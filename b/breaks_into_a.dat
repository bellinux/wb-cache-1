25|$|During {{the stage}} {{performance}} of the controversial Uncle Tom's Cabin, white actor G. C. Germon put on blackface to represent an African-American male. The play left the white audience pitying the character, Tom, rather than seeing him as an equal. Earlier during this play, an actor <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> song with lyrics stereotyping mischievous, black children. This play encapsulates the controversy between anti-slavery activists and those pro slavery in the United States.|$|E

Critically praised, it was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. However, despite its acclaim, it did not sell well initially. It was later re-released on Xbox 360 under the Xbox Originals banner, as well as for Microsoft Windows via GameTap and Steam.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the {{conversational}} mode of composition is Haydn's string quartet Op. 20, No. 4 in D major. In the first movement, after a statement of the main theme by all the instruments, the first violin <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> triplet figure, supported by the second violin, viola and cello. The cello answers with its own triplet figure, then the viola, while the other instruments play a secondary theme against this movement. Unlike counterpoint, where each part plays essentially the same melodic role as the others, here each instrument contributes its own character, its own comment on the music as it develops.|$|E
25|$|General Stone {{orders the}} {{building}} to be quarantined and District One {{to be put into}} Code Red lockdown. Civilians are herded into safe rooms, but despite the precautions, Don <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> room containing a large crowd and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The mob - now with half its members infected - breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a U.S. Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy, and several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. General Stone orders District One to be firebombed, but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure and must be protected at all costs. Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle, but he refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who are possibly infected.|$|E

25|$|At Woo-jin's penthouse, Woo-jin {{reveals the}} truth, that Mi-do is Dae-su's daughter. Woo-jin had {{arranged}} their meeting by using hypnosis to guide Dae-su into the sushi restaurant, {{hoping that they}} would fall in love, so that Dae-su might experience the same pain which Woo-jin had. Dae-su attempts to attack Woo-jin but is beaten badly, until Woo-jin intervenes, killing his own bodyguard. Woo-jin proceeds to threaten {{to tell the truth}} to Mi-do, who is being held by Mr. Park in his new prison. Dae-su apologizes for driving Woo-jin's sister to suicide and begs him not to tell Mi-do. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a symbol of penance. Woo-jin accepts Dae-su's pleading, and tells Mr Park to keep the truth from Mi-do. Woo-jin then boards the elevator, recalls the events of his sister's suicide, and shoots himself {{in the head with a}} Derringer pistol. In the aftermath of the event, Dae-su finds the hypnotist from the prison to erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter, so that they can stay together and have a nice relationship. Mi-do then finds Dae-su and embraces him. Dae-su <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> wide smile, which is then slowly replaced by a look of pain, bringing into question whether the hypnosis worked.|$|E
25|$|The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in {{the room}} where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was largely positive, albeit lukewarm; receiving a rating of 71% at review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviews generally praised the high graphical standard in the game, PC Zone described the visuals as superb and praised the use of [...] "transparent surfaces and open frameworks to alleviate the potential monotony of racing through a drainpipe." [...] IGN echoed this, stating that at those moments where [...] "a solid tunnel <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> transparent one", [...] "the true meticulous nature of the courses can be realized". GameSpot praised the graphical effects, describing them as [...] "a psychedelic display of cosmic lighting and motion-blur wizardry".|$|E

On {{one end of}} the street was an event in the park, while on the other end a wedding took place. Elsewhere, Fuller carried a mock-suitcase bomb to film in Grosvenor Square. However, because the American Embassy is situated next to the square, shortly after Fuller and the filming crew arrived, they found themselves surrounded by five armed American security officers who believed Fuller was about to commit an attack. Fortunately, location manager Patrick Stuart was able to [...] "sweet-talk" [...] the American officials, and they were allowed to film in the area.|$|E

At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: [...] "I've made a conquest!"

Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes {{to be an old}} motorcycle suit, which he takes home.

In the middle of the speech, he falters as he realizes how futile this all is, then tells the press that the War on Drugs implies a war even on some people's own family members, which he cannot endorse.

500|$|Paramount's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) {{played to}} the Freudian {{theories}} {{popular with the}} audience of its time. Fredric March played the split-personality title character. Jekyll represented the composed super-ego, and Hyde the lecherous id. Miriam Hopkins's coquettish [...] bar singer, Ivy Pierson, sexually teases Jekyll early in the film by displaying parts of her legs and bosom. Joy felt the scene had been [...] "dragged in simply to titillate the audience." [...] Hyde coerces her {{with the threat of}} violence into becoming his paramour and beats her when she attempts to stop seeing him. She is contrasted with his wholesome fiancée Muriel (Rose Hobart), whose chaste nature dissatisfies March's baser alter ego. The film is considered the [...] "most honored of the Pre-Code horror films." [...] Many of the graphic scenes between Hyde and Ivy were cut by local censors because of their suggestiveness. Sex was intimately tied to horror in many pre-Code horror movies. In Murders in the Rue Morgue, an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's classic tale which has little in common with the source material, Bela Lugosi plays a mad scientist who tortures and kills women, trying to mix human blood with ape blood during his experiments.

Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the space colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the Moon to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause space colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour. [...] Gerald did this in order to exact revenge on humanity, who he blamed {{for the death of}} his Granddaughter Maria after she was killed in a government raid on space colony ARK. Everyone teams up and works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic and believes he has fulfilled his purpose of revenge. Chris confronts Shadow, reminding him of Maria last wish for Shadow to be a protector of humanity; to guide and aid them. Moved to tears and with a new sense of purpose, Shadow teams up with Sonic and both power up using the Emeralds and teleport the ARK away from Earth, though Shadow is seeming killed in the process. [...] Sonic, his friends, and Eggman reflect on Shadow's sacrifice and return to Earth.|$|E
500|$|Taking {{place an}} unknown {{length of time}} after the events of Mother 2, Mother 3 story is told in eight chapters, {{including}} a prologue. The game begins with twins Lucas and Claus, and their mother Hinawa visiting her father, who lives up in the mountains. The kids spend their time playing with friendly dinosaur creatures called Dragos. Their home village, Tazmily, is a quiet small town that does not utilize any form of currency. Shortly after Flint, Hinawa's husband, receives a letter from Hinawa, the Pig Mask Army starts a forest fire and invades Tazmily Village, {{a small town in}} the Nowhere Islands. [...] Flint quickly arrives to help others deal with the fire, but later realizes his family has not yet returned from visiting Hinawa's father. When Hinawa is found dead due to a Drago fang in her chest, Flint lashes out in anger and is imprisoned.

In chapter two, neophyte thief Duster <b>breaks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> castle to find an egg that keeps the world's secrets. He meets the princess Kumatora, but they are separated when a flood washes them out of the castle. In chapter three, Pig Mask leader Fassad orders the monkey player-character, Salsa, through the desert.

Lucas and Flint protect the town while Kumatora and Salsa look for Duster. In chapter four, three years have passed, Tazmily has been modernized, and Lucas becomes the game's main protagonist.
