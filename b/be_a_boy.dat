Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuichi: when they were growing up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as she was called then, while girls teased her and the boys bullied her to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, {{she has not been}} on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store.|$|E

Shuichi quickly becomes friends with another student, tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, Yoshino confesses a similar desire to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages Shuichi to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another AMAB student their age from another class who also secretly wants to be a girl.

5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school who wants to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> but she realized that a boy {{who wants to be a}} girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E

His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started to go wrong for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times.

500|$|Milton and Tessie marry in 1946. They {{have two}} children, ChapterEleven and Calliope ("Callie"). Prior to Callie's birth, Desdemona predicts {{the child to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> {{although}} the parents prepare for a girl. Chapter Eleven is a biologically [...] "normal" [...] boy; however, Callie is intersex. Her family members are unaware of her situation for many years, so they raise Callie as a girl. Elements of family life are portrayed against {{the rise and fall}} of industrial Detroit, where so many struggled. The family gets caught up in the 1967 Detroit riot resulting from racial tensions, after President Johnson authorizes the use of federal troops. The family home is raided during this period, to the shock of the parents. After this harrowing experience, the family moves to a house on Middlesex Boulevard, Grosse Pointe.|$|E
500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focuses on}} the potential confusion of sexuality with gender in the novel. As Jay Prosser argues, “rightly tracing Hall’s debt to nineteenth-century sexologists, critics have wrongly reduced sexual inversion to homosexuality.” What many refer to as Stephen’s ‘butch lesbianism’, Prosser suggests, is actually a transgender identity. As a child, Stephen insists that s/he is male - “Yes, of course I’m a boy…I must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> ‘cause I feel exactly like one,” – and, when talking to her/his mother, Stephen claims that, “All my life I’ve never felt like a woman, and you know it.” Through Stephen’s final rejection of Mary, ostensibly so that Mary can participate in a heterosexual relationship with Martin and therefore have a more secure life, Prosser surmises that “Stephen affirms her identification with the heterosexual man”, thus rejecting lesbianism and instead aligning her/himself with the male.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} {{different}} categories of {{worker in the}} quarries. The quarrymen proper, who made up just over 50% of the workforce, worked the slate in partnerships of three, four, six or eight, known as [...] "bargain gangs". A gang of four typically consisted of two [...] "rockmen" [...] who would blast the rock to produce blocks, a splitter, who would split the blocks with hammer and chisel, and a dresser. A rybelwr would usually <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> learning his trade, who would wander around the galleries offering assistance to the gangs. Sometimes a gang {{would give him a}} block of slate to split. Other groups were the [...] "bad rockmen" [...] who usually worked in crews of three, removing unworkable rock from the face, and the [...] "rubbish men" [...] who cleared the waste rock from the galleries and built the tips of waste which surrounded the quarry. One ton of saleable slate could produce up to 30tons of waste.|$|E
500|$|Yoshino, {{the other}} protagonist, is a tall, {{masculine}} child {{who at the}} beginning of Wandering Son is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class. Otherwise known as [...] by their classmates, with an honorific used mainly with boys, Yoshino was assigned female at birth, but wants to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> Yoshino usually refrains from dressing in traditionally feminine clothes, such as skirts or dresses. Despite this, Yoshino's mother insists on buying such clothes for Yoshino. Shortly after becoming friends with Shuichi, Yoshino gets a haircut in a boyish style, taking on the appearance of a boy their age, especially when Yoshino is dressed in a male school uniform. Like Shuichi, Yoshino becomes increasingly concerned and resentful about undergoing puberty, such as {{at the beginning of}} menstruation or the growth of breasts. Yoshino goes to buy a chest-flattening garment to escape the necessity of wearing a bra. Also like Shuichi, Yoshino shows signs indicating gender dysphoria, though later stops thinking that way due to personal exposure to modeling.|$|E

While their only son is hosting a birthday party, the husband informs Ellen that they are financially ruined because of her. Ellen attempts to get money from her uncle, who refuses, and a friend of the family soon comes to her aid with a loan.

The son decides to sell newspapers for some money and in this job is recognized by his father, soon the family is reunited.

2500|$|A few {{characters}} in the series are identified with a title and last name, or with a gender-neutral name. In some languages—for example, those where adjectives are gendered—it was necessary for the translator to guess the character's gender. The Hebrew translation initially made Blaise Zabini a girl, though the character was revealed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> in later books. To avoid this problem, Isabel Nunes, the Portuguese translator, asked Rowling about the gender {{of some of the}} characters—Zabini, Professor Sinistra, and [...] "R.A.B."—while working on her translations.|$|E
