40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the proper time to restore composite resin over mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Methods Thirty-five samples of MTA blocks were divided into 7 groups with 3 different times (10 minutes, 1 day, and 7 days) selected for restoring the composite resin over MTA with and without bonding resin, and a control group was included for comparison. After 21 days, the distances between MTA and the composite resin or between MTA and the <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> on sectioned planes along the long axis were measured using a scanning electron microscope (× 2, 000 magnification). The hardness of the MTA near the composite resin was presented as the Vickers microhardness. Results There were no gaps at the interface in the 10 -minute groups, the 1 -day group with a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> and the 7 -day group with a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent.</b> The groups without a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> at 1 and 7 days presented a separation or gap at the interface. The value of the Vickers microhardness in the 1 -day groups was significantly decreased compared with those of the other groups regardless of the presence or absence of a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent.</b> Conclusions These findings suggest that composite resin with a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> over MTA can be restored almost immediately after MTA mixing during a single visit...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to know the tensile bond strength of hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> to bovine dentine surface at various humidity. The bovine dentine was grounded to give flat surface, which was then etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 seconds. Dentine was washed with 20 ml water and dried with blot dry technique.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> and thermo-mechanical cycling on the flexural bond strength of a gold and cobalt-chromium alloy to a feldspathic ceramic. Sixty-four metal bars were fused (3 × 25 × 0.5 mm 3): 32 with a gold alloy and 32 with a cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy. Over the bars’ central area (8 × 3 mm 2), a <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> and two glass-ceramic layers were fired, totaling 1 mm in ceramic thickness. Eight specimens of each alloy were randomly divided according to the <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> (application or the absence thereof) and the thermo-mechanical cycle (3, 000 thermo-cycles and 20, 000 mechanical-cycles; or no cycling). The flexural bond strength between the metal alloy and the ceramic was evaluated by a three-point bending test and data were subjected to three-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α[*]=[*] 0.05). The failure mode was classified. No significant interactions were observed among the three factors evaluated (alloy, <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> and thermo-mechanical cycling; p[*]=[*] 0.5734). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the alloys (p[*]=[*] 0.8559). The interaction between alloy/bonding agent (p[*]=[*] 0.0001) showed that, for the gold alloy, the group with the <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> showed mean values of flexural bond strength significantly higher than those of the group without the <b>bonding</b> <b>agent,</b> while, for the Co-Cr alloy, the groups with or without <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> had similar mean values of flexural bond strength. The interaction between alloy/thermo-mechanical cycling (p[*]=[*] 0.0001) showed that, for the gold alloy, the non-cycled group had flexural bond strength mean values significantly greater than those of the cycled group, while for the Co-Cr alloy, both non-cycled and cycled groups had similar mean values. The <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> significantly improved the flexural bond strength between the ceramic and the gold alloy, but had no influence on the Co-Cr alloy. Thermo-mechanical cycling decreased the flexural bond strength of the gold alloy specimens, but did not affect the Co-Cr specimens.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bonding</b> <b>agents</b> {{are often}} methacrylates with some {{volatile}} carrier and solvent like acetone. They may also contain diluent monomers. For proper bonding of resin composite restorations, dentin should be conditioned with polyacrylic acids {{to remove the}} smear layer, created during mechanical treatment with dental bore, and expose some of the collagen network or organic matrix of dentin. Adhesive resin should create the so-called hybrid layer (consisting of a collagen network exposed by etching and embedded in adhesive resin). This layer is an interface between dentin and adhesive resin and the final quality of dental restoration depends greatly on its properties. Modern dental bonding systems come as a “three-step system”, where the etchant, primer, and adhesive are applied sequentially; as a “two-step system”, where the etchant and the primer are combined for simultaneous application; and as a “one-step system”, where all the components should be premixed and applied in a single application (so-called seventh generation of <b>bonding</b> <b>agents).</b>|$|E

Using bondings is effective for decreasing the microleakage. This experimental study aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> on microleakage of a fissure sealant before or after contamination to saliva. Methods: In this experimental study 40 sound premolar teeth were randomly divided into four groups. The prophylaxis was done and the teeth were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid gel, then they were washed and dried. In the first group, Seal-Rite fissure sealant and Dentastic (Pulpdent, USA) without saliva contamination, {{and in the second}} group sealant with <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> after saliva contamination for 10 s, were applied and cured for 40 s. In the third group, fissure sealant without <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> or saliva contamination, and in the fourth group fissure sealant without bonding application was applied after contamination with saliva and then was cured. After thermocycling, the teeth were placed in 50 % silver nitrate for 2 hours. The buccolingual sections were applied and microleakage evaluation was made by stereomicroscope at 4 X magnifications and results were evaluated with mann-whiteny test. Results: The fissure sealant group without <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> showed the most microleakage after contamination to saliva and use of sealant with <b>bonding</b> <b>agent</b> significantly showed decrease of microleakage.
