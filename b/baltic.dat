5|$|König {{remained}} in port until 21 October, {{when the ship}} was again sent to the <b>Baltic</b> for training. The ship returned to the fleet on 3 November. König {{and the rest of}} IIISquadron then steamed out to Horns Reef on 5–6 November. König was then assigned various tasks, including guard duty in the German Bight and convoy escort in the <b>Baltic.</b> 1917 saw several training missions in the <b>Baltic</b> during 22 February– 4 March; 14–22 March and 17 May– 9 June. König then went into Wilhelmshaven for maintenance on 16 June. The installation of a new heavy foremast and other work lasted until 21 July.

5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered some material benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic representatives of the <b>Baltic</b> states in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying <b>Baltic</b> flags. By establishing a non-recognition policy, it allowed some 120,000 postwar displaced persons from the <b>Baltic</b> states to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E

5|$|The Welles Declaration {{established}} a five-decade non-recognition of the <b>Baltic</b> states' annexation. The document had major significance for overall U.S. policy toward Europe {{in the critical}} year of 1940. While the U.S. did not engage the Soviet Union militarily in the region, the Declaration enabled the <b>Baltic</b> states to maintain independent diplomatic missions, and Executive Order 8484 protected <b>Baltic</b> financial assets. Its essence was supported by all subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions. The <b>Baltic</b> states re-established their independence in 1990–91.|$|E
5|$|This {{westbound}} expansion {{was accompanied}} by the regress at the southeastern bounds of the <b>Baltic</b> range caused by the advancing Slavs, the Balts' closest relatives. A majority of the <b>Baltic</b> peoples, whose population {{at the end of}} first millennium AD is estimated at about 480 thousand, became extinct during the later Middle Ages because of attempts of forced Christianisation, conquest and extermination, or assimilation, the Old Prussians being the primary example.

5|$|Admiral Makarov {{was built}} by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer, France. The ship was laid down in April 1905, and she was {{launched}} on 28 May 1906. Admiral Makarov was completed in April 1908. The ship sailed for the <b>Baltic</b> on 27 May and reached Tallinn, Estonia on 11 June where she {{was assigned to the}} <b>Baltic</b> Fleet. A few months later, she returned to the Mediterranean and provided assistance to the survivor of the Messina earthquake in December. The ship then rejoined the <b>Baltic</b> Fleet, but she was transferred back to Mediterranean in 1910 where she represented the Russian Empire, together with the battleship , the armored cruiser , and the protected cruiser , at the coronation of Nicholas I of Montenegro in August 1910. Admiral Makarov was back in the <b>Baltic</b> during 1911 and she made a port visit to Copenhagen in 1912. The following year, the ship was {{one of a group of}} cruisers that visited Brest, France, the Isle of Portland in Great Britain, and Stavanger, Norway.|$|E

5|$|After safely {{returning}} to port in Kiel, Leipzig {{was taken into}} the Deutsche Werke shipyard for repairs. She was decommissioned while under repair and reclassified as a training ship. To accommodate additional training crews, four of the ship's boilers were removed. She returned to service in late 1940. In early June 1941, she escorted the heavy cruiser Lützow (formerly Deutschland) to Norway. After {{she returned to the}} <b>Baltic,</b> she and the cruiser Emden provided artillery support to advancing German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. In September, she supported the invasion of the <b>Baltic</b> islands in the West Estonian archipelago. While bombarding Soviet positions on Moon Island, Leipzig was attacked unsuccessfully by the Soviet submarine Shch-317. In late September, the ship joined the German <b>Baltic</b> Fleet, centered on the battleship Tirpitz; the fleet was tasked with blocking a possible Soviet attempt {{to break out of the}} <b>Baltic.</b> Leipzig returned to Kiel in October, and conducted maneuvers with the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer. Leipzig became the flagship of the training fleet in 1942; she spent the year performing training duties.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Brandenburg was reactivated and assigned to the V Squadron, which was initially tasked with coastal defense duties in the North Sea. In mid-September, the V Squadron {{was transferred to the}} <b>Baltic,</b> under the command of Prince Henry. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the <b>Baltic</b> on 25 September. Brandenburg {{and the rest of the}} squadron returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the <b>Baltic.</b> Prince Henry next ordered a foray toward Gotland. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the <b>Baltic</b> cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Kaiser Friedrich III and her sisters were brought back to active service and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron. Kaiser Friedrich III was commanded by Käpitan zur See Alfred Begas. The V Squadron was tasked with providing coastal defense in the North Sea. The ships were deployed to the <b>Baltic</b> twice, from 19 to 26 September and 26 to 30 December 1914. For the first operation, the commander of naval forces in the <b>Baltic,</b> Prince Heinrich, initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the <b>Baltic</b> on 25 September. Kaiser Friedrich III and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, where the landing force disembarked. The ships then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. For their second deployment to the <b>Baltic,</b> Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland to attack Russian warships that {{might be in the}} area. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the <b>Baltic</b> cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December, having failed to locate any Russian vessels.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous <b>Baltic</b> Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the <b>Baltic</b> Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} <b>Baltic</b> Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important <b>Baltic</b> Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Despite being decommissioned, {{repair work}} on the ship continued. The ship was moved in April to Pillau in the <b>Baltic,</b> to put Admiral Hipper {{out of the reach}} of Allied bombers. A year later, the ship was moved to Gotenhafen; the Kriegsmarine {{intended}} to re-commission the ship so she could be used in the <b>Baltic.</b> Over the next five months, Admiral Hipper ran a series of sea trials in the <b>Baltic,</b> but failed to reach operational status. As the Soviet army pushed the Germans back on the Eastern Front, her crew was drafted into construction {{work on the}} defenses of the city, further impairing Admiral Hippers ability to enter active service. The Royal Air Force also laid an extensive minefield around the port, which forced the ship to remain in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Due to Allied {{victories}} in France and Eastern Europe, Germany's surface shipping was largely {{confined to the}} lower <b>Baltic</b> and Norwegian waters by late 1944.

When the <b>Baltic</b> iced over {{during the winter of}} 1944–45, Germany was forced to transport its vital imports of Swedish iron ore from the port of Narvik in northern Norway.|$|E

5|$|Following Königs {{return from}} the <b>Baltic,</b> the ship was tasked with guard duties in the North Sea and with {{providing}} support for minesweepers. König returned to the <b>Baltic</b> on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April König steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage. König was briefly grounded in the northern harbor of the island of Helgoland on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, König and the rest of IIISquadron covered a minesweeping unit in the North Sea. The ship then went to the <b>Baltic</b> for training on 7–18 August, after which König returned to the North Sea.
