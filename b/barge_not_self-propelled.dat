50|$|A barge is a {{flat-bottomed}} boat, built {{mainly for}} river and canal transport of heavy goods. Some <b>barges</b> are <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled</b> {{and must be}} towed or pushed by towboats. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway in the early Industrial Revolution, but were outcompeted in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of railways.|$|R

50|$|Steam shovels {{usually had}} a three-man crew: engineer, fireman and ground man. There was much jockeying {{to do to}} move shovels: rails and timber blocks to move; cables and block {{purchases}} to attach; chains and slings to rig; and so on.

50|$|Stiff competition, declining world trade, and the {{employment}} of tramp steamers to carry lumber cargoes combined to put Higgins' Lumber and Export Co. out of business.

50|$|A jackup rig or a self-elevating unit {{is a type}} {{of mobile}} {{platform}} that consists of a buoyant hull fitted with a number of movable legs, capable of raising its hull over the surface of the sea. The buoyant hull enables transportation of the unit and all attached machinery to a desired location. Once on location the hull is raised to the required elevation above the sea surface supported by the sea bed. The legs of such units may be designed to penetrate the sea bed, may be fitted with enlarged sections or footings, or may be attached to a bottom mat. Generally jackup rigs are <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled</b> and rely on tugs or heavy lift ships for transportation.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the {{military}} doctrine of Soviet deep battle called for {{extensive use of}} heavy artillery to hold the formal line of front. Soviet doctrine was remarkably different from the German doctrine of Blitzkrieg, {{and called for a}} far more extensive use of artillery. As a result, howitzers saw most of the action on the Eastern front, and most of the best howitzers of the WWII period were Soviet-made, as other allies mostly relied on different types of assault for the battle. Most of the howitzers produced by the USSR at the time were <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled,</b> as the country did not have resources to spare for the construction of the engines for the self-propelled variants.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The paper involves: 1) {{confirmation}} of the technical characteristics of cars and their modifications, as well as indicators of unfailing work probability during the time between overhauls or service hours; 2) improving the methodological approaches to assess the maintenance characteristics of new and modernized equipment of rail transport on the example of <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled</b> rolling stock, namely, railway freight cars; 3) solution of scientific and applied problems in assessment the maintenance characteristics of the new and modernized railway equipment. Methodology. The basic methodological approaches to {{the assessment of the}} maintenance characteristics on the example of <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled</b> rolling stock, namely, railway freight cars were considered. The analysis of the reliability of the car, which is considered as a complex mechanical system, where all system elements are connected in series, wherein each element includes m is serially connected parts. The failure of each part of the calculation will result in refusal of the car. Thus, the car is a system without redundancy. Findings. The evaluation technic of the maintenance characteristics of freight cars in controlled operation with taking into account the features of the new generation of cars was improved. Specified: the duration of the tests, the frequency of inspection of the control group of cars controlled by the parameters of the car, the reasons for the early termination of controlled operation. Identified failures in the process of controlled operation are divided according to their nature. Originality. The authors proposed a method of assessing the maintenance characteristics of railway equipment in trial operation {{as an example of a}} new generation of freight cars. Practical value. The results allow assessing the maintenance characteristics of new and modernized rail transport equipment during the maintenance test...|$|R
5000|$|The Remco Showboat, less {{popularly known}} as the Arthur Showboat Theater Playset, was a toy theatre in the shape and style of the typical Hollywood idea of a showboat - a sternwheeler {{complete}} with twin smokestacks, {{much like the one}} seen in MGM's 1951 film Show Boat. (Real showboats of the nineteenth and early twentieth century were <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled</b> and did <b>not</b> have smokestacks. The design of the showboat in the 1929 and the 1936 film versions of [...] "Show Boat" [...] are much closer to the real thing.) The playset was manufactured and introduced by Remco in 1962. The toy contained playscript adaptations of famous stories such as Pinocchio, Heidi, Cinderella, and The Wizard of Oz and came complete with miniature cutout dolls and theatrical settings, so that children could use these dolls to present the stories contained in the playscript.|$|R

500|$|The GWR built a [...] goods shed on {{the north}} side of the station {{adjacent}} to the Floating Harbour, with a small dock for transhipment of goods to <b>barges</b> (<b>not</b> seagoing ships, as the wharf was upstream of Bristol Bridge). Wagons had to be lowered [...] to the goods shed on hoists. On 11 March 1872, a direct connection to the harbour was made in the form of the Bristol Harbour Railway, a joint operation of the three railways, which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, across the street outside on a bridge, and descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe on its way to a wharf downstream of Bristol Bridge.|$|R
50|$|In 1840 the Lowca {{engineering}} {{works of}} Tulk and Ley {{made the first}} locomotive for the new Maryport and Carlisle Railway, but ironically, {{it had to be}} transported from Parton by seagoing <b>barge.</b> <b>Not</b> until several years later was the technically challenging railway extension to Whitehaven via Parton developed. The railway soon supplanted the old tramway, and brought new opportunities for Parton's industries. The colliery, the engineering works and the brewery all thrived, an iron-foundry opened next to the new railway station, and in the 1870s an ironworks was established on the shore near the Lowca works. Unfortunately, the end of the 19th century was a period of industrial consolidation, and Parton's relatively small businesses began to struggle.|$|R
25|$|Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a {{collective}} behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling {{about the same}} spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic. As a term, swarming is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term flocking or 'murmuration' are usually used to refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, herding to refer to swarm behaviour in quadrupeds, shoaling or schooling to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called blooms, although these organisms are algae and are <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled</b> the way animals are. By extension, the term swarm is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a robot swarm, an earthquake swarm, or a swarm of stars.|$|R
50|$|Titans cantilever-jib arm {{could reach}} 190 ft {{above the surface}} at maximum extension. The crane could lift up to 150 t at an arm radius of 90 ft, or 125 t at 125 ft.

The crane {{was supported by a}} lattice mast fitted to a riveted-steel pontoon barge that was 176 ft long, 79 ft wide, and had a depth of 13 ft. The crane was <b>not</b> <b>self-propelled,</b> and required two or three tugboats to manoeuvre her around. Power for lifting and rotating was supplied by a coal-fired boiler supplying three steam generators (two 220 kilowatt generators and a 44 kilowatt auxiliary). The only connection between the crane arm and the lattice mast were drive shafts for the slewing (rotational) motors. Titan had a maximum displacement of 2125 t.|$|R
