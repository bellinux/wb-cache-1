Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game strategies {{in the same manner}} as GameFAQs was added.

Overlay Mixer also supports DXVA connections. Because it always renders in overlay, full-screen video to TV-out is always activated.|$|E

Collaborative analysis for the multimodal streams is achieved based on temporal dependency between their streams, in order to improve the reliability and ef-ficiency for semantic content analysis such as extracting highlight scenes from sports video and automatically gener-ating annotations of specific scenes. A couple of case stud-ies are shown to experimentally confirm the effectiveness of intermodal collaboration. 1...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} lack of rules, general <b>broadcast</b> <b>videos</b> are more {{difficult}} to analyze than news or sport videos. To retrieve human interventions in this context, a robust face tracker is needed. The approach we investigate for face tracking combines three main modules that are a face detector, a region-based tracker and an eye tracker. The regionbased tracker relies on a robust parametric motion estimation technique. The eye tracker is based on a Kalman filter. The analysis of the coherence of the trackers output provides an efficient way to detect profile positions and tracking errors. We have thus defined an entirely automatic tracker, able to manage several appearing/disappearingfaces, without any a priori knowledge on the image sequence. Experimental results on <b>broadcast</b> <b>videos</b> demonstrate its efficiency to deal with large and rapid motions, occlusions and faces in profile position. 1...|$|R

Camera motions, noise and blurs in <b>broadcast</b> <b>videos</b> {{make it difficult to}} extract the trajec-tories with a single existing object tracking algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ball and player trajectory extraction in <b>broadcast</b> soccer <b>videos.</b> The framework generates candidate ball trajec-tories and player trajectory segments, then it searches the optimal ball trajectory with the likelihood ranking and refines player trajectories with MCMC data associ-ation. Instead of extracting ball and player trajectories respectively, our framework employs the motion rela-tionship of the ball and players to build a collaborate scheme to improve the tracking and trajectory refine-ment results. The experimental results show the pro-posed framework is more effective than previous works. 1...|$|R

Therefore, knowing their impact on the quality of experience of the end users is a crucial issue. For instance, it would help to improve the performance of the distribution systems, and to develop monitoring tools to automatically estimate the quality perceived by the end users. In this paper we validate a subjective evaluation approach specifically designed to obtain meaningful results of the effects of degradations caused by transmission errors. This methodology has been already used in our previous works with monoscopic and stereoscopic videos. The validation is done by comparing the subjective ratings obtained for typical transmission errors with the proposed methodology and with the standard method Absolute Category Rating. The results show that the proposed approach could provide more representative evaluations of the quality of experience perceived by end users of conventional and 3 D <b>broadcasted</b> <b>video</b> services...|$|R
