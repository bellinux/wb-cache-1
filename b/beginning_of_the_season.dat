Despite a poor performance when compared with previous seasons' accomplishments, Virginia Tech still ranked second in the Big East conference in total defense, scoring defense, and quarterback sacks.|$|E
5|$|After the 2005–06 season, the Senators {{opted not}} to bring back Hašek, instead {{acquiring}} Martin Gerber to compete with Emery for the starter position. Gerber was the starter at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November.

Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.|$|E

The season became a great success as the club won Allsvenskan for the nineteenth time and became Swedish champions for the sixteenth time. Unlike in 2004, these successes were achieved without any major transfers before the season, and with a squad consisting mostly of younger players.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} final pre-bowl game Bowl Championship Series standings were {{released}} on December 4, Auburn was among several teams disgruntled with the system. One of these was California, which only lost to top-ranked USC, but was denied a bid to the prestigious Rose Bowl after Texas vaulted it in the rankings despite having the same record. The Golden Bears were forced to attend the less-attractive Holiday Bowl instead. The Auburn Tigers, meanwhile, had completed their first 12-win regular season and won their first conference championship in 15 years, but in the final BCS rankings, Auburn was third, behind USC and Oklahoma. It {{was the first time}} since the creation of the BCS in 1998 that three major-conference college football teams were undefeated at the conclusion of the regular season. Some pundits and fans considered Auburn's failure to reach the championship game to be based on the fact that the Tigers had started with a lower ranking at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> The Tigers had been ranked 17th at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> while USC had been ranked first and Oklahoma second, the same spots they occupied at the end of the regular season.|$|E

Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.|$|E
5|$|The Challenge Cup {{has taken}} a number of {{different}} formats, ranging from a table formed from the results of designated league fixtures to groups of four teams playing on a round-robin basis at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> During some seasons, Elite League games have also been classed as Challenge Cup games and points counted for both. The semi finals and final are two-legged games, the winner being the team with the highest aggregate score {{at the end of the}} second game.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger-Cats {{traded for}} Alipate in May 1991 {{as part of}} an {{agreement}} that sent quarterback Tom Worman to Saskatchewan. Due to the CFL's import ratio, Alipate was held out of games during the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> He started in place of Pete Giftopoulos in early September but was later injured and placed on the reserve list. Alipate ended the season with 25 tackles, three sacks, and a fumble recovery over seven games. The Saskatchewan Roughriders signed Alipate for training camp in 1992, but he was released {{before the start of the}} regular season.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> to establish their territories. The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E
50|$|After this, matches became single-legged. For <b>the</b> {{next two}} <b>seasons,</b> they were played at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>season</b> {{to fit in}} with to Derby County's touring schedules (so the 1984-85 match was actually played at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1985-86 <b>season</b> and <b>the</b> 1985-86 match was actually played at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1986-87 <b>season),</b> before becoming standard pre-season matches. This meant that two matches were played within six days of each other in 1986: one on 9 August for <b>the</b> 1985-86 <b>season</b> and one on 15 August for <b>the</b> 1986-87 <b>season.</b> <b>The</b> 1996-97 match broke the established timetable and was held in November.|$|R

5|$|During the 193233 {{season that}} saw England tour Australia under Douglas Jardine with their Bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling high speed deliveries at the batsmen's body, rumours circulated that Halcombe could be {{selected for the}} Tests. Halcombe's pace saw him touted as a possible retaliatory outlet against the English. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Halcombe played for Western Australia in a tour match against England. He took 3/48 and 1/38 in a drawn match, including the Bodyline mastermind and captain Douglas Jardine, Bob Wyatt, Les Ames and the Nawab of Pataudi. He was then called into the Australian XI in a subsequent tour match. He was less successful on this occasion, taking 1/81 as England scored 7/583. Halcombe was not selected for any other first-class matches during the season.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds {{at the end of}} that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the Big Bad; in the fifth season this takes the form of a powerful goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer).|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes, and poached the Bury manager Bert Head after persistence from chairman Arthur Wait in early 1966. Head had been with Bury less than a season. The new manager promoted from the youth team and transferred in players new and old, and delighted fans by re-signing Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968–69 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> finished second behind Derby County who were managed by Brian Clough. Palace had achieved {{a place in the}} top flight {{for the first time in}} their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.|$|E
