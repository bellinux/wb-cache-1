30|$|No methods {{produced}} {{death rates}} of zero in this study, {{but it is}} worth noting that the Rate Ratio Scaling method is susceptible to producing them. When there are no deaths in one particular period-cohort in a region in the base period the rate ratio will be zero, and the resulting projected death rate will therefore also be zero. The theoretical underlying death rate is unlikely to be zero. Regions with smaller populations, with small numbers of deaths, will be at greater risk of this occurring. The Broad Age Rate Ratio Scaling is much less prone to this issue due to the use of <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> rate ratios which are less likely to be zero. Similarly, the smoothing of rate ratios in the TOPALS method makes the possibility of a zero death rate less likely.|$|E

40|$|Ovarian sex cord-stromal {{tumors are}} {{infrequent}} and represent approximately 7 % of all primary ovarian tumors. This histopathologic ovarian tumor group differs considerably {{from the more}} prevalent epithelial ovarian tumors. Although sex cord-stromal tumors present in a <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group,</b> the majority tend to present as a low-grade disease that usually follows a nonaggressive clinical course in younger patients. Furthermore, because the constituent cells of these tumors are engaged in ovarian steroid hormone production (e. g., androgens, estrogens, and corticoids), sex cord-stromal tumors are commonly associated with various hormone-mediated syndromes and exhibit {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical features ranging from hyperandrogenic virilizing states to hyperestrogenic manifestations. The World Health Organization sex cord-stromal tumor classification has recently been revised, and currently these tumors have been regrouped into the following clinicopathologic entities: pure stromal tumors, pure sex cord tumors, and mixed sex cord-stromal tumors. Moreover, some entities considered in the former classification (e. g., stromal luteoma, stromal tumor with minor sex cord elements, and gynandroblastoma) are no longer considered separate tumors in the current classification. Herein, we discuss and revise the ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of the different histopathologic types and clinicopathologic features of sex cord-stromal tumors to allow radiologists to narrow the differential diagnosis when facing ovarian tumors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fractional {{anisotropy}} (FA) is {{a useful}} measure of connectivity in the brain that {{can be derived from}} the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) dataset. This study investigated the relationship between FA and selected measures of cognition across a <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> to explore a possible structural basis for cognitive changes with age. METHODS: FA images were generated from DTI data acquired at 1. 5 T in 87 healthy subjects (age range, 20 – 73 years). Relationships between a range of cognitive measures and FA were explored using regional and voxel-based analysis. RESULTS: Age and regional average FA were significantly associated in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes but not in the occipital lobe. This negative relationship was especially prominent in the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobe, where FA declined at a rate of approximately 3 % per decade. Decreased FA in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes was associated with poorer cognitive performance in executive maze and in an attention-switching task. A voxel-level analysis of these data revealed that the executive function-FA association was particularly strong and regionally delineated over 2 continuous, bilateral areas extending from the prefrontal cortex to the parietal lobe, with projections to the anterior portions of the thalamus...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of major chronic diseases and their risk factors in different socioeconomic groups in the Australian population, in order to highlight the need for public policy initiatives to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in health. Methods: Data were provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) from the 2001 National Health Survey (NHS) for selected chronic diseases and associated risk factors. Conditions selected were those, which form the National Health Priority Area (NHPA) conditions (other than injury, {{which has not been}} included in this paper, with its focus on chronic disease); plus other 'serious' chronic conditions, in line with the classification developed by Mathers; and for which sufficient cases were available for analysis by socioeconomic status. Indirectly age-standardised prevalence rates were calculated by <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> for Australia and for five groups of socioeconomic status; rate ratios were calculated to show variations in prevalence between these groups. Results: Significant socioeconomic inequalities were evident for many of the major chronic diseases; the largest was for diabetes mellitus (at ages 25 to 64 years); and for many diseases, there was also a strong, continuous socioeconomic gradient in the rates. Circulatory system diseases (in particular, hypertensive disease) and digestive system diseases also exhibited a strong differential in the 25 to 64 year age group. In the 65 years and over age group, the strongest inequalities were evident for mental and behavioural problems, diabetes (with a continuous socioeconomic gradient in rates) and respiratory system diseases. A number of risk factors for chronic diseases, namely self-reported smoking, alcohol misuse, physical inactivity and excess weight showed a striking association with socioeconomic status, in particular for people who were smokers {{and those who did not}} exercise. Conclusion This analysis shows that {{the prevalence of}} chronic disease varies across the socioeconomic gradient for a number of specific diseases, as well as for important disease risk factors. Therefore, any policy interventions to address the impact of chronic disease, at a population level, need to take into account these socioeconomic inequalities.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{prompted}} by the widespread acceptance that the rates of inter-county and inter-state migration have been falling in the USA and sets itself the task of examining whether this decline in migration intensities {{is also the case}} in the UK. It uses the inter-area migration matrices available for England and Wales from the National Health Service Central Register (NHSCR) which provides continuous monitoring since the 1970 s by <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> The main methodological challenge, arising from changes in the geography of health areas for which the inter-area flows are given, is addressed by adopting the lowest common denominator of 80 areas. Care is also taken to allow for the effect of business cycles in producing short-term fluctuations on migration rates and to isolate the effect of a sharp rise in rates for 16 - 24 year olds in the 1990 s, which is presumed {{to be related to the}} expansion of the university sector. The findings suggest that, unlike for the USA, there has not been a substantial decline in the intensity of internal migration between the first two decades of the study period and the second two. While there was a 3 per cent reduction in the overall rate of migration between the regions of England and Wales between 1975 - 1990 and 1996 - 2011 (omitting the 16 - 24 s), the rate for within-region moves between areas was some 10 per cent higher in the latter period. The main evidence for decline relates to particular age groups of between-region migration, where the rate for those aged 65 and over shrank by a quarter and that for 0 - 15 year olds was down by a tenth. In general, however, if there has been any major decline in the intensity of address changing in England and Wales, it can only be for the shortest-distance (within area) moves that the NHSCR does not record...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the importance}} of demographic uncertainty for the net present value (NPV) of public old age pension obligations in Norway. A probabilistic population forecast is combined with a deterministic macro model for future pension expenditures. The model is applied to Norwegian data for the period 2003 - 2100. Under the current pension system, the liabilities are likely to grow {{by a factor of}} ten {{towards the end of the}} century. The demographic driving force is an assumed increase in the life expectancies of men and women by some 13 - 16 years over the next 95 years. The results show also that long-run relative uncertainty is larger for total population than for the NPV, due to the enormous uncertainty in the number of births in the long run. In 2100, the 80 per cent prediction interval of population size is 1. 5 times as wide as the median value. For the NPV, this relative uncertainty ratio is 80 per cent. Also for earlier years, the relative uncertainty in the NPV is approximately half that in population size. There is no single <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group,</b> in which relative uncertainty is similar to that in the NPV during the entire period. fter the Second World War, many Western countries developed general systems for the provision of public old age pensions. At that time, life expectancies for men and women were about ten years lower than nowadays. Falling mortality has led to longer periods over which retirees received their pension benefits. At the same time, early retirement and increased disability among older workers resulted in a fall in the actual age at which workers left the labour market. Shorter periods of active life in the labour market and longer periods of life spent as retiree resulted in problems connected to the sustainability of the public old age pension systems. As a result, a number of countries, including all OEC...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to add a new {{dimension}} to the literature by analyzing the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) scoring system at the individual item level. The item scores represent specific behaviors demonstrated by youth and can yield valuable information about treatment needs and outcomes for vulnerable youth. However, the conventional scoring system wastes potential information about youth. The CAFAS is used nationwide, and although extensive research has been done on the properties of the CAFAS, little research has been conducted at the item level. ^ The approach that was utilized in addressing this problem involved developing and then comparing three alternative scoring systems with the standard method of scoring the CAFAS to accomplish three goals: (a) determining if a different picture would emerge for youth if the CAFAS was scored differently, (b) analyzing which scoring system was able to demonstrate the most change across three time points, and (c) investigating what additional information would be gained by utilizing an alternative scoring system. ^ Seventy youth receiving services from a Midwestern behavioral health organization were included in this study. This study was based on a sample of 35 youth in foster care, and 35 youth living at home and receiving intensive outpatient services. Youth were in the <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 7 to 17. The sample population was composed of 43 boys and 27 girls. Of the youth, 72. 9 % were European American, 21. 4 % were African American, and 5. 7 % were Hispanic. ^ The results of the study suggested that when a scoring method is utilized which captures all endorsed items of the CAFAS, the level of agreement of the measure increases with other measures of impairment. Of the three alternative scoring formats developed, one particular alternative method performed as well as the standard scoring format in detecting change across time. In conclusion, advantages of utilizing a different method of scoring the CAFAS include (a) greater utility of the measure, (b) greater sensitivity of the measure in identifying and describing impairment, and (c) greater sensitivity to associations with another measure of impairment such as the Daily Adjustment Indicator Checklist (DAIC). ...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{population}} of the Pacific Melanesian country of Vanuatu was 234, 000 at the 2009 census. Apart from subsistence activities, economic activity includes tourism and agriculture. Current completeness of vital registration is considered too low to be usable for national statistics; mortality and life expectancy (LE) are derived from indirect demographic estimates from censuses/surveys. Some cause of death (CoD) data are available to provide information on major causes of premature death. Methods: Deaths 2001 - 2007 were coded for cause (ICDv 10) for ages 0 - 59 years from: hospital separations (HS) (n = 636), hospital medical certificates (MC) of death (n = 1, 169), and monthly reports from community health facilities (CHF) (n = 1, 212). Ill-defined causes were 3 % for hospital deaths and 20 % from CHF. Proportional mortality was calculated by cause (excluding ill-defined) and age group (0 - 4, 5 - 14 years), and also by sex for 15 - 59 years. From total deaths by <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and sex from 1999 and 2009 census analyses, community deaths were estimated by deduction of hospital deaths MC. National proportional mortality by cause was estimated by a weighted average of MC and CHF deaths. Results: National estimates indicate main causes of deaths < 5 years were: perinatal disorders (45 %) and malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia (27 %). For 15 - 59 years, main causes of male deaths were: circulatory disease 27 %, neoplasms 13 %, injury 13 %, liver disease 10 %, infection 10 %, diabetes 7 %, and chronic respiratory disease 7 %; and for females: neoplasms 29 %, circulatory disease 15 %, diabetes 10 %, infection 9 %, and maternal deaths 8 %. Infection included tuberculosis, malaria, and viral hepatitis. Liver disease (including hepatitis and cancer) accounted for 18 % of deaths in adult males and 9 % in females. Non-communicable disease (NCD), including circulatory disease, diabetes, neoplasm, and chronic respiratory disease, accounted for 52 % of premature deaths in adult males and 60 % in females. Injuries accounted for 13 % in adult males and 6 % in females. Maternal deaths translate into an annual maternal mortality ratio of 130 / 100, 000 for the period.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} a histological diagnosis of cervical cancer following a given Pap test result and for a given history of Pap test results in a screened population across the full spectrum of possible cytological results. Methods: All the Pap screening results held on the New South Wales Pap Test Register for 1997 - 2003 (five million tests for 1. 87 million women) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the odds of having a histologically determined cervical cancer for a given Pap test result and test result history. The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to Pap test result histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last Pap test result adjusting for age, frequency of Pap testing and proportion of high grade (≥cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN 2]) abnormalities found in a woman 2 ̆ 7 s total recorded test result history; and (ii) with regard to the last Pap test result against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last Pap test result. The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next Pap test and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past Pap testing and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman 2 ̆ 7 s prior Pap test history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group,</b> and for all women, to estimate the 2 ̆ 71 in n 2 ̆ 7 odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last Pap test result, and by a given last Pap test result for various prior Pap test result histories. Results: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous Pap testing and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative Pap test result was 1 in 5546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN 1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer. These odds estimates were significantly modified by age and by the highest Pap test result prior to the most recent Pap test result: the higher the age and, less consistently, the higher the previous highest Pap test result for a given last Pap test result, the shorter the odds of having a subsequent histological diagnosis of cervical cancer. Conclusions: The results presented here will enable clinicians to inform their patients of their chances of being diagnosed with cervical cancer for a given Pap test result, and for some combinations of the last Pap test result and highest recorded prior Pap test result...|$|E

40|$|ResumenEl proceso de envejecimiento de la población iniciado en el último tercio del siglo XX en los países más desarrollados, se está extendiendo al resto del mundo en el siglo XXI, coincidiendo con la creciente urbanización del planeta que afecta igualmente a todos los territorios, aunque con diferencias patentes entre los países más y menos desarrollados. En este trabajo se revisan las interacciones de envejecimiento y urbanización y algunas de sus implicaciones en la sociedad. Se centra en la situación actualde las personas mayores que cada vez suponen más altas proporciones de la población de cada país y que afrontan grandes dificultades en su día a día, derivadas de sus limitaciones personales, a las que se añaden las múltiples barreras urbanas de unas ciudades pensadas para la población joven y sana. AbstractPopulation ageing and {{urbanization}} are two global {{trends that}} together comprise major forces shaping the 21 st century. At {{the same time}} as cities are growing, their share of residents aged 65 years and more is increasing. The world is currently experiencing two major demographic transitions: the ageing of populations and urbanization. The trend in today's planetary human society is restructuring throughout two fundamental and simultaneous processes with serious socio-economic implications. The urban environment influences the health and quality of older people's life. By 2050, {{more than two-thirds of the}} world's population will be living in cities. And, at least, a quarter of urban populations will be aged 65 and over, with significant implications for urban planning and development. Increasingly, cities will need to balance their role as drivers of economic development with responsibilities for improving the quality life of elderly people. In 2015, worldwide, 8 percent of the population is over 65 years and in the most developed and urbanized countries the percentage raises to 17 percent. Between 1950 and 2015, the total world population increased by 191 percent. However, in the same period, the population of older people rose by a much larger proportion. Between 1950 and 2000 the proportion of those over 65 grew by 218 percent and the population of people aged 80 or more by 386 percent. In the last fifteen years this process has intensified even more. Currently, developed countries have the greatest proportion of elders, but in a few decades many developing countries will reach the same levels of aging. In 2015 the percentage in Latin America reached 7 percent while in the European Union it is 19 percent. In an attempt to diversify the long interval between the onset of aging and increasingly advanced centenarian ages, for testing purposes, this <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>group</b> has been disaggregated into three subgroups: young old (65 - 74 years), old old (75 - 84 years) and very old (over 85 years). These subgroups show a relatively greater internal homogeneity, considering both patterns of biological clock and, above all, the social clock indicating the changes that occur in both economic activity and capabilities intellectual, cognitive, health, life expectancy [...] . The ageing population, a process registered not only in all developed countries, is due to the reduction tendency of birth and fertility and at the same time, to the decreasing of mortality and an important extension of the life expectancy at birth. Population ageing is not “gender-neutral”. The evolution to an older age structure changes the balance in numbers of men and women in the whole population. Men's higher mortality over the life course means that women typically outnumber men at older ages, and the difference is quite large among the oldest old. We must take into account that older people have a gradual loss of physical and mental faculties that they previously had. This process is the first cause of the transition generally to less mobility and repetitive spatial behaviors that are dominated by a certain rejection to change, especially to change the habitual place of residence. In general, older people want to stay at home, but his progressive loss of health and personal autonomy generates serious problems for families who must deal with their care. Not so long ago, the relatives have always been the people who had assumed the care of the elderly in their own homes, often because women were made usually responsible for reproductive work. However, due to the incorporation of women into the workplace and the increasing number of long-lived people, many women refuse to give up their jobs to care for their grandparents or parents. At present, older people in situations of dependency have to realize that informal care is no longer an option due to changes in traditional family values. However, in the current economic crisis, seniors are sometimes the ones aiding their economically uncertain families. This happens in those countries being hardest hit by the economic crisis. In general, society tends to convey a negative image of older people associated with dependence and vulnerability, regardless of the diversity of situations that arise in this heterogeneous age group, ignoring the positive aspects of aging as is the accumulated experience. And this is accentuated in urban areas that are not designed for the needs of this age group, especially the most dependent. Urbanists, planners and managers of city governments should be aware that any transformation of urban spaces entails territorial identities and sense of place of older people...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{limitations}} and possibilities of age estimation based on tooth wear of skeletal remains from wild boar, 315 mandibles from five different populations of wild boar from Poland, Germany and Sweden were analysed. Asymmetric tooth wear between {{the right and left}} mandibles was found to be rare and no systematic difference in tooth wear between males and females (less than 36 months) could be proven. The rate of tooth wear seems to vary between different populations of wild boar. The largest difference was found between wild boar kept in enclosures and four populations of free-ranging animals that showed relatively small difference in tooth wear of individuals younger than 36 months. The analysis reveals a strong correlation between age and mandible wear stages (MWS) /tooth wear stages (TWS) and indicates that tooth wear can be useful in age estimation of mandibles or loose teeth of wild boar. However, the individual variation of tooth wear is relatively large and increases with age, which implies that long lasting TWS and MWS can only be restricted to <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

Of primary interest is the effect of age, as these differences have the potential to surpass the magnitude of measurement error.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an {{assessment}} of poverty and program participation among children who reside in households that include elderly adults aged 65 and over. Children and the elderly draw on different pools of public support, fueling recent discussions of the intergenerational tensions regarding the appropriate resource share due each <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Yet within family households, the “fortunes ” of children may be closely tied to that of their elderly relatives. While a sizable literature documents the considerable kinship support systems that link the generations, the implications of these systems for poverty and for program participation have not been extensively considered. Given the trends and debates surrounding public support for these two <b>broad</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups,</b> such a consideration is of considerable policy importance. This study is based on data from the 1990 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Estimates of poverty status and participation in means-tested resource programs are generated for children, and the extent to which these outcomes are associated with elderly coresidence is considered. The results suggest that children who have at least one elderly individual living with them have lower rates of poverty and economic hardship, but that thi...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I take up some {{problems}} on the analytical theory of population which we meet with frequently in practice. Especially I feel regrettable {{that the value of}} life expectation is not available until the computation of a life table is finished. Usually it takes several years that the computation of a life table is finished under the preparation of population census figures. So I want to find a certain experimental fomula about life expectation which can be estimated easily from the crude death rate at that time and formerly calculated life expectation. I start from an assumption on mortality force, and get experimental formula. As the control of these formula, I adopt following method. I calculate estimated values of life expectaion by sex and selected ages, 1935 based on the figures of life expectation of the 5 -th life table (based on 1930 census population) and crude death rates of 1930 and 1935. Then I compare these estimated figures with the figures of life expectation of the 6 -th life table. (based on 1935 census population) The result is satisfactory I think.
