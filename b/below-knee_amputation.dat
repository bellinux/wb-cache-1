40|$|Abstract Introduction Hip {{fracture}} fixation {{surgery in}} patients with <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> poses a challenging problem to the surgeon in terms of obtaining traction for reduction of the fracture. The absence of the foot {{and part of the}} leg in these patients makes positioning on the fracture table difficult. We highlight this difficult problem and suggest techniques to overcome it. Case presentation A 73 -year-old man with bilateral <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> presented with a history of fall. Radiographs revealed an inter-trochanteric fracture of the femur. A dynamic hip screw fixation was planned for the fracture but the dilemma was on how to position the patient on the fracture table for the surgery. Special attention was needed in positioning the patient and in surgical fixation of the fracture. Conclusion Hip fracture fixation {{in patients with}} <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> poses a special problem in positioning for fracture reduction and fixation. In this case report, we share our experience and suggest techniques to use when encountering this difficult problem. </p...|$|R

40|$|Buerger's Disease, {{characterized}} by segmental, inflammatory, occlusive {{disease of the}} distal small and medium sized arteries, predominantly affects young men who are cigarette smokers. The disease may lead to ischemia, necrosis, and amputation of distal extremities; most patients have significant improvement in symptoms if smoking is discontinued. We report a patient who experienced progression of biopsy-proven Buerger's disease, after substituting smokeless tobacco for cigarettes. The patient's disease was severe enough to eventually require bilateral <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputations.</b> The association of smokeless tobacco with progressive limb ischemia should lead clinicians to discourage the substitution of smokeless tobacco for cigarette smoking in patients with Buerger's disease...|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of {{the route of the}} Moffat Road is open, except for a long, deteriorated trestle (Riflesight Notch trestle) just east of the pass, and sections leading to the Needle's Eye Tunnel, a short high altitude railroad tunnel which was closed in 1990 after a rock fell from the ceiling injuring a Denver firefighter resulting in a <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputation.</b> Since then, the tunnel was sealed by Boulder County and the United States Forest Service. The original Boulder Wagon Road (BWR) also goes over Rollins Pass yet bypasses the Needle's Eye Tunnel (as it had not yet been constructed) by taking a steep route encircling Yankee Doodle Lake counterclockwise before continuing to head west/northwest to proceed over the summit and down into the Middle Park valley. The BWR is a four-wheel-drive road not suited to lower clearance two-wheel-drive vehicles, and in some areas a winch can be helpful. Although open prior to 2008 and in good condition, this road remains to this day a subject of much controversy. In 2002 the James Peak Wilderness and Protection Area Bill (a.k.a. Public Law 107-216) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The Bill specifically created a narrow road corridor between the Indian Peaks and James Peaks Wilderness areas and states that if any of the affected counties (Grand, Gilpin or Boulder) request, the Secretary of the USDA will cooperate and assist with the repair of the Rollins Pass Road and until that time the attendant road (the BWR) will remain open to motorized use. Boulder County officials and the USFS-Boulder Ranger District have resisted the wording of the law and have closed the BWR. Both Grand and Gilpin Counties have made numerous written requests to the Secretary for the repair of Rollins Pass Road but to date there has been no repair of the road or the barricaded Needle's Eye Tunnel. The reopening of the BWR, and/or repair of the Rollins Pass Road, and even the facts surrounding the 1990 accident in the tunnel, have become contentious and ongoing issues.|$|E

40|$|True aneurysms are rare. All {{patients}} were white Caucasian males. The most common physical sign was an expanding pulsatile mass.

The occurrence of both abdominal or iliac aneu-rysms and femoral aneurysm can call for staging or complete repair. This judg-ment depends on the patient’s condition and the surgeon’s experience. A retrospective study revealed that 23 patients had 31 arteriosclerotic true femoral aneurysms. Twenty-three of 27 patients had a complete recovery with aneurysmectomy and prosthetic grafts.

40|$|Summary: The {{reconstruction}} of defects around the knee often poses a challenge {{due to the}} limited availability of local soft tissues. Indeed, this same problem is encountered when attempting to revise a <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputation</b> stump. Moreover, due to a paucity of recipient vessels in those who have undergone previous amputation secondary to trauma, free-flap reconstruction is often challenging and not always successful. We report {{a case of a}} reverse anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap used to revise a long <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputation</b> stump. Previous reports in the literature attest to the versatility of the reverse ALT to cover defects around the knee and proximal tibia, but to our knowledge, this is the first report of a reverse ALT reaching to the mid-tibial level...|$|E
40|$|The authors studied 13 amputees (7 below knee, 6 above knee) with sequen-tial {{ultrasound}} examinations at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 6 status post amputation {{to define}} the natural evolution of stump healing in below- and above-knee amputa-tions. This would permit diagnosis of abnormal conditions such as abscess. In their series, they found striking differences between below- and above-knee am-putations. In <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> the development of fluid collections was rare (2 / 6) and, when present, small (less than 3 cm) and transient (resolving within two to three weeks). In above-knee amputations, all stumps first devel-oped subcutaneous edema followed by fluid collections (less than 5 cm) all of which resolved within six weeks. They found that ultrasound examinations are a useful technique to define abnormal fluid collections in the amputee’s residual limb...|$|R

It was found that all patients achieved less than expected growth and that the reduction was greater in those patients who had had amputation for congenital deformity. It is frequently implied (Beekman 1938; Aitken and Frantz 1960 : Tooms 1971) that the {{growth of the}} stump may be proportionate after below-knee amputa-tion. This was questioned by Gillis (1956), who felt growth to be less than expected. He suggested that the processes responsible might be similar to those causing decreased growth in the wasted limbs of patients suffering from poliomyelitis. External factors that affect epiphysial growth are little understood, though it may be that longitudinal loading or stress provides an important stimulus.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the degree of mobility achieved by patients following major amputation for arterial occlusive disease of the legs and its relationship to the level of amputation. Eighty-four out of a possible 85 consecutive amputees form the basis of the study and the degree of mobility was assessed and graded in survivors six months after amputation. Of the 69 survivors 74 % were mobile to some degree and 57 % walked daily with a prosthesis. Sixty-five per cent of all the <b>amputations</b> were <b>below-knee.</b> Seventeen per cent of bclow-knee stumps in patients surviving two weeks failed to heal. In amputees who attained a unilateral mobile healed stump 78 % with <b>below-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> and 50 % with above-knee amputations walked daily with a prosthesis.
