50|$|The <b>broadnosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> {{tends to}} rest in a {{vertical}} position among the fronds of seaweed and feeds on plankton such as copepods which it sucks in through its mouth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>broadnosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> is {{native to}} the Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. Its range extends from Vardø, Norway to Morocco. It is found at depths down to about 20 m.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Broadnosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) is a fish of the Syngnathidae family (seahorses and pipefishes). It is {{native to}} the Eastern Atlantic from Vardø in Norway, Baltic Sea (north to the Gulf of Finland) and the British Isles at North to Morocco at South. Also in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov. It is common in the coastal shallow waters, usually on reefs with seagrasses. This species is notable for its [...] "broad" [...] snout, which is as deep as its body.|$|E
50|$|The <b>broadnosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> is a slender, {{elongated}} {{fish with}} a hexagonal cross-section which distinguishes {{it from its}} even more threadlike relation the straightnose pipefish (Nerophis ophidion) which has a circular cross-section. The body surface is covered by small bony plates. The head resembles that of a seahorse with a long, laterally flattened snout and obliquely sloping mouth. Unlike the straightnose pipefish, it has a fan-shaped caudal fin. The general colour is greenish, often with various darker mottling, and the belly is yellow. The average size is about 15 to 20 cm with a maximum of 25 cm.|$|E
50|$|The straightnose {{pipefish}} initially {{gives the}} impression of being a worm. The head is tiny and resembles that of a seahorse, to which this fish is closely related. The body is round in cross-section and the fins are tiny. The only fish with which it might be confused is the <b>broadnosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Syngnathus typhle) but that is more robust and has a hexagonal cross-section. The general colour of the straightnose pipefish is green with a yellowish belly. The female has pale blue markings {{on the head and}} body and both sexes become more colourful at breeding time when the male’s snout turns yellow. The average size is about 15 to 20 cm with a maximum of 30 cm.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{other species}} of pipefish, the <b>broadnosed</b> <b>pipefish</b> is sex-role reversed: males brood the eggs and because of their {{increased}} investment in offspring are the choosier sex, whereas females compete more intensely than males for access to mates. [...] Females can produce eggs faster than males can brood them, and are limited {{by the size of}} the male's brood pouch, which cannot carry all the eggs of a female similar to himself in size.   Male brood time is approximately four to six weeks, during which time the male provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing embryos until they hatch.   One to six females contribute to each brood clutch, which is the highest rate of multiple maternity in all of the pipefish species.|$|E
