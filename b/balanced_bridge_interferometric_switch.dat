By using picosecond pulses, we characterize the switching window of the three devices in terms of both temporal width and output peak-to-peak amplitude. These results are found to be in close agreement with a previously developed theoretical model. Since these nonlinear <b>interferometric</b> <b>switches</b> use an active device as the nonlinear element, relatively low control pulse energy is needed to perform switching as compared to other techniques.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{a possible}} {{use of the}} magnonic <b>interferometric</b> <b>switches</b> in multi-valued logic circuits. The switch is a three-terminal device consisting of two spin channels where input, control, and output signals are spin waves. Signal modulation is achieved via the interference between the source and gate spin waves. We report experimental data on a micrometer scale prototype based on Y 3 Fe 2 (FeO 4) 3 structure. The output characteristics are measured at different angles of the bias magnetic field. The On/Off ratio of the prototype exceeds 36 dB at room temperature. Experimental data is complemented by the theoretical analysis {{and the results of}} micro magnetic simulations showing spin wave propagation in a micrometer size magnetic junction. We also present the results of numerical modeling illustrating the operation of a nanometer-size switch consisting of just 20 spins in the source-drain channel. The utilization of spin wave interference as a switching mechanism makes it possible to build nanometer-scale logic gates, and minimize energy per operation, which is limited only by the noise margin. The utilization of phase in addition to amplitude for information encoding offers an innovative route towards multi-state logic circuits.

40|$|Magneto-optic {{devices are}} a {{potential}} enabler of better scaling, transparent networks that are bit-rate, protocol and format insensitive. Transparency is critical given the paradigm shift from connection-oriented communications to IP-centric packet switched data traffic {{driven by the}} influx of high bandwidth applications. This is made more urgent by the large and growing optical-electronic bandwidth mismatch {{as well as the}} rapid approach of device dimensions to the quantum limit. Fiber-based switches utilizing bismuth-substituted iron garnets as Faraday rotators in Mach-Zehnder and Sagnac interferometer configurations are proposed, analyzed and characterized. The issues and limitations of these switches are investigated and efforts are undertaken to model and optimize the field generating coil impedance parameters. While alleviating the concerns associated with free-space switches and being compatible with contemporary optical networks, the performance of the fiber-based <b>interferometric</b> <b>switches</b> is still below theoretical limits and could be improved. Moreover, the discrete components of a fiber-based implementation engender scalability concerns. In keeping with the spirit of Richard Feynman 2 ̆ 7 s lectures, the maturity of planar lithographic techniques that are widely used in microelectronics is leveraged to realize integrated versions of the fiber-based <b>interferometric</b> <b>switches.</b> The design, analysis, fabrication and characterization of these integrated switches are detailed herein, including the selection of a suitable material system, design of the waveguide geometry, creation and calibration of a fabrication process based on direct-write scanning electron-beam lithography as well as determination of the switches 2 ̆ 7 fabrication tolerance. While the larger waveguide cross-section of the microphotonic switches enables efficient coupling to fiber and greatly reduces geometrical birefringence, the weak confinement results in longer device lengths. Moreover, the small but finite birefringence induces some polarization dependence in switch performance. Consequently, compact and nominally non-birefringent nanophotonic versions of the <b>interferometric</b> <b>switches</b> are proposed and analyzed in the interest of further improving switch performance and scalability...|$|R
