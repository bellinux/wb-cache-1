MUNIX is a variant of UNIX, an operating system for the PDP 11 developed at Bell Laboratories. The three major design goals of the system were: (1) support for processes capable of real-time interaction with several dynamic graphics display units, an array processor, and a multi-channel A/D converter; (2) interactive and <b>background</b> <b>processing</b> facilities to support program development; and, (3) management of the hierarchical storage created by the mix of shared and private memories of various speeds. The resulting MUNIX system provides an effective mechanism for resource sharing in a laboratory environment and {{is the basis for}} protected real-time operation in a multi-user system.

40|$|There are {{well-documented}} behavioral {{differences in}} the visual processing of objects and backgrounds {{as a function of}} cultural group. Recent neuroimaging evidence also point to cultural differences in neural activation patterns. Compared to East Asians, Westerners show more object-focused processing and activate neural structures reflective of this bias for objects. In a recent adaptation study, East Asian older adults showed an absence of an object processing area but normal adaptation for background areas. In the present study, 75 young and old adults (half East Asian and half Western) were tested in an fMR-adaptation study to examine differences in object and <b>background</b> <b>processing</b> as well as object-background binding. We found equivalent <b>background</b> <b>processing</b> in the parahippocampal gyrus in all four groups, diminished binding processes in the hippocampus in both old East Asians and Westerners, and diminished object processing in old adults compared to young in the lateral occipital complex. Moreover, there was significantly less adaptation response in the object areas for old East Asians compared to old Westerners. These findings demonstrate the malleability of perceptual processes as a result of differences in cultural exposure over time or cohort-specific experiences...|$|E
