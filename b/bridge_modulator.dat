40|$|Summary form only given. In conclusion, we have {{demonstrated}} {{for the first}} time a travelling wave driven balanced <b>bridge</b> <b>modulator</b> switch on InP with a bandwidth exceeding 15 GHz. This could be further improved substituting the quaternary waveguide layer by multi-quantum-well layers utilizing the quantum confined Stark effect. For a 1 -mm-long travelling wave electrode it would have the potential to handle data with 40 - 100 Gbit/ s...|$|E
40|$|Photonic and {{optoelectronic}} devices {{may offer}} {{the opportunity to}} realize efficient signal processing at speeds higher than in conventional electronic devices. Switches form the building blocks for circuits and fast photonic switches have been realized [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Recently, proof of principle of exciton optoelectronic devices was demonstrated [7, 8]. Potential advantages of excitonic devices include high operation and interconnection speed, small dimensions, {{and the opportunity to}} combine many elements into integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate experimental proof of principle for the operation of excitonic switching devices at temperatures around 100 K. The devices are based on an AlAs/GaAs coupled quantum well structure and include the exciton optoelectronic transistor (EXOT), the excitonic <b>bridge</b> <b>modulator</b> (EXBM), and the excitonic pinch-off modulator (EXPOM). This is a two orders of magnitude increase in the operation temperature compared to the earlier devices, where operation was demonstrated at 1. 5 K [7, 8].

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{performed}} recently that demonstrate the reliability of lithium niobate Annealed Proton Exchanged (APE') Integrated Optical Circuits (lOCs). Studies have been performed on APETM bC die as well as pigtailed and packaged devices. The tests indicate that the reliability of APE' lOCs meet or surpass the needs of most military and commercial applications. 2. RELIABILITY OF IOC DIE AND FIBER PIGTAILS Accelerated aging studies performed on Y-fed Balanced <b>Bridge</b> <b>Modulators</b> (YBBM) OEIC die indicate that optical insertion loss, half-wave voltage, and Y-branch split ratio will exhibit no degradation over 25 years at 125 °C [1]. Directional coupler coupling ratio may change slightly under those conditions; however, the changes are small enough that a> 19 dB modulator extinction is maintained for greater than 13 years at 125 °C. Micro-crack growth was studied using IOC die for Fiberoptic Gyroscopes (FOG) [2]. Micro-cracks originate from microscopic defects in the LiNbO 3 crystal. Ove...|$|R
40|$|The AD 7730 is a {{complete}} analog front end for weigh-scale and pressure measurement applications. The device accepts lowlevel signals directly from a transducer and outputs a serial digital word. The input signal is applied to a proprietary programmable gain front end based around an analog <b>modulator.</b> <b>Bridge</b> Transducer ADC AD 7730 /AD 7730 L The modulator output is processed by a low pass programmable digital filter, allowing adjustment of filter cutoff, output rate and settling time. The part features two buffered differential programmable gain analog inputs {{as well as a}} differential reference input. The part operates from a single + 5 V supply. It accepts four unipolar analog input ranges: 0 mV to + 10 mV, + 20 mV, + 40 mV and + 80 mV and four bipolar ranges: ± 10 mV, ± 20 mV, ± 40 m...|$|R
