We denote the cores without WBRs as light-wrapped cores and present a new modular SoC test architecture for concurrently testing both the wrapped and the lightwrapped logic cores. Since the WBRs of cores that transfer test stimuli and test responses for light-wrapped cores become shared resources during test, conflicts arise during test scheduling that will negatively impact the test application time. The algorithm for SoC test scheduling and light-wrapped logic cores works under multiple constraints (test power dissipation, test resources and test priorities) and applies a Power Swarm optimization based optimum search for a solution to the scheduling problem. We consider the experiments on several SoC benchmark circuits and demonstrate that, with an acceptable increase in test application time, the number of WBRs can be significantly decreased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Motivated by the {{increasing}} design for test (DFT) area overhead and potential performance degradation caused by wrapping all the embedded cores for modular system-on-a-chip (SOC) testing, this paper proposes {{a solution for}} {{reducing the number of}} wrapper <b>boundary</b> <b>register</b> (WBR) cells. By utilizing the functional interconnect topology and the WBRs of the surrounding cores to transfer test stimuli and responses, the WBRs of some cores can be removed without affecting the testability of the SOC. We denote the cores without WBRs as light-wrapped cores and present a new modular SOC test architecture for concurrently testing both the wrapped and the light-wrapped logic cores. Since the WBRs of cores that transfer test stimuli and test responses for light-wrapped cores become shared resources during test, conflicts arise during test scheduling that will negatively impact the test application time. As a consequence, to alleviate this problem, we present a novel test access mechanism (TAM) design algorithm for the proposed SOC test architecture. We conduct experiments on several SOC benchmark circuits and demonstrate that, with an acceptable increase in test application time, the number of WBRs can be significantly decreased. This will ultimately lessen the necessary DFT area for modular SOC testing and reduce the propagation delays between cores. Index Terms—Core wrapper, electronic test, system-on-a-chip (SOC). I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} to infer the {{boundaries}} of the interplanetary coronal mass ejections is proposed. The local minima of a proton temperature anisotropy are used as potential boundaries of the interplanetary event. The low-beta plasma values are then invoked to detect at least four boundaries, two for the beginning and two for the end of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). Intermediate boundaries can be identified, as indicated by other plasma and magnetic field signatures, and mark substructures of an event.

40|$|Characterising the {{nanoscale}} dynamic organisation of lipids in bilayers {{is central}} {{to our understanding of}} cell membranes at a molecular level. We investigate phase separation and communication across leaflets in ternary lipid bilayers, including saturated lipids with between 12 and 20 carbons per tail. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal a novel two-step kinetics due to hydrophobic mismatch, in which the initial response of the apposed leaflets upon quenching is to increase local asymmetry (antiregistration), followed by dominance of symmetry (registration) as the bilayer equilibrates. Antiregistration can become thermodynamically preferred if domain size is restricted below ⇠ 20 nm, with implications for the symmetry of rafts and nanoclusters in cell membranes, which have similar reported sizes. We relate our findings to theory derived from a semi-microscopic model in which the leaflets experience a “direct” area-dependent coupling, and an “indirect” coupling that arises from hydrophobic mismatch and is most important at domain <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Registered</b> phases di↵er in composition from antiregistered phases, consistent with a direct coupling between the leaflets. Increased hydrophobic mismatch purifies the phases, suggesting that it contributes to the molecule-level lipid immiscibility. Our results demonstrate an interplay of competing inter-leaflet couplings that a↵ect phase compositions within the leaflets, and lead to a lengthscale that can influence lateral and transverse bilayer organisation within cells...|$|R

Precomputation automatically discovers some standard circuit transformations like bypassing and lookahead.
