40|$|Swelling {{experiments}} in supercritical CO {{have been conducted}} on two groups of samples of Miocene low rank coal with different megascopic textures (non-banded and banded) to address the different swelling behaviors. A block sample (30 × 10 × 10 mm) from core samples was used and a strain gauge {{was attached to the}} long axis of the sample block to measure the length of change. The actual maceral group compositions between these samples were similar and high in huminite. However, there is a subtle difference in suberinite and corpohuminite maceral where banded samples consistently have higher compositions compared to non-banded ones. The experimental results showed that <b>banded</b> <b>coal</b> samples tend to have anisotropic linear swelling where swelling perpendicular to bedding plane was always greater than that parallel. In contrast, non-banded samples showed more isotropic behavior without much preference to bedding plane orientation. The ratio of perpendicular to parallel swelling was around 1. 28 and 1. 05 for banded and non-banded coal samples, respectively. The difference in swelling characteristics was concluded as a result of different megascopic textures of coal samples with respect to bedding orientation...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to coal lithotype analysis {{is based on}} a visual characterisation of coal in core, mine or outcrop exposures. As not all wells are fully cored, the petroleum and coal mining industries increasingly use geophysical wireline logs for lithology interpretation. This study demonstrates a method for interpreting coal lithotypes from geophysical wireline logs, and in particular discriminating between bright or banded, and dull coal at similar densities to a decimetre level. The study explores the optimum combination of geophysical log suites for training the coal electrofacies interpretation, using neural network conception, and then propagating the results to wells with fewer wireline data. This approach is objective and has a recordable reproducibility and rule set. In addition to conventional gamma ray and density logs, laterolog resistivity, microresistivity and PEF data were used in the study. Array resistivity data from a compact micro imager (CMI tool) were processed into a single microresistivity curve and integrated with the conventional resistivity data in the cluster analysis. Microresistivity data were tested in the analysis to test the hypothesis that the improved vertical resolution of microresistivity curve can enhance the accuracy of the clustering analysis. The addition of PEF log allowed discrimination between low density bright to <b>banded</b> <b>coal</b> electrofacies and low density inertinite-rich dull electrofacies. The results of clustering analysis were validated statistically and the results of the electrofacies results were compared to manually derived coal lithotype logs...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploration}} for unconventional {{energy reserves}} has rapidly {{increased over the}} last five to ten years. Currently, {{there are a number of}} companies actively exploring for coalbed methane (CBM) in New Zealand. This study investigates one of these prospects, the subbituminous Huntly coalfield. Coal core was retrieved from the two major seams in the coalfield, the Renown and the Kupakupa. Three coals types were identified (1) bright lustre, non-banded, (2) bright lustre, moderately banded and (3) bright lustre, highly banded. As the degree of banding increases, the average thickness of the vitrain bands increase, the amount of structured vitrinite macerals also increase and the vitrodetrinite content decreases. The Renown seam is predominantly composed of bright non-banded coal while in the Kupakupa seam the more <b>banded</b> <b>coal</b> types are dominant. On average, the Renown seam has both the capacity to hold more gas and has higher gas contents than the stratigraphically lower Kupakupa seam. Additionally, gas content, on average, was found to be highest in intervals of the non-banded coal type and lowest in the highly <b>banded</b> <b>coal</b> type. Cluster analysis found that gas content is associated with hydrogen, volatile matter, calorific value and collodetrinite. As such, gas appears to be preferentially retained/produced in the matrix-dominated material. While not causally linked with gas content, gas holding capacity showed associations with the sporinite, inertodetrinite, funginite and vitrodetrinite; of note, these macerals are highest in the non-banded coal type. Gas holding capacity is thought to be a function of coal texture. Ash yield was found to inversely affect total gas content when ash yield is > 10 %. Below 10 %, it is thought that inorganic elements are organically bound. The small angle scattering analysis indicated that inorganic matter was in the 12. 5 Å < r < 125 Å pore size range. The influence of inorganic material was more noticeable in vitrain than matrix samples and is proposed to exist as thin inorganic coatings. Total porosity of the Huntly coal is primarily composed of micropores with macroporosity only contributing a small proportion. In addition, the specific surface area of the coals is also largely contributed by the micropores. Methane holding capacity on a dry, ash-free basis showed positive correlations with both micro- and macroporosity. When methane holding capacity was considered on an ‘as analysed’ basis, correlation was only identified with macroporosity. Possibly gas holding capacity is affected by the presence of moisture blocking access to gas adsorption sites in smaller pores. Considerable variation is present in both gas adsorption and gas desorption results between drill holes, between seams and also within individual seam intersections. Gas adsorption capacity and gas content are used to calculate % saturation for a reservoir, a key assessment parameter. It was found that multiple samples of both gas adsorption capacity and gas content are required to reduce the uncertainty around the calculated % saturation (at least three of each in the current study). Additionally, adsorption isotherm samples need to be collected as fresh as possible to minimize oxidation and moisture loss. Delaying sample analysis was found to result in an overestimation of gas adsorption capacity...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the parent stratigraphy of a coal seam, i. e. its lithotype and band distribution, {{can be used to}} estimate the input and output size distributions of broken coal for a fragmentation event(s) was tested using the drop-shatter process for core. Coal breakage {{is a function of the}} inherent strength of the material, its particle size, and the amount of impact energy imparted. Coal is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of bright and dull bands, and stone, which generate different daughter particle size distributions in response to impact energy. Lithotypes and bands also exhibit an in situ thickness distribution that can be related to input and output size distributions. The results demonstrate that dull coal that is massive and strong requires more energy to break relative to brighter, more friable coals. As a result, brighter and <b>banded</b> <b>coal</b> lithotypes break into finer band components, resulting in the concentration of bright (vitrinite-rich) coal in the finer progeny fractions. Dull coal and stone concentrate in the coarse fractions, except where stone consists of soft claystones or shales. The frequency distributions of the lithotypes 2 ̆ 7 thickness estimate the feed size, and that of the component bright, dull and stone bands of the daughter particle size distribution at the end of the fragmentation process. This has implications for the prediction of size, and composition of size fractions, resulting from fragmentation events that occur during mining and handling, both of which will impact on the downstream processing behaviour of coal...|$|E
40|$|The Bernice Basin {{is a small}} {{structural}} basin entirely {{contained within}} the northern halves of the Laporte and Lopez quadrangles in north-central Pennsylvania. It contains Pottsville and Llewellyn sediments and is of Middle Pennsylvanian age. ^ An abandoned strip mine in the basin contains {{the remains of a}}n in place Paleozoic swamp forest. The basal unit in the swamp sequence is the old soil horizon, a medium gray, unfossiliferous, intensely rooted siltstone.

The forest 2 ̆ 7 s trunks are well preserved in the overlying black shale which grades into 150 centimeters of allochthonous <b>banded</b> <b>coal.</b> ^ Logs of Lepidodendron rimosum and L. dichotomum dominate this assemblage. In these two species, juvenile trunks are obconical, because the growth of secondary tissues did not keep pace with the increasing diameter of the apical meristem. During this stage, the cushion 2 ̆ 7 s length and width increased with trunk height. After the meristem matured, the trunk continued growing upward in an unbranched state, and the cushions produced at this time were of constant dimensions. In both species, unfavorable environmental conditions affected cushion size. ^ Lepidodendron rimosum accomodated growth of the secondary tissues by expanding the inter-area between cushions. Lepidodendron dichotomum lacked this potential and shed its cushions more quickly. ^ Cushion length decreased drastically in Lepidodendron rimosum just before branching, but not in L. dichotomum. The former branched by dichotomizing apices and was determinate in growth, the latter produced determinate lateral branches by monopodial branchings but was indeterminate as a whole. ^ The Bernice forest had a multi-story canopy. The uppermost canopy was some 50 m above the ground and was dominated by L. rimosum. A lower canopy occurred some 35 m above the surface and was dominated by L. dichotomum. A third level occurred 15 m above the ground. It contained the pteridosperms and occasional calamites. The lowest layer consisted of the herbaceous Sphenophyllum. ...|$|E

40|$|Instantaneous outbursts in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} {{have occurred in}} at least 16 countries, involving both methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The precise mechanisms of an instantaneous outburst are still unresolved but must consider the effects of stress, gas content and physico-mechanical properties of the coal. Other factors such as mining methods (e. g., development heading into the coal seam) and geological features (e. g., coal seam disruptions from faulting) can combine to exacerbate the problem. Prediction techniques continue to be unreliable and unexpected outburst incidents resulting in fatalities are a major concern for underground coal operations. Gas content thresholds of 9 m(3) /t for CH 4 and 6 m(3) /t for CO 2 {{are used in the}} Sydney Basin, to indicate outburst-prone conditions, but are reviewed on an individual mine basis and in mixed as situations. Data on the sorption behaviour of Bowen Basin coals from Australia have provided an explanation for the conflicting results obtained by coal face desorption indices used for outburst-proneness assessment. A key factor appears to be different desorption rates displayed by <b>banded</b> <b>coals,</b> which is supported by both laboratory and mine-site investigations. Dull <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high fusinite and semifusinite contents tend to display rapid desorption from solid coal, for a given pressure drop. The opposite is true for bright <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high vitrinite contents and dull <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high inertodetrinite contents. Consequently, when face samples of dull, fusinite-or semifusinite-rich coal of small particle size are taken for desorption testing, much gas has already escaped and low readings result. The converse applies for samples taken from <b>coal</b> <b>bands</b> with high vitrinite and/or inertodetrinite contents. In terms of outburst potential, it is the bright, vitrinite-rich and the dull, inertodetrinite-rich sections of a coal seam that appear to be more outburst-prone. This is due to the ability of the solid coal to retain gas, even after pressure reduction, creating a gas content gradient across the coal face sufficient to initiate an outburst. Once the particle size of the coal is reduced, rapid gas desorption can then take place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science...|$|R

The typical {{characteristic}} of stoning <b>band</b> <b>coal</b> seams is of multi-layers and low permeability, so fractured vertical well is usually {{used in the}} CBM development {{of this kind of}} coal seams. As far as the reservoir simulation of vertical fractured CBM wells is concerned, the fracture characterization technique is of great importance. Taking the vertical fractured pilots in F coal measures of Bowen Basin in Australia as an example, this paper will illustrate the application of fracture characterization technique in reservoir simulation. Its highlight is to scientifically characterize the shape of hydraulic fractures and quantitatively describe the reservoir permeability improvement after fracturing through “MULTX ” of grid conductivity with Tartan grid model, thereby determining key parameters for the reservoir simulation of fractured vertical wells and providing a scientific basis for establishing CBM development plan and forecasting ultimate recoverable reserves. ...|$|R
