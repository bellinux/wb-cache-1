50|$|A {{new version}} of Man-At-Arms was {{released}} in 2009 as part of Mattel's on-line Masters of the Universe Classics collectors toyline. As with other releases in the series, this figure was heavily influenced by the original 1980s line. The look of the character was based upon his vintage toy packaging artwork. This {{new version of}} Man-At-Arms came <b>with</b> <b>interchangeable</b> <b>heads</b> (<b>with</b> and without moustache), as well as additional weapons - a sword and small laser pistol, similar in design to those which came with the original 1980s Castle Grayskull playset.|$|R
5000|$|Stingray {{represented}} {{a major breakthrough}} from Fireball XL5 {{both in terms of}} special effects techniques and storytelling. It was the first Supermarionation series to use puppets <b>with</b> <b>interchangeable</b> <b>heads,</b> allowing a number of emotions to be conveyed to the audience. The love triangle between Atlanta, Troy, and Marina is a surprisingly mature development for a children's TV programme, and is even incorporated into the closing credits, in which Troy sings [...] "Aqua Marina" [...] (a song about his romantic feelings for Marina, sung by Gary Miller) while Atlanta gazes wistfully at his photograph.|$|R

5000|$|The company's {{original}} product was the CMV 3, the world's first commercially available condenser microphone. It {{was a rather}} large (40 cm tall, 9 cm diameter) microphone <b>with</b> several <b>interchangeable</b> capsule <b>heads</b> which gave it different directional patterns. Because of its shape and size, this microphone was often known as the [...] "Neumann bottle". It is often seen in historical photographs of public events in Germany through the period of World War II.|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a method for probing the mechani- cal response of thin film materials based on miniature tensile testing. A number of mechanisms that may compromise the performance and potentially limit the operational lifetime of MEMS devices which incorporate functional ferroelectric ceramics were also identified and investigated. Reliability of piezo MEMS com- ponents was studied at a wafer and at a device level through the development of appropriate techniques based on miniature tensile testing, time- resolved mi- cro RAMAN spectroscopy and laser Doppler vibrometry. Micro tensile testing was further used for the extraction of the elastic properties of various thin film materials. A miniature tensile stage was developed in common with DEBEN UK for the mechanical characterization of functional thin film materials like PZT and ZnO ceramics, which are commonly used in MEMS fabrication. The stage is of- fered with a piezo electric motor which can be fitted <b>with</b> <b>interchangeable</b> <b>heads.</b> These can be combined with di. erent types of mounting jaws, enabling both con- ventional tensile testing and compression testing to be performed. Strains and displacements were measured in- situ using an optical, non destructive method based on CCD imaging. The elastic constants of polymer (LCP), LCP-Au bi- layers and electroplated Ni were defined in good agreement with the literature. However yield of successfully released ceramic samples was rather poor so a col- laboration with IMTEK at Germany was established. Using their facilities batch processing {{of a large number of}} wafers was possible. Cont/d. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5000|$|Fred leaves Steiner's {{castle and}} meets a blue-skinned hunchback in the {{cemetery}} outside. The hunchback introduces himself as Sam Spade, a gravedigger and [...] "head merchant" [...] who can help Fred by providing him <b>with</b> quality <b>interchangeable</b> <b>heads.</b> Fred continues to Creepy Hollow, where he defeats the Horseman and rescues Dr. Steiner. Steiner, however, has little information regarding Fred's investigation and suggests that he question the residents of Hope Falls {{to learn more about}} his demise. Fred begins exploring Hope Falls, meeting many strange personalities along the way. He reconnects with his old girlfriend Jeanne, who is the daughter of a prominent Hope Falls citizen, Vinni Rossini. Fred learns that Mr. Rossini had been reported missing by Jeanne, and Jeanne had subsequently hired Fred to find him. Fred had eventually followed the trail to Pitt, who had bribed Fred's partner, Benny Salazar, into betraying him. Fred was promptly caught by Pitt's henchmen and shot to death by his right-hand man, Lefty.|$|R
40|$|The Autosub AUV project, {{funded by}} the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has been used {{worldwide}} over the last twelve years, for the most part, using a purpose made gantry {{on a variety of}} ships for launch and recovery. Over this time, a history has accumulated of the system strengths, weaknesses, and maintenance and refit costs. We require a second system to allow simultaneous AUV use on separate ships. This will be designed to be a more compliant system, tolerant of high dynamic loads. We will also review the positioning of the system on the ship to minimise pitch and roll movements. The inherent dynamic difficulties in recovering AUVs {{are similar to those of}} ROVs and we would consider whether a common crane system <b>with</b> <b>interchangeable</b> lift <b>heads</b> would be feasible for use with either AUVs or ROVs, thus creating the benefits of a shared infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} the concept of <b>interchangeable</b> {{straight}} spindle <b>head</b> type VA 1 -C, used for automatic clamping in 80 kW spindle head from production of TOS Ku≈ôim. Thesis contains survey of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>heads,</b> analysis of the spindle housing, strenght analysis of the spindle with the safety calculations in critical sec-tions and analysis of the clamping mechanism together with the calculation of the camping force, which holds the tools in the spindle. Analysis of the camping mechanisms contains calculation of the contact stress between balls and housings. All results are shown in the graphs. In {{the last part of the}} thesis are described the construction elements using the model of the <b>interchangeable</b> <b>head.</b> Enclosed is the assembly drawing of the spindle head, bill of material, detail drawing of the spindle and also 3 D model of the <b>interchangeable</b> spindle <b>head...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{supplying}} {{air to the}} bag is through blowing into a blowpipe, or blowstick.
