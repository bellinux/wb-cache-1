5|$|Expressions {{of sympathy}} and {{solidarity}} from the European film community manifested in renewed assurances of continued {{support from the}} production's German partners, ARTE, and the French National Film Centre (whose support was conditional on the film having 51% of its dialogue in French). New French financing was secured from production company Mezzanine Film, and in Hungary, the Hungarian Motion Picture Foundation (MMKA) and the Minister of Culture pledged to back the production if a guarantee could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film would be finished safely. A compromise filming schedule was negotiated whereby {{a quarter of the}} shoot would take place in Eastern Europe rather than Corsica and fewer shooting days would be allotted. This allowed the original €5 million budget to be reduced by €700,000 to the amount available. With the funding promises secured and a revised shooting schedule, the film's producers forged a new co-production contract in July 2005.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the designs}} were approved, the artists {{prepared}} bronze casts {{to be sent}} to the Medallic Art Company in New York.

The Panama–Pacific issues are the first American coins known to have been produced from hubs provided by a private company—the Medallic Art Company prepared hubs for the 1913 Buffalo nickel, but it is uncertain if they were used. The Panama–Pacific hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where the Engraving Department, headed by Barber, would produce the necessary dies. [...] Although the authorizing statute required that the coins be struck in San Francisco, all coinage dies at that time were produced by Barber and his assistants in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Tolman and {{his assistants}} {{finished}} making their changes in July 1945, and Groves had copies sent out by courier to selected personnel. Each submitted a written report, which was {{returned with the}} courier and the manuscript. These were busy people who sometimes only had {{a few days or}} even hours to look at the manuscript. Many, but not all, merely signed a statement saying that they were happy with it. Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, sent back a detailed review. He had concerns about the amount of credit being given to different people and organizations, and recommended that [...] "full credit be given to H. D. Smyth for preparing it and that the statement <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Army has no responsibility for the report except for asking him to do it." [...] Smyth was given credit, but no such statement was issued. To prepare the final draft for the printer, Groves brought typists with the required security clearances to Washington, D.C., from the Manhattan District's headquarters in Oak Ridge.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, The Wires Esther Zuckerman {{criticized the}} {{inclusion}} of a romantic relationship in the film, and said of the two characters' kiss: [...] "There's a case to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kiss is simply an acceptance of their fate, but everything we know about Rita up until this point implies that she's a dedicated soldier, and making her a sudden romantic betrays her character." [...] Zuckerman added: [...] "That's not to say she can't soften up a bit as humans do, but the moment reads less like she's accepting her humanity and more like the filmmakers had to acknowledge two attractive leads ... who should lock lips because that's what men and women do in movies." [...] Writing in The Week, Monika Bartyzel also criticized the romance in the film, stating that Rita is the one who kisses Cage, despite knowing him for only a day where he had known her for multiple days via time loop. Bartyzel said that Rita's portrayal was part of a commonly seen motif in which a female character helps a male [...] "Chosen One" [...] character, and that this was [...] "the new normal because it allows Hollywood to appeal to feminist concerns while continuing to feed male wish fulfillment". Bartyzel said that Rita [...] "at her most powerful" [...] ultimately serves [...] "to make the male hero into a fighter like herself".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} The Great Evangelical Disaster, Francis Schaeffer details the {{theological}} shift in American Christianity from conservatism to liberalism. In that discussion, Schaeffer describes how Machen's [...] "defrocking" [...] rightly became front page {{news in the}} secular media of the country. Schaeffer concludes: [...] "A good case could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> news about Machen was the most significant U.S. news {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century.

2500|$|In early August 2005, {{after the}} June {{election}} of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iran's President, Iran removed seals on its uranium enrichment equipment in Isfahan, which UK officials termed a [...] "breach of the Paris Agreement" [...] though a case can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> EU violated {{the terms of}} the Paris Agreement by demanding that Iran abandon nuclear enrichment. Several days later, the EU-3 offered Iran a package in return for permanent cessation of enrichment. Reportedly, it included benefits in the political, trade and nuclear fields, as well as long-term supplies of nuclear materials and assurances of non-aggression by the EU (but not the US). Mohammad Saeedi, the deputy head of Iran's atomic energy organization rejected the offer, terming it [...] "very insulting and humiliating" [...] and other independent analysts characterized the EU offer as an [...] "empty box". Iran's announcement that it would resume enrichment preceded the election of Iranian President Ahmadinejad by several months. The delay in restarting the program was to allow the IAEA to re-install monitoring equipment. The actual resumption of the program coincided with the election of President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, and the appointment of Ali Larijani as the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator.|$|E
2500|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, it was {{a popular}} belief among many whites that the {{presence}} of blacks in a white neighborhood would bring down property values. The United States government created a policy to segregate the country which involved making low-interest mortgages available to families through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Veteran's Administration. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as [...] "in decline." [...] The rules for loans did not say that [...] "black families cannot get loans"; rather, they said people from [...] "areas in decline" [...] could not get loans. While a case could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect. In fact, this administration was formed as part of the New Deal to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the inner city areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of the}} {{priority}} method for constructing a r.e. set X is to list a countable sequence of requirements that X must satisfy. For example, to construct a r.e. set X between 0 and 0prime& {{it is enough to}} satisfy the requirements Ae and Be for each natural number e, where Ae requires that the oracle machine with index e does not compute 0prime& from X and Be requires that the Turing machine with index e (and no oracle) does not compute X. [...] These requirements are put into a priority ordering, which is an explicit bijection of the requirements and the natural numbers. The proof proceeds inductively with one stage for each natural number; these stages {{can be thought of as}} steps of time during which the set X is enumerated. [...] At each stage, numbers may be put into X or forever prevented from entering X in an attempt to satisfy requirements (that is, force them to hold once all of X has been enumerated). [...] Sometimes, a number can be enumerated into X to satisfy one requirement but doing this would cause a previously satisfied requirement to become unsatisfied (that is, to be injured). [...] The priority order on requirements is used to determine which requirement to satisfy in this case. [...] The informal idea is that if a requirement is injured then it will eventually stop being injured after all higher priority requirements have stopped being injured, although not every priority argument has this property. [...] An argument must <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overall set X is r.e. and satisfies all the requirements. Priority arguments can be used to prove many facts about r.e. sets; the requirements used and the manner in which they are satisfied must be carefully chosen to produce the required result.|$|E
2500|$|The defence stands here solely {{upon the}} {{absolute}} immunity from judicial inquiry {{of every one}} who asserts authority from {{the executive branch of}} the government, however clear it may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> executive possessed no such power. Not only no such power is given, but it is absolutely prohibited, both to the executive and the legislative, to deprive any one of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or to take private property without just compensation. ... No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives. Courts of justice are established, not only to decide upon the controverted rights of the citizens as against each other, but also upon rights in controversy between them and the government; and the docket of this court is crowded with controversies of the latter class. Shall it be said, {{in the face of all}} this, and of the acknowledged right of the judiciary to decide in proper cases, statutes which have been passed by both branches of Congress and approved by the President to be unconstitutional, that the courts cannot give a remedy when the citizen has been deprived of his property by force, his estate seized and converted to the use of the government without lawful authority, without process of law, and without compensation, because the President has ordered it and his officers are in possession? If such be the law of this country, it sanctions a tyranny which has no existence in the monarchies of Europe, nor in any other government which has a just claim to well-regulated liberty and the protection of personal rights.|$|E
