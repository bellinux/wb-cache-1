5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, {{and he seems}} to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the score}} is through-composed, within the general {{structure}} of the opera there are several identifiable numbers: four solos given to the three main characters, a trio and a brief love duet. Only Lauretta's O mio babbino caro, the best-known of the solos, is separable from its context and can <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> as a concert piece.|$|E
5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to <b>be</b> <b>sung.</b> Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply melody and verse. However, due to the oral tradition of the time, the original melody of the song was not notated and {{over the course of}} time was forgotten.|$|E

50|$|Holocaust {{survivor}} {{and author}} Moshe Ha-Elion recalls {{that when the}} camp was liberated, the Polish inmates <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> the Polish hymn, the Greek inmates <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> the Greek hymn and the French inmates <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> La Marseillaise. After, the Jews inmates <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> Ha Tikvah.|$|R
50|$|The song {{has often}} <b>been</b> <b>sung</b> by operatically trained voices in {{professional}} stage productions. In the original Broadway production it <b>was</b> <b>sung</b> by Patricia Neway, {{in the original}} London production it <b>was</b> <b>sung</b> by Constance Shacklock, and in the original Australian production it <b>was</b> <b>sung</b> by Rosina Raisbeck.|$|R
5|$|The painting, set in {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of May 3, 1791, shows the procession of deputies from the Royal Castle (background), where the Constitution has just been adopted by the Great Sejm, to St. John's Collegiate Church (left, now an archcathedral), where a Te Deum will <b>be</b> <b>sung.</b> The procession moves down St. John's Street (ulica Świętojańska), surrounded by enthusiastic Warsaw residents and visitors. The deputies are protected by soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The post-Chalukya {{period is}} characterised by the {{popularity}} of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though secular and courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres in vogue were the shatpadi (six-line verse), the tripadi, the ragle (rhymed couplets) and the sangatya (compositions meant to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> to the accompaniment a musical instrument). Overall, Kannada writings began to change from marga ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to desi ("vernacular") and become more accessible to the common man.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, but the final version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E

5|$|Written by an {{anonymous}} hand, {{the text is}} now only {{to be found in}} the Sloane Manuscript 2593, a collection of medieval lyrics now held in the British Library, although contemporary sources suggest it was well known in its day. Originally intended to <b>be</b> <b>sung,</b> no evidence of the work's musical setting survives, and since its rediscovery and popularisation it has formed the basis for a number of modern choral and vocal works.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} poll by The Straits Times {{found that}} while many Singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant, only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word. However, all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem should continue to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> in Malay. The three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in English {{because that was the}} language most commonly used in Singapore. All the interviewees, including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics, said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|The twelve finalists {{from the}} fifth {{series of the}} UK TV talent show The X Factor {{released}} a cover of the song on October 27, 2008 for the Help for Heroes and The Royal British Legion charities. The release was backed by, and originally suggested by, The Sun newspaper. The finalists performed the single {{for the first time}} alongside Mariah Carey on October 25, 2008 during a week when only Carey's material could <b>be</b> <b>sung.</b> The single was released on download on 26 October 2008, followed by the physical release the day after.|$|E

5|$|From the 1550s, in {{the reign}} of Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542–67) and the {{minority}} of her son James VI (r. 1567–1625), cultural pursuits were limited {{by the lack of}} a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk, heavily influenced by Calvinism, also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496–1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; John Rolland (fl. 1530–75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume (c. 1556–1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse. Alexander Scott's (?1520–82/3) use of short verse designed to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> to music, opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign.|$|E
5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent to that of Jainism. Writing on secular topics was popular throughout this period. Authorship of these writings was not limited to poets and scholars alone. Significant literary contributions were made by members of the royal family, their ministers, army commanders of rank, nobility and the various subordinate rulers. In addition, a vast body of devotional folk literature was written by musical bards, mystics and saint-poets, influencing society in the empire. Writers of this period popularised use of the native metres: shatpadi (six-line verse), sangatya (compositions meant to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), and tripadi (three-line verse).|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E
5|$|Solti took up {{the musical}} {{directorship}} of Covent Garden in August 1961. The press gave him a cautious welcome, but there was some concern that under him {{there might be a}} drift away from the company's original policy of opera in English. Solti, however, was an advocate of opera in the vernacular, and he promoted the development of British and Commonwealth singers in the company, frequently casting them in his recordings and important productions in preference to overseas artists. He demonstrated his belief in vernacular opera with a triple bill in English of L'heure espagnole, Erwartung and Gianni Schicchi. As the decade went on, however, more and more productions had to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> in the original language to accommodate international stars.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E
