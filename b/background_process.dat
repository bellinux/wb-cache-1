25|$|Reduplication {{of verbal}} roots {{suggests}} a process lacking a focus or decisive goal. The following examples describe events which have no apparent end, {{in the sense}} of lacking purpose or completion. A lack of seriousness may also be implied. Similarly, reduplication can suggest a <b>background</b> <b>process</b> {{in the midst of a}} foreground activity, as shown in (5).|$|E
500|$|Specialized {{molecular}} dynamics programs, {{referred to as}} [...] "FahCores" [...] and often abbreviated [...] "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a <b>background</b> <b>process.</b> A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on GROMACS, {{one of the fastest}} and most popular {{molecular dynamics}} software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations. Although GROMACS is open-source software and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a closed-source license to help ensure data validity. Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used AMBER, CPMD, Desmond, and TINKER, but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service. Some of these cores perform explicit solvation calculations in which the surrounding solvent (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform implicit solvation methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum. The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation checkpoints so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.|$|E
2500|$|SETI@home was {{conceived}} by David Gedye along with Craig Kasnoff {{and is a}} popular volunteer distributed computing project that was launched by the University of California, Berkeley, in May 1999. It was originally funded by The Planetary Society and Paramount Pictures, and later {{by the state of}} California. The project is run by director David P. Anderson and chief scientist Dan Werthimer. Any individual can become involved with SETI research by downloading the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software program, attaching to the SETI@home project, and allowing the program to run as a <b>background</b> <b>process</b> that uses idle computer power. The SETI@home program itself runs signal analysis on a [...] "work unit" [...] of data recorded from the central 2.5MHz wide band of the SERENDIP IV instrument. After computation on the work unit is complete, the results are then automatically reported back to SETI@home servers at University of California, Berkeley. By June 28, 2009, the SETI@home project had over 180,000 active participants volunteering a total of over 290,000 computers. These computers give SETI@home an average computational power of 617 teraFLOPS. In 2004 radio source SHGb02+14a set off speculation in the media that a signal had been detected but researchers noted the frequency drifted rapidly and the detection on three SETI@home computers fell within random chance.|$|E

40|$|Assuming {{that dark}} matter is a weakly {{interacting}} massive particle (WIMP) species X {{produced in the}} early Universe as a cold thermal relic, we study the collider signal of pp or ppbar -> XXbar + jets and its distinguishability from standard-model <b>background</b> <b>processes</b> associated with jets and missing energy. We assume that the WIMP is the sole particle related to dark matter within reach of the LHC [...] a "maverick" particle [...] and that it couples to quarks through a higher dimensional contact interaction. We simulate the WIMP final-state signal XXbar + jet and dominant standard-model (SM) <b>background</b> <b>processes</b> and find that the dark-matter production process results in higher energies for the colored final state partons than do the standard-model <b>background</b> <b>processes,</b> resulting in more QCD radiation and a higher jet multiplicity. As a consequence, the detectable signature of maverick dark matter is an excess over standard-model expectations of events consisting of large missing transverse energy, together with large leading jet transverse momentum and scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the jets. Existing Tevatron data and forthcoming LHC data can constrain (or discover!) maverick dark matter. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
