40|$|This short {{paper was}} {{presented}} at a workshop on care management at an Anglo-US Study Seminar Community Care in the New World: Learning from each other, at Boston University in August 1992. As work on implementation of the Community Care White Paper 'Caring for People' (1989) has progressed, local authorities (LAs) and health authorities (HAs) have increasingly realised that care management cannot be developed in isolation from other structures, systems and procedures inherent in the new legislation, such as the purchaser-provider split, the devolution of budgetary control, and the design of information systems (see also SSI and SWSG 1991, pp 66 - 7). Furthermore some of the functions of care managers which they conduct on a micro-level for individual clients, are conducted on a macro-level further up the organisation, such as planning, purchasing, and monitoring quality. Given that the emphasis in 'Caring for People' is on putting the client first and providing a needs-lead service, the purpose of macro-level functions should be to support the care management process. The emphasis of this presentation is {{on the relationship between}} these functions at the micro- and macro-level. The paper picks out two particular issues that arise from the relationship between care management at the micro-level, {{and the rest of the}} SSD at a more macro-level: i) The development of information systems to link care management with planning, purchasing and contracting decisions made at area and HQ level; ii) The problem of reconciling micro- and macro-purchasing arrangements to match <b>bulk</b> <b>provision</b> with what is required by clients. The paper assumes that a contract culture will emerge as a result of implementation of 'Caring for People', and draws on the experience of Kent Social Services to demonstrate the points raised. The paper concludes that until effective information systems are up and running in local authorities, services will continue to be planned and purchased on the basis of inadequate top-down information and may fail to be responsive to needs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The Path Computation Element (PCE) is {{a network}} entity {{utilized}} for network path computation operations, especial-ly useful in optical networks based on wavelength division mul-tiplexing (WDM). In the PCE paradigm, the communication between a node and the PCE is {{specified by the}} Path Computa-tion Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). According to PCEP protocol, multiple LSP (Label Switched Path) requests can be bundled together before {{being sent to the}} PCE {{in order to reduce the}} control overhead. Multiple bundles received by the PCE can then be provisioned at once as a single <b>bulk.</b> Enabling <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> of LSP requests at the PCE in a concurrent manner can bring significant improvements in terms of higher network resource utilization and control plane overhead reduc-tion. However, these advantages come at a cost of a longer con-nection setup-time and of an instantaneous increase in the net-work load, which may lead to a degradation of the network per-formance, e. g. blocking probability. In this study pros and cons of <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> are explored in shared path protection (SPP) by comparing sequential and concurrent path computation strategies. An efficient meta-heuristic named GRASP_SPP_BP (Greedy Random Adoptive Search Procedure for Shared Path Protection with Bulk Provi-sioning) is proposed for concurrent provisioning of primary and shared backup path pairs. GRASP_SPP_BP minimizes the back-up resource consumption while requiring minimal path computa-tion time. The presented results demonstrate that, in a SPP net-work scenario, a significant reduction in the PCEP control over-head, network blocking probability and backup resource con-sumption can be achieved via LSP <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> at the PCE with the proposed GRASP_SPP_BP approach...|$|R
50|$|A further {{barrier to}} {{adopting}} DaaS is the legacy IT <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> {{of only the}} 'Read' element of the CRUD model (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This leads IT into neglecting the need to 'write back' into the original dataset, because this is complex to achieve. It is the need of shadow IT users to then store this changed data separately (I.E. 'siloeing') that results {{in a loss of}} organisational data integrity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{centralized}} network control and management plane, {{such as the}} one based on a path computation element (PCE), is highly beneficial in terms of resource optimization in wavelength division multiplexing optical networks. Benefits of centralized provisioning are even more evident when connection requests are provisioned in batches, i. e., they allow a better use of network resources via concurrent optimization. In this study, a dynamic <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> framework is presented with the objective of optimizing the use of network resources that also presents, as an additional benefit, the ability to yield a reduction of the control plane overhead. The rationale behind the proposed framework is based on a mechanism in which the PCE client is allowed to bundle and simultaneously send multiple labeled switch path (LSP) requests to the PCE where, in turn, several bundles can be concurrently processed together as a single bulk. From the network deployment perspective, a PCE-based network architec-ture is proposed to practically realize this approach. For dynamic <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> of optical LSP requests, a time-efficient integer linear programming (ILP) model (LSP BP ILP) is presented to minimize the request blocking, the network resource consumption, and the network congestion. In addition, a heuristic based on a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP), namely LSP BP GRASP, is also proposed as a scalable alternative. The presented results demonstrate significant advantages of the pro-posed PCE <b>bulk</b> <b>provisioning</b> framework based on concurrent optimization in terms of reduced blocking probability and control overhead when compared with conventional dynamic connection provisioning approaches processing a single connection request at a time.

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe {{political}} context {{that prompted the}} formation of district municipalities in the present form can be summarized as follows: before 1994, {{there were a few}} sporadic Regional Services Councils and Joint Services Boards responsible mainly for <b>bulk</b> service <b>provision</b> in rural areas. In many rural areas, the acute imbalances in personal wealth, physical infrastructure and the provision of services were most patent. Provinces decided which of the local government models best suited their province. Consequently, it was possible for the institutions of local government to differ from province to province and there would be a two-tier system of local councils and region-wide district councils throughout non-metropolitan South Africa. The aim of this study was two-fold. FIrst to analyze the key causes of conflict that arise within the two-tiered system. Second, to determine whether district intergovernmental forums will be able to address the key causes of conflict identifies and assist in making the relationship between district and local municipalities more co-operative.

40|$|The {{launch of}} the Expanded Public Works Programme has led to {{preferential}} use of labour-intensive construction methods over conventional methods in construction and maintenance of public infrastructure assets. This report evaluated five bulk water infrastructure projects in Madibeng Municipality where labour-intensive construction methods were used. The research found that factors which adversely affected construction progress included: inability to transfer experience and lessons learnt from one project to the next, skills and experience shortcomings, administrative and management realities, negative interventions from stakeholders and failure of the Municipality to set specific objectives and monitor project achievements with respect to intended objectives. Appropriate training and support from local communities were found to enhance success during construction. It was concluded that labour-intensive construction methods are feasible for <b>bulk</b> water <b>provision</b> projects and can generate productive significant employment provided certain basic requirements were in place. Ultimately the findings led to the compilation of lessons learnt from the projects...|$|R
60|$|It is evident, that if {{trade and}} foreign {{commerce}} {{were held in}} great honour in China, from the plenty of labourers, and the cheapness of labour, she might work up manufactures for foreign sale to an immense amount. It is equally evident that from the great <b>bulk</b> of <b>provisions</b> and the amazing extent of her inland territory she could not in return import such a quantity as would be any sensible addition to the annual stock of subsistence in the country. Her immense amount of manufactures, therefore, she would exchange, chiefly, for luxuries collected {{from all parts of}} the world. At present, it appears, that no labour whatever is spared in the production of food. The country is rather over-people in proportion to what its stock can employ, and labour is, therefore, so abundant, that no pains are taken to abridge it. The consequence of this is, probably, the greatest production of food that the soil can possibly afford, for it will be generally observed, that processes for abridging labour, though they may enable a farmer to bring a certain quantity of grain cheaper to market, tend rather to diminish than increase the whole produce; and in agriculture, therefore, may, in some respects, be considered rather as private than public advantages.|$|R

40|$|Wood pellets {{have become}} an {{important}} fuel in heat and power production, and pellet markets are currently undergoing rapid development. In this paper, the pellet markets, raw materials and supply structures are analyzed for Sweden and Finland, based on a database of the current location and production capacity of the pellet producers, complemented with existing reports and literature. In Sweden, a total of 94 pellet plants/producers were identified, producing 1. 4 Â million tonnes of pellets, while the domestic consumption was 1. 7 Â million tonnes, and about 400, 000 Â t of pellets were imported to fulfil the demand in 2007. In Finland, 24 pellet plants/producers were identified and the production was around 330, 000 Â t while the domestic consumption was 117, 000 Â t in 2007. In Finland, pellet market has been long time export oriented, whereas domestic consumption has been growing mainly in the small scale consumer sector, estimated 15, 000 households had pellet heating systems in 2008. In the future, {{the increasing number of}} pellet users will require a reliable delivery network and good equipment for <b>bulk</b> pellet deliveries. <b>Provision</b> of new raw materials and ensuring the good quality of pellets through the whole production, delivery and handling chain will be fundamental in order to increase the use of pellets and sustain the ability to compete with other fuels.

5000|$|On 16 September, a typhoon hit the Okinawa area. Late that evening, Weehawken {{tried to}} get {{underway}} and {{to take on the}} crews of Coast Guard cutters moored nearby. During the operation, she collided with several of the cutters and with buoy tender [...] (WAGL-289). After several additional collisions with the cutters and Woodbine, Weehawken began to drag anchor toward Tsuken Shima at 2330. At 0440 on 17 September, she struck a reef off Tsuken Shima. Fortunately, the typhoon began to subside, and she was towed out of shoal water later that day by [...] She suffered little damage in that scrape and resumed her duties off Tsuken Shima soon thereafter. Following three weeks of routine operations, Weehawken battled another typhoon. Early in the morning of 9 October, steadily increasing winds forced her to use her engines to relieve the strain on her anchor chains. Through the morning, the winds rose steadily to gale force and, by 1400, reached 80 kn. Weehawken fought the raging seas; but, at 1522, the chain to the mooring buoy snapped in two. While playing out the port anchor chain to 95 fathoms and making precautionary preparations to abandon ship, the minelayer collided with a net tender broadside to port. The two ships parted with no apparent damage, and Weehawkens crewmen continued their struggle to keep her headed into the wind and relieve the strain on the anchor chain. In spite of their efforts, she continued to drag anchor toward shoal water. At 1550, she collided with , but again escaped without major damage. By 1600, the winds reached 125 kn; and Weehawken sailed out of control — broadside to the wind — and dragged anchor. At 1700, she ran hard aground and took on a list. She immediately flooded compartments below to return to even keel and rested firmly on the bottom. There, she remained through the night battered by wind and sea and with her crew ready to abandon ship at a moments notice. The following morning, the winds began to slacken and the sea to abate. Between 10 and 12 October, the minelayer unloaded the <b>bulk</b> of her <b>provisions</b> and transferred the majority of her crew to USS Benson (APA-120). On 16 October, her hull began to break in two, but a skeleton crew remained on board salvaging equipment. On the 31st, a board of inspection and survey convened in Weehawken to look her over and found her hull to be a complete loss. The board recommended that she be decommissioned, stripped, and destroyed. Accordingly, Weehawken was decommissioned on 11 December 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 3 January 1946.|$|R
40|$|The South African Constitution {{ensures the}} right to {{adequate}} water, health services and a healthy environment (Government Gazette, 1996 : 1251, 1255). Associated legislation and national strategies require that water resources and water services are rendered in a sustainable manner to ensure the rights enshrined in the Constitution are realised (Trialogue, 2010 : 34; Government Gazette, 1998 (c) : 11; Department of Water Affairs (DWA), 2003 : 9). South Africa is the 30 th driest {{country in the world}} (DWA, 2013 : iii), has impounded most of its surface water resources and has utilised 40 percent of the groundwater resource with remaining groundwater water quality uncertain (DWA, 2013 : 6 - 7). Despite achieving the basic water and sanitation Millennium Development Goals approximately 2. 2 million and 4. 5 million households still require access to basic services respectively (DWA, 2013 : 28 - 29). South Africa’s ten water boards {{play a key role in}} <b>bulk</b> water service <b>provision.</b> They supply 57 percent of the countries domestic water supply (DWA, 2013 : 19) and are required to provide sustainable water services (Government Gazette, 1997 : 35). The Department of Water Affairs (Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) as of June 2014) is mandated to monitor the performance of water boards and monitors of water boards through a Share Holders Compact (SHC) (Government Gazette, 1997 : 50). The aim of the research is to achieve the following objectives: 1. Describe best practice for sustainability monitoring frameworks for water services. 2. Outline South Africa’s water services mandatory and voluntary requirements with regards to sustainability monitoring. 3. Evaluate South Africa’s current water services performance monitoring framework for water boards against findings from goals one and two. 4. Develop an improved framework for assessing South African water board’s performance in their compliance and sustainability journey. 5. Demonstrate the improved framework functionality with a sample of water boards audited performance data from the 2012 / 13 financial year. A qualitative normative theory evaluation research method was utilised to achieve first three objectives of the research. The objectives to first understand current best practice for sustainability monitoring frameworks and the mandatory requirements for water services sustainability monitoring frameworks in South Africa was achieved via an extensive literature review. The evaluation research method was used where South Africa’s current water services monitoring framework for water boards was evaluated for its adequacy to monitor sustainability compared with legislated requirements, national and international best practices (Hall et al, 2004 : 55). Data collection for the evaluation research was sourced via documentation analysis. The 2012 / 13 water board audited annual reports, relevant national water services legislation, national and global water service sustainability monitoring best practices were critically reviewed. The review yielded a “thick description” of sustainability performance monitoring framework requirements that was used to evaluate the SHC (Holliday, 2002 : 79). Despite the mandatory participation requirement for successful sustainability performance monitoring being met, the SHC was found to have inadequate aspects. It lacks an outcomes based approach, does not include environmental indicators, does not allow water board sustainability performance comparison and cannot indicate where individual water boards are on their sustainability journey. An improved sustainability performance monitoring framework for South African water boards is therefore proposed. This was developed with the assistance of an expert focus group drawn from multiple disciplines and organizations relevant to water board sustainability (Litosseliti, 2003 : 8 and Hall et al, 2004 : 51). The functionality of the framework is then demonstrated using 2012 / 13 audited performance data sourced from the annual reports of Overberg, Amatola, Rand and Umgeni Water boards. The proposed Water Services Sustainability Monitoring Framework (WSSMF) quantifies performance in terms of 10 water utility outcomes that are measured with 88 performance indicators that encompass the financial, social, environmental and governance dimensions of sustainability. The WSSMF demonstrated that the legislated intentions and best practice recommendations can be incorporated into an improved version of the SHC. Further refinement of the WSSMF is required. In depth engagement with DWS and all the water boards would promote the refinement of the indicator set, performance thresholds for indicators and indicator weighting. Further testing through a pilot project initiative would allow the WSSMF to be developed into a robust and adequate sustainability performance monitoring framework for South African water boards (Rametsteiner et al, 2011 : 64; Muga and Mihelcic, 2008 : 438; McAlphine and Birnie, 2005 : 247 and van Leeuwen et al, 2012 : 2192) ...|$|R
