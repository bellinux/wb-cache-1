2500|$|Together with Willoughby D. Miller, Newell Sill Jenkins {{developed}} a toothpaste and named it Kolynos, the first toothpaste containing disinfectants. The name's origin is from Greek Kolyo nosos (κωλύω νόσος), meaning [...] "disease prevention". Numerous attempts {{to produce the}} toothpaste by pharmacists in Europe have been uneconomic. After returning to the US, he continued experimenting with Harry Ward Foote (1875-1942), professor of chemistry at Sheffield Chemical Laboratory of Yale University. After 17 years of development of Kolynos and clinical trials Jenkins retired and transferred the production and distribution to his son Leonard A. Jenkins, who brought the first toothpaste tubes on the market on April 13, 1908. Within a few years the company expanded in North America, Latin America, Europe and the Far East. A <b>branch</b> <b>operation</b> opened in London in 1909. In 1937 Kolynos was produced in 22 countries and sold in 88 countries. Until modern times Kolynos is widespread mainly in South America and in Hungary.

40|$|High {{performance}} architectures {{have always}} {{had to deal with}} the performance-limiting impact of <b>branch</b> <b>operations.</b> Microprocessor designs are going to have to deal with this problem as well, as they move towards deeper pipelines and support for multiple instruction issue. Branch prediction schemes are often used to alleviate the negative impact of <b>branch</b> <b>operations</b> by allowing the speculative execution of instructions after an unresolved branch. Another technique is to eliminate branch instructions altogether. Predication can remove forward branch instructions by translating the instructions following the branch into predicate form. This paper analyzes a variety of existing predication models for eliminating <b>branch</b> <b>operations,</b> and the effect that this elimination has on the branch prediction schemes in existing processors, including single issue architectures with simple prediction mechanisms, to the newer multi-issue designs with correspondingly more sophisticated branch predictors.

50|$|Branching is {{one major}} culprit. For example, a program may add two numbers and branch to a {{different}} code segment if the number is bigger than a third number. In this case, even if the <b>branch</b> <b>operation</b> {{is sent to the}} second ALU for processing, it still must wait for the results from the addition. It thus runs no faster than if there was only one ALU. The most common solution for this type of problem is to use a type of branch prediction.|$|E
40|$|AbstractClassical suffix tree {{construction}} algorithms by McCreight and Ukkonen {{spend most}} of the time looking up the right branch to follow from the current node. However, not all these slow <b>branching</b> <b>operations</b> are necessary. A significant portion of them is used for implicit suffix link simulation and can be avoided by replacing the traditional top-down descent with bottom-up climbing. We describe the bottom-up approach and analyze its costs and benefits. An experimental evaluation on two standard data corpora shows that bottom-up climbing removes forty to sixty six percent of <b>branching</b> <b>operations</b> and consequently saves twenty one to thirty two percent of construction time. However, a theoretical analysis of the worst-case behavior reveals that the time complexity of the bottom-up approach is superlinear. This is remedied by a combination of both approaches that removes nearly as many <b>branching</b> <b>operations</b> as the bottom-up climb, but still runs in linear time like the top-down descent...|$|R

So, no other hint bits are needed in the operation codes of RISC-V branches. This makes more bits available in the <b>branch</b> <b>operation</b> codes. Simple, inexpensive CPUs can merely follow the default predictions and still perform well with optimizing compilers. Compilers can still perform statistical path optimization, if desired.|$|E

50|$|Much in {{the same}} way a branch {{predictor}} allows for a processor to speculate on the outcome of a <b>branch</b> <b>operation</b> without actually performing the operation, speculative multithreading allows for the processor to speculate deeper, executing entire branches of code on an additional core.

But, because the data dependencies of speculative multithreading, and the necessity to manage inter-thread dependent data, hardware implementation must be taken into consideration.|$|E
