5|$|Drogba faced {{problems}} off {{the pitch}} during {{the end of}} the season as his transfer from Marseille to Chelsea in July 2004 came under scrutiny.

5|$|During {{the time}} of the earthquake, others {{believed}} that the destruction was a result of an underground nuclear explosion. Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of instruments it carried.|$|E

5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high mountain ranges, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of stopover or feeding sites, {{or the lack of}} thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|The stamps {{were sold}} from post-offices {{across the country}} but some were also issued to postmen for sale. Sales started on 25 June 1849, however their use only became legal on 1 July. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of an {{infrastructure}} of post boxes, particularly in rural areas, letters could be given directly to the postman in person rather than delivered to post offices to be sent.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} in the atoll is sparse, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of fresh}} water.

Acadia, Pandora and Edwards Islets are forested with Heliotropium foertherianum, but Westward Islet is not.

25|$|The {{class has}} been criticised in Parliamentary {{evidence}} for: lacking a helicopter hangar (even a telescopic hangar), {{something that will}} limit utility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter deck by preventing embarkation of a helicopter for anything other than very short periods; lacking a medium calibre gun (such as 76mm); and poor value for money. It is argued that <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> features (which could have been incorporated for the price) the vessels {{will not be as}} capable in the ocean-going patrol capacity as claimed.|$|R
5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion.

In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting the fighters at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references {{in the latter part}} of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s {{the rise}} in motor traffic had put {{pressure}} on the ferry's capacity. A proposed bridge between Shooter's Hill and East Ham was rejected as it would be too obvious a target for wartime bombings, and a third vessel was introduced instead. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a fixed crossing, the Thames became a psychological barrier for those living in the East End of London, who could only use a limited number of routes to cross the river, including the Woolwich Ferry. The lack of a suitable alternative route was instrumental in creating plans for what eventually became the Dartford Crossing further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats {{at the hands of}} the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} unknown how baleen whales produce sound <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a melon and vocal cords. In a 2007 study, it was {{discovered}} that the larynx had U-shaped folds which are thought to be similar to vocal cords. They are positioned parallel to air flow, as opposed to the perpendicular vocal cords of terrestrial mammals. These may control air flow and cause vibrations. The walls of the larynx are able to contract which may generate sound with support from the arytenoid cartilages. The muscles surrounding the larynx may expel air rapidly or maintain a constant volume while diving.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{classification}} <b>of</b> Stenopelix {{is controversial}} and {{has ever been}} problematic <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> skull. Prior to the 1960s, it was often assigned to some ornithopod group. In 1974 Teresa Maryańska suggested {{it to be a}} pachycephalosaur, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest known, due to <b>the</b> apparent exclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pubis from the acetabulum, and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> strong caudal ribs. Peter Galton in 1982 showed that the [...] "pubis" [...] was actually part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acetabulum, and the so-called [...] "caudal ribs" [...] were sacral ribs. <b>The</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ischium and absence of an obturator foramen were not characteristics seen in other pachycephalosaurs.

5|$|It is {{not known}} whether Eorpwald was baptised in East Anglia, Northumbria or Kent, {{but it is very}} likely that Edwin, now the senior ruler, was present as his sponsor.

The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E

Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{together}} with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218. Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hugh's half-sister, Melisende of Lusignan, in Tripoli. During the same year, Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of Tripoli.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{positions}} to develop within the code {{was referred to as}} the kick through. The position was unique to the Sheffield game and developed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of an offside rule. The job of the man playing in the kick through position was to remain near to the opposition's goal and wait for a through ball, a tactic today called cherry picking or goal hanging. By 1871 this position had become modern-day forwards. Cover goals developed in opposition of kick throughs. Despite their name their job was to man mark the kick through.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacks</b> in {{analogic}} television signal, researches proposed High Definition Television (HDTV), a {{new approach}} to transmit the television signal with higher definition. HDTV has quite better image quality than traditional TV. The recent transition to broadband access networks allows multimedia and TV services for Internet users, so it is needed an analysis and an evaluation of HDTV compression codecs for its storage and transmission over Internet. In this paper, we will show how to create a video with HDTV properties. Then, we will choose an adequate codec for HDTV compression to measure the compression gain, the compressed file size and the time needed to compress a second of video. Key-Words:- HDTV, video compression, transmission over Internet, video measurements. ...|$|R
