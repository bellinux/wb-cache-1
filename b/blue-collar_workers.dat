5|$|In May 1968, protesting {{students}} {{occupied the}} Sorbonne {{and put up}} barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger {{was born}} the second of seven sons in the Potrero Hill area of San Francisco to German {{immigrants}} August Pflueger and Ottilie Quandt who had met in Los Angeles and married. Other Quandt relatives lived in the Noe Valley neighborhood, and, in 1904, the Pflueger family moved closer, to 1015 Guerrero Street in the Mission District, a melting pot neighborhood of <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers.</b> At age 11, Pflueger took his first job working for a picture-framing firm near his home.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen do-it-yourself handyman.|$|E

5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers,</b> eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time {{on the national scene}} was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, {{it would have made}} him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E

40|$|Since 1989, <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> {{have been}} {{permitted}} to work in Taiwanese industries. Most <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> apply for jobs in Taiwan through blue-collar foreign workers’ agencies. Because <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> {{are not familiar with}} the language and culture in Taiwan, in occupational accident education and hazard prevention, the agencies {{play an important role in}} the coordination and translation between employees and <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers.</b> The purpose of this study is to establish the agencies’ role in the occupational accidents education and hazard prevention for <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> in Taiwan. This study uses a qualitative method—grounded theory—to collect, code, and analyze the data in order to understand the agencies’ role in occupational accident education and hazard prevention for <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> in Taiwan. The results show that the duty of agencies in occupational accident education and hazard prevention includes selecting appropriate <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers,</b> communicating between employees and <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers,</b> collecting occupational safety and health information, assisting in the training of occupational safety and health, and helping <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> adapt to their lives in Taiwan. Finally, this study suggests seven important points and discusses the implementation process necessary to improve governmental policies. The government and employees should pay attention to the education/training of occupational safety and health for <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers</b> to eliminate unsafe behavior in order to protect the lives of <b>blue-collar</b> foreign <b>workers...</b>|$|R

5|$|These {{effects were}} not felt uniformly, however. For example, {{by the end}} of the Brezhnev era, <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> had higher wages than {{professional}} workers in the Soviet Union. For example, the wage of a secondary school teacher in the Soviet Union was only 150 rubles while a bus driver's wage was 230. As a whole, real wages increased from 96.5 rubles a month in 1965 to 190.1 rubles a month in 1985. A small minority benefited even more substantially. The state provided daily recreation and annual holidays for hard-working citizens. Soviet trade unions rewarded hard-working members and their families with beach vacations in Crimea and Georgia. Workers who fulfilled the monthly production quota set by the Soviet government were honored by placing their respective names on the factory's Roll of Honor. The state awarded badges for all manner of public services, and war veterans were allowed to go to the head of the shop queues. All members of the USSR Academy of Sciences were given a special badge and their own chauffeur-driven car. These awards, perks and privileges made it easier for some to find decent job placements, though they did not prevent the degeneration of Soviet society. Urbanization had led to unemployment in the Soviet agricultural sector, with most of the able workforce leaving villages for the local towns.|$|E

25|$|Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in {{manufacturing}} of aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics.

America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area <b>blue-collar</b> <b>workers</b> and thousands of downtown white-collar workers when the longtime Pittsburgh-based world headquarters moved out.
