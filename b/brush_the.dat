5|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} items of {{uncertain}} function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s and 1980s Utopia became {{well known}} for the design and {{production}} of batiks. By 1981 there were 50artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major design project supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Dean in the Lesser Antilles were spread over five island {{countries}} and included 3 fatalities. Hurricane Dean of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season {{formed in the}} Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14, 2007. The National Hurricane Center's first Forecast Advisory on the system anticipated that the Cape Verde-type hurricane would pass into the Caribbean through the Lesser Antilles. The storm moved persistently towards the small island chain, strengthening until it passed through the islands three days later on August 17 as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It went on to <b>brush</b> <b>the</b> island of Jamaica and reached Category5 strength before making landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The use of props in Noh is minimalistic and stylized. The most {{commonly}} used prop in Noh is the fan, as it is carried by all performers regardless of role. Chorus singers and musicians may carry their fan in hand when entering the stage, or carry it tucked into the obi (the sash). The fan is usually placed at the performer's side {{when he or she}} takes position, and is often not taken up again until leaving the stage. During dance sequences, the fan is typically used to represent any and all hand-held props, such as a sword, wine jug, flute, or writing <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> fan may represent various objects {{over the course of a}} single play.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted Beryl to <b>brush</b> <b>the</b> Carolinas; as such, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse. When a more northeastward track became apparent, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued about 33hours prior to moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. About 22hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole, Massachusetts westward to New Haven, Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson. In anticipation for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season. Local Red Cross chapters were opened, as well, with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist. Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm. Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage.|$|E

5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and <b>brush</b> <b>the</b> teeth of the Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed {{for over an hour}} by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E
5|$|Resuming for New South Wales in 1952–53, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in {{the last}} match before the {{beginning}} of the Test series against South Africa. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, Barnes offered to act as twelfth man to provide an opportunity for a younger player, Ray Flockton. During a drinks break {{on the second day of}} the match, he appeared on the ground in a suit and tie, (rather than 'whites') carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game. The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector Phil Ridings, officially complained to the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} food and {{economic}} development in the colony expanded white settlement to Parramatta in late 1788. Over the 1790s land grants for farms in the Parramatta area extended {{to what is now}} known as the Carlingford district, Kissing Point, North <b>Brush,</b> <b>The</b> Ponds, Field of Mars. Grants were given to Cox, Mobbs, Arndell and others.|$|E
25|$|Wetshaving {{also has}} exfoliating properties; first, {{the action of}} moving a shaving brush vigorously across the face washes the face and removes dead skin at the same time. After {{applying}} the lather with a <b>brush,</b> <b>the</b> use of a double-edged safety razor or straight razor removes dead skin simply {{by the fact that}} the aforementioned razors are dragged much closer across the skin and remove dead skin more effectively than the cartridge or electric razor.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} of Gloria Vanderbilt and Carol Matthau are encountered first, {{the two women}} gossiping about Princess Margaret, Prince Charles {{and the rest of}} the British royal family. An awkward moment then occurs when Gloria Vanderbilt has a run-in with her first husband and fails to recognize him. It is only at Mrs. Matthau's reminder that Gloria realises who he is. Both women <b>brush</b> <b>the</b> incident aside and chalk it up to ancient history.|$|E
50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} used with <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> to maintain constant {{contact with the}} commutator. As <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> downwards towards <b>the</b> commutator. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> holder, and so <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> must be replaced.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was the {{evaluation}} of the dental plaque and the influence of determined hygienic factors on gingival recession occurrence in 455 students of The Medical University of Białystok. All the subjects were examined in artificial light, with the use of the probe, mirror, and parodontometer. The distribution of stained dental deposits were estimated with the use of the plaque index according to Quigley and Hein. Moreover, the students were to fill a survey of their own project concerning hygienic habits. The results underwent statistical analysis. The dental plaque was not present in 71 people. Gingival recession was revealed in 134 out of 455 subjects. The majority of medical students brushed their teeth twice a day, using medium hard toothbrush or electric toothbrush with appropriate movements and medium strength while <b>brushing.</b> <b>The</b> frequency of <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> teeth, hardness of the toothbrush, the use of electric toothbrush, <b>the</b> movements during <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> teeth, <b>the</b> strength of <b>brushing,</b> <b>the</b> frequency of toothbrush change, the age, and sex have significant influence on the number of recession. The increase in the gingival recession in students is connected with: large pressure on <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> while toothbrushing, too frequent brushing and toothbrush change, the use of hard toothbrush and additional hygienic items, movements while <b>brushing,</b> <b>the</b> age (the number of recession elevates with the age), and sex (women showed more recession than men) ...|$|R

25|$|Lint on {{clothing}} {{is generally considered}} unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive and may damage the clothing itself. For this reason, visible lint is often removed with a lint remover or clothes <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced {{with the use of}} a fabric softener, which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces and therefore prevents the lint from sticking to the clothes.|$|E
25|$|There are sizable pygmy forest {{areas on}} the west facing slopes and more level inner {{plateaus}} of Mount Hood. Here the predominant species are Sargent cypress, various Arctostaphylos species and coyote <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> Sargent cypress were formerly misidentified as Mendocino cypress (Cupressus pygmaea), which would be far out of their native range here. The height of the pygmy forest is ten to fifteen feet (3 – 5 m) and these patches of relatively dense thickets extend for about a half to {{one and a half}} miles (one to two kilometers) in patch size.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any {{particular piece of}} paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> brush strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence {{shows up in the}} work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at a moment in time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E

25|$|The {{predecessor}} of the toothbrush is the chew stick. Chew sticks were twigs with frayed ends used to <b>brush</b> <b>the</b> teeth {{while the}} other end {{was used as a}} toothpick. The earliest chew sticks were discovered in Sumer Mesopotamia in 3500 BC, an Egyptian tomb dating from 3000 BC, and mentioned in Chinese records dating from 1600 BC. The Greeks and Romans used toothpicks to clean their teeth and toothpick like twigs have been excavated in Qin Dynasty tombs. Chew sticks remain common in Africa the rural Southern United States and in the Islamic world the use of chewing stick Miswak is considered a pious action and has been prescribed to be used before every prayer five times a day. Miswaks have been used by Muslims since 7th century.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the lack}} of colour {{contrast}} in the monochromatic aizuri-e, late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This {{led to the development}} of bokashi, a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a hake <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While aizuri-e themselves were inexpensive to print, bokashi was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as uchiwa-e. Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity.|$|E
25|$|S. balanoides {{can be the}} {{dominant}} species of rocky shores, where it grows {{in a range of}} situations, from very sheltered to very exposed. It is typically found lower on the shore than another barnacle, Chthamalus montagui, although with some overlap. S. balanoides can tolerate salinities down to 20psu, allowing it to colonise parts of estuaries. On semi-exposed shores, S. balanoides may form a patchwork with patches of seaweeds, such as Fucus serratus, and limpets; the fronds of the seaweeds <b>brush</b> <b>the</b> barnacle larvae from the rocks, allowing limpets to colonise it instead. At the southern limit of its range, including Cornwall, S. balanoides is replaced by Chthamalus montagui. Although capable of living in the sublittoral zone, S. balanoides tends to be restricted to the intertidal by predation and by competition from species such as the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Chondrus crispus.|$|E
