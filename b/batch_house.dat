Kulka {{is estimated to}} have designed and realized over 100 commercial structures throughout this period of New Zealand's industrialization; such buildings include: the Fletcher Building Head offices and Plywood factory, Tip Top Ice Cream, Bond & Bond, Dominion Industries, Portland Cement, Fisher & Paykel, Kempthorn & Prosser, Robinsons, The National Bank of New Zealand, The Bank of New Zealand, Dominion Breweries, amongst others.Henry Kulka realized over 40 fine wooden houses throughout New Zealand through his residential practice. Kulka's wooden houses were pioneering in their spatial and material resolution, and he is recognised as an [...] "apostle of modern architecture to the South Pacific."Kulka's typologies were diverse: family homes, bungalows, beach <b>houses,</b> bush <b>batches,</b> galleried <b>houses,</b> apartments, libraries, churches and monuments. These forms were realized in the Pacific Islands (Samoa, Tonga as well as Fiji) and across New Zealand. Kulka's prolific building in New Zealand continues to influence Modern Architecture and the Modern Interior in New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{preference}} chamber {{with four}} inter-connected compartments {{was designed and}} built to test the tolerance of atmospheric ammonia by laboratory mice. The preference chamber incorporated a novel tracking system using an infra-red sensor {{at each end of}} each tunnel, which monitored all journeys through the tunnels and their direction. An experiment was successfully undertaken with four batches, each of four mice. Each <b>batch</b> was <b>housed</b> in the chamber for 4 days and given the choice between ammonia concentrations of nominally 0, 25, 50 and 100 ppm after initial familiarization. The results showed that there were two motivations acting on mouse behavior. The mice made extensive use of the whole chamber once they had been trained to use the tunnels, at least 2000 movements between compartments for each group over 48 h. The mice clearly preferred to be in the upper two compartments of the top tier of the chamber rather than in the lower compartments. The mice did not exhibit a clear preference for or aversion to ammonia, which implies that their short- term tolerance of ammonia at potentially noxious concentrations may not be in their long-term interest...|$|R
50|$|The {{first batch}} of housemates that entered on Day 1 were teen housemates. 11 teens entered the house. The {{median age of}} this batch was 15 years old. An {{eviction}} was held every week where one housemate was evicted, until the seventh week, where two housemates were evicted. One housemate opted for a voluntary exit. On Day 50, the four finalists of this <b>batch</b> exited the <b>House.</b> On Day 84, one housemate from this batch crossed over to another batch of housemates. On Day 99, during It's Showtime, the four finalists were instructed {{to return to the}} House. On Day 133, after Zeus Collins was evicted, voting for the winner of this batch opened. On Day 141, Franco Rodriguez and Bailey May were named third and fourth placers, respectively. On the same day, voting for the remaining two housemates re-opened to determine the winner for this batch.|$|R
40|$|A {{fermentable}} {{non-starch polysaccharides}} (fNSP) -rich diet (sugarbeet pulp; SBP) was previously shown to reduce within-day variation in blood glucose levels and reduce stereotyped behaviour. The {{aim of the}} present experiment was to study (1) {{whether there is a}} relationship between fNSP level in a diet and behavioural indicators of satiety and indicators of glucose stability and (2) whether a mixture of fNSP-sources is as effective as SBP as fNSP-source. One hundred and eight sows were used during their first gestation and were divided over six <b>batches.</b> They were <b>housed</b> in groups of three sows in six pens. Pen and batch were blocking factors in a Latin Square design with dietary treatment as the factor under study with six distinct diets. Four treatments with different levels of dietary fNSP (11 %, 20 %, 29 % and 38 % fNSP; realised concentrations) were used for the first research question. A mixture of fNSP-rich ingredients was used. The fifth treatment had 28 % fNSP, comparable with the third treatment, but with SBP as the main fNSP-source. These two treatments were used for the second research question. The sixth treatment was similar to others but does not contribute to the aims of this paper. Sows were fed with a restricted amount of feed during 30 -min individual housing in stalls, once per day at 7 : 30 h. Behavioural indicators of satiety (self-directed behaviour, substrate-directed behaviour and inactivity) were scored on each of 3 days in weeks 10, 12 and 14, during 1 h directly after feeding and 1 h in the afternoon (8 h after feeding). Days within weeks were pooled per group. Mean glucose levels in eight blood samples and indicators of glucose stability (variance, VAR; sum of absolute differences between levels in consecutive samples, SAD) were determined on one day in these weeks. Glucose was immediately measured in a drop of blood, stress-free obtained from the ear at 1 -h intervals from 4 to 11 h after feeding time (i. e., eight samples). Results and conclusions were: (1) Self-directed behaviour (most pronounced directly after feeding), total oral behaviour, glucose SAD, glucose VAR and mean glucose level decreased and inactivity (most pronounced in the afternoon) increased with increasing fNSP level in the diet. The maximal effect of fNSP on behaviour and glucose parameters was apparently not yet reached by the diets used. Substrate-directed behaviour was not affected by fNSP level in the diet. (2) A mixture of fNSP-sources was equally effective as SBP as main fNSP-source (similar dietary fNSP level...|$|R
40|$|This study (supported by AGER, grant n. 2011 - 0280) {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} commercial genetic group (GG: Anas, Danbred, Goland and Topigs) and dietary crude protein (CP) content on several technological properties of thighs aimed to dry-cured ham production. Thighs data from 282 pigs from a feeding study that involved 3 batches of 96 pigs each were used. In each <b>batch,</b> pigs were <b>housed</b> in 8 pens balanced for GG and assigned either to conventional (CONV) or low (LP) CP diets providing 147 or 119 g/kg CP and 6. 0 or 4. 8 g/kg standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine in early (90 to 120 kg BW) and 132 or 103 g/kg CP and 4. 4 or 3. 5 g/kg SID lysine, respectively (12 pigs per pen, gilts and barrows, and 4 pens per treatment in each batch). Pigs were slaughtered when BW averaged 166 kg and carcasses were dissected. After a 24 h chilling period, thighs were dressed, subcutaneous fat thickness was measured and a trained operator scored the dressed thighs. A sample of thighs subcutaneous fat was individually collected to determine fatty acid (FA) composition and iodine number. Thighs were seasoned according to S. Daniele procedures {{and the weight of}} raw and dry-cured hams was recorded. Data were analysed according to a linear mixed model including the effects of batch, pen, diet, GG and sex and some interactions. The GG influenced the thigh dressed and seasoned weight and seasoning loss % (P< 0. 001), and affected marbling (P< 0. 001), fat cover (P< 0. 001) and lean colour (P= 0. 001). In particular ANAS, compared to Danbred, produced lighter thighs with a thicker fat cover and reduced seasoning loss. Thighs from Danbred were also more marbled and paler than those from the other GG. Subcutaneous fat of thighs from ANAS was richer in saturated FA than that of Topigs and contained a lower amount of polyunsaturated FA than that of Danbred, resulting in the lowest iodine number. Thighs from pigs fed LP showed higher fat covering thickness and score (P< 0. 05), a more saturated FA proportion and lower iodine number (P< 0. 05), and lower seasoning losses than those from CONV fed pigs, but also an increased marbling score. In conclusion, the provision of low CP and SID lysine diets seems not only economically and environmentally convenient, but it may also improve several important technological properties of raw hams. Nevertheless, the ncreased marbling score should be taken into account especially when using GG with high marbling tendency such as Dandred and Topigs...|$|R
