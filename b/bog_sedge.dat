50|$|Like all equids, kiangs are herbivores, {{feeding on}} grasses and sedges, {{especially}} Stipa, but also including other local {{plants such as}} <b>bog</b> <b>sedges,</b> true sedges, and meadow grasses. When little grass is available, such as during winter or in the more arid margins of their native habitat, they have been observed eating shrubs, herbs, and even Oxytropis roots, dug from the ground. Although they do sometimes drink from waterholes, such sources of water are rare on the Tibetan Plateau, and they likely obtain most of their water from the plants they eat, or possibly from snow in winter.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} two {{distinct}} pond areas {{separated by a}} heathy ridge and is particularly notable for the abundance of royal fern Osmunda regalis, <b>bog</b> <b>sedge</b> Carex limosa and especially for the populations of locally uncommon cranberry Vaccinium oxycoccos growing on a Sphagnum lawn {{in one of the}} ponds.|$|E
50|$|Kobresia sibirica, the Siberian <b>bog</b> <b>sedge,</b> is a {{plant species}} known from arctic and alpine tundra in Siberia, the Russian Far East, Alaska, Yukon, the Canadian Northwest Territories, Nunavut, British Columbia, Colorado (several {{counties}} in the Rockies), Utah (Duchesne County), Montana (Carbon County), and Wyoming (Park County). Some authorities have considered the North American collections as distinct species (K. macrocarpa, described from Colorado, and K. hyperborea from the Canadian Arctic), but they are more often tentatively regarded as conspecific with K. siberica pending further investigation.|$|E
50|$|In nutrient-poor to {{moderately}} nutrient-rich, acidic waterbodies, floating mats {{form out of}} peat mosses, (feathery bogmoss Sphagnum cuspidatum, {{species of}} the complex Sphagnum recurvum s.l.) or brown mosses (Scorpidium scorpioides). Furthermore, floating mats are colonised by characteristic species of the small sedges such as the <b>bog</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex limosa), (Carex rostrata), beak sedge (Rhynchospora ssp.), Rannoch-rush (Scheuchzeria palustris) and marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris). The edges of nutrient-rich waterbodies are colonised by reeds (Phragmites australis), bulrushes (Typha ssp.), hop sedge (Carex pseudocyperus) and cowbane (Circuta virosa). Floating mats are habitats for shelly amoeba such as Amphitrema sp. and lake fly larvae.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} a Y-shaped {{drainage}} system running {{from east to}} west. The two arms of the stream display a large and unusual contrast in water chemistry. Water in the northern arm is acidic, while water in the southern arm is moderately high in calcium and moderately alkaline. Immediately downstream from the confluence, water is intermediate in composition, becoming increasingly acidic as it flows downstream. The wetland surrounding the northern branch of the stream supports acid-loving wetland plants; golden bog-moss is abundant in this area. The wetland around the southern branch supports wetland plants that thrive in alkaline conditions; it is dominated by black bog-rush, which forms tussocks. Rare plants on the site include Dorset heath, and, around a series of pools, <b>bog</b> <b>sedge</b> and the rare bog orchid (Hammarbya).|$|E
50|$|Grandma Lake Wetlands State Natural Area is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area {{featuring}} the undeveloped, pristine 44-acre Grandma Lake, which {{lies in a}} depression formed during the last glacial period. The lake is ringed by a large, open sphagnum bog mat. The bog mat {{is surrounded by a}} coniferous swamp of tamarack (Larix laricina) and black spruce (Picea mariana). The bog mat supports a plant community that is considered diverse and unusual, with several rare species present, including: bog arrow-grass (Triglochin maritima), dragon's mouth orchid (Arethusa bulbosa), livid sedge (Carex livida), small-headed <b>bog</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex tenuiflora), as well as one of only a few known populations of bog rush (Juncus stygius) in the State of Wisconsin.

50|$|The plateau pika as well {{as being}} {{considered}} to be a keystone species is also considered to as a pest because of the degradation is causes to crops which causes a competition in foraging with the livestock of farmers such as yaks, sheep, and horses, which in turn affects their livelihood. The plateau pika is an herbivore that eats plants such as <b>bog</b> <b>sedge,</b> krobesia, grasses, perennial, turf. Farmers believed that a good method to manage pikas and stop them from foraging in their land was to start poisoning programs which began to cause secondary poisoning which was believed to lead to loss of biodiversity. However the attempts in poisoning the pikas did not have a long-term effect as they would repopulate within the next breeding season and would return to the same population size. A second form of management is fencing, which also did not prove to be very successful in preventing foraging by the plateau pika. It is generally agreed that a solution will need to include improving livestock management and pest control; biologists believe that a way to accomplish this would be {{to gain a better understanding}} of how populations of pikas respond to control programs so that they can change the patterns of livestock grazing. Therefore, because of their rapid growth pikas are considered to be an animal of least concern.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the nature}} reserve {{includes}} kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby.

40|$|The use {{of stable}} carbon isotope {{geochemistry}} and C/N ratios for coastal palaeoenvironmental reconstructions {{is a relatively}} new and under-researched field. This research seeks to understand the processes which govern the carbon isotope and C/N ratios of past and present vegetation communities, particularly alder carr and saltmarsh. Romney Marsh is a large, extensively studied reclaimed coastal wetland in south east England containing a 2 -metre thick peat layer that formed between c. 5500 - 1500 cal. yrs. BP. The palynological data from two mid- to late- Holocene cores, Hope Farm and Little Cheyne Court allows comparison to the ς¹³C and C/N data collected in this study. Ninety three contemporary plant samples, 25 contemporary soil samples and 234 fossil peat samples were collected and analysed for their carbon isotope and C/N ratios. The results show that contemporary alder carr woodland plant material have more negative ς¹³C (- 26 %₀ to - 32 %₀) than saltmarsh plant material (- 22. 5 %₀ to - 26 %₀). The C/N of the plant material from the sampled vegetation communities varied dependent on the type material collected. In general leaf material has lower C/N (around 20) than non leaf material (btween 15 and 80). In the fossil core, former raised <b>bog,</b> <b>sedge</b> fen, alder carr and saltmarsh communities, identified by pollen and microfossil remains, have been tested for ς¹³C and C/N. There is eveidence for post-depositional changes in the alder carr communities, with a negative shift of between 0. 7 %₀ and 2 %₀ from the contemporary soil to fossil peat. Three periods of increased higher water availability have been identified within the Little Cheyne Court core, using ς¹³C, at 4600 - 4000; 3200 to 2700,; to 2200 to 1500 cal. yrs. BP. Spectral analysis has found evidence for cycles, with periodicities of 1005 and 1675 years. The research has also provided evidence for past environmental stress on the vegetation communities, including changes in precipitation and changes in local coastal conditions, principally relative sea level...|$|E
50|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} sedge beds in Europe, {{mainly in the}} east, and across Asia. They used to breed in Great Britain up to the mid-19th century, but the western European population declined through drainage. There has been a recovery in north-western Europe in recent years, with the recolonisation of Germany and the Netherlands, and breeding suspected in Britain; an Irish record in 2012 was the first there since the 1850s. They nest in a dry location in wet <b>sedge</b> <b>bogs,</b> laying 4-8 eggs. This species is migratory, wintering in east Africa and south Asia.|$|R

Nests were in {{available}} palustrine classes without tree canopies. Only 19 % were in Sphagnum bogs, in which most nests from other areas of the Upper Peninsula have been found. Cattail (Typha latifolia) marshes, most prevalent in the managed area of the refuge, contabed 44 % of the nests, and sedge (Carex spp.) marshes accounted for 37 %. Important co-dominant plant species were leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), especially in <b>bogs</b> and <b>sedge</b> marshes, and willows (Salix ssp.

The high temporal resolution of the palaeoenvironmental study, with an average resolution of 40 years between samples, allows us to trace the landscape dynamics for the last 2000 years at a micro-regional scale. During the Roman Imperial period (ca. 1 ste 3 rd centuries AD) local agropastoral activities were moderate, whereas metallurgical activities developed in the region as attested by geochemical records. Later, during Late Antiquity and Early Medieval periods (ca. 3 rde 10 th centuries AD), agropastoral activities increased and human impact produced major changes in local mire dynamics with the replacement of birch wooded <b>bogs</b> by <b>sedge</b> communities.

40|$|We {{measured}} seasonal {{patterns of}} net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO 2 in a diverse peatland complex underlain by discontinuous permafrost in northern Manitoba, Canada, {{as part of}} the Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). Study sites spanned the full range of peatland trophic and moisture gradients found in boreal environments from bog (pH 3. 9) to rich fen (pH 7. 2). During midseason (July-August, 1996), highest rates of NEE and respiration followed the trophic sequence of bog (5. 4 to − 3. 9 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) < poor fen (6. 3 to − 6. 5 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) < intermediate fen (10. 5 to − 7. 8 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) < rich fen (14. 9 to − 8. 7 μmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1). The sequence changed during spring (May-June) and fall (September-October) when ericaceous shrub (e. g., Chamaedaphne calyculata) <b>bogs</b> and <b>sedge</b> (Carex spp.) communities in poor to intermediate fens had higher maximum CO 2 fixation rates than deciduous shrub-dominated (Salix spp. and Betula spp.) rich fens. Timing of snowmelt and differential rates of peat surface thaw in microtopographic hummocks and hollows controlled the onset of carbon uptake in spring. Maximum photosynthesis and respiration were closely correlated throughout the growing season with a ratio of approximately 1 / 3 ecosystem respiration to maximum carbon uptake at all sites across the trophic gradient. Soil temperatures above the water table and timing of surface thaw and freeze-up in the spring and fall were more important to net CO 2 exchange than deep soil warming. This close coupling of maximum CO 2 uptake and respiration to easily measurable variables, such as trophic status, peat temperature, and water table, will improve models of wetland carbon exchange. Although trophic status, aboveground net primary productivity, and surface temperatures were more important than water level in predicting respiration on a daily basis, the mean position of the water table was a good predictor (r 2 = 0. 63) of mean respiration rates across the range of plant community and moisture gradients.

The `Ōla`a Trench is a complex of craters in the remote northeastern quarter of `Ōla`a Tract in Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park. Because the feature had never been formally surveyed, an inventory of vascular plants was carried out in June and July, 2001. A large main crater, three of four small craters and a hill associated with the feature were surveyed; one of the small craters was inaccessible. Vegetation cover in the area was montane wet `ōhi`a (Metrosideros polymorpha) forest with an open canopy. Native <b>sedge</b> <b>bogs</b> were observed on the floors of craters, and native matted ferns and shrubs were the dominant vegetation on steep slopes. While the canopy and understory plants of the forest were primarily native, ground cover was disturbed by feral pigs and contained a number of alien plant species. Few individuals of highly invasive alien plant species, such as yellow Himalayan raspberry (Rubus ellipticus) and strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum), were noted in the area. The most notable native plant observed was the endangered Cyrtandra tintinnabula. A small population of this shrub occurred at three sites within the feature.
