5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies.

This makes the tapered stem a suitable option for total hip arthroplasty in congenital hip dysplasia, also in case of young patients, with a low grade of complications and an optimal implant survival rate at long-term.|$|R

5|$|The first {{accurate}} atomic clock, a caesium standard {{based on}} a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK.

5|$|Collectors {{tend to use}} the {{catalogues}} {{produced in}} their own region and language, so in the United States, Scott is used most often as evidenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Scott numbers in American stamp auction catalogues. In contrast, SG numbers are used in England and Ireland because Stanley Gibbons (a British publisher) produces the catalogue of choice in those countries. Advanced and more specialist collectors have used the David Feldman, later called MacDonnell/Feldman, and later again called MacDonnellWhyte, catalogues between 1978 and 1991, and Hibernian catalogues (1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986, 2002 and 2009 editions).|$|E

The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.|$|E

The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with bipolar disorder and dark sense of humour were major influences on his songwriting.
