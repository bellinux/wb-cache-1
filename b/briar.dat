5|$|<b>Briar</b> Creek Reservoir {{is located}} in the <b>Briar</b> Creek watershed, on East Branch <b>Briar</b> Creek. It is owned by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission and Columbia County. It was {{originally}} constructed to control floods, but most recreational activities in the watershed take place at this lake. These include fishing, picnicking, and weddings. There are also Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed. The waters of <b>Briar</b> Creek are approved trout waters and the stream is stocked with trout.|$|E
5|$|<b>Briar</b> Creek begins where Knob Mountain, Huntington Mountain, and Lee Mountain meet {{in western}} <b>Briar</b> Creek Township. It flows east {{for a short}} {{distance}} before turning south through a gap in Lee Mountain, briefly descending quite steeply. The course levels out as it leaves the mountain behind and begins flowing through a valley after a short distance. It flows under Pennsylvania Route 93, leaving the valley behind. Soon afterwards, the stream picks up the tributary West Branch <b>Briar</b> Creek and turns southeast. After some distance, it enters the community of <b>Briar</b> Creek {{and picks up the}} tributary East Branch <b>Briar</b> Creek. The stream then turns southwest and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River near French Island.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of <b>Briar</b> Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage divide between the creek's watershed and another watershed. Several points along <b>Briar</b> Creek and its tributaries have erode with ease or moderate ease. The infiltration capacity of these points is mostly moderate to high.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, two dams {{had been}} {{constructed}} on Glen Brook (a subtributary of <b>Briar</b> Creek) in <b>Briar</b> Creek Township two {{miles north of}} Berwick. In 1911, the first dam, known as Number One, had a capacity of 15 million gallons. The second dam, known as Number Two, had a capacity of 7.5 million gallons. In 1911, a third dam was under construction several hundred feet downstream of the two aforementioned dams. It was intended to have a capacity of 23.8 million gallons.|$|E

5|$|The club had {{its origins}} around 1895, with Briarcliff founder Walter W. Law's private nine-hole course on his estate, which became {{available}} to Briarcliff Lodge guests, and was {{then known as}} the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year. The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to <b>Briar</b> Hills Country Club. <b>Briar</b> Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and spaciousness. In 1936, A. W. Tillinghast redesigned the course. In 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it <b>Briar</b> Hall Golf and Country Club. The 1964 Metropolitan Open was hosted at <b>Briar</b> Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship. In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Scavino, {{social media}} {{director}} for Trump's presidential campaign began working at <b>Briar</b> Hall Country Club as a caddie in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to {{general manager of}} the club after Trump's purchase. In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the Republican primaries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed {{it to be an}} oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first <b>Briar</b> Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|Fishing Creek drains most of Columbia County {{north of}} the Susquehanna River except for an area {{in the eastern part}} of the county, which is drained by <b>Briar</b> Creek. It also drains {{southern}} Sullivan County and western Luzerne County. Minor tributaries drain small portions of Montour County and southeastern Lycoming County. The upper part of the watershed is 85 percent forest and 13 percent farmland. Near its source, the other two percent is residential; closer to Benton, the remainder is urban. The creek's drainage basin consists of a number of sub-watersheds. The largest ones are the Huntington Creek watershed, with an area of 114 square miles; the Little Fishing Creek watershed, with an area of 68.1 square miles; the Green Creek drainage basin, with an area of 36.9 square miles; and the West Branch Fishing Creek drainage basin, with an area of 32.9 square miles.|$|E
60|$|Peter felt a queer little thrill as he peeped {{out from}} under the {{friendly}} bramble-bush. Very strange and wonderful it seemed. Of course he couldn't see very far, because the Old Pasture was all overgrown with bushes and <b>briars,</b> and they made the very blackest of black shadows in the moonlight. Peter wondered what dangers might be awaiting him there, but somehow he didn't feel much afraid. No, Sir, he didn't feel much afraid. You see those <b>briars</b> looked good to him, for <b>briars</b> are always friendly to Peter and unfriendly to those who would do harm to Peter. So when he saw them, he felt almost at home.|$|R
