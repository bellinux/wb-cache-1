Toxicants such as PAHs can be genotoxic carcinogens to aquatic organisms. [...] PAHs are widely {{spread throughout the}} environment through the incomplete burning of coal, wood, or petroleum products. Although PAHs do not bioaccumulate in vertebrate tissue, many studies have confirmed that certain PAH compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, and <b>Benzofluoranthene,</b> are bioavailable and responsible for liver diseases like cancer in wild fish populations. One mechanism of action for genotoxic carcinogens includes the formation of DNA adducts. Once the PAH compound enters an organism, it becomes metabolized and available for biotransformation.|$|E

Although fullerenes have not previously been detected in the Murchison and Allende meteorites, the Allende meteorite is known to contain several well-ordered graphite particles which are remarkably similar in size and appearance to the fullerene-related structures carbon onions and nanotubes. We report that fullerenes are in fact present in trace amounts in the Allende meteorite. In addition to fullerenes, we detected many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the Allende meteorite, consistent with previous reports.

Higher mean concentrations of total cPAHs were detected in samples collected in winter (9. 62 ng/m 3) and autumn (2. 69 ng/m 3) compared to spring (1. 05 ng/m 3) and summer (0. 21 ng/m 3). The calculated BaP toxic equivalent concentrations have also reflected that the local population appears to be exposed to significantly higher cancer risk in the heating seasons.

40|$|To {{reconstruct}} {{a history}} of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution in the Gulf of Trieste, {{one of the largest}} urbanized areas in the Adriatic Sea, we analyzed three long sediment cores collected between 1996 and 1997.

The same trend was shown with separate representative pyrogenic PAHs (pyrene, <b>benzofluoranthene</b> and phenanthrene). Using Hg as a recent geochronological tracer, we observe an increasing input of PAHs {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th Century and, especially, after the Second World War coinciding with increasing industrialization and urbanization of the region.

Results showed that the total biogas production volume in the thermal pretreatment system was 4 and 5 times higher than that in the ultrasound pretreatment and in the control system, and the corresponding volatile solid removal efficiencies reached 28 %, 15 %, and 8 %. Phenanthrene, paranaphthalene, fluoranthene, <b>benzofluoranthene,</b> and benzopyrene removal rates reached 43. 3 %, 55. 5 %, 30. 6 %, 42. 9 %, and 41. 7 %, respectively, in the thermal pretreatment system, which were much higher {{than those in the}} ultrasound pretreatment and in the control system. Moreover, capillary suction time (CST) of sludge increased after pretreatment, and then reduced after 20 days of anaerobic digestion, indicating that sludge dewaterability was greatly improved after anaerobic digestion. The decrease of protein and polysaccharide in the sludge could improve sludge dewaterability during petrochemical sludge anaerobic digestion. This study suggested that thermal pretreatment might be a promising enhancement method for petrochemical sludge solubilization, thus contributing to degradation of the PAHs, biogas production, and improvement of dewaterability during petrochemical sludge anaerobic digestion...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{enabling}} {{the determination of}} 15 priority carcinogenic polyaromatic compounds (PAC) proposed by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) has been developed and applied to diesel exhaust particulates (DEP). The clean-up procedure consists of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and HPLC fractionation on silica phases followed by liquid-liquid extraction and chromatography on a polyvinylbenzene copolymer column. The method gives good recoveries for all PAC studied except dibenzo[a,j]acridine and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, for which recovery values are below 80 %. The use of GC-MS ion trap and its capacity to achieve single-ion storage enhanced {{the sensitivity of the}} method, enabling the detection of high-molecular-weight PAH in the low ng g(- 1) concentration range. Intermediate polarity GC columns, e. g. BPX- 50 or equivalent, enabled better separation, when applied to DEP analysis, than the generally used DB- 5 apolar phase. This is observed mainly for separation of isomeric compounds belonging to the <b>benzofluoranthene</b> and dibenzopyrene families. The application of this method to DEP sampled from the exhaust of a diesel engine and in confined locations such as a tunnel has shown that all PAH of the NTP list could be detected, except dibenzo[a,h]pyrene.

Four PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and benzo[k]fluoranthene, were quantified. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) were used to purify and analyze the PAH extracts, respectively. Levels of PAH found on charcoal-grilled steaks were higher than those observed in the literature. A balanced incomplete block design was used to analyze the data. There were no significant differences among the treatments in the production of the <b>benzofluoranthenes.</b> There were significant increases in production of benzo[a]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene when grill marks were applied to the UHT steak.

40|$|In this paper, we confirm {{our earlier}} {{observations}} of fullerenes (C 60 and C 70) in the Allende meteorite (Becker et al., 1994 a, 1995). Fullerene C 60 was also detected {{in two separate}} C-rich (approximately 0. 5 - 1. 0 %) dark inclusions (Heymann et al., 1987) that were hand picked from the Allende sample. The amounts of C 60 detected were approximately 5 and approximately 10 ppb, respectively, which is considerably less than what was detected in the Allende 15 / 21 sample (approximately 100 ppb; Becker et al., 1994 a, 1995). This suggests that fullerenes are heterogeneously distributed in the meteorite. In addition, we present evidence for fulleranes, (C 60 Hx), detected in separate samples by laser desorption (reflectron) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (LDMS). The LDMS spectra for the Allende extracts were remarkably similar to the spectra generated for the synthetic fullerane mixtures.

40|$|European {{legislation}} has recently established {{a list of}} 15 priority PAHs to be monitores in foodstuff. Thus, the accurate determination of these compounds has become a highly relevant issue. The {{fact that some of}} these EU PAHs differ from those typically analysed, the so-called EPA PAHs, requires the re-evaluation of the instrumental conditions, including the selection of the capillary column, for the proper determination of the new target compounds. In this study, the influence of the stationary phase and dimensions of the GC capillary column on the chromatographic resolution of the 15 EU PAHs has been investigated. Apolar (DB- 5 type) and medium polar (DB- 17 type) stationary phases with different lengths and film thickness have been evaluated for the separation of the target compounds, with special emphasis on those coelutions involving isomers such as the 3 <b>benzofluoranthene</b> isomers included in the EU PAHs. In addition, the influence of the injection technique and the column dimensions on the recovery of the high molecular mass PAHs has been studied. A programmable temperature vaporizing (PTV) injector has been used in three different splitless operational modes and the results were compared to those obtained using on-column injection. The best results were obtained when a medium polar column (DB- 17 type) with athin film thickness was used and the PTV injector was operated in its programmable temperature mode. The experimental parameters involved in the injection step were optimised by using the so-called "design of experiments". JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|E
40|$|In Hungary, the {{measurement}} of ambient PM 10 -bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations is great importance {{for a number of}} reasons related to human health, the environment and compliance with European Union legislation. However, the monitoring of PAHs associated with PM 2. 5 aerosol fraction is still incomplete. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the concentration levels of PAHs in PM 2. 5 urban aerosol fraction. PM 2. 5 and associated PAHs were monitored in November 2014 in an urban site of Győr (Northwest Hungary). The aerosol samples were collected every day for 24 -hours over two weeks with a high volume air sampler provided with a PM 2. 5 cut-off inlet. The levels of 19 PAH compounds associated with PM 2. 5 aerosol fraction were quantified by a gas chromatographic method. Polluted air quality for PM 2. 5 (> 25 g/m 3) was indicated in 50 % of the collected samples. The total PAHs concentrations ranged from 2. 1 to 37. 3 ng/m 3 with the mean value of 12. 4 ng/m 3. Indeno(123 -cd) pyrene (IND) and sum of three <b>benzofluoranthene</b> isomers were the most dominant PAH species followed by benzo(ghi) perylene and benzo(a) pyrene (BaP). Using BaP-equivalent approach on the concentration data of carcinogenic PAH species, BaP, and IND contributed the highest carcinogenic exposure equivalent (1. 50 and 0. 24 ng/m 3 on average). A selected number of concentration ratios of specific PAH compounds were calculated to evaluate the possible sources of PAH contamination. The ratios reflected that the major source of PAH compounds in the PM 2. 5 aerosol fraction of Győr during the study period was fossil fuel combustion from automobiles...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{extracts}} from three polluted {{sites of the}} river Elbe basin were fractionated using a novel on-line fractionation procedure. Resulting fractions were screened for mutagenic, aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) -mediated, transthyretin (TTR) -binding and estrogenic activities and their potency to inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) to compare toxicity patterns and identify priority fractions. Additionally, more than 200 compounds and compound classes were identified using GC-MS/MS, LC-MS/MS and HPLC-DAD methods. For all investigated endpoints major activities were found in polar fractions, which are defined here as fractions containing dominantly compounds {{with at least one}} polar functional group. Nonpolar PAH fractions contributed to mutagenic and AhR-mediated activities while inhibition of GJIC and estrogenic and TTR-binding activities were exclusively observed in the polar fractions. Known mutagens in polar fractions included nitro- and dinitro-PAHs, azaarenes and keto-PAHs, while parent and monomethylated PAHs like benzo[a]pyrene and <b>benzofluoranthenes</b> were identified in non-polar fractions. Additionally, for one sample high AhR-mediated activities were determined in one fraction characterized by PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PCNs. Estrone, 17 ß-estradiol, 9 H-Benz[de]anthracene- 7 -one, triclosan and 4 -nonylphenol were identified as possible estrogenic and TTR-binding compounds. Thus, not only nonpolar compounds like PAHs, PCBs and PCDD/Fs but also the less characterized and investigated semipolar and polar substances should be considered as potent mutagenic, estrogenic, AhR-inducing, TTR-binding and GJIC inhibiting components for future studies. Effect-directed analysis of three sediment extracts and five in vitro endpoints suggests polar compounds as dominant substances for investigated effects. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Thermal {{maturity}} parameters {{have traditionally}} focused around the peak-oil window while parameters for the late- to post-oil window {{are not well}} constrained. Previous {{studies have shown that}} 3 -ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be used to correctly predict the maturity order for sedimentary organic matter. PAHs are structurally stable molecules and, when bound within kerogen, the kinetics of thermal alteration are slowed. The utility and preservation systematics of kerogen-bound 5 -ring PAH, as measured by the 252 Da fragment ion, have not been studied in depth. These molecules have the potential to extend the sensitivity of maturity parameters into the late-oil window and beyond. Kerogen samples from five basins with a range of maturities and sedimentary environments were loaded with 5 -wt% ammonium dioxydithiomolybdate [(NH 4) 2 MoO 2 S 2] and pyrolysed using catalytic hydropyrolysis (HyPy; 0 C to 250 C at 100 C min- 1 then 250 C to 520 C at 8 C min- 1) to extract covalently-bound compounds. Extracted compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The relative order of stability of kerogen-bound 5 -ring PAH was shown to be perylene < benzo(a) pyrene < benzo(e) pyrene < <b>benzofluoranthenes.</b> The ratio of benzo(a) pyrene. benzo(e) pyrene (BaP/BeP) values range from 0. 02 to 1. 20.

Kerogen-bound perylene was found to be most sensitive to change in the peak-oil window though still present at very low abundances in the most mature kerogen suite.

Here the potential of BjF-9,10-dihydrodiol" [...] and BkF-8,9-dihydrodiol to contribute to the mutagenicity of BjF and BkF toward S. typhimurium TA 100 has been evaluated. A high-pressure liquid chromatogram of the metabolites of BjF formed in vitro is shown in figure 2. Six bands of metabolites were collected and tested for mutagenicity toward S. typhimurium TA 100 with activation. The results are summarized in Table 1. Band 3 had the highest mutagenic activity, suggesting that this band contained proximate mutagenic metabolites of benzo(y)fluoranthene (ByF). When tested separately, each of Peaks A and B of Band 3 was mutagenic (Table 1).Dihydrodiols are proximate mutagenic metabolites of BjF. BjF-9,10-dihydrodiol was mutagenic only in the presence of rat liver homogenate, indicating that its mutagenic activities resulted from conversion to dihydrodiol-epoxides, as observed with other hydrocarbons. Other metabolites may also contribute to the mutagenicity of BjF. This includes BjF-9,10-epoxide which is the likely precursor to the observed dihydrodiols, but it was not isolated or synthesized. The structure of BjF-9,10-dihydrodiol is similar to those of dihydrodiols which are proximate forms of other carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and can form dihydrodiol- epoxides with one carbon of the epoxide ring in a 3-sided [...] "bay region". The presumed ultimate mutagen derived from B(j)F9,10-dihydrodiol, 9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxy- 11,12-epoxybenzo(j)-fluoranthene would have the epoxide ring in a 4-sided, [...] "pseudo-bay region," [...] in which the additional side is derived from the 5-membered ring. Such a dihydrodiol-epoxide would not be expected to be a potent carcinogen. B(j)F-9,10-dihydrodiol is currently being bioassayed on mouse skin for carcinogenicity. It is the conversion of trans-4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzojfluoranthene to anti-4,5-dihydroxy-5,6a-epoxy-4,5,6,6a- tetrahydrobenzojfluoranthene that is principally associated with DNA adduct formation in mouse skin.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{feasibility}} of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC–ToF MS) for {{the determination of the}} 15 + 1 EU PAHs in sediments. Experimental variables affecting the injection, chromatographic separation and analytical detection of the analytes have systematically been optimised. Under finally proposed conditions, a satisfactory resolution among critical pairs/groups of PAHs, including benz[a]anthracene, cyclopenta[cd]pyrene and chrysene, the three <b>benzofluoranthene</b> isomers, indeno[1, 2, 3 -cd]pyrene from dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DahA), and DahA from dibenz[a,c]anthracene, has been achieved using DB- 5 × BPX- 50 as column combination with a run time of 1 h. The feasibility of the method for the analysis of real-life samples has been demonstrated by accurate determination of relevant target PAHs in the certified harbour sediment BCR- 535 (deviations among certified concentration values and those calculated using the proposed method lower than 3 %); and by successful application to sediments sampled from a relevant protected area located in the South of Spain. The low methodological limits of detection (LODs) obtained for most of the targeted PAHs (in the 5. 7 – 60 μg/kg range, as calculated for real samples) guarantied accurate quantification of the target compounds at the low levels expected in these types of pristine matrices. The strong retention experienced by the heaviest dibenzopyrene isomers included in the study resulted in relatively high LODs for these analytes; nevertheless, these compounds were detected at concentration levels above the corresponding LOD in some of the analysed sediments. In addition, the enhanced identification power provided by GC × GC–ToF MS for the identification of non-target analytes allowed the tentative identification of a group of polynuclear aromatic thiophenes in some of the test samples. Finally, the potential of the use of normalised bubble plots for the fast screening of the potential PAH sources has been demonstrated.

Exposures are complex, involving mixtures of particles and chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Adverse health effects associated with these agents include elevated incidences of coronary heart disease and several cancers. PAHs have been detected at fire scenes, and in the firehouse rest area and kitchen, routinely adjoining the truck bay, and where firefighters spend a major part of each shift. An academic-community partnership was developed with the Cincinnati Fire Department with the goal of understanding active firefighters' airborne and dermal PAH exposure. PAHs were measured in air and particulates, and number and mass concentrations, respectively, of submicron (0. 02 - 120) and PM 2. 5 (2. 520 diameter and less) particles during overhaul events in two firehouses and a University of Cincinnati administrative facility as a comparison location. During overhaul firefighters evaluate partially combusted materials for re-ignition after fire extinguishment and commonly remove Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). Face and neck wipes were also collected at a domestic fire scene. Overhaul air samples had higher mean concentrations of PM 2. 5 and submicron particles than those collected in the firehouse, principally in the truck bay and kitchen. Among the 17 PAHs analyzed, only naphthalene and acenaphthylene were generally detectable. Naphthalene was present in 7 out of 8 overhaul activities, in 2 out of 3 firehouse (kitchen and truck bay) samples, and in none collected from the control site. In firefighter face and neck wipes a greater number of PAHs were found, several of which have carcinogenic activity, such as <b>benzofluoranthene,</b> an agent also found in overhaul air samples. Although the concentration for naphthalene, and all other individual PAHs, was very low, the potential simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals even in small quantities in combination with high ultrafine particle exposure deserves further study.
