50|$|A <b>basin</b> <b>wrench,</b> {{sometimes}} called a sink wrench, is a plumbing tool {{that is used}} in confined spaces to turn fasteners that would be difficult or impossible to reach with a plumber wrench or other types of wrenches. For example, the threaded nuts used to secure faucets to sinks are often located in deeply recessed places {{that can only be}} accessed with a <b>basin</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>basin</b> <b>wrench</b> {{consists}} of a long shaft {{with a pair of}} asymmetrical jaws at one end and a transverse handle at the other end. The two jaws form an assembly in which the jaws are joined with a pivot pin. One of the jaws is fixed relative to the shaft, and the other is curved and spring-loaded relative to the fixed jaw so that it will automatically close and grip the fastener. When the shaft is turned in the direction that causes the curved jaw to trail the pivot pin, the jaws will increase their grip on the fastener as shaft torque increases, thereby allowing the operator to apply torque to the fastener without slippage. The transverse handle passes through a loosely fitting hole in the shaft {{so that it can be}} shifted to conform to tight spaces or to elongate it so as to increase leverage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fixed jaw}} is {{attached}} to the shaft with a pivot pin so that the entire jaw assembly can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the shaft. This permits the jaws to be rotated over the end of the shaft {{so that they can be}} [...] "flipped" [...] over, to allow the tool to be used to either tighten or loosen a fastener. Mechanical stops limit this rotation to 180° so that when the jaws assembly is resting at a stop, the jaws will be perpendicular to the shaft and thus aligned to the fastener. When the shaft is held in a vertical orientation, the jaws are automatically held against the stop by gravity. <b>Basin</b> <b>wrenches</b> are available with both fixed-length and telescopic handles.|$|R
50|$|The {{breakup of}} Gondwana {{began in the}} early Cretaceous (about 184-132 Mya). South America began to drift westward from Africa as the South Atlantic Ocean opened, {{resulting}} in complete open marine conditions by 110 Mya. During this, the Owambo Basin was reactivated as a pull-apart rift basin pulling apart from the east to the west, but received compression from the opening of the Damara Belt to its south. This created rotational seismic wrench systems across the <b>basin</b> profile. These <b>wrench</b> systems allowed for intrusions of continental igneous deposits: sills and dikes, along with pegmatites from metasomatized country rock. This intrusion of igneous material and hydrothermal activity led to heavy mineral depositions like the copper ore from the Tsumeb mine.|$|R
40|$|During the Equanaute survey (June 1992), {{fourteen}} submersible dives {{were performed}} between 4950 and 2250 m water depths across the southern {{slope of the}} Cote d'Ivoire-Ghana Marginal Ridge (CIGMR), in the eastern Equatorial Atlantic. The CIGMR, a high-standing topographic marginal ridge along the Cote d'Ivoire-Ghana transform margin, is believed to result from a complex structural evolution due to the specific wrench-related rifting between Western Equatorial Africa and Northeastern Brazil, in Early Cretaceous times. In this paper we report and discuss geological observations made during dives, and sample analyses to resolve the lithology, paleoenvironmental conditions, age and origin of the CIGMR. The data help in better characterizing the different sedimentary and tectonic regimes which successively prevailed during the CIGMR formation and assessing the thermal regime operative during the fabrication and subsequent evolution of the margin. The thick sedimentary pile exposed along the southern CIGMR slope {{is made up of}} a repetitive elastic sequence indicative of a deltaic-to-prodeltaic environment. This sedimentary pile, of Early Cretaceous age, has recorded different stages of the transform margin structural evolution. (1) Syn-to post-lithification deformations first record extensional deformations related to the rifting of the adjacent northern divergent; margin segment (the Deep Ivorian <b>Basin).</b> (2) <b>Wrench</b> tectonics has, at a later stage, produced intense fracturing and participated in local folding; chiefly detected upslope. The integrated studies of geological samples and insitu observations obtained during the Equanaute survey support models. for transform margin evolution proposed mainly from geophysicaI data...|$|R
5000|$|This {{method is}} widely used in {{provenance}} studies {{and it has the}} ability to link sandstone composition to tectonic setting. This method is described in the Dickinson and Suczek 1979 paper. Detrital framework modes of sandstone suites from different kinds of basins are a function of provenance types governed by plate tectonics. (1)Quartzose sands from continental cratons are widespread within interior basins, platform successions, miogeoclinal wedges, and opening ocean basins. (2)Arkosic sands from uplifted basement blocks are present locally in rift troughs and in <b>wrench</b> <b>basins</b> related to transform ruptures. (3)Volcaniclastic lithic sand and more complex volcano-plutonic sands derived from magmatic arcs are present in trenches, forearc basins and marginal seas. (4) Recycled orogenic sands, rich in quartz or chert plus other lithic fragments and derived from subduction complexes, collision orogens, and foreland uplifts, are present in closing ocean basins. Triangular diagrams showing framework proportions of quartz, the two feldspars, polycrystalline quartzose lithics, and unstable lithics of volcanic and sedimentary parentage successfully distinguish the key provenance types." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Proterozoic Mount Isa terrain {{records the}} effects of four periods of intraplate tectonism. The c. 1870 Ma Barramundi Orogeny was {{characterized}} by a massive felsic magmatic event, and global correlations suggest a physical link between Australia and Laurentia t this time. Thereafter, the terrain underwent an extensional history spanning 200 Ma involving repeated episodes of rifting, post-rift subsidence and associated depositional and magmatic phases. This protracted rifting history resulted in a cumulative stratigraphic thickness of up to 25 km above attenuated continental crust. Rifting was interrupted prior {{to the formation of}} ocean crust by the compressional Isan Orogeny (1590 - 1500 Ma). The Isan Orogeny was synchronous with low-pressure high-temperature metamorphism and widespread metasomatism. In the waning stages of shortening, the Mount Isa terrain evolved into a wrench system characterized by an extensive network of strike-slip faults. The current level of exposure inthis terrain provides spectacular examples of superimposed rifts, <b>basin</b> inversion, and <b>wrench</b> geometries developed at middle to upper crustal levels. The Mount Isa terrain (Figs 1 & 2) provides on...|$|R
40|$|The Betic Cordillera of {{southern}} Spain form {{the western end}} of the Alpine orogen, which during the Neogene was affected by large-scale late-orogenic extension. Extension, however, occurred within a setting of continuous slow convergence of the African and European plates. During the Neogene, shortening occurred in the External Zone of the Betic chain as a result of collision between the southern margins of Iberia and the Betic crust. Simultaneously, late-orogenic extension affected the Internal Zone of the Betics, resulting in the development of intramontane basins. Parts of the Internal Zone have subsided since the Miocene to form a large marine basin, the Alboran Sea. Seismic studies of the Alboran seafloor have revealed ubiquitous graben and half-graben structures of Miocene age. The Alboran basin and basins in the eastern Betics are currently underlain by an anomalously hot thinned continental crust. A prominent set of NE-SW trending strike-slip faults in the south-eastern part of the Betics form bounding faults along a number of late Miocene intramontane basins. This first-order characteristic invited earlier workers to interpret the intramontane <b>basins</b> as <b>wrench</b> <b>basins,</b> developed in response to wrench faulting along these faults. But recent fission-track studies in the Betic crust as well as the Miocene geology of the basins onland and in the Alboran Sea clearly indicate that extension of the Betic-Alboran domain continued well into the late Miocene. And studies of the Betic and Alboran crust led other workers relate the geological and geometrical developments of the Betic-Alboran region to orogenic collapse in response to convective removal of a thickened lithospheric root or to subduction roll-back followed by slab detachment. They interpret the late Miocene basins largely as extensional or back-arc basins. Our field studies of basins in the Betic External and Internal Zone clearly provide evidence that foreland basin development and thrusting in the External Zone continued well into the late Miocene and occurred simultaneously with extension and development of basins in the Internal Zone. The intramontane basins in the Internal Zone initiated {{at the beginning of the}} late Miocene and developed as genuinely extensional and subsiding basins in response to ~NE-SW and later ~N-S directed extension. In the late Miocene, progressively from the easternmost part of the Betics towards the southwest, extension in the basins was terminated followed by uplift. In the latest Miocene – early Pliocene NE-SW trending thrust and reverse faults developed, basins were inversed and basin sediments were folded. A number of the faults that belong to the prominent NE-SW trending fault zone initiated as normal faults during late Miocene basin development but became reactivated as oblique contraction faults in the latest Miocene – early Pliocene. In conclusion, the extending middle-upper parts of the Betic-Alboran crust were transported northward onto the Iberian foreland as inferred from late Miocene ages of thrusting and amount of shortening in the Betic External Zone. The structure of the extensional basins became modified by latest Miocene – early Pliocene large-scale reverse faulting accommodating ongoing convergence between Africa and Iberia. The development of the Betic might be related with orogenic collapse, but seem more consistent with slab-detachment...|$|R
40|$|Palaeoproterozoic {{volcanic}} formations having different geochemical {{features are}} described in the Katiola-Marabadiassa area (Central Ivory Coast). They consist of (i) metamorphic mafic rocks belonging to the greenstone belts, (ii) rhyodacites intruded into the greenstone belts and interpreted as sub-volcanic apophyses of TTG plutons, and (iii) calc-alkaline andesitic lava interbedded in the lower sedimentary pile of the Bandama Basin. The greenstone belt rocks have a magmatic signature of ocean floor tholeiites. They were generated from moderate partial melting of a fairly depleted spinel lherzolite source. The rhyodacites show the same compositions as the TTG granitoids of the belt. These TTGs generated from melting of garnet-bearing amphibolite, derived from subducted oceanic crust, but also from peridotite melting of the fertilized mantle wedge. The andesites show a common composition of active continental margin potassic calc-alkaline lavas. However, they do not constitute a volcanic belt, but belong to an intracontinental basin settled in a wrench tectonic system. They probably generated from remelting of sub-crustal metasomatised mantle. The tectono-magmatism story of the Katiola-Marabadiassa area comprises four stages. A similar evolution is found in other belt-and-basin areas in Ivory Coast. A review of lithostratigraphic and chronological data of the Birimian terrains leads us to compare the four-stage model of the Central Ivory Coast to the West-African Palaeoproterozoic evolution. The first stage corresponds to ocean crust formation, by mid-ocean ridge accretion and volcanic arc building. The second stage, partly overlapping the previous one, is convergent and lasted from oceanic crust stacking to TTG and associated greenstone belt formation. It led to a protocontinental crust accretion by docking of granitized blocks, from ca 2200 Ma to 2110 Ma. The third stage corresponds {{to the formation of}} intracontinental basins by reorganization of the granitoid-greenstone shields and of the remnant oceanic basins, between 2118 Ma and 2093 Ma. It was associated with calc-alkaline magma production. The fourth stage is characterized by transtensional stress, with the closure of the <b>basins</b> by left-lateral <b>wrenching</b> along N-S faults, and by emplacement of new potassic granitoids until 2072 Ma...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Rhine Graben (URG) is a Cainozoic rift and <b>wrench</b> <b>basin</b> about 300 km {{long and}} 30 to 40 km wide, with an Eocene to Quaternary {{sedimentary}} fill up to 3 km thick. Its complex geological history presents multiple {{opportunities for the}} use of its geopotentials, which have increasingly attracted professional and public interest. A detailed knowledge of the deep geological structure of the URG is needed to use this potential successfully and safely. The EU project GeORG (Geopotentials of the deep Upper Rhine Graben) aims at the construction of a transnational database allowing statements about deep subsurface geopotentials, e. g. deep geothermal energy, thermal and mineral waters, possibilities of CO 2 sequestration and storage of compressed air. The basis is a 3 D Gocad model parameterized with hydrogeological and geothermal properties based on the interpretation of about 5400 km of reprocessed seismic lines (3900 km in Germany and 1500 km in France), and a database of more than 2500 wells, mainly from the oil and mining industry. It {{is the first time that}} such an amount of subsurface data is gathered, studied and modelled in the URG. We put our emphasis on the inventory of the various observed structural features (e. g. main border faults, normal and strike-slip faults, salt domes), and their implication regarding the structural evolution the URG. We then focus on the predominant role of the Miocene-to-present NNE-SSW strike-slip regime in the present-day 3 D geometry of the URG. This wrench system is mainly characterized by the development of transtensional faults and negative flower structures, but also includes local transpression and inversion on older normal fault planes. The most striking result is a segmentation of the URG into several tectonic domains, separated from each other by first order transverse faults. At least some of these domain boundary faults, seen in Cenozoic rocks, seem to extend from segments of reactivated Palaeozoic basement faults. These reactivated segments, however, have been cut and offset from their prolongation outside the basin by Neogene shear zones. Thus, Neogene strike-slip deformation tends to obliterate the initial rift structure as well as its basement structural heritage and gives only a distorted view of pre-Miocene structural styles...|$|R
40|$|The Upper Rhine Graben (URG) is {{a complex}} rift and <b>wrench</b> <b>basin</b> about 300 km long, 35 to 50 km wide and filled with up to 3500 m of Eocene to Quaternary sediments. Middle to Late Eocene {{lacustrine}} and saline deposits cover an area of c. 7500 km² of the central and southern segment of the URG. Thicknesses vary from a few metres of palustrine limestone to more than 1000 m of halite-bearing marls. Lithofacies associations include bedded halite-bituminous marl alternations with salic paleosols, laminated marls with poor freshwater fauna, partly with intercalated paleosol horizons, poorly bedded marls with paleosols and sandstone beds, and palustrine limestone with pisolites and freshwater gastropods. An marginal facies belt of cyclic channelized alluvial conglomerates, sandstones and rooted overbank mudstones is typically only a few kilometres wide and rapidly replaced by block conglomerates of steeply sloped fan-delta deposits close to the rift margins. There is a first-order shift of facies boundaries in the Eocene succession, indicating rapid transgressive drowning of the internal parts of the basin in the Lutetian and successive progradation of fluviolacustrine environments during the Priabonian. Paleosol facies and fossil content do not show {{significant changes in the}} overall climate regime over this transgressive-regressive cycle, spanning almost 10 Ma. Thus, we attribute this first-order cycle trend mainly to early syn-rift tectonics creating accommodation space and its subsequent autocyclic fill-up. In any of these facies there is evidence for high-frequency cyclic variations in lake level and salinity, e. g. by alternations of halite deposits and fossiliferous freshwater marls, recurring pedogenic overprint on laminated hypolimnion deposits, and subaqueous green clay intercalations within successions of palustrine carbonates. They suggest rapid lake level oscillations between deep freshwater lake phases and intense droughts, reducing the open-water surface to a small and shallow salt lake in the deepest parts of the Graben. The time scale of these oscillations is poorly constrained. According to the maturity of the paleosols, time intervals seem to represent cycles well within the Milankovich frequency band, i. e., 10 e 4 to 10 e 5 yr, and thus suggest a climatic control on these small-scale cycles...|$|R
40|$|The Jackson Mountains {{are located}} in the western Great Basin in Humboldt County, {{northwest}} Nevada. The range contains a late Paleozoic to Mesozoic depositional sequence. This sequence records sedimentation, volcanism and deformation in a back-arc setting. The Mississippian to late Early Permian McGill Canyon Formation was deposited in basinal to slope to distal shelf environments, dominated by hemipelagic and turbiditic facies. In the Permian there was an volcanic arc andesite component, and a nearby contemporaneous carbonate platform shed olistostromes into the unit. The McGill Canyon was laid down in an area between the McCloud arc and the Havallah back-arc basin. The late Middle Triassic to middle Norian Bliss Canyon Formation was laid down in basinal to fore-reef to carbonate platform to lagoonal to terrigenous littoral environments. Both of these formations are of flap sequences deposited on an east-facing, back-arc margin. The Bliss Canyon represents the western margin of the Early Mesozoic marine basin of the western Great Basin. From the late Norian to the Bathonian, several stages of subearial volcanism and alluvial epiclastic sedimentation laid down the Happy Creek Formation, a thick arc andesite volcanic pile. The Happy Creek is part of the Early Mesozoic Cordilleran magmatic arc province. In the Bathonian, this volcanic pile was cut by a conjugate sinistral high-angle wrench fault system as volcanism waned. During the Callovian, sediments of the King Lear Formation filled in and then overlapped the <b>wrench</b> <b>basins.</b> These sediments were derived from the east, where a west-vergent thrust system was active. This phase of thrusting ceased by the Oxfordian. Arc-related silicic volcanism and alluvial to fluvial sedimentation within the King Tear continued into the Aptian, when the thrusts were reactivated during a second phase. Both phases of thrusting verged both east and west. Stocks, dikes and sills of the Early Mesozoic Intrusive suite are comagmatic with the volcanism in the Happy Creek and King Lear, and intrude the sedimentary units. This suite both plugs and is truncated by the wrench faults and the first phase of thrusting, but is cut by the second phase. The Jackson Mountains are part of the Black Rock terrane in northwest Nevada. Within this terrane, the rocks share a common tectonic history and stratigraphy distinct from the neighboring terranes, and are separated from them by Mesozoic thrust and strike-slip faults...|$|R
