25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E
500|$|The <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was {{armoured}} and {{the pilot}} was also protected by a bulletproof windscreen. The entire canopy was also redesigned to accommodate the new windscreen. The landing gear could not be housed in the thin wings so it was redesigned to retract into the fuselage. Low and high wing loading wing versions were considered, but the low wing loading [...] wings were chosen for the prototype.|$|E
500|$|Although Bacon revered Velázquez's portrait, {{he did not}} try to {{reproduce}} the earlier painting. In interviews, he said that he saw flaws in Velázquez's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as, according to Schmied, [...] "obsolete and decayed". Bacon's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again, thereby making a sly comment on the treatment of royalty in both Old Master and contemporary painting. Yet Velázquez's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting. The sitter's pose closely echoes the original, as does the violet and white colouring of his cope, which is built up through broad, thick, brush-strokes. The influence can be further seen in the gold-coloured ornaments on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> that extend {{on both sides of the}} figure. Art historian Armin Zweite describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to Velázquez, while at the same time deconstructs his painting.|$|E
50|$|Renovation on the Auditorium {{began in}} 1983 and was {{finished}} in 1984. Donors {{to the project}} had their names inscribed on brass plaques, which were affixed to <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> colours <b>of</b> Flight Deck {{match in}} with <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movie Top Gun. <b>The</b> {{supports}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track are coloured grey, {{and the track}} itself is coloured with a much lighter shade <b>of</b> grey. <b>The</b> trains on Flight Deck are coloured mainly red, but also have a bit <b>of</b> white on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> <b>The</b> station for Flight Deck is coloured all grey.|$|R
50|$|In economy class, fabric-coated {{seats are}} {{arranged}} in 2+2 with audio system.

500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45. His report {{of the crime scene}} described [...] "the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting against the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> and the left thigh running {{along the edge of the}} seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E

It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.|$|E
50|$|The larger A330 aircraft, {{operated}} between 2002 and 2011 {{and used}} mainly on longer flights to London Heathrow, Paris and Amsterdam, but also occasionally to Manchester, Athens and Zurich, had individual screens for each passenger, mounted on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats,</b> offering many more options in {{video and audio}} entertainment.|$|R
5000|$|Volpe {{conceived}} and developed [...] "Met Titles," [...] which were introduced during the 1995-96 season opening night performance of Otello. This system provides individual title screens on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> for those members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience {{who wish to}} utilize them, but with little distraction {{for those who do}} not.|$|R

2500|$|Until then, signs {{separating}} the races were carried on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in streetcars and buses. [...] These signs could be moved forward or {{back in the}} vehicle as passenger loads changed during the operating day. [...] Under court order, the signs were simply removed, and passengers were allowed to sit wherever they pleased.|$|R

50|$|In 1999 {{the wooden}} chairs were {{replaced}} with plush new theater seating. A {{memorial to the}} original chairs is on <b>the</b> grounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Continuing a tradition from 1932, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chairs commemorate Colorado pioneers, notable performers, and opera supporters. Illustrious names like Horace Tabor, Buffalo Bill Cody, Beverly Sills, and Lillian Gish are carved on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{first shot}} cracked the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> within the two-inch {{space between the}} {{shoulders}} of Littlefield and Miss Derwent. The next went through the dashboard and Littlefield's trouser leg.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> {{as if he were}} {{addressing}} himself to that; and softly played upon it with his hands, as if he were striking chords upon a dumb piano.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is nice," [...] said Jeff, letting himself rest {{against the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> He {{stretched}} {{his left arm}} along the top, and presently it dropped and folded itself about the waist of the girl.|$|E

50|$|Another benefit {{comes when}} <b>the</b> heavy mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine is located close to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> It {{makes it easier}} for the {{suspension}} to absorb <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> bumps so <b>the</b> riders feel a smoother ride. But in sports cars the engine position is once again used to increase performance and the potentially smoother ride is usually more than offset by stiffer shock absorbers.|$|R

6000|$|He {{turned his}} head and looked up over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> at the great hotels above him, full of softly shaded lights and the glow and colour and stir of feasting. Might his gift to mankind mean simply more of that? [...] .|$|E
60|$|Lydie sank on to {{the rough}} bench, leaning well back and resting {{her head against the}} hard, uneven <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> Her eyes gazed {{straight}} upwards to a patch of vivid blue sky, almost crude and artificial-looking above the canopy of the beeches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I said, [...] "how are you?" [...] He {{turned in}} surprise, and thrust his big, bony {{hand across the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] "Come and sit here." [...] He came. [...] "Do you ever get back to Cambridge in these days?" [...] I asked cordially.|$|E

60|$|In <b>the</b> wide space <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> a great {{throng of}} young people were promenading to the left, round and round the massive pillars, in leisurely {{rustling}} swing, the men mainly in dress suits, the ladies in soft luminous colors; the heavy carpet beneath their feet gave out no sound, and only <b>the</b> throb <b>of</b> laughter, <b>the</b> murmur <b>of</b> speech and <b>the</b> soft whisper <b>of</b> drapery was to be heard.|$|R
50|$|Racial {{segregation}} on streetcars {{and buses}} in New Orleans was finally ended peacefully in 1958. Until then, signs separating the races were carried on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats</b> in streetcars and buses. These signs could be moved forward or {{back in the}} vehicle as passenger loads changed during the operating day. Under court order, the signs were simply removed, and passengers were allowed to sit wherever they pleased.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he ignored}} Mr. Boltwood. His {{eyes focused on}} Claire's face. To steady himself on the running-board he had placed his left hand {{on the side of}} the car, his right on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> That right hand slid behind her. She could feel its warmth on her back.|$|E
60|$|The Speaker listened patiently, {{one long}} finger against his cheek. The clerks bowed over the papers. The honourable Member's two colleagues listened like men under an anæsthetic, each sideways, each {{with his arm}} over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> Across the House one Member was furtively writing a letter and three others were {{whispering}} together.|$|E
60|$|Fell a step {{upon the}} patch behind them {{crunching}} the gravel. Captain Tremayne, his arm still along the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seat,</b> and seeming to envelop her ladyship, {{looked over her}} shoulder. A tall figure was advancing briskly. He recognised it even in the gloom by its height and gait and swing for O'Moy's.|$|E
5000|$|... {{blood on}} <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driver's <b>seat,</b> where Byrd was {{crouching}} {{when the police}} pulled the van over; ...|$|R
2500|$|... 1981: First cab {{regulation}} {{requirement for}} metal to cover <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>seat.</b> (violation <b>of</b> Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard $201). Cost: approx. $100.00. This requirement was implemented {{in order to}} address the concerns voiced by some cab drivers that <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>seat</b> was vulnerable to knife penetration. The BPDHD became silently apoplectic when asked what might they say if an assailant stabbed the bullet deflector part and or shot at the knife resistant part.|$|R
60|$|In {{some way}} {{she found herself}} {{a few moments later}} walking out through the iron gate into <b>the</b> throng <b>of</b> promenaders <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>seats.</b> It was <b>the</b> most splendid moment of her life. She forgot her fear <b>of</b> Mason in <b>the</b> {{excitement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment. She walked with hands clenched tightly and head lifted. The look on her face, and the burning color in her face made scores of people turn to look at her.|$|R
