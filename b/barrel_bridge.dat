50|$|Although today its use is {{far more}} restricted, {{in the past the}} size and {{strength}} of kauri timber made it a popular wood for construction and ship building, particularly for masts of sailing ships because of its parallel grain and the absence of branches for much of its height. Kauri is also a superb timber for building the hulls and decks of boats because of its resistance to rot. Kauri crown and stump wood was much appreciated for its beauty, and was sought after for ornamental wood panelling as well as high-end furniture. Although not as highly prized, the light colour of kauri trunk wood made it also well-suited for more utilitarian furniture construction, as well as for use in the fabrication of cisterns, <b>barrels,</b> <b>bridges</b> construction material, fences, moulds for metal forges, large rollers for the textile industry, railway sleepers and braces for mines and tunnels.|$|R

40|$|Some {{different}} {{procedures for}} the evaluation of the non-linear behavior of masonry arch bridges are here proposed. In particular, the Venice trans lagoon masonry arch bridge is numerically analyzed by means of several 3 D FE numerical strategies. The three dimensional behavior of the structure when subjected to train loads and pile foundation settlement is investigated. Focus is also posed to the stabilizing role played by the backfill. Both a non-commercial code and a standard commercial FE software are utilized. The non-commercial code properly takes into account for the orthotropic behavior of the barrel vaults and the stone arches, and allows performing non-linear static and limit analyses on complex 3 D structures. Within the noncommercial FE approach, each material of the <b>bridge</b> (<b>barrel</b> vault, external stone arches, spandrels, piers, backfill) is suitably modeled using rigid parallelepiped elements and quadrilateral interfaces exhibiting an orthotropic constitutive law with either softening or rigid-plastic behavior in the non-linear and limit analysis version respectively. In both FE codes, mechanical properties of each material of the <b>bridge</b> (<b>barrel</b> vault, external stone arches, spandrels, piers, backfill) are modeled starting from suitable homogenization procedures in the elastic range (commercial software) and also beyond the linear limit (noncommercial FEM). The bridge is studied under service loads and up to failure for the passage of a standard train on either a single or both tracks. In the analyses, the stabilizing role played by the backfill, the strength increase obtained with stiff lateral stone arches on the barrel vault and the 3 D effects induced by both load configurations are discussed. Results obtained with the incremental non-linear procedures are always compared with limit analysis predictions of collapse loads and failure mechanisms. Finally a uniform foundation settlement of one of the piles is simulated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{sensitivity}} of the structural behaviour of masonry arch bridges to the presence of external stone arch rings. European railways networks include more than one hundred thousand masonry arch bridges, which belong to two typologies: (i) the arch ring may be made in stone voussoirs and the arch barrel in brickwork masonry or otherwise (ii) the whole arch barrel may be made of brickwork masonry. A comparison between these two different structural forms is here proposed. The study, reported in this paper, considers the historical masonry arch bridge that connects Venice with the mainland, which belongs to the second typology. Two finite element models of the bridge have been prepared: The former representing the actual configuration of the bridge and the latter assuming the presence of two external stone arch rings. The arch <b>barrel</b> of the <b>bridge</b> has been modelled by means of a homogenization procedure, as well as the hypothetic configuration with the external stone arch rings. A linear analysis with a multi-scale approach has been carried out to investigate the behaviour of bridge under service loads. The more consistent conclusion of this research is that the presence of external stone arch rings may influence the structural behaviour and the load bearing capacity of masonry arch bridges, improving the performance of the bridge...|$|R
60|$|We {{shook off}} our wrappings {{and entered the}} long lamp-lit hall, partly dazed by the sudden glare and warmth after the intense cold. It {{certainly}} was different from anything I had seen at home, for here in place of paint and gilding the decoration was {{in harmony with the}} country, bizarre and bountiful, with a beauty that was distinctly its own. Few oat-heads grown from English furrows might compare with the pale golden tassels that drooped in graceful festoons from the wall, while among the ruddier wheat-ears and bearded barley, antelope heads peeped out beside the great horns of caribou which the owner of Lone Hollow had shot in the muskegs of the north. Rifles and bright double-bitted axes of much the same pattern as those with which our forbears hewed through Norman mail caught the light of the polished brass lamps and flashed upon the wainscot, while even an odd cross-cut saw had been skillfully impressed into the scheme of ornamentation. But there was nothing pinchbeck or tawdry about them. Whirled high by sinewy hands, or clenched in hard brown fingers while a steady eye stared down the <b>barrel,</b> that a <b>bridge</b> might span a ravine where no bridge had been, or venison help to cut down the grocery bill and leave the more for the breaking of virgin soil, that steel had played its part in the opening up of a wide country. Yet, the suggestion of strict utility even enhanced its effectiveness, and I remembered with a smile the trophies of weapons stamped out by the gross in Birmingham which I had seen adorning our suburban villas at home.|$|R
40|$|Masonry arch bridges {{still play}} an {{important}} role in the transportation infrastructure today in the United Kingdom. Previous research has mainly focused on the load carrying capacity in the span direction. The three dimensional behaviour is often investigated by simplifying into two dimensions with modified arch parameters but these simplified analyses cannot represent all aspects of behaviour. Spandrel wall failure in some railway masonry arch bridges has raised concerns recently, and this is one aspect which cannot be modelled in two dimensions. This thesis presents a research which attempts to model the interaction behaviour between arch, backfill and spandrel wall with the aim of representing the three dimensional nature of real bridges. It mainly focuses on the spandrel wall defects under increasing load, including crack development across the wall and longitudinal cracks in the arch barrel underneath spandrel wall. Experimental results from the laboratory tests on engineering blue brick and a hydraulic premixed mortar as well as brickwork masonry specimens are presented. Numerical analysis was initially performed on these brickwork masonry specimens for validation. Three dimensional FE models were proposed for both small and large scale bridges. The general behaviour of the small scale bridge under rolling load and large scale bridge under increasing load were studied. Reasonable agreement between the FE analyses and experimental results from previous literature was obtained, indicating the model validated for small masonry specimens could be scaled up to full-scale bridges. A series of computer models were constructed to investigate the relationship between a range of geometric and material parameters and the lateral behaviour of arch bridges. The backfill depth and spandrel wall thickness have greatest impact on both bridge strength and lateral behaviour. The fill properties also have an importance influence on the load carrying capacity. This provides an indication of which bridge should be more closely monitored for spandrel wall defects. Separate FE models was constructed to simulate existing longitudinal cracks found in the arch <b>barrel</b> for old <b>bridges</b> and the influence of strengthening of spandrel wall with tie bars. The general behaviour under a concentrated load is studied and discussed. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to effectively model the three dimension behaviour of masonry arch bridges and in particular, spandrel wall failures...|$|R
