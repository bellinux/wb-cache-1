Eyeless white hamsters are more correctly called Anophthalmic whites and can survive well in spite of this. Hamsters don't rely on their eyesight as much as other mammals. They live below ground during the day and are active at twilight and near dawn so it doesn't affect them much. The hamster relies heavily on scent and the detection of vibrations, as well as sound to some extent. Despite the fact Hamsters can live easily with this mutation, it is a mutation that should never be produced.|$|R
