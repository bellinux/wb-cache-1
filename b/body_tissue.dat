5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of <b>body</b> <b>tissue,</b> done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Body</b> <b>tissue</b> {{samples from}} Eurasian sparrowhawks are still {{analysed}} {{as part of}} the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Eurasian sparrowhawks were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there was not a significant or consistent decline in residues between 2000–2005.|$|E
5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets {{of muscles}} {{on either side}} of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} Lepidoptera {{sequester}} or manufacture toxins which {{are stored in}} their <b>body</b> <b>tissue,</b> rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the monarch butterfly in the Americas and Atrophaneura species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as aposematism.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 micrometers in diameter.|$|E

25|$|In {{any part}} of the world that uses organophosphates, C. megacephala could prove to be beneficial. Organophosphate {{compounds}} are used in agriculture and are highly toxic. Organophosphate poisoning often causes death, and in many cases, by evaluating the <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> and fluids, the toxin can be identified as the source of the poisoning. However, it is somewhat difficult to evaluate the <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> in a body that is exceedingly decomposed. Nevertheless, a medical examiner in Hawaii worked on a case in which poisoning by malathion, an organophosphate insecticide, was thought to be the cause of death. The victim’s stomach contents and body fat were examined and found to have contained malathion. The fly larvae of Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya rufifacies were also present at the scene on the body and were tested for malathion. Both of these species did contain malathion, but there had been no previous record of organophosphates in their larvae. Studying larvae from decomposed remains may provide an effective method of determining the presence of these toxins in a body that is extremely decayed.|$|E

25|$|After {{being carried}} in blood to a <b>body</b> <b>tissue</b> {{in need of}} oxygen, O2 is handed-off from the heme group to monooxygenase, an enzyme that also has an active site with an atom of iron. Monooxygenase uses oxygen to {{catalyze}} many oxidation reactions in the body. Carbon dioxide, a waste product, is released from the cell and into the blood, where it combines with bicarbonate and hemoglobin for transport to the lungs. Blood circulates back to the lungs and the process repeats.|$|E

In the absence of some key metabolic enzymes, the products of intermediary metabolism accumulate. They are either eliminated through the urine and body fluids or are deposited in some <b>body</b> <b>tissue,</b> such as bone and teeth.

25|$|For {{statistical}} purposes, {{injuries are}} classified as either intentional such as suicide, or unintentional, such as a motor vehicle collision.

In the United States, most deaths caused by penetrating trauma occur in urban areas and 80% of these deaths are caused by firearms. Blast injury is a complex cause of trauma because it commonly includes both blunt and penetrating trauma, and also may {{be accompanied by a}} burn injury. Trauma also may be associated with a particular activity, such as an occupational or sports injury.|$|E
