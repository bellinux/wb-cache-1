5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, submitting to Augustine would have been seen as submitting to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E
5|$|As {{the format}} of Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, who played lead actor Tony and understudy Jim respectively, the episode starred Lyndsey Marshal as Laura, Julia Davis as Felicity, Rosie Cavaliero as Kirstie, Roger Sloman as Bill, Di Botcher as Jean, and Richard Cordery as Nick. In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff.|$|E
50|$|HIV/AIDS stigma is {{widespread}} in South Africa: a 2002 national survey revealed that 26% of respondents <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> share a meal {{with a person}} living with AIDS, 18% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> sleep {{in the same room}} as with someone with AIDS, and 6% <b>were</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> talk to a person with AIDS. AIDS-related stigma is most severe among township residents in South Africa because they lack access to reliable information about the disease. Many South Africans in townships wrongly believe that HIV is transmitted through proximity to HIV-positive individuals, which leads them to claim that people with AIDS should be socially ostracized.|$|R

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{himself has}} given {{only a few}} facts and hints about events {{of his life in}} various works. Till late nineteenth century, the two widely known ancient sources on Tulsidas' life were the Bhaktamal {{composed}} by Nabhadas between 1583 and 1639, and a commentary on Bhaktamal titled Bhaktirasbodhini composed by Priyadas in 1712. Nabhadas was a contemporary of Tulsidas and wrote a six-line stanza on Tulsidas describing him as an incarnation of Valmiki. Priyadas' work was composed around a hundred years after the death of Tulsidas and had eleven additional stanzas, describing seven miracles or spiritual experiences from the life of Tulsidas. During the 1920s, two more ancient biographies of Tulsidas were published based on old manuscripts – the Mula Gosain Charit composed by Veni Madhav Das in 1630 and the Gosain Charit composed by Dasanidas (also known as Bhavanidas) around 1770. Veni Madhav Das was a disciple and contemporary of Tulsidas and his work gave a new date for Tulsidas' birth. The work by Bhavanidas presented more narratives in greater detail as compared to the work by Priyadas. In the 1950s a fifth ancient account was published based on an old manuscript, the Gautam Chandrika composed by Krishnadatta Misra of Varanasi in 1624. Krishnadatta Misra's father was a close companion of Tulsidas. The accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars, whereas some other scholars have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> dismiss them. Together, these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of Tulsidas are based.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 15thcentury ecclesiastic estates {{comprised}} 13.5% of {{the lands}} within the Kingdom of Hungary. Despite the Church's vast land holdings, the nobility seems to have <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> send their sons to the clergy, consequently ecclesiastic career was open practically everyone. For instance, the three Primates of Hungary between 1497 and 1526, Tamás Bakócz, György Szatmári, and László Szalkai were all commoners.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{another factor}} in the {{reconsideration}} of local Chinese troops was the changing mood of the local peasantry. Where before they had <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> fight for Manchu primacy, they were now constantly threatened {{and in some cases}} occupied by Taiping forces that were, despite their “heavenly” origin, ruthless in their treatment of local populations. Indeed, in many cases informal militias were formed to drive Taiping forces out, and conduct guerilla operations.|$|E

In February 2008, Juraj Liška, SDKÚ-DS's deputy leader, openly asked Dzurinda to resign as the party leader due to the low party polls and the arguably undemocratic style of leadership. The members of the party praesidium denied Mr. Liška's accusations and since the praesidium assembly, Mr. Liška has <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> speak out on the inner affairs of the party. This affair led to the open protests against Mr. Dzurinda from party members from Bratislava.

These governments were responsible {{for some of the}} province's most progressive social legislation (including the Ontario Code of Human Rights), the creation of most of Ontario's welfare state and social programs, the creation of many Crown Corporations, and strong economic growth. Though the Conservatives were reduced to a minority government in 1975 and 1977, they stayed in power as they moved {{to the left of the}} rural-based Liberals. In addition, the Liberal and NDP opposition parties had <b>been</b> <b>unwilling</b> <b>to</b> cooperate. The Conservatives' were returned with a majority government in 1981.|$|E
