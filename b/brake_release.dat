25|$|The 1976 {{model year}} saw no major {{changes to the}} Torino line-up. The Gran Torino Sport was discontinued, and so the Torino {{consisted}} of 9 separate models; 2- and 4-door versions of the Torino, Gran Torino, and Gran Torino Brougham, along with three station wagon models. New options for the 1976 model year included a power trunk release and an automatic parking <b>brake</b> <b>release.</b> Gran Torino 2-doors could now be ordered with the center console when optional bucket seats were specified; previously the console was only available on Sport models. In addition, opera windows and landau roofs were now available options for all 2-door models. There were no styling changes made to Torino for 1976.|$|E
500|$|Following {{trials that}} lasted over a year, No. 36001 {{was shown to}} have several flaws, {{including}} heavy coal and water consumption, mechanical unreliability, untenable working conditions for both fireman and driver, loss of steam through the cylinder rings and uneven weight distribution on the bogies. After renewing the cylinder assembly, it was tested around Brighton and Eastleigh using an LNER Dynamometer car, where good running was experienced at high costs in fuel and {{effort on the part}} of the fireman. The Leader was tested against the performance of a U class control locomotive and indicated that the <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> was too slow in service for use on tight schedules despite the brake application being noted as the best used on a Bulleid design.|$|E
500|$|In {{the twelve}} seconds between brake {{application}} and <b>brake</b> <b>release,</b> the train {{passed over the}} fixed AWS magnet for signal SN43, which was displaying a single yellow (caution) aspect. This warning was cancelled in time. The train then passed over the TPWS+ overspeed sensor for signal SN45, which was displaying a red (danger) aspect. As the train was travelling more slowly than the trigger speed, no brake action was demanded from the train. The train then passed over the second TPWS overspeed sensor for signal SN45, this time at , which was {{in excess of the}} [...] trigger speed. Consequently, a TPWS intervention occurred, but as the AWS isolating cock was open the brakes did not apply. When the driver saw that signal SN45 was at danger, he applied the brakes on the train. Due to there being insufficient distance to stop, the train overran the signal by [...] and came to a stand across Wootton Basset Junction.|$|E

2500|$|At 16:10:43 (133 seconds), the Trident {{entered a}} deep stall. It was {{descending}} through , its nose was pitched up by 31°, and its airspeed had fallen below the minimum indication of [...] At 16:10:47 (137 seconds) and , the Trident was descending at [...] Impact {{with the ground}} came at 16:11, precisely 150 seconds after <b>brake</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The DC-8 {{began its}} {{take-off}} roll on runway 22 from {{the intersection of}} runway 13 at 10:15 UTC (06:45 NST). It rotated near taxiway A, 51 seconds after <b>brake</b> <b>release,</b> at an airspeed of about 167 KIAS. Witnesses reported the aircraft showed difficulty gaining altitude after rotation. Airborne, the airspeed reached 172 KIAS and began to decrease again, causing the DC-8 to descend. After crossing the Trans-Canada Highway, located about [...] from the departure end of runway 22, at a very low altitude, the aircraft's pitch increased and it continued to descend.|$|E
2500|$|... 1976 {{brought about}} a few changes on the Electra. The {{front-end}} was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and turn signal lights underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights. [...] There were also some minor interior differences. The <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> handle was black instead of chrome, the seat material was slightly different, on the limited, notch-back diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a [...] "corduroy" [...] form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance. [...] The engine air cleaner {{did not have a}} [...] "cold-air" [...] ram air intake hose like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about {{the same size as the}} 1975 at , making them among the biggest Buicks ever.|$|E
5000|$|Yo La Tengo {{covered the}} song on their 1990 album, Fakebook. It was also covered by The Mavericks, whose version peaked at number 42 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1999. Turin <b>Brakes</b> <b>released</b> their cover version as a B-side to their single, [...] "Something In My Eye".|$|R
50|$|In 1928, a Hupmobile sedan {{parked on}} Brunson Hill went amok. The <b>brake</b> <b>released</b> {{and the car}} plunged {{down the hill and}} through a {{basement}} window in the library. No one was in the car or the library at the time, but the car was found in a vertical position, rear end up, on the Children's Room floor.|$|R
50|$|NapsterLive, or The Napster Sessions, is a live EP by the British band Turin <b>Brakes.</b> <b>Released</b> as a {{companion}} to their album Jackinabox, it was a digital download available from the Napster online music service, {{as well as many}} other download stores. The session was recorded in the Wise Buddah venue in London on May 9, 2005.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{takeoff weight}} (also {{known as the}} maximum brake-release weight) is the maximum weight {{authorised}} at <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for takeoff, or {{at the start of}} the takeoff roll.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and releases the brakes to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|E
50|$|Landing {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} as it lands at the destination. This is the <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> weight minus the trip fuel burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and reserve fuel.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>brakes</b> are <b>released,</b> {{pressure}} in the brake pipe is about , and [...] in brake cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The Whike 1.0 was {{released}} on 5 June 2008. It has a standard 1.6 m2 sail and can reach speeds up to 50 km/h with wind speeds of 4-5 bft (13 - 24 mph). It can be legally used on both bike lanes and streets in the Netherlands and UK. Activating the front <b>brake</b> <b>releases</b> the sail's spinlock, assuring {{there will be no}} more wind-propulsion.|$|R
50|$|This type of {{retarder}} {{is known}} as Jake <b>brake</b> or compression <b>release</b> <b>brake.</b> A disadvantage of this system is that it becomes very noisy in operation, particularly if the exhaust muffler is faulty; its use is therefore banned in some locales.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum-operated hidden {{headlamps}} were added, which retracted upwards in {{event of}} failure. An automatic parking <b>brake</b> <b>release,</b> two-way power seats, power front disc brakes (rear drum), an indicator light for the headlight doors, and adjustable head restraints were all standard features.|$|E
50|$|At 16:10:43 (133 seconds), the Trident {{entered a}} deep stall. It was {{descending}} through 1200 ft, its nose was pitched up by 31°, and its airspeed had fallen below the minimum indication of 54 kn. At 16:10:47 (137 seconds) and 1000 ft, the Trident was descending at 4500 ft/min m/s. Impact {{with the ground}} came at 16:11, precisely 150 seconds after <b>brake</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
50|$|Engine {{failure on}} {{take-off}} (EFTO) is a situation, when flying an aircraft, where an engine has failed, {{or is not}} delivering sufficient power, at any time between <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> and the wheels leaving the ground / V2. The phases of flight are de-lineated to allow simplified standard procedures for different aircraft types to be developed. If an aircraft suffered engine failure on takeoff, the standard procedure for most aircraft would be to abort the takeoff.|$|E
50|$|Also {{included}} is Hill-Hold Control, {{a safety}} technology that prevents the car from rolling backwards {{on a steep}} incline when the <b>brake</b> is <b>released.</b>|$|R
5|$|Shortly before 10.00am as the Duke of Wellington arrived, a {{band played}} See, the Conquering Hero Comes in his honour, {{beginning}} {{a tradition of}} the song being played at almost every British railway station opening from then on. The Duke's party entered their carriage; a gun was then fired to mark {{the opening of the}} railway. The Duke's carriages had their <b>brakes</b> <b>released</b> and were allowed to roll down the incline under the force of gravity to be coupled to the waiting Northumbrian.|$|R
50|$|The {{main part}} of the set up is the winding motor which is driven by the dc motor. Two double deck cages are {{attached}} to the two ends of the winding rope. At the start of the winding cycle, power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>released.</b> The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of 6 m/s until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake.|$|R
50|$|In 1972 {{a modest}} frontal {{revision}} placed {{more emphasis on}} horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking <b>brake</b> <b>release,</b> passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. New DeVille signature script was affixed {{to the sides of}} the rear roof panels. Sales reached a record 194,811.|$|E

25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking <b>brake</b> cylinders to <b>release</b> the parking <b>brake,</b> or <b>release</b> the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking <b>brake</b> being <b>released</b> if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking <b>brake</b> to be <b>released,</b> or the <b>brake</b> shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} valves {{to control and}} generate brake applications on the cars {{along the length of}} the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a brake pipe that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the brake pipe and car components are charged with air, the <b>brakes</b> <b>release.</b> When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the brake pipe pressure. As the brake pipe pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their <b>brake</b> cylinders. To <b>release</b> the <b>brakes,</b> the engineer charges the brake pipe. This method of controlling the brakes on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868.|$|R

50|$|Having {{learned from}} the BD-5 that using an {{untested}} engine was a bad idea, he selected the smallest production engine he could find in quantity, the General Electric J85, and designed an aircraft around it. The resulting design bore some resemblance to the Northrop T-38 Talon, which was powered by two examples of the same engine. Performance estimates were fantastic: after <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> the 1,580 lb (715 kg) aircraft was claimed {{to be able to}} climb to 10,000 feet (3050 m) in under 60 seconds, would cruise for 2,000 miles (3,200 km) at up to 45,000 ft (13,700 m) altitude in a 9 psi (465 mm Hg) pressurized cabin, and could reach supersonic speeds of up to Mach 1.4.|$|E
5000|$|Gladhands are {{designed}} to allow the driver to disconnect without a mechanic or tools. They sometimes utilize a quick release style to speed up <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> time. A tractor / trailer typically has two gladhands - one for service brakes and another for emergency brakes. Gladhands are color coded. Within the United States service lines are blue and emergency brake lines are red and are standardized by SAE J318. Where ISO standards are used, the Supply lines are Red and the Control Lines are Yellow per ISO 1728. The SAE [...] "Service" [...] lines are synonymous with the ISO [...] "Supply" [...] lines and the [...] "Emergency" [...] lines are synonymous with ISO [...] "Control" [...] lines ...|$|E
