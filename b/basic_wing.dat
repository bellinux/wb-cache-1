25|$|The GT-1 {{was derived}} from the GB-1 series of glide bombs, {{developed}} by Aeronca for the United States Army Air Forces. The weapon's airframe was inexpensive and simply designed, with a <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> and twin tails attached to a cradle for carrying the payload. The flight path of the GT-1 was determined by a preset autopilot that kept the weapon on a steady course after release.|$|E
25|$|The Beechcraft Model 65 Queen Air and Model 90 King Air {{are both}} direct descendents of the Model 50 Twin Bonanza. All three {{aircraft}} {{share the same}} <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> design, as well as landing gear, flaps, instrument panels, fuel cells, and more. The Queen Air added a larger cabin to the design, while the later King Air added turbine power and pressurization. Twin Bonanza production ended in 1963 while the King Air was under development.|$|E
25|$|The rudder {{mass balance}} {{was larger than}} that of {{production}} aircraft, with an angled lower edge cutting further {{into the top of}} the fin. Although the <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> plan was to stay the same for most production Spitfires, the prototype wing was structurally different: No weapons were fitted and the alclad skinning was laid out in spanwise strips; underneath the port wing the radiator bath started immediately behind the starboard undercarriage bay, with the opening conforming to the angle of the bay. Unlike production aircraft the wingtips were {{an integral part of the}} structure and, for the first series of tests a long pitot tube projected from near the port wingtip.|$|E

25|$|The Pfalz D.XIV was a {{derivative}} of the D.XII, utilizing the same fuselage and <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> structure. The D.XIV differed primarily by replacing the 180hp Mercedes D.IIIa체 with the 200hp Benz Bz.IV체, a substantially heavier engine. To {{cope with the}} increased power and weight, the D.XIV featured longer span wings and an enlarged vertical stabilizer. Enlarged ailerons were used to maintain rate of roll. A few prototypes were tested at the second Adlershof competition and a small production order ensued. Production was quickly terminated, however, and the D.XIV did not see active service. The D.XIV did not offer an appreciable increase in performance over the D.XII, and the Benz Bz.IV체 engine was needed for reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{developed}} the C-X {{in parallel with}} the P-X, which it had also been selected to develop. As a cost saving measure, major airframe parts and system components were shared between the two aircraft. They use the same <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> structure, although it is installed at different sweep angle and dihedral on the two versions, with different high lift devices and powerplant attachments. Common components include the cockpit windows, outer wings, horizontal stabilizer, and other systems. Internal shared parts include the auxiliary power unit, cockpit panel, flight control system computer, anti-collision lights, and gear control unit. As of 2007, the total development cost for the two aircraft has been 345 billion yen (or roughly equal to $2.9 billion), which is low compared to similar programs; for example, the development contract for the Boeing P-8 Poseidon alone was $3.89 billion.|$|E
500|$|Frost {{considered}} {{the new design}} as an interim aircraft between the CF-100 and the more advanced C-104 project. The salient changes to the <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> planform were in decreasing its chord and thickness, and adding a 42째 sweep to the leading edge, creating a near-delta wing configuration. The tail surfaces were also swept back. [...] One version that was considered featured two streamlined fuel tanks blended into {{the leading edge of}} the wings near the three/quarter position. [...] Despite the use of more powerful engines, the redesign had very modest performance specifications, with a planned maximum diving speed of Mach 0.95, scarcely better than the placarded Mach 0.85 speed limit of the production CF-100 Mk 2 and Mk 3. Avro executives, recognizing that the company had already suffered due to the protracted development of the CF-100, determined that Frost's revised design would provide a [...] "hedge" [...] against the CF-100's failure to secure long-term contracts.|$|E

2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the <b>basic</b> <b>wing</b> was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the effect of various high lift devices on a highly sweptforward wing with a leading edge sweep angle of 55 degrees and on a straight wing, both wings having an aspect ratio of 1. 72 and the same span. Experimental tests were made in the Cal Tech - Merrill low speed wind tunnel at Pasadena City College on both types of wing with and without fuselage. High lift devices investigated were extended leading edge flaps, plain leading edge flaps, extended trailing edge flaps, and split flaps. Both 70 per cent and full span configurations were used in each case except for the plain leading edge flaps. All force data was reduced to standard non-dimensional lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients, and the results presented in standard graphical form. In addition, photographs of tuft surveys were made for typical configurations. The maximum lift coefficient obtained from the <b>basic</b> <b>wings</b> was approximately the same for both, but the angle of attack for maximum lift was appreciably lower for the straight wing than for the sweptforward wing. The addition of the fuselage increased the maximum lift coefficient of both the <b>basic</b> <b>wings</b> and of the sweptforward wing with flap configurations, but the fuselage was detrimental to the lift for the straight wing with flap configurations. Straight wing configurations gave respectively higher maximum lift coefficients and larger lift curve slopes than on the comparable sweptforward wing models. All high lift devices investigated were more effective on the straight wing than on the sweptforward wing. Extended trailing edge flaps were the most effective of the flaps investigated in increasing the maximum lift, but gave the largest negative increase in the pitching moments. On the straight wing the 70 per cent span split and 70 per cent span extended trailing edge flaps at optimum flap deflection angles gave a higher maximum lift coefficient than the full span flaps at the optimum flap deflection. When the straight wing was mounted on the fuselage, this effect was true only for the split flaps...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} by the transonic-bump technique of the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics {{of a series of}} thin, low-aspect-ratio, highly tapered wings has been made in the Langley high-speed 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel. The Mach number range extended from about 0. 60 to 1. 18, with corresponding Reynolds numbers ranging from about 0. 75 x 10 (6) to 0. 95 x 10 (6). The angle of attack range was from - 10 degrees to approximately 32 degrees. The effects on drag and lift-drag ratio of a variation in sweep angle from - 14. 03 degrees to 45 degrees with respect to the quarter-chord line for wings of 3 -percent-chord thickness was found to be small in comparison to the effects of a variation in thickness from 2 percent chord to 4. 5 percent chord for wings with 14. 03 degree sweepback. For the range of variables considered, variations in plan form were considerably more important with regard to longitudinal stability characteristics than the variations in thickness. For the series of <b>basic</b> <b>wings</b> having an aspect ratio of 4, the most hearly linear pitching-moment characteristics were obtained with 26. 57 degree of sweepback of the quarter-chord line. However, for the modified series of wings (obtained by clipping the tips of the original wings parallel to the plane of symmetry to give an aspect ratio of 3 and a taper ratio of 0. 143), the most nearly linear pitching-moment characteristics were obtained with 36. 87 degrees of sweepback. By decreasing the thickness-to-chord ratios from 0. 03 to 0. 02, a large increase in lift-curve slope was obtained for both the <b>basic</b> and modified <b>wings.</b> All of the wings of both series had fairly large inward shifts of the lateral center-of-pressure location (indicative of tip stalling) with increasing lift coefficient, except those wings having minimum sweepback angles...|$|R
