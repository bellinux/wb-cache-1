50|$|<b>Bronopol</b> {{was invented}} by The Boots Company PLC in the early 1960s and first {{applications}} were as a preservative for pharmaceuticals. Owing to its low mammalian toxicity (at in-use levels) and high activity against bacteria (especially the troublesome Gram-negative species), <b>bronopol</b> became popular as a preservative in many consumer products such as shampoos and cosmetics. It was subsequently adopted as an antimicrobial in other industrial environments such as paper mills, oil exploration and production facilities, as well as cooling water disinfection plants.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>bronopol</b> in {{personal}} care products (cosmetics, toiletries) has declined since the late 1980s due to the potential formation of nitrosamines. While <b>Bronopol</b> is not in itself a nitrosating agent, under conditions where it decomposes (alkaline solution and/or elevated temperatures) it can liberate nitrite {{and low levels of}} formaldehyde and these decomposition products can react with any contaminant secondary amines or amides in a personal care formulation to produce significant levels of nitrosamines (due to the toxicity of these substances, the term 'significant' means levels as low as 10s of parts per billion).|$|E

40|$|<b>Bronopol</b> {{has been}} used as a {{preservative}} in drugs and cosmetics since 1964. <b>Bronopol</b> has low dermal irritancy at levels commonly used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals but it is significantly irritating at higher concentrations. Laboratory testing of <b>bronopol</b> indicates a low potential for dermal sensitization; however, a number of case reports demonstrate human allergenic reactions. No reports were identified on the allergenic properties of <b>bronopol</b> for the inhalation route of exposure. In 1983 approximately 5, 200 people in the United States were occupationally exposed to <b>bronopol.</b> Current novel uses of <b>bronopol</b> include mold remediation and the sanitizing of ventilation system components. These new applications have the potential to expose vast new populations to the chemical. Since 89 million people in the United States work in indoor environments and 50 million Americans suffer from allergies, it is likely that a sizeable portion of these populations will be exposed to <b>bronopol.</b> This is significant since the dermal sensitizing properties of <b>bronopol</b> suggest that the material may also be a respiratory sensitizer, potentially resulting in chemically induced asthma. More people are being diagnosed with asthma today than at any time in the past; the causes of this increased prevalence are largely unknown. In this work an existing ultraviolet spectrophotometric method for analysis of <b>bronopol</b> has been combined with conventional industrial hygiene air sampling techniques. No combined air sampling and analytical method for <b>bronopol</b> has previously been published in the literature. A calibration curve has been developed with a linear range of 1 ug/ml to 25 ug/ml. The instrumental limit of detection is 1 ug/ml with an instrumental limit of quantitation of ca. 3 ug/ml. During chamber sampling trials analytical recovery for treated glass fiber filters yielded a sampling recovery efficiency averaging 99. 9 %. <b>Bronopol</b> concentration obtained during chamber sampling trials ranged from 10. 80 mg/m 3 to 21. 59 mg/m 3, with a pooled coefficient of variation of 4. 33 % for all chamber sampling sets.

In this study the efficacy of <b>bronopol</b> against Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was tested both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro trials demonstrated a 30 min exposure to 100 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> killed 51. 7 % of the infective theronts. In vitro exposure of the protomonts to <b>bronopol</b> (0, 20, 50 and 100 mg L- 1) for 30 min was observed to kill 0 %, 76. 2 %, 97. 2 % and 100 % respectively. Protomonts surviving treatment, demonstrated delayed development with the time taken from protomont until the release of theronts ranging from 28. 3 h for 0 mg L- 1 exposure, to 70 h for parasites in 20 and 50 mg L- 1 exposure groups. These concentrations also caused asymmetric cell division of the encysted tomonts. Exposure of encysted tomonts (min. 8 cell stage) to 100 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> for 30 min, killed 50 % within this period, with the remainder dying within the subsequent 42 h post exposure. Lower doses of <b>bronopol</b> were less effective in killing encysted tomonts than the higher doses (3. 3 % of parasites were killed in 20 mg L- 1; 10 % in 50 mg L- 1), but they still delayed theront release significantly (25. 7 h for 0 mg L- 1 to 46. 2 h for parasites exposed to 20 - 50 mg L- 1). Long, low dose (1 mg L- 1) exposure to <b>bronopol</b> was also efficacious against theronts. Survival after 12 h was 29 % (c. f. 100 % in control parasites), and less than 1 % after 24 h exposure (c. f. 74 % in control parasites). Theronts surviving these exposures demonstrated reduced infection success compared to control theronts. The findings of this study demonstrate that <b>bronopol</b> (PycezeTM) affects the survival of all free-living stages of I. multifiliis (protomonts, tomont and theronts), thus suggesting that <b>bronopol</b> may serve a useful role in the control of I. multifiliis infections...|$|E
40|$|Patterns {{of growth}} {{inhibition}} of Escherichia coli {{in the presence}} of 2 -bromo- 2 -nitropropane- 1, 3 -diol (<b>bronopol)</b> indicate a period of biocide-induced bacteriostasis followed by growth at an inhibited rate. The length of the bacteriostatic period, but not the subsequent growth inhibition, was reduced by the addition of excess cysteine. Patterns of growth inhibition were unaffected by catalase or superoxide dismutase. The bactericidal concentrations (100 to 500 micrograms/ml) were considerably in excess of the MIC (13 micrograms/ml) and generally produced first-order reductions in viability. Bactericidal activity was considerably reduced by anoxic conditions and by the presence of catalase or superoxide dismutase. Results indicate that there are two distinct reactions between <b>bronopol</b> and thiols. Under aerobic conditions, <b>bronopol</b> catalytically oxidizes thiol-containing materials such as cysteine, with atmospheric oxygen as the final oxidant. By-products of this reaction are active oxygen species such as superoxide and peroxide, which are directly responsible for the bactericidal activity of the compound and for the reduced growth rate after the bacteriostatic period. The latter effect probably results from the oxidation of intracellular thiols such as glutathione and cysteine. Catalytic oxidation of thiols {{in the presence of}} excess thiol leads to the creation of an anoxic state. Under these conditions, the slower reaction with thiols, which consumes <b>bronopol,</b> predominates.

The effect of <b>bronopol</b> on the colonisation success of infective theronts was also investigated by adding 2 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> to the water prior and during the infection process. The number of parasites surviving on fish treated this way was compared to groups of fish that only received treatment after infection had occurred. The effect of <b>bronopol</b> on exiting trophonts throughout their external development to the point of theront release was also assessed through the delivery of 1 mg L- 1, 2 mg L- 1 and 5 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> for up to 27 days consecutively (days 9 - 36 post-infection). The trial showed that a nominal dose of 2 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> administered prior to infection significantly reduced the number of theronts surviving in the water column {{at the time of the}} initial challenge by 35 - 40 % (P less than  0. 05). Similarly, doses of 2 and 5 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> administered as the first wave of mature I. multifiliis trophonts exited fish (i. e. day 11 onwards) to develop externally, reduced the number of trophonts establishing on fish as the second cycle of infection by 52 - 83 %. Continuous application of 2 and 5 mg L- 1 <b>bronopol</b> throughout the second and third cycles of I. multifiliis infection gave further reductions of between 90 and 98 %. The number of trophonts on the fish in the control tanks and those treated with 1 mg L- 1 and the 2 mg L- 1 dose at the time of initial infection, by comparison, were observed to increase with successive cycles of infection. From these small scale tank trials, this study demonstrates that the strategic, long duration, low dose delivery of drugs like <b>bronopol</b> can significantly reduce the number of trophonts establishing on fish suggesting the potential of this drug at managing I. multifiliis infections...|$|E

Weight loss corrosion rates of carbon steel beads incubated with these field water samples averaged 0. 2 mm/yr, but injection water sample S 19 had 1. 25 ± 0. 07 mm/yr. S 19 had a most probable number of zero acid-producing bacteria and incubation of S 19 with carbon steel beads or coupons {{did not lead}} to big changes in microbial community composition. In contrast other field water samples had most probable numbers of APB of 102 /mL to 107 /mL and incubation of these field water samples with carbon steel beads or coupons often gave large changes in microbial community composition. HPLC analysis indicated that all field water samples had elevated concentrations of bromide (average 1. 6 mM), which may be derived from <b>bronopol,</b> which was used as a biocide. S 19 had the highest bromide concentration (4. 2 mM) and was the only water sample with a high concentration of active <b>bronopol</b> (13. 8 mM, 2760 ppm). Corrosion rates increased linearly with <b>bronopol</b> concentration, as determined by weight loss of carbon steel beads, for experiments with S 19, with filtered S 19 and with <b>bronopol</b> dissolved in defined medium. This indicated that the high corrosion rate found for S 19 was due to its high <b>bronopol</b> concentration. The corrosion rate of coiled tubing coupons also increased linearly with <b>bronopol</b> concentration as determined by electrochemical methods.

40|$|The {{selective}} inhibition (SI) {{technique has}} been widely used to resolve fungal and bacterial biomass. By studying bacterial growth (leucine/thymidine incorporation) and respiration simultaneously, this study demonstrates that the inhibitors the SI technique is based on do not efficiently or specifically resolve fungal and bacterial contributions to respiration. At concentrations that completely inhibited bacterial growth, the bactericide streptomycin had no influence on the SI technique's respiration measurement, and complete inhibition of bacterial growth using oxytetracycline resulted in marginal respiration reductions. The fungicides captan and benomyl severely inhibited non-target bacterial growth. Cycloheximide did not reduce bacterial growth at moderate concentrations, but the cycloheximide respiration reduction was no higher in a soil with more fungal biomass, casting doubt {{on its ability to}} discriminate fungal respiration contribution. Conclusions regarding bacteria and fungi based on the SI technique using these inhibitors are thus compromised.

40|$|Soil pH {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} variables in soil, and is a powerful factor in influencing the size, activity and community structure of the soil microbial community. It was previously shown in a century old artificial pH gradient in an arable soil (pH 4. 0 - 8. 3) that bacterial growth is positively related to pH, while fungal growth increases with decreasing pH. In an attempt to elucidate some of the mechanisms for this, plant material that especially promotes fungal growth (straw) or bacterial growth (alfalfa) was added to soil samples of the pH gradient in 5 -day laboratory incubation experiments. Also, bacterial growth was specifically inhibited by applying a selective bacterial growth inhibitor (<b>bronopol)</b> along the entire pH gradient to investigate if competitive interaction caused the shift in the decomposer community along the gradient. Straw benefited fungal growth relatively more than bacterial, and vice versa for alfalfa. The general pattern of a shift in fungal:bacterial growth with pH was, however, unaffected by substrate additions, indicating that lack of a suitable substrate was not the cause of the pH effect on the microbial community. In response to the bacterial growth inhibition by <b>bronopol,</b> there was stimulation of fungal growth up to pH 7, but not beyond, both for alfalfa and straw addition. However, the accumulation of ergosterol (an indicator of fungal biomass) during the incubation period after adding alfalfa increased at all pHs, indicating that fungal growth had been high at some time during the 5 -day incubation following joint addition of alfalfa and <b>bronopol.</b> This was corroborated in a time-series experiment. In conclusion, the low fungal growth at high pH in an arable soil was caused to a large extent by bacterial competition, and not substrate limitation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{intensification}} of freshwater aquaculture worldwide has facilitated {{the propagation of}} the parasitic ciliate protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis Fouquet, 1876 commonly known as “fish white spot” or “Ich”. Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infections lead to high mortalities, generating significant economic losses in most cultured freshwater fish species worldwide. Until recently, malachite green was the chemical treatment traditionally used to control I. multifiliis infections. Its reclassification as carcinogenic to humans and its subsequent ban for use in food fish has left the industry without any suitable treatments. Currently, in-bath formaldehyde and sodium chloride treatments {{are the most common}} option used in farm systems to control I. multifliis infections. Given their low efficacy, however, they are not considered as sustainable long–term options. There is, therefore, an urgent necessity to find efficacious alternatives for controlling I. multifliis infections. The general aim of this research project was to improve the management of I. multifiliis infections in order to develop more comprehensive, environmentally friendly and sustainable therapeutic strategies for use in freshwater food fish aquaculture. The present PhD-thesis present first a literature review chapter providing an overview and critical assessment of chemotherapeutants and physical interventions tested within the last 30 years against I. multifiliis infections. The experimental worked consisted of a number of in vitro and in vivo trials were conducted using experimental scale flow-through, static tank systems and commercial scale raceways within a rainbow trout hatchery, in addition to molecular work on different isolates of the parasite. The results of this research are organised into three experimental chapters which describe the testing of chemical and non-chemical treatments against I. multifiliis infections and work undertaken to determine the most suitable molecular markers to identify I. multifiliis isolates. In the first experimental chapters, the possibility of efficiently controlling I. multifliis infections through the administration of novel environmentally-friendly chemical treatments (e. g. <b>bronopol</b> and peracetic acid-based products) was investigated. The results clearly showed that <b>bronopol</b> and peractic acid-based products have a strong biocidal/cytotoxic effect against all free-living stages of I. multifiliis (e. g. tomonts, cysts and theronts). The administration of high concentrations of <b>bronopol</b> (e. g. 20, 50 and 100 mg L- 1) over short periods of exposure (e. g. 30 min) significantly reduced the survival of tomonts, cysts and theronts and delayed the development of I. multifiliis tomonts and cysts. Prolonged low concentrations of <b>bronopol</b> (e. g. 1 mg L- 1) greatly reduced the survival of infective theronts, although such treatment did not affect the ability of surviving theronts to subsequently infect a host. When tested in vivo, the continuous prolonged exposure (e. g. 27 days) of low concentrations of <b>bronopol</b> (e. g. 2 and 5 mg L- 1) {{had an impact on the}} population dynamics of I. multifiliis, this being demonstrated by a significant reduction in the number of trophonts developing within the fish. Low concentrations of <b>bronopol</b> (e. g. 2 mg L- 1) administrated as a preventive treatment prior to infection also proved to be very successful at reducing the colonisation success of I. multifiliis. Peracetic acid administrated at low concentrations (e. g. 8, 12 and 15 mg L- 1) over a short window of exposure (e. g. 1 h) displayed a strong biocidal effect against all the free-living stages of I. multifiliis (e. g. tomonts, cysts and theronts). The <b>bronopol</b> and peracetic acid-based products tested here both appear to be capable of disrupting the development of the cyst stage of I. multifiliis which is seldom reported for chemotherapeutants currently used against this parasite. These results suggest that <b>bronopol</b> and peracetic acid-based products have a place in the arsenal of treatment options for controlling I. multifiliis infections in commercial aquaculture systems. The use of a mechanical device or a biological control agent to remove the cyst stage of I. multifiliis and the impact of such control on the population dynamics and the levels of infection of fish were also investigated. The results revealed that tomonts preferentially settle and encyst on the base of culture systems and on biofilm–covered substrates. The survival of the tomont stage is greatly affected by the composition of the substrate upon which it settles and is significantly lower on polypropylene-based plastic. The lining of raceways in a commercial rainbow trout hatchery with a low-adhesion polymer created a smooth surface facilitating the dislodgement and elimination of the cyst stage of I. multifilis by natural flushing or brushing. The physical removal of the cyst stage alone, through the use of a mechanical device or substrate detrivorous/algae feeder as a biological control agent, significantly reduced the propagation of I. multifiliis to a low level of infection without the need to deploy an additional chemical treatment. These studies demonstrate that the cyst is a key stage in the dynamics of I. multifiliis infection and its removal from the fish culture systems could constitute an effective and simple mean of managing I. multifiliis infections. The third experimental chapter explores the utilisation of molecular marker to characterise different isolates of I. multifiliis. The results highlight the unsuitability of the rDNA region (ITS- 1 and ITS- 2) and the strong potential of the mtDNA (COI) as molecular markers to discriminate isolates of I. multifiliis from distant geographical locations. It is suggested that genetic “barcoding” using mtDNA is the most effective method to identify I. multifiliis isolates. Importantly, genetic “barcoding” could allow associating I. multifiliis strains or geographical isolates with particular properties as regards their ecophysiology, pathogenicity and sensitivity to treatment, in order to improve the management of I. multifiliis infections according to the specific genetic isolate encountered. This research project demonstrates the efficacy of a range of new approaches against the propagation of I. multifiliis. Together, our findings contribute towards the development of a more effective and integrated system for managing I. multifliis infections in farm systems. The utilisation of physical methods and of environmentally friendly chemotherapeutants holds great potential for the control of I. multifiliis infections in organic fish production and in a broader context to any freshwater food fish farms affected by I. multifiliis...|$|E
