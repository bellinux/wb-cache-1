5|$|According to {{historian}} George H. Haynes, {{during his}} nearly {{thirty years of}} public service Wilson practiced principled politics by championing unpopular causes, sometimes {{at the expense of}} his personal ambition. The causes Wilson supported included abolition of slavery, and the rights of workers, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white patients. He started {{a school in}} the evenings, teaching children. He established {{what has been called}} the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, from the rural and small town South. These developments dramatically altered {{the demographics of the}} state. Indiana industrial cities were among the destinations of the Great Migration. After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in heavy industry resulted in Indiana's becoming part of the Rust Belt.|$|E
50|$|Chaos continued; {{the police}} were overworked and tired. Detroit Police {{were found to have}} {{committed}} many acts of abuse against <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites who were in their custody.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 Detroit Riot was {{different}} in that <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites participated in destruction in the city. Violence {{was directed at}} attacking police and the National Guard, and destroying property.|$|R

5|$|While in Scotland, Smith {{joined the}} Glasgow Emancipation Society and met {{people in the}} Scottish and English {{abolitionist}} movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery. When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States. He worked effectively with <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846-65.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> {{white as}} well as Gevacolor, Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958 and garnered positive critical reception. It was a commercial success, grossing 11million in its lifetime, thereby becoming only the second Tamil film to earn 10million after another Ramachandran starrer Madurai Veeran (1956); it became a silver jubilee film. Nadodi Mannan acquired cult status in Tamil cinema. It was dubbed into Telugu as Anaganaga Oka Raju and in Hindi as Hamen Bhi Jeene Do.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Los Angeles grew as {{a center}} for {{production}} of aircraft, war supplies and ammunitions. Thousands of people, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, from the South and the Midwest migrated to the West to fill factory jobs.|$|R
40|$|Everyone {{would agree}} that the American flag is red, white and blue. Everyone should also agree that it looks red, white and blue to people with normal color vision in {{appropriate}} circumstances. If a philosophical theory led {{to the conclusion that}} the red stripes cannot look red to both men <b>and</b> women, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, <b>both</b> young and old, we would be reluctant (to say the least) to accept that philosophical theory. But there is a widespread philosophical view about the nature of conscious experience that, together with some empirical facts, suggests that color experience cannot be veridical for both men <b>and</b> women, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, <b>both</b> young and ol...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the Reconstruction governments {{established}} {{public education}} and social welfare institutions for the first time, improving education for <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, and tried to improve social conditions for the many left in poverty after the long war. No Reconstruction state government was dominated by blacks; in fact, blacks did not attain a level of representation equal to their population in any state.|$|R
5|$|The French {{settlers}} brought <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> Indian {{slaves to}} St. Louis; {{although the majority}} were used as domestic servants, others worked as agricultural laborers. In 1769, the Spanish prohibited Indian slavery in Louisiana, but the practice was entrenched among the French Creoles in St. Louis. As a compromise, Spanish governors ended the Indian slave trade but allowed the retention of current slaves and any children born to them. In 1772, a census determined {{the population of the}} village to be 637, including 444 whites (285 males and 159 females) and 193 African slaves, with no Indian slaves reported due to their technical illegality. During the 1770s and 1780s, St. Louis grew slowly and the Spanish commanders were replaced often.|$|E
5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> red ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
5|$|With the {{popularity}} of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if Brütal Legend would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by <b>both</b> <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> Kyle Gass.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 {{state legislators}} amended the state constitution, {{removing}} the poll tax. In many areas <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> poor whites still faced subjectively applied barriers to voter registration {{that did not}} end until after passage of national civil rights legislation, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1880s, the {{community}} at Rehoboth were joined by other Baster families from Grootfontein (South) (whom missionary Heidmann had earlier tried to recruit), Okahandja, and Otjimbingwe. While based on descent within the families, they also accepted <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites who applied to join {{the community}}.|$|R

5|$|ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo {{publicly}} {{claimed responsibility}} for shooting down the Hunyani {{in an interview with}} the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.|$|E
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
5|$|Bears, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> brown, {{are seen}} in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

25|$|Sharecroppers formed {{unions in}} the 1930s, {{beginning}} in Tallapoosa County, Alabama in 1931, and Arkansas in 1934. Membership in the Southern Tenant Farmers Union included <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> poor whites. As leadership strengthened, meetings became more successful, and protest became more vigorous, landlords {{responded with a}} wave of terror.|$|R
25|$|Though the {{arrangement}} protected sharecroppers from {{the negative effects}} of a bad crop, many sharecroppers (<b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white) remained quite poor. Arrangements typically left a third of the crop to the sharecropper.|$|E
25|$|Some {{equipment}} only {{fits the}} needs for one particular mission over another. There is however some equipment {{that is used}} for <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> green operations, and these pieces of gear are usually combat vests, flak and armor jackets (or systems), and harnesses for use in hasty extraction measures.|$|E
25|$|Perlinos are bay horses who are {{homozygous}} for {{the dominant}} creme (CCr) allele. <b>Both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> red pigment are diluted to some shade of creme, though the formerly black points {{often have a}} stronger reddish cast. The skin is a slightly pigmented pink and the eyes are blue.|$|E
30|$|Now {{suppose that}} <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, through some {{effective}} social policy, experienced an additive shift such that those now at x= 50, or half {{the poverty line}} income, were now at x= 100, which {{can be viewed as}} effectively rescaling the x variable. While the overall proportions of <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites below the poverty line would both be substantially smaller, the corresponding FR would be much higher, going from 2.29 prior to the additive shift to. 118 /. 044 = 2.68 afterwards. Hence, as Scanlan says “…the rarer the outcome, the greater the disparity in experiencing the outcome.” Similarly, for the other ratio, “…the smaller the disparity in avoiding the outcome” namely the SR ratio associated with those avoiding poverty. The SR disparity is reduced from. 84 to. 92.|$|R
40|$|I {{document}} {{trends in}} <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white retirement rates and in living arrangements among retirees. I {{show that the}} retirement rates of <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites rose between 1900 and 1930 but that convergence in <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white rates and in living arrangements only occurred between 1930 and 1950. I examine whether rising income explains the rise in black retirement rates prior to 1930 and whether rising income and the institution of Social Security in 1935 led to convergence {{by looking at the}} impact of the first pension program available to <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites, that serving Union Army veterans. I find that blacks were 2 to 5 times as responsive as whites to income transfers in their retirement decisions and 6 to 8 times as responsive in their choice of independent living arrangements. The results suggest that income effects from the institution of Social Security explain up to half of the convergence in black-white retirement rates and in living arrangements...|$|R

25|$|Abuses of {{the poll}} tax {{continued}} to resist efforts by reformers {{for change in}} the 1930s and 1940s. In 1943 legislators managed to rescind the poll tax, but the Tennessee Supreme Court declared that action unconstitutional. It was not until 1953 that a new constitutional convention finally removed provisions for the poll tax. Hundreds of thousands of citizens, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, had been disenfranchised by its abuses during the decades since its passage.|$|E
25|$|Berea College, {{located at}} the extreme {{southern}} edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau, was the first coeducational college in the South to admit <b>both</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white students, doing so from its very establishment in 1855. This policy was successfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in the case of Berea College v. Kentucky in 1908. This decision effectively segregated Berea until the landmark Brown v.

5000|$|In [...] "The Almost Year", Alice Walker {{explains}} how the author Florence Randall {{explains how}} she wants <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites to embrace one another. She clarifies that [...] "she seeks {{to find a}} way in which <b>black</b> abused <b>and</b> poor and white privileged and rich can meet and exchange some warmth of themselves. Walker's perspective is that if <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites can stop the racial equality that <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites will not be divided. In this house, a black girl feels somewhat threatened being an all-white household. Due to these circumstances, Walker provides a sense of division between the <b>black</b> girl <b>and</b> the family that is providing a home for her to feel free. The black girl cannot embrace the warmth from the Mallory's family because she feels that all white people are to hurt black people. Walker explains how the Civil Rights Movement intended to bring <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites together. Walker wants to show how a black girl should not have to feel unequal when they are around white people.|$|R
