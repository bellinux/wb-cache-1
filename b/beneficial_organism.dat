50|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, a <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism</b> is any organism that benefits the growing process, including insects, arachnids, other animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes. Benefits include pest control, pollination, {{and maintenance of}} soil health. The opposite of beneficial organisms are pests, which are organisms deemed detrimental to the growing process.|$|E
50|$|Maintaining {{plant health}} will {{eliminate}} most pest problems. It {{is best to}} start with pest-free plant materials and supplies and close inspection of the plant upon purchase is also recommended. Establishing diversity within the area of plant species will encourage <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism</b> populations (e.g. birds, insects), which feed on potential plant pests. Because plant pests vary from plant to plant, assessing the problem correctly is half the battle. The owner must consider whether the plant can tolerate {{the damage caused by}} the pest. If not, then does the plant value justify some sort of treatment? While pesticide is often chosen to solve the problem, physical barriers and repellents may help. If pesticides are the chosen method, selective organic or natural pesticide is often better because it has less impact on non-target species.|$|E

5000|$|Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a {{bacterium}} that originally {{was considered to}} be a subspecies of L. casei, but later genetic research found it to be a species of its own. It is a short Gram-positive heterofermentative facultative anaerobic non-spore-forming rod that often appears in chains. Some strains of L. rhamnosus bacteria are being used as probiotics, and are particularly useful in treating female-related infections, most particularly very difficult to treat cases of bacterial vaginosis (or [...] "BV"). The Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. reuteri species are most commonly found in the healthy female genito-urinary tract and are most helpful to supplement in order to regain control over dysbiotic bacterial overgrowth during an active infection. L. rhamnosus sometimes is used in yogurt and dairy products such as fermented and un-pasteurized milk and semi-hard cheese. While frequently considered a <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism,</b> L. rhamnosus may not be as beneficial to certain subsets of the population; in rare circumstances, especially those primarily involving weakened immune system or infants, there may be no advantage.|$|E

40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism</b> for the {{discovery}} of genes, signaling pathways and chemical compounds that slow cellular and organismal aging in eukaryotes across phyla. As a first step towards uncovering novel aging-delaying chemical compounds, I conducted a screen of a library of plant extracts for those that can extend yeast chronological lifespan. My screen revealed six plant extracts that increase yeast chronological lifespan considerably more efficiently {{than any of the}} longevity-extending chemical compounds yet described. I show that each of the six plant extracts is a geroprotector which delays the onset and decreases the rate of yeast chronological aging by eliciting a hormetic stress response. Because the rate of aging in yeast is controlled by a network of integrated signaling pathways and protein kinases, I assessed how single-gene-deletion mutations eliminating each of these pathways and kinases affect the aging-delaying efficiencies of the six plant extracts. My findings imply that these extracts slow aging in the following ways: 1) plant extract 4 decreases the efficiency with which the pro-aging TORC 1 pathway inhibits the anti-aging SNF 1 pathway; 2) plant extract 5 mitigates two different branches of the pro-aging PKA pathway; 3) plant extract 6 coordinates processes that are not assimilated into the network of presently known signaling pathways/protein kinases; 4) plant extract 8 diminishes the inhibitory action of PKA on SNF 1; 5) plant extract 12 intensifies the anti-aging protein kinase Rim 15; and 6) plant extract 21 inhibits a form of the pro-aging protein kinase Sch 9 that is activated by the pro-aging PKH 1 / 2 pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} environmental {{risks of}} Neodryinus typhlocybae, a parasitic wasp from North America, were evaluated {{with regard to}} its safe use as an exotic biocontrol agent for the planthopper Metcalfa pruinosa in Austria. Following an earlier host range study of N. typhlocybae conducted in the laboratory, the present study assessed the potential for establishment and spread as well as negative indirect effects on non-target organisms. The potential release sites in Austria were analysed for matching of the climatic requirements for establishment of N. typhlocybae. The two proposed release locations, Vienna and Graz, have a predominantly similar climate to the parasitoid’s region of origin, though the comparably cooler mean summer temperatures might result in a low emergence rate of the partial second generation. The natural spread potential of N. typhlocybae was reviewed and {{is considered to be}} sufficiently good for released individuals to reach nearby sites infested with M. pruinosa. However, a perceptible spreading of N. typhlocybae females only occurs a few years after release and seems to be strongly dependent on the host density. Gelis areator, a hyperparasitoid of N. typhlocybae known to occur in Austria, might have negative effects on the population of the <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism.</b> Advantages and disadvantages of chemical and biological control methods against M. pruinosa were evaluated. It is concluded that N. typhlocybae is very well suited as a biological control agent for M. pruinosa in Austria, as no adverse effects on non-target species are expected but its release offers advantages with regard to sustainable and environmentally friendly pest management...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Trichoderma hamatum strain GD 12 is unique in that it can promote plant growth, activate biocontrol against pre- and post-emergence soil pathogens and can induce systemic resistance to foliar pathogens. This study extends previous work in lettuce to demonstrate that GD 12 can confer beneficial agronomic traits to other plants, providing examples of plant growth promotion in the model dicot, Arabidopsis thaliana and induced foliar resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in the model monocot rice. We further characterize the lettuce-T. hamatum interaction to show that bran extracts from GD 12 and an N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamindase-deficient mutant differentially promote growth in a concentration dependent manner, and these differences correlate with differences in the small molecule secretome. We show that GD 12 mycoparasitises a range of isolates of the pre-emergence soil pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and that this interaction induces a further increase in plant growth promotion above that conferred by GD 12. To understand the genetic potential encoded by T. hamatum GD 12 and to facilitate its use as a model <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism</b> to study plant growth promotion, induced systemic resistance and mycoparasitism we present de novo genome sequence data. We compare GD 12 with other published Trichoderma genomes and show that T. hamatum GD 12 contains unique genomic regions with the potential to encode novel bioactive metabolites that may contribute to GD 12 's agrochemically important traits.

40|$|International audienceModern {{agriculture}} {{suffers from}} {{its dependence on}} chemical inputs and subsequent impacts on health and environment. Alternatively, protecting crops against pests can be achieved through the reinforcement of regulation ecological services. Our work propounds a data-driven methodological framework to derive relevant agricultural landscape rearrangements enhancing populations of beneficial organisms regulating pests. Building on spatialised entomological and geographic data, we developed a parsimonious reaction–diffusion model describing the population dynamics of beneficial organisms. Parameter estimation {{was carried out in}} a Bayesian framework accounting for uncertainty in the measurement. Thousands of agricultural landscapes were generated under agronomic specifications dealt with as constraint satisfaction problems. Population dynamics was simulated on each landscape with the fitted reaction-diffusion model mentioned above, and two metrics of abundances allowed the assessment of the regulation performance of the landscape spatial arrangements. One metric is a mean field performance criterion assessing the regulation performance from the landscape composition only, the other is a spatial performance metric assessing the performance resulting from the whole landscape spatial configuration. The former is computed with a non-spatialised form of the population dynamics model, the latter results from the reaction-diffusion model of the population dynamics. Comparing these metrics enabled to quantify the impact of spatial arrangements, hence allowing arrangements proposals. This framework was applied to the case study of a ground beetle species involved in the biological regulation of weeds. The arrangement proposals abides by the productive agronomic constraint that is the landscape composition, while they allow for significant habitat quality enhancement (or deterioration) for the <b>beneficial</b> <b>organism</b> (or a pest). Minor adaptations of our integrated data-driven approach would suit numerous situations ranging from the provision of enhanced ecosystem services to land management for conservation...|$|E

40|$|In {{agricultural}} ecosystems, pest insects, pathogens, {{and reduced}} soil fertility pose major challenges to crop productivity and {{are responsible for}} significant yield losses worldwide. Management of belowground pests and diseases remains particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the soil and the limited reach of conventional agrochemicals. Boosting the presence of <b>beneficial</b> rhizosphere <b>organisms</b> is a potentially sustainable alternative and may help to optimize crop health and productivity. Field application of single <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>organisms</b> has shown satisfactory results under optimal conditions. This might be further enhanced by combining multiple <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>organisms,</b> but this remains poorly investigated. Here, we inoculated wheat plots with combinations of three <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>organisms</b> that have different rhizosphere functions and studied their effects on crop performance. Plant beneficial Pseudomonas bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), were inoculated individually or in combinations at seeding, and their effects on plant performance were evaluated throughout the season. We used traditional and molecular identification tools to monitor their persistence over the cropping season in augmented and control treatments, and to estimate the possible displacement of native populations. In three separate trials, <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>organisms</b> were successfully introduced into the native populations and readily survived the field conditions. Various Pseudomonas, mycorrhiza, and nematode treatments improved plant health and productivity, while their combinations provided no significant additive or synergistic benefits compared to when applied alone. EPN application temporarily displaced some of the native EPN, but had no significant long-term effect on the associated food web. The strongest positive effect on wheat survival was observed for Pseudomonas and AMF during a season with heavy natural infestation by the frit fly, Oscinella frit, a major pest of cereals. Hence, beneficial impacts differed between the <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>organisms</b> and were most evident for plants under biotic stress. Overall, our findings indicate that in wheat production under the test conditions the three <b>beneficial</b> soil <b>organisms</b> can establish nicely and are compatible, but their combined application provides no additional benefits.
