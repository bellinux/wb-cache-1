5|$|The game {{began as}} the private {{development}} of Seow Zong Hui who presented an early <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Christian Svensson, Capcom's Senior VP of consumer software, at EVO 2012. Svensson showed the <b>build</b> <b>to</b> several staff {{members in the}} Capcom office (including senior community manager Brett Elston), and Capcom later decided {{to assist in the}} development of the game. While Zong Hui continued to develop the game based on his original design, Capcom took over tasks such as funding, marketing, and quality assurance. Capcom decided to distribute the game on PC instead of gaming consoles because Zong Hui did not have a license for console development. Svensson has noted that Capcom will consider console releases in the future, but chose to initially distribute the game on PC to keep the game free for fans and meet its December 17 target release date.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E

5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} <b>build</b> <b>to</b> include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually <b>build</b> <b>to</b> a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and opened it up to a wider audience {{that would not have been}} attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E
5|$|None of the {{original}} engines survived into preservation, however {{progress is being made}} by a Registered Charity (No. 1062320), the Standard Steam Locomotive Company, on constructing a new locomotive {{that would have been the}} first of the uncompleted batch of 15, number 72010 Hengist. As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive <b>build</b> <b>to</b> be commenced to a British Railways standard design. The Standard Steam Locomotive Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required cast parts can be made from patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).|$|E

It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E

5|$|Calshot Castle was {{designed}} to protect the Solent, a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet decided to <b>build</b> <b>to</b> improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure, but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E

5|$|Elix Skipper {{challenged}} Christopher Daniels for the TNA X Division Championship at Lockdown. The <b>build</b> <b>to</b> {{this encounter}} {{began on the}} March18 episode of Impact!, when Skipper interrupted Daniels after a match and hinted at a future encounter. On the March25 episode of Impact!, TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced that a four way elimination match involving Chris Sabin, Michael Shane, Skipper, and Petey Williams would be held on the April1 episode of Impact! to determine Daniels' opponent for the title at Lockdown. Skipper {{went on to win}} the match the following week, earning the opportunity to challenge for the title. The main surrounding storyline was that Daniels and Skipper used to be tag team partners as part of the group Triple X, which disbanded after losing a Six Sides of Steel Cage match against America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) at TNA's Turning Point PPV event on December5, 2004. Jeff Hardy fought Raven in a Six Sides of Steel Tables match at Lockdown. On the March25 episode of Impact!, Raven offered Hardy an alliance, which Hardy turned down. On the April1 episode of Impact!, Raven attacked Hardy during an incident between Hardy and Abyss. Rhodes announced that the two would face at Lockdown in a Six Sides of Steel Tables match on the April8 episode of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|Governor Broward {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, {{were paid}} by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward {{was elected to the}} Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his {{leadership}} and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Key West in 1912.|$|E
5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small <b>build</b> <b>to</b> symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E

5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was defended in a Three Way match by Awesome Kong against Gail Kim and ODB, {{also on the}} card. <b>Build</b> <b>to</b> this {{encounter}} began on December 2, 2007, at TNA's Turning Point PPV event, where then-TNA Women's Knockout Champion Kim defeated Kong by disqualification. Kim then fought Kong again at Final Resolution in a No Disqualification match, in which Kim retained the title. On the January 10, 2008, episode of Impact!, Kong defeated Kim to win the title in a match which gave Kim an injury in the storyline. Kong then defended the title against ODB at Against All Odds, which Kong won. Leading up to Destination X, Kim and ODB started a partnership {{in order to try}} and take the championship from Kong on the February 14 episode of Impact!. TNA later promoted a Three Way match between the three leading up to the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{light rail}} {{is now under}} {{construction}} from Lagunen via Kokstad to Bergen Airport, Flesland. Both Sørås and Indre Steinsvik have experienced rapid housing construction without a corresponding increase of public transport. Further out is a large corporate center with many of Bergen's largest employers, such as Telenor, Statoil and BKK. The area was built without sufficient roads or public transport, and has among the worst road congestion in the urban area. Building the light rail line to Flesland will supplement the airport shuttles and offer cheaper service for locals and employees at the airport. Another incentive to <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Flesland {{was that there was}} sufficient available land which allows a large depot to be constructed. After the line was opened to Lagunen, there was insufficient space at Kronstad to house additional trams. The line to the airport is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E
