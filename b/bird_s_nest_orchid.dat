50|$|The Lóndrangar are {{remnants}} from {{a bigger}} crater which has mostly eroded away. It is reckoned that the {{rock in the}} slopes of nearby Svalþúfa is an isolated {{part of the original}} rim around the crater itself, with the rest eroded away by the sea. There are many <b>bird</b> <b>nest</b> <b>s</b> in the steep slopes of the twin towers and birds which can be observed are black-legged kittiwake, common murre, puffin and northern fulmar. At one time the coastal area around Lóndrangar, Drangsvogur, was used for the landing of fishing vessels with up to 12 fishing boats making use of it as a natural harbor.|$|R
50|$|The dense {{foliage of}} the beech canopy {{results in a}} rather minimal ground flora but species like bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> are found amongst the leaf litter. The high {{humidity}} of the more sheltered parts of the gorge encourage the growth of ferns, mosses and other lower plants including the lichen, Stricta sylvatica and the hay-scented buckler fern.|$|R
25|$|The estate {{woodlands}} contains typical species, such as copper beech, horse-chestnut, yew, bay-laurel, oaks, ornamental pines, {{and a fine}} walnut. Several {{very large}} beeches and sycamores are also present. The Glenfield Ramblers recorded two especially rare species {{in the area of}} the Lainshaw Estate, the lesser wintergreen and the bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid.</b> Unfortunately no precise details of the site were recorded.|$|R
50|$|Woodland plants include wood sorrel, blackthorn, bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid,</b> wood anemone, bluebell, wood avens, bugle, ramsons, self-heal, dog violet, honeysuckle, holly, lords and ladies, {{herb robert}} and woody nightshade. Woods {{dominated}} by oak and birch, with lesser amounts of rowan, holly, hazel, yew and aspen are called western oakwoods and occur principally in the uplands of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are temperate rainforests.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} small {{remnant of}} the medieval royal hunting Rockingham Forest. Short Wood is ancient {{semi-natural}} woodland with the dominant trees being ash and pedunculate oak. Flora include several local rarities such as wood speedwell, bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> and greater butterfly orchid. Southwick Wood lost its elms in the late 1960s due to Dutch elm disease, and it now has oak, ash, field maple and hazel.|$|R

50|$|The Common {{is noted}} for its wild flowers, with {{thriving}} communities of yellow archangel (Galeobdolon luteum), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Spurge-laurel (Daphne laureola) is sparsely but widely distributed. The Common {{is also home to}} such interesting species as stinking hellebore (Helleborus foetidus), green hellebore (H. viridis ssp. occidentalis), bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> (Neottia nidus-avis), violet helleborine (Epipactis purpurata), the extreme rarity E. x schulzei (first British record here, 1931), and green-flowered helleborine (E. phyllanthes).|$|R
50|$|The ground flora {{includes}} {{ferns and}} a spring display of primrose, bluebell, dog-violet, wood anemone and early purple orchid. Also recorded are green hellebore, bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> and fingered sedge. Wild flowers grow {{on the open}} rock faces, cliff ledges and in the quarries. These include hairy violet, yellow-wort, lesser calamint, oxeye daisy, red valerian and shining crane's-bill. The flora of the saltmarsh includes sea aster, English scurvy-grass, sea milkwort and buck's-horn plantain. There {{are a variety of}} lichens and mosses.|$|R
50|$|Denge Wood is {{particularly}} notable for {{the range of}} orchids that it supports. twayblade (Neottia ovata), common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii), pyramidal orchid (Anacamptis pyramidalis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha), man orchid (Aceras anthropophorum) and fragrant orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea) occur in the scrubland and chalk grassland. The early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera), lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> (Neottia nidus-avis) {{can be found in}} woodland areas whilst there is also a large population of the rare lady orchid (Orchis purpurea).|$|R
50|$|Unusual {{plants in}} the wood include oxlip (a {{national}} rarity {{at the edge of}} its European range here), herb paris, bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> and nettle-leaved bellflower. There are plants typical of ancient woodland: common bluebell, dog's mercury, yellow archangel, wood millet and wood anemone. Potton Wood has large areas of broadleaved woodland, some dating back to at least 1601, but also had commercially planted, non-native conifers which were removed in 2004 as part of a long term project to restore the coppiced ancient woodland.|$|R
50|$|Aller and Beer Woods are {{outstanding}} {{examples of}} ancient, escarpment woodland managed {{in a traditional}} coppice-with-standards system. The woodland is {{a variant of the}} calcareous ash/Wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), andash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of Wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum).|$|R
50|$|About 400 {{species of}} {{flowering}} plants, plus one gymnosperm (Parasitaxus usta), are parasitic on mycorrhizal fungi. This effectively gives these plants {{the ability to}} become associated {{with many of the}} other plants around them. They are termed myco-heterotrophs rather than parasitic plants. Some myco-heterotrophs are Indian pipe (Monotropa uniflora), snow plant (Sarcodes sanguinea), underground orchid (Rhizanthella gardneri), bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchid</b> (Neottia nidus-avis), and sugarstick (Allotropa virgata). Within the taxonomic family Ericaceae, known for extensive mycorrhizal relationships, there are the Monotropoids. The Monotropoids include the genera Monotropa, Monotropsis, and Pterospora among others. Myco-heterotrophic behavior is commonly accompanied by the loss of chlorophyll.|$|R

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's <b>nest</b> <b>orchids.</b> The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet.
