5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E
5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating. The interruption of the war had forced the suspension of the rule to account for players' military service, however, and {{he was allowed to}} leave college. The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back at Ohio State to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{initially}} remained neutral during World War I, but by 1915, had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> by the Triple Entente {{to enter}} the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Both the Italians and Austro-Hungarians adopted a cautious fleet policy in the confined waters of the Adriatic Sea, and so the four Regina Elena-class battleships did not see action. They spent the war rotating between the naval bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona. After {{the end of the}} war, the ships of the class were included amongst the battleships that Italy could keep in service (by the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty), but they were retained only for a few years. Between February 1923 and September 1926, all four ships were stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap.|$|E

40|$|Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008] {{study the}} {{spreading}} {{of a message}} in an Erdős-Rényi random graph G(n, p) starting from a set of vertices that <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of the message initially. In their strictmajority scenario, whenever {{more than half of}} the neighbors of a vertex v <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of a message, v itself also becomes convinced. The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can <b>be</b> <b>convinced.</b> Following Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008], we derive lower bounds on the minimum number min-seed(n, p) of vertices that need to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> initially so that all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. Our main results are that min-seed(n, p) = Ω (min { n, p 2 n 2 }) and min-seed(n, p) = Ω (n 2 / 3) hold with high probability. We also consider the case of random seeds. For any sufficiently large constant d> 0 and any s ≤ n/(d ln n), we show that if one picks the set of seeds uniformly at random from the family of all s-sized sets, then with high probability, not all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. ...|$|R
5|$|Mahler had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> {{from the}} start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an {{expression}} of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by Deryck Cooke—to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.9 as a defining human statement for its century.|$|E
5|$|Malone had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> {{for some}} time that war was on the horizon and {{prepared}} himself accordingly. He studied military history and practices intensively, and underwent a physical fitness and conditioning programme in preparation for military service. This reputedly included his sleeping on a military camp bed. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service either in New Zealand or overseas. Well regarded by his superiors in the Territorial Force, he was made commander of the Wellington Infantry Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF).|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} were {{slated to be}} {{scrapped}} in 1914–15 due to their age, but the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 prevented their disposal. Italy initially remained neutral during the war, but by 1915, had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> by the Triple Entente to enter the war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Both Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and Emanuele Filiberto were used as harbor defense ships in Venice {{for the duration of}} the war, and did not see action there. Neither ship remained in service long after the end of the war. Emanuele Filiberto was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and Ammiraglio di Saint Bon was stricken on 18 June. Both ships were subsequently discarded.|$|E

5|$|Đurić {{announced}} {{his decision to}} quit professional football {{at the end of}} the 2014 season, having <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> by the club management to postpone his initial plans to retire at the end of 2012. He started the season having scored a record 378 domestic goals. Tampines failed to reach the 2014 AFC Champions League after losing to South China at the first qualifying round. The club dropped into the 2014 AFC Cup accordingly, and was eventually eliminated in the group stage. He ended the season with eight goals in 35 appearances across all competitions as Tampines finished third in the league. Đurić retired from his playing career after his final match in a 2–1 loss to Brunei DPMM in the Singapore Cup third-place play-off match on 5 November 2014.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would {{maintain}} the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
5|$|In Seattle, {{two friends}} argue about {{applying}} for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (Michael R. Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> by school counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his progress is too mediocre {{to make it}} worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend and colleague Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E

5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E
