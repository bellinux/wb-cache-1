30|$|Various {{practical}} issues are {{addressed in this}} section and the previous section (Section 3) based on a LTE-like system. Specifically, results shown in this section are with ACI, and results shown in Section 3 are without ACI. The simulation parameters are specified in Table  1, if not otherwise indicated. To {{examine the effects of}} ACI on a given receiver, consider two transmitters: one transmitter is desired and generates the desired signal, and the other transmitter is not desired and generates ACI. Presented in this section are the following three scenarios. In the first scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another PU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU. In the second scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another SU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PU. In the third scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another SU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> third SU.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E

Of these, it is in the best surviving condition. It lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow on the western side of the river.

All {{members of the group}} are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound.

At the trial Xu Ming testified that he gave Bo's wife Gu Kailai $3.23 million in 2000 to buy the villa Fontaine St-Georges in Nice, France, and that he paid for their son Bo Guagua's travel and credit card bills.
