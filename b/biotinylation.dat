25|$|Electron {{microscopy}} or EM {{can be used}} {{to study}} the detailed microarchitecture of tissues or cells. Immuno-EM allows the detection of specific proteins in ultrathin tissue sections. Antibodies labelled with heavy metal particles (e.g. gold) can be directly visualised using transmission electron microscopy. While powerful in detecting the sub-cellular localisation of a protein, immuno-EM can be technically challenging, expensive, and require rigorous optimisation of tissue fixation and processing methods. Protein <b>biotinylation</b> in vivo was proposed to alleviate the problems caused by frequent incompatibility of antibody staining with fixation protocols that better preserve cell morphology.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin is {{important}} in fatty acid synthesis, branched-chain amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. It covalently attaches to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues in these carboxylases. This <b>biotinylation</b> reaction requires ATP and is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase. In bacteria, biotin is attached to biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by biotin protein ligase (BirA in E. coli). The attachment of biotin to various chemical sites, <b>biotinylation,</b> is used as an important laboratory technique to study various processes, including protein localization, protein interactions, DNA transcription, and replication. [...] Biotinidase itself {{is known to be}} able to biotinylate histone proteins, but little biotin is found naturally attached to chromatin.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin {{is widely}} used {{throughout}} the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein {{will most likely be}} unaffected. This process is called <b>biotinylation.</b> Because both streptavidin and avidin bind biotin with high affinity (Kd of [...] 10−14mol/l to 10−15mol/l) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. [...] The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest. [...] Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away. [...] However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6M guanidine HCl at pH1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest. [...] To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ~10−8mol/l, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.|$|E
5000|$|Proteins can be {{biotinylated}} chemically or enzymatically. Chemical <b>biotinylation</b> utilises various conjugation chemistries {{to yield}} nonspecific <b>biotinylation</b> of amines, carboxylates, sulfhydryls and carbohydrates (e.g., NHS-coupling gives <b>biotinylation</b> of any primary amines in the protein). Enzymatic <b>biotinylation</b> results in <b>biotinylation</b> {{of a specific}} lysine within a certain sequence by a bacterial biotin ligase. [...] Most chemical <b>biotinylation</b> reagents consist of a reactive group attached via a linker to the valeric acid side chain of biotin. As the biotin binding pocket in avidin / streptavidin is buried beneath the protein surface, <b>biotinylation</b> reagents possessing a longer linker are desirable, as they enable the biotin molecule to be more accessible to binding avidin/streptavidin/Neutravidin protein. This linker can also mediate the solubility of <b>biotinylation</b> reagents; linkers that incorporate poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) can make water-insoluble reagents soluble or increase the solubility of <b>biotinylation</b> reagents that are already soluble to some extent.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to primary amine <b>biotinylation</b> is to label sulfhydryl groups with biotin. Because free sulfhydryl groups are less prevalent on most proteins compared to primary amines, sulfhydryl <b>biotinylation</b> is useful when primary amines {{are located in}} the regulatory domain(s) of the target protein or when a reduced level of <b>biotinylation</b> is required. Sulfhydryl-reactive groups such as maleimides, haloacetyls and pyridyl disulfides, require free sulfhydryl groups for conjugation; disulfide bonds must first be reduced to free up the sulfhydryl groups for <b>biotinylation.</b> If no free sulfhydryl groups are available, lysines can be modified with various thiolation reagents (Traut's reagent, SAT(PEG4), SATA and SATP), resulting in the addition of a free sulfhydryl. Sulfhydryl <b>biotinylation</b> is performed at a slightly lower pH (6.5-7.5) than labeling with NHS esters. Besides whole proteins, biotinylated peptides can be synthesized by introducing a cysteine (Cys) residue during synthesis at the terminus of the amino acid chain to get a site specific and oriented <b>biotinylation.</b> Nucleotides can also be biotinylated by incorporation of biotinylated nucleotides.|$|E
50|$|Photoactivatable <b>biotinylation</b> {{reagents}} {{can also}} be used to activate <b>biotinylation</b> at specific times in an experiment or during certain reaction conditions, by simply exposing the reaction to UV light at the specific time or condition.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to chemical <b>biotinylation</b> methods, enzymatic <b>biotinylation</b> allows biotin {{to be linked}} at exactly one residue present in the protein. This <b>biotinylation</b> reaction can also go to completion, meaning that the product is generated with high uniformity and {{can be linked to}} streptavidin in a defined orientation e.g. for MHC multimers. Enzymatic <b>biotinylation</b> is most often carried out by fusing the protein of interest at its N-terminus, C-terminus or at an internal loop to a 15 amino acid peptide, termed AviTag or Acceptor Peptide (AP). [...] This tag serves as a recognition site for a E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase, also known as biotin ligase (BirA). Once tagged, the protein is then incubated with BirA allowing <b>biotinylation</b> to take place in the presence of biotin and ATP. Enzymatic <b>biotinylation</b> can be carried out in vitro but BirA also reacts specifically with its target peptide inside mammalian and bacterial cells and at the cell surface, while other cellular proteins are not modified. Enzymatic <b>biotinylation</b> can also take place in vivo typically through the co-expression of an Avitag tagged protein and BirA. Another way to biotinylate proteins is by fusing the target protein to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). A protein fused by BCCP can be recognized by biotin molecules in vivo and attach to it.|$|E
50|$|Carboxyl {{groups are}} {{found on the}} C-terminal ends of {{proteins}} and on glutamate and aspartate amino acid side chains. <b>Biotinylation</b> reagents that target carboxyl groups {{do not have a}} carboxyl-reactive moiety per se but instead rely on a carbodiimide crosslinker such as EDC to bind the primary amine on the <b>biotinylation</b> reagents to the carboxyl group on the target protein.|$|E
5000|$|Photoactivatable <b>biotinylation</b> {{reagents}} {{are ideal}} when primary amines, sulfhydryls, carboxyls and carbohydrates {{are not available}} for labeling. These reagents rely on aryl azides, which become activated by ultraviolet light (UV; >350 nm), which then react at C-H and N-H bonds. Because these types of bonds occur independent {{of the type of}} amino acid, this type of <b>biotinylation</b> is termed [...] "non-specific".|$|E

50|$|Luciferase {{can also}} be used to detect the level of {{cellular}} ATP in cell viability assays or for kinase activity assays. Luciferase can act as an ATP sensor protein through <b>biotinylation.</b> <b>Biotinylation</b> will immobilize luciferase on the cell-surface by binding to a streptavidin-biotin complex. This allows luciferase to detect the efflux of ATP from the cell and will effectively display the real-time release of ATP through bioluminescence. Luciferase can additionally be made more sensitive for ATP detection by increasing the luminescence intensity by changing certain amino acid residues in the sequence of the protein.|$|E
50|$|Citrulline {{residues}} can be {{chemically modified}} with butanedione or <b>biotinylation</b> prior to analysis, {{leading to a}} different mass shift, and this strategy has successfully been used to facilitates identification by mass spectrometry.|$|E
50|$|Lysine can be {{modified}} through acetylation (acetyllysine), methylation (methyllysine), ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation, <b>biotinylation,</b> pupylation, and carboxylation, which tends to modify {{the function of the}} protein of which the modified lysine residue(s) are a part.|$|E
5000|$|The non-covalent bond formed between biotin and avidin or {{streptavidin}} has {{a binding}} affinity that {{is higher than}} most antigen and antibody bonds and approaches {{the strength of a}} covalent bond. This very tight binding makes labeling proteins with biotin a useful tool for applications such as affinity chromatography using immobilized avidin or streptavidin to separate the biotinylated protein from a mixture of other proteins and biochemicals. Biotinylated protein such as biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used in solid-phase assays as a coating on the well surface in multiwell assay plates. <b>Biotinylation</b> of red blood cells {{has been used as a}} means of determining total blood volume without the use of radiolabels such as chromium 51, allowing volume determinations in low birth weight infants and pregnant women who could not otherwise be exposed to the required doses of radioactivity. Furthermore, <b>biotinylation</b> of MHC molecules to create MHC multimers has become a useful tool for identifying and isolating antigen-specific T-cell populations. More recently, in vivo protein <b>biotinylation</b> was developed to study protein-protein interactions and proximity in living cells ...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} targets for modifying protein {{molecules}} are primary amine {{groups that are}} present as lysine side chain epsilon-amines and N-terminal α-amines. Amine-reactive <b>biotinylation</b> reagents {{can be divided into}} two groups based on water solubility.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biotinylation</b> at {{carboxyl}} groups occur at pH 4.5-5.5. To prevent crossreactivity of the crosslinker with buffer constituents, buffers should not contain primary amines (e.g., Tris, glycine) or carboxyls (e.g., acetate, citrate); MES buffer {{is an ideal}} choice.|$|E
50|$|Glycoproteins can be {{biotinylated}} by {{modifying the}} carbohydrate residues to aldehydes, which then react with hydrazine- or alkoxyamine-based <b>biotinylation</b> reagents. Sodium periodate oxidizes the sialic acids on glycoproteins to aldehydes to form these stable linkages at pH 4-6.|$|E
50|$|Reaction {{conditions}} for <b>biotinylation</b> are chosen {{so that the}} target molecule (e.g., an antibody) is labeled with sufficient biotin molecules to purify or detect the molecule, {{but not so much}} that the biotin interferes with the function of the molecule.|$|E
50|$|In biochemistry, <b>biotinylation</b> is {{the process}} of covalently {{attaching}} biotin to a protein, nucleic acid or other molecule. <b>Biotinylation</b> is rapid, specific and is unlikely to perturb the natural function of the molecule due to the small size of biotin (MW = 244.31 g/mol). Biotin binds to streptavidin and avidin with an extremely high affinity, fast on-rate, and high specificity, and these interactions are exploited in many areas of biotechnology to isolate biotinylated molecules of interest. Biotin-binding to streptavidin and avidin is resistant to extremes of heat, pH and proteolysis, making capture of biotinylated molecules possible {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Also, multiple biotin molecules can be conjugated to a protein of interest, which allows binding of multiple streptavidin, avidin or Neutravidin protein molecules and increases the sensitivity of detection of the protein of interest. There is a large number of <b>biotinylation</b> reagents available that exploit the wide range of possible labelling methods. Due to the strong affinity between biotin and streptavidin, the purification of biotinylated proteins has been a widely used approach to identify protein-protein interactions and post-translational events such as ubiquitylation in molecular biology.|$|E
50|$|The {{photoactivatable}} group provides nonspecific {{labeling of}} proteins, DNA and RNA probes or other molecules. <b>Biotinylation</b> of DNA and RNA with photoactivatable biotin is easier {{and less expensive}} than enzymatic methods since the DNA and RNA does not degrade. Photobiotin is most effectively activated by light at 260-475 nm.|$|E
50|$|Extent of <b>biotinylation</b> {{can also}} be {{measured}} by streptavidin gel-shift, since streptavidin remains bound to biotin during agarose gel electrophoresis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proportion of target biotinylated can be measured via the change in band intensity of the target with or without excess streptavidin, seen quickly and quantitatively for biotinylated proteins by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.|$|E
50|$|N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters have poor {{solubility}} in aqueous solutions. For {{reactions in}} aqueous solution, they {{must first be}} dissolved in an organic solvent, then diluted into the aqueous reaction mixture. The most commonly used organic solvents for this purpose are dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethyl formamide (DMF), which are compatible with most proteins at low concentrations. Because of the hydrophobicity of NHS-esters, NHS <b>biotinylation</b> reagents can also diffuse through the cell membrane, meaning that they will biotinylate {{both internal and external}} components of a cell.Sulfo-NHS esters are more soluble in water and should be dissolved in water just before use because they hydrolyze easily. The water solubility of sulfo-NHS-esters stems from their sulfonate group on the N-hydroxysuccinimide ring and eliminates the need to dissolve the reagent in an organic solvent. Sulfo-NHS-esters of biotin also can be used as cell surface <b>biotinylation</b> reagents, because they do not penetrate the cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|Acetylation of amines {{followed}} by tryptic digestion and <b>biotinylation</b> of free N-terminal peptides uses chemical (acetylation) to label free lysines and N-termini. The blocked N-termini is then negatively selected. However, the naturally free internal N-termini and blocked N-termini cannot be distinguished after acetylation. This method {{does not use}} isotopic labeling, thus {{it is difficult to}} quantify the findings. Also, it is hard distinguish between experimental and background proteolysis products.|$|E
50|$|Subtiligase <b>biotinylation</b> of N-termini uses enzymatic {{labeling}} of N-terminal peptides, {{but does not}} use lysine blocking chemicals. Without lysine blocking, many of the cleaved N-terminal peptide will be too short for identification. The results can be highly dependent on the properties of subtiligase thus may be biased. This method does not capture naturally blocked N-termini and also does not use isotopic labeling thus {{it would be difficult}} to quantify findings.|$|E
50|$|The HABA (2-(4-hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid) assay {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the extent of <b>biotinylation.</b> HABA dye is bound to avidin or streptavidin and yields a characteristic absorbance. When biotinylated proteins or other molecules are introduced, the biotin displaces the dye, resulting in a change in absorbance at 500 nm. This change is directly proportional to the level of biotin in the sample. The disadvantage of the HABA assay is that it uses large amounts of sample.|$|E
50|$|Lysine guanidination {{followed}} by <b>biotinylation</b> of N-termini uses a chemical to block lysine residues and tag free N-termini. The tagged free N-termini is then selected. The down {{side to this}} method is that the findings {{cannot be applied to}} a statistical model using non-cleaved peptides due to not being able to capture naturally blocked N-termini. Since it does not involve isotopic labeling, the results cannot be quantified. The cleavage site also has to be already known to do labeling.|$|E
50|$|Protein tags {{may allow}} {{specific}} enzymatic modification (such as <b>biotinylation</b> by biotin ligase) or chemical modification (such as reaction with FlAsH-EDT2 for fluorescence imaging). Often tags are combined, {{in order to}} connect proteins to multiple other components. However, {{with the addition of}} each tag comes the risk that the native function of the protein may be abolished or compromised by interactions with the tag. Therefore, after purification, tags are sometimes removed by specific proteolysis (e.g. by TEV protease, Thrombin, Factor Xa or Enteropeptidase).|$|E
50|$|For Chem-seq to be feasible, {{the small}} {{molecule}} under study must be amenable to <b>biotinylation</b> without disruption of its natural binding properties. This {{is simply not}} possible with certain small molecules and even when it is, the process can require expertise in organic chemistry. Once synthesized, the binding properties of the biotinylated compound must be tested. To date, this has been accomplished by comparing the binding kinetics of the biotinylated and unmodified compounds, a process that requires prior knowledge of the proteins that the compound binds.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic nanochains are a {{new class}} of magnetoresponsive and superparamagnetic {{nanostructures}} with highly anisotropic shapes which can be manipulated using magnetic field and magnetic field gradient. Such nanochains consist of self-assembled nanoparticle clusters which are magnetically assembled and fixated into a chain. Among the various linking methods used are silica coating, polyacrylic acid (PAA) coating, tetraethoxysilane condensation, <b>biotinylation</b> or glucose decomposition. Typically, the primary building blocks of these nanostructures are individual superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). Nanoparticle clusters which are composed of a number of individual magnetic nanoparticles (ca. 100 SPIONs) are known as magnetic nanobeads with a diameter of 50-200 nanometers.|$|E
5000|$|Cell {{debris in}} the sheared lysate is then cleared by {{sedimentation}} and protein-DNA complexes are selectively immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies to the protein(s) of interest. The antibodies are commonly coupled to agarose, sepharose or magnetic beads. Alternatively, chomatin-antibody complexes can be selectively retained and eluted by inert polymer discs. The immunoprecipitated complexes (i.e., the bead-antibody-protein-target DNA sequence complex) are then collected and washed to remove non-specifically bound chromatin, the protein-DNA cross-link is reversed and proteins are removed by digestion with proteinase K. An epitope-tagged {{version of the}} protein of interest, or in vivo <b>biotinylation</b> [...] can be used instead of antibodies to the native protein of interest.|$|E
50|$|One {{challenge}} for the 'exonuclease approach', where a processive enzyme feeds individual bases, in the correct order, into the nanopore, is to integrate the exonuclease and the nanopore detection systems. In particular, {{the problem is that}} when an exonuclease hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in DNA, the subsequently released nucleotide is not necessarily guaranteed to directly move into, say, a nearby alpha-hemolysin nanopore. One idea is to attach the exonuclease to the nanopore, perhaps through <b>biotinylation</b> to the beta barrel hemolysin. The central pore of the protein may be lined with charged residues arranged so that the positive and negative charges appear {{on opposite sides of the}} pore. However, this mechanism is primarily discriminatory and does not constitute a mechanism to guide nucleotides down some particular path.|$|E
