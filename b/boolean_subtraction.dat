Firstly, {{the idea}} put forward {{in this paper}} is Contemporary Integrated Manufacturing System (CIMS) {{environment}} needs the In-Process Models (IPMs) which are associated completely with the information of design and manufacturing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient and robust algorithm for the geometric determination of swept volumes during the simulation of NC-milling (three-axis machining and five-axis machining). The boundary Y {{of the volume}} swept by a cutter F is represented polygonally by using instantaneous helical motions to exactly determine the line of contact between F and Y. Applying concepts of differential geometry allows a better and more efficient approximation of tool paths. Tool paths are explicitly calculated when a design surface G is to be milled along prescribed curves. We also describe how to quickly determine a polygonized representation of the truncated material during the milling process by means of "G-buffering". This polygon-oriented algorithm is perfectly suitable for <b>Boolean</b> <b>subtractions</b> and error assessment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCutter-workpiece {{engagement}} (CWE) is the instantaneous contact geometry {{between the}} cutter and the in-process workpiece during machining. It {{plays an important}} role in machining process simulation and directly affects the calculation of the predicted cutting forces and torques. The difficulty and challenge of CWE determination come from the complexity due to the changing geometry of in-process workpiece and the curved tool path of cutter movement, especially for multi-axis milling. This paper presents a new method to determine the CWE for general milling processes. To fulfill the requirement of generality, which means for any cutter type, any in-process workpiece shape, and any tool path even with self-intersections, all the associated geometries are to be modeled as triangle meshes. The involved triangle-to-triangle intersection calculations are carried out by an effective method in order to realize the multiple <b>subtraction</b> <b>Boolean</b> operations between the tool and the workpiece mesh models and to determine the CWE. The presented method has been validated by a series of case studies of increasing machining complexity to demonstrate its applicability to general milling processes...|$|R
3000|$|As aforementioned, {{the domain}} [...] _w(t) {{in which we}} are {{interested}} in computing the fluid velocity and pressure is represented by the portion of water surrounding the ship hull. The time varying shape of such domain—and in particular that of its boundary with the air above—is one of the unknowns of the fluid dynamic problem. By convention, we place the origin of the vertical axis Z in correspondence with the undisturbed free surface level, and we start each simulation at time t= 0 from such undisturbed configuration. Thus, at least in its initial configuration, the flow domain is represented by [...] _w(t= 0) = R^ 3 _Z-, which is the <b>boolean</b> <b>subtraction</b> of the hull volume from the lower half-space of R^ 3 for which Z< 0, here indicated with R^ 3 _Z-.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} for reconstructing a 3 D object from a construction design sketch under an orthogonal isometric project. In general, for a mechanical part, it can be constructed from a base geometry and then incrementally add or cut other basic constructive elements. During a conceptual design process, designers work through this basic form construction process with freehand drawing, a construction sketch can be received progressively with principal and construction lines. This construction sketch contains information about a valid construction process with related elements, which in turn can support CSG-based solid modeling. The construction sketch can be partitioned into several feature drawing; each feature drawing can be topologically represented a feature graph, and easily recognized as a projection of a corresponding 3 D constructive element. While the relationship between two feature graphs gives information to construction methods such as add (Boolean Union) or cut (<b>Boolean</b> <b>Subtraction).</b> From these information, reconstructing a valid 3 D object from an construction sketch can be achieved interactively, realizing the “What You Draw is What You Get” design fashion without pre-defined gestures. This paper details construction sketch partitioning and analysis techniques for 3 D reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the paper}} is to present an {{evaluation}} of a new mixed CAD modeling method, capable to universally build surfaces and solid models of gears. The proposed CAD solution builds gear models, primary not for a visual simulation of the gearing processes, but for complex gearing- and FEA studies in virtual environment. Localization of the contact paths of gear pairs, virtual kinematic evaluations, rapid verification of newly developed gear types and FEA analysis requires satisfactorily precise surface and solid models. The known NURBS modeling methods are mainly based on the analytical equations of the flanks of the teeth surfaces. The bottom and tip surfaces of the teeth, are very important in meshing and FEA studies, and generally cannot be built from the meshing equations. As the new mixed modeling method proposes a simplified and quick CAD modeling procedure, with flexible modeling options like rapid tool profile modifications, {{an evaluation of the}} obtained models must be made, from both: generating time and precision point of view. For this purpose, a model of a spur cylindrical gear (generated by a convolute helical hob) is built using the Solid <b>Boolean</b> <b>Subtraction</b> method and is compared with the gear generating process using a new mixed CAD method...|$|E
