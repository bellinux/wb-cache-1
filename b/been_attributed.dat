5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: cranberry and scots pine. Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> with a badge of cranberry. Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox. The badge of scots pine has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to all seven clans of Siol Alpin: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.|$|E
5|$|Large surface {{temperature}} variations on 55Cancrie have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to possible volcanic activity releasing large {{clouds of dust}} which blanket the planet and block thermal emissions.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn {{a correlation between}} hypothesized causes {{and the history of}} patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E

Powel and {{his wife}} Elizabeth (née Willing) lavishly redecorated, creating {{some of the most}} ornate interiors in the Colonies.

50|$|In the {{biological}} tradition, psychological disorders <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to biological causes {{and in the}} psychological tradition, disorders <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to faulty psychological development and to social context.

5|$|Minnesotans {{participate}} in {{high levels of}} physical activity, {{and many of these}} activities are outdoors. The strong interest of Minnesotans in environmentalism has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to the popularity of these pursuits.|$|E
5|$|No {{version of}} the game has been {{released}} outside Japan. This has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Nintendo's policy of censoring religious references in games, which rendered the early Megami Tensei titles unsuitable for localization due to their central religious elements. A fan translation of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei was released on August 28, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to the {{influences}} of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, {{and this is the}} source of the merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
5|$|The Copse Road Chapel is an Independent Evangelical Church, {{which was}} built in 1851 and has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Foster and Wood of Bristol, who also {{designed}} the United Reformed Church on Hill Road.

5|$|The {{first case}} {{description}} of pituitary apoplexy has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to the American neurologist Pearce Bailey in 1898. This was followed in 1905 by a further {{report from the}} German physician Bleibtreu. Surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925. Before the introduction of steroid replacement, the mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50%.|$|E

50|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study of the}} ozone formed from the oxidation of nitrogen dioxide in ambient air reported by the WHO suggested that daily deaths of 1 to 2% <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to exposure to ozone concentration above 47.3 ppb and exposure above 75.7ppb <b>is</b> <b>attributed</b> to 3 to 5% increase in daily mortality. A level of 114 ppb <b>was</b> <b>attributed</b> to 5 to 9% increase daily mortality.|$|R

5|$|These routes – {{spreading}} religion, {{trade and}} technology – {{have historically been}} vital {{to the growth of}} urban civilization. The extent of development of cities, and the level of their integration into a larger world system, has often <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to their position in various active transport networks.|$|E
5|$|A few sculptures, {{including}} Epimetheus and Pandora, have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to El Greco. This doubtful attribution {{is based}} on the testimony of Pacheco (he saw in El Greco's studio a series of figurines, but these may have been merely models). There are also four drawings among the surviving works of El Greco; three of them are preparatory works for the altarpiece of Santo Domingo el Antiguo and the fourth is a study for one of his paintings, The Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} accomplishments in sports have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to Clement, but cannot be confirmed {{because of poor}} record keeping at the time. These claims include winning tennis championships in Iowa and South Dakota and setting world records in shot put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball, where it is claimed that Clement threw a baseball 275 feet.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} {{piezoelectricity}} in Topaz can probably <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> to ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: orthorhombic bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties which <b>are</b> <b>attributed</b> to such ordering.|$|R
5|$|Amanda E. Clement (March 20, 1888 – July 20, 1971) was {{the first}} woman paid to umpire a {{baseball}} game, and may have also been the first woman to referee a high school basketball game. Clement served as an umpire on a regular basis for six years, and served occasionally for several decades afterwards. An accomplished athlete in multiple disciplines, Clement competed in baseball, basketball, track, gymnastics, and tennis, and has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> world records in shot put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to their social organisation {{and their ability to}} modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced {{increased risk of}} extinction because of global warming.|$|E

5|$|Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, {{and were}} {{described}} on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption.

5|$|Benfica {{won their}} first European title in 1961, {{defeating}} Barcelona {{to win the}} European Cup, and successfully retained the title {{in the following year}} after defeating Real Madrid. Since then, they appeared in five more finals – 1963, '65, '68, '88 and '90 – but failed to reconquer the title. These consecutive final losses have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to a famous curse by Hungarian manager Béla Guttmann in 1962. Benfica have also played in three UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League finals – 1983, 2013 and '14 – losing all three.|$|E
5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> to one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
