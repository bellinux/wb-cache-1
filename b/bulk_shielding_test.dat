40|$|A <b>bulk</b> <b>shielding</b> {{experiment}} was {{performed at the}} D-T neutron source FNS, using the assembly simulating shield blanket, vacuum vessel and toroidal field coil (superconducting magnet) of ITER. The objective {{was to investigate the}} influence on nuclear parameters due to the nuclei involved in the toroidal field coil and the effect of B 4 C:Pb. The analysis was performed by MCNP 4 -A and the DOT 3. 5 (P 5 S 16 approximation, 175 -n and 42 -g groups with and without self-shielding correction) with JENDL Fusion File (JENDL-FF) and FENDL:E- 1. 1. All of the MCNP calculations and DOT calculations with self-shielding correction agreed within 940 % with the measurements. It was found that the influence of self-shielding mainly due to copper and tantalum in the DOT calculations was large for neutrons less than 10 keV. It is concluded that the uncertainty of nuclear designs by MCNP- 4 A and DOT 3. 5 with JENDL-FF and FENDL:E- 1. 1 on the <b>bulk</b> <b>shield</b> of ITER is approximately 40 % in the toroidal coil region. The analysis suggested that it was quite important to deal with heavy nuclei of small quantity such as tantalum precisely in the shielding design. © 1998 Elsevier Science S. A.

This facility, called the 'National Synchrotron Light Source II' (NSLS-II), will provide x-ray radiation of ultra-high brightness and exceptional spatial and energy resolution. It will also provide advanced insertion devices, optics, detectors, and robotics, and a suite of scientific instruments designed to maximize the scientific output of the facility. The project scope includes the design, construction, installation, and commissioning of the following accelerators: a 200 MeV linac, a booster accelerator operating from 200 MeV to 3. 0 GeV, and the storage ring which stores a maximum of 500 mA current of electrons at an energy of 3. 0 GeV. It is planned to operate the facility primarily in a top-off mode, thereby maintaining the maximum variation in stored beam current to < 1 %.

The scope of the relevant tests becomes wider and the requirements, especially {{in the range of}} safety, reliability and comfort, become higher. Of particular significance, are in recent years, tests concerning electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of whole vehicles and their subassemblies. A survey of basic standardized EMC test methods is presented in the paper. Moreover, an alternative test method of vehicle immunity worked out by authors is proposed.
