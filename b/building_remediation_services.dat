40|$|Vacant and {{abandoned}} buildings pose significant {{challenges to the}} health and safety of communities. In 2011 the City of Philadelphia began enforcing a Doors and Windows Ordi-nance that required property owners of abandoned buildings to install working doors and windows in all structural openings or face significant fines. We tested the effects of the new ordinance on the occurrence of crime surrounding abandoned buildings from January 2011 to April 2013 using a difference-in-differences approach. We used Poisson regression mod-els to compare differences in pre- and post-treatment measures of crime for buildings that were remediated as a result of the ordinance (n = 676) or permitted for renovation (n = 241), and randomly-matched control buildings that were not remediated (n = 676) or permitted for renovation (n = 964), while also controlling for sociodemographic and other confounders measured around each <b>building.</b> <b>Building</b> <b>remediations</b> were significantly associated with citywide reductions in overall crimes, total assaults, gun assaults and nuisance crimes (p < 0. 001). <b>Building</b> <b>remediations</b> were also significantly associated with reductions in vio-lent gun crimes in one city section (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract: Administrative and Support and Waste Management and <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services</b> sector {{comprises}} establishments performing routine support {{activities for}} the day-to-day operations of other organizations. These essential activities are often undertaken in-house by establishments in many sectors of the economy. The establishments in this sector specialize {{in one or more}} of these support activities and provide these services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households. Activities performed include: office administration, hiring and placing of personnel, document preparation and similar clerical services, solicitation, collection, security and surveillance services, cleaning, and waste disposal services. This paper research provides information relating to employment and unemployment in waste management and <b>remediation</b> <b>services.</b> While most data are obtained from employer or establishment surveys, information on industry unemployment comes from a national survey of households. The following tables present an overview of the industry including the number of jobs, the unemployment rate of those previously employed in the industry, mass layoffs, data for occupations common to the industry, and projections of occupational employment change. We are gather information from Albanian projects and incentives on waste management. Why waste management is still with problems in Albania?

Sample data were assembled for sixteen radionuclides and thirty-five chemical analytes. The characterization data were provided to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{in support of}} the Tank Waste <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services</b> Privatization Support Project. The purpose of this report is to present the results and document the methodology used in preparing the waste characterization information data set to support the Tank Waste <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services</b> Privatization Support Project. This report describes the methodology used in assembling the waste characterization information and how that information was validated by a panel of independent technical reviewers. Also, contained in this report are the various data sets created: the master data set, a subset, and an unreviewed data set. The master data set contains waste composition information for Tanks 241 -AN- 102 and - 107, 241 -AP- 102 and - 105, 241 -AW- 101; and 241 -AZ- 101 and - 102. The subset contains only the validated analytical sample data from the master data set. The unreviewed data set contains all collected but unreviewed sample data for Tanks 241 -AN- 104, - 105, and - 106; 241 -AP- 104; 241 -AW- 103 and- 105; and 241 -C- 109. The methodology used to review the waste characterization information was found to be an accurate, useful way to separate the invalid or questionable data from the more reliable data. In the future, this methodology should be considered when validating waste characterization information...|$|R

The SAVE system is a mobile unit designed for in situ remediation of dissolved hydrocarbons. The partitioning principles of the SAVE system include promotion of a large air-water interface in combination with high operating temperatures and vacuum pressures to encourage volatile organic constituents (VOC) transfer from water to gas...|$|R
40|$|The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) Accreditation Standards and Guidelines 2007 {{states that}} colleges and schools of {{pharmacy}} {{must have a}} remediation policy. Few comparative studies on remediation have been published by colleges and schools of pharmacy, making it challenging to implement effective and validated approaches. Effective remediation policies should include early detection of problems in academic performance, strategies to help students develop better approaches for academic success, and facilitation of self-directed learning. While the cost of remediation can be significant, revenues generated either cover or exceed the cost of delivering the <b>remediation</b> <b>service.</b> Additional research on remediation in pharmacy education across the United States and abroad is needed to make sound decisions in developing effective policies.

In 2003 Bechtel Jacobs was awarded a new 5-year cost-plus-incentive-fee contract with an estimated value of $1.8 billion. Bechtel Jacobs was replaced as the environmental remediation contractor for the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant site in Piketon in 2005, after DOE awarded a new contract to LATA/Parallax Portsmouth, LLC, a joint small business venture of Los Alamos Technical Associates (LATA) and Parallax, Inc.

40|$|Concrete {{is by far}} the world’s {{most common}} {{construction}} material. Modern concrete is a mixture of industrial pozzolanic cement formulations and aggregate fillers. The former acts as the glue or binder in the final inorganic composite; however, when exposed to a fire the degree of concrete damage is often difficult to evaluate nondestructively. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy through techniques such as transmission, attenuated total reflectance, and diffuse reflectance have been rarely used to evaluate thermally damaged concrete. In this paper, we report on a study assessing the thermal damage of concrete via the use of a non-destructive handheld FT-IR with a diffuse reflectance sample interface. In situ measurements can be made on actual damaged areas, without the need for sample preparation. Separate multivariate models were developed to determine the equivalent maximal temperature endured for three common industrial concrete formulations. The concrete mixtures were successfully modelled displaying high predictive power as well as good specificity. This has potential uses in forensic investigation and <b>remediation</b> <b>services</b> particularly for fires in buildings...|$|R
