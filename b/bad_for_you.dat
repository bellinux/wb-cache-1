500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, RedOne and Space Cowboy, with RedOne {{producing}} the track. The song was recorded at the Record Plant Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships and the literal meaning is about a [...] "guy with a big dick". She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>you...</b> If you listen to the lyrics, it's like being in love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... But what I really need is the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E
500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What do you do, when you know something's <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} towards [...] "Addicted to You" [...] {{was mostly}} positive. Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily {{commented that the}} song prevents the listener from getting [...] "lulled" [...] and [...] "hurries back to the hip-swaying dance beat". Michelle Morgante from The Boston Globe picked the song {{as an example of}} Shakira's [...] "new merengue-rock hybrid that lays down bare horn riffs over a driving beat in a groove that is irresistible". Carlos Macias from Terra USA, however, gave it a negative review and criticized its use of a [...] "cheap keyboard that drives the tune reminds us of music played at weddings and quinceañeras". In 2013, Latina included [...] "Addicted to You" [...] on their list of [...] "The 13 Best Songs in Spanglish" [...] and commented that [...] "If non-Spanish speakers can’t pick up the language after listening to this track, then we feel <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> son". At the 28th International Dance Music Awards held in 2013, [...] "Addicted to You" [...] was nominated for [...] "Best Latin Dance Track". It was also nominated at the 2013 Billboard Latin Music Awards for Latin Pop Song of the Year. El Cata received an ASCAP Latin award at the Pop category for his composition of the song.|$|E

500|$|Teri VanHorn of MTV {{said that}} with [...] "Her body newly toned and her smile beaming, she looked every bit like {{a woman who had}} emerged from her quarter-life crisis {{stronger}} than yesterday." [...] She also said Spears performed with [...] "a naughty, free-spirited attitude", as though she [...] "had invited 900 friends to her dirty little dance party, and too <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> if you couldn't roll with the fun." [...] SuChin Pak, also from MTV stated the show was [...] "no huge revelation", explaining, [...] "It {{was not the kind of}} show that says: 'She's back. She's going to come out with the biggest album of her career.' Nor did it say that she's lost forever and we'll never see the old Britney back again. These are all really tiny baby steps." [...] Thomas K. Arnold of USA Today said the show [...] "turned out to be more rehearsal than comeback", although [...] "all those post-rehab workouts were worth the effort." [...] On May 2, 2007, scalpers outside the House of Blues in San Diego were selling tickets with a face value of $35 for prices between $200 and $500. Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "her 'comeback'– if you want to call it that– cemented Spears' place as pop music's reigning drama queen, capable of capturing worldwide tabloid headlines with a bare minimum of creative expenditure." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I wish I had when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's <b>bad</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E
