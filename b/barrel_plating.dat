In hard coating applications, the corrosion resistance of thicker coatings {{is not quite as}} good as it is with hexavalent chromium. The cost of the chemicals is greater, but this is usually offset by greater production rates and lower overhead costs.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{here the}} application of <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> gold electrodes for fabricating {{a new type of}} disposable amperometric glucose biosensor. It is prepared by inserting two <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> gold electrodes onto an injection molding plastic base followed by immobilizing with a bioreagent layer and membrane on the electrode surface. The primary function of <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> is to provide an economical way to electroplate manufactured parts. The manufacture procedure is simple and can increase the fabrication precision for automation in mass production. At the two-electrode system, the detection of glucose is linear up to 800 mg/dL (i. e., 44. 5 mM, r(2) > 0. 99) in pH 7. 4 PBS with a sensitivity of 0. 71 mu A/mM. Excellent sensor-to-sensor reproducibility shows coefficients of variation of only 0. 8 - 1. 4 % for the detection of 56. 5 - 561. 0 mg/dL glucose. In laboratory trials 176 capillary blood samples with a range of 30 - 572 mg/dL glucose are used to evaluate the clinical application of the biosensor. A good linear correlation is observed between the measured values of the proposed biosensor and laboratory reference. Error grid analysis verifies that the proposed technique is promising in fabricating biosensor strips on a mass scale. As successfully demonstrated by using whole blood glucose as a model analyte, the fabrication technique can extend into other <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> noble metal electrodes for various applications...|$|E

Easy for mass production, <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> rhodium electrode (Rh-BPE) is {{for the first time}} demonstrated for analytical application. Hydrazine was chosen as a model analyte to elucidate the electrocatalytic and analytical ability of the Rh-BPE system in pH 7 phosphate buffer solution. Flow injection analysis (FIA) of hydrazine showed a linear calibration range of 25 - 1000 ppb with a slope and a regression coefficient of 5 nA/ppb and 0. 9946, respectively. Twenty-two replicate injections of 25 ppb hydrazine showed a relative standard deviation of 3. 17 % indicating a detection limit (S/ N = 3) of 2. 5 ppb. The system can be continuously operated for I day without any alteration in the FIA signals and is tolerable to the interference of oxalic acid, gelatine, Triton X- 100, and albumin for even up to 100 times excess in concentration with respect to 400 ppb hydrazine. Since the fabrication cost of the electrode is cheap, it is thus disposable in nature. Furthermore, <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> technique can be extendable to other transition metals for application in many fields of research interest...|$|E
40|$|Abstract】Dynamic hip/compression screw (DHS/ DCS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed surgeries in orthopaedic practice. Sliding <b>barrel</b> <b>plate</b> over the DHS/DCS lag screw {{is one of the}} very crucial and at times uncomfor-table and time consuming steps of DHS/DCS surgery espe-cially when it comes to inexperienced surgeons and residents.

40|$|Background : The dynamic hip screw has {{appeared}} to be a reliable answer for intertrochanteric fractures. Intertrochanteric fractures are composed of different anatomic patterns that vary in their degree of stability. However insufficient impaction allowed by the implant may have an adverse effect on fracture healing. Methods : One hundred and four patients were divided in two groups and followed up for one year, mean age was 78. 2 years. The ninety patients in group I were fixed with short <b>barrel</b> <b>plate</b> and screws of 75 mm or less while fourteen patients in group II were treated with standard <b>barrel</b> <b>plate</b> and screws of 80 mm or more. Results : In patients treated with short barrel DHS four out of 90 fractures in group 1 did not heal while in group 2 one out of fourteen did not heal due to failure of standard <b>barrel</b> <b>plate</b> to accommodate the collapse of the fracture fragments. We observed a healing rate of 100 &#x 0025; at 3 months. Conclusion : The DHS is reliable for intertrochanteric fractures.

The precision test of this <b>barrel</b> <b>plating</b> gold glucose biosensor also showed the best performance (coefficients of variation {{in the range of}} 1. 4 - 2. 4 %) in thermal acceleration experiments at 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C and 70 degrees C for 27 days.

40|$|Surface Technology and in particular, Electroplating, is a key, {{across-the-board}} discipline {{without which}} {{the entire range of}} today's manufactured products would not exist. The formation of functional surfaces is a key to innovation in all branches of industry. In the realm of Electroplating, the use of pulsed deposition currents, known as "Pulse Plating" allows the production of a wider range of coating layers than those possible using DC, with extremely attractive functional properties. It is, however, the case that Pulse Plating is a knowledge-based technology. In order to exploit it to the full, a detailed knowledge of electrode kinetics and mass-transport in the electrolyte is essential. This volume, edited by two leading authorities in the field, presents the state-of-art knowledge of the science and the associated technology and equipment. Building on what was hitherto the standard work on the subject, written in the 1990 's, the current understanding of the basic principles is presented together with the full range of processes now available, within its 400 pages, in the English language. Significant developments within the field of Pulse Plating both from aqueous solutions and ionic liquids include the deposition of binary and ternary alloys, composite coatings, compositionally-graded coatings and multilayer coatings. Also described are nanocrystalline deposits and selective plating which is widely used in electronics manufacture and in high-rate deposition processes for coating semiconductors (electronics, solar cells [...] ). The technology is also used in anodic processes (oxidation, electrochemical machining, electropolishing etc). Following a forward-looking but also critical introductory chapter, the book falls into four sections covering all the basic principles and significant industrial applications of the technology. The first of these sections opens with an in-depth treatment of the thermodynamics and reaction kinetics of metal deposition at the metal-electrolyte interface. Special emphasis is laid on the kinetics of multi-step processes, on alloy deposition as well as the importance and modus operandi of additives, all of this supported with examples and documentation. Nucleation and growth processes in electrodeposition and formation of microstructure as well as nanocrystalline deposits using both DC and Pulse Plating are described. A systematic approach to the effect of additives, hitherto scarcely described in the literature, is also provided. The effect of Pulse Plating parameters on secondary current distribution (below the limiting current density) is critical. The use of simulation and modelling is also discussed, not least as used in an industrial setting. One important example of this is the modelling of copper electrodeposition for blind via filling. Of special importance in metal electrodeposition using Pulse Plating are phenomena at the electrode double layer in relation to mass transport and the effects of current pulsing on the double layer structure, which in turn, affects current efficiency. The effects of pulsed current on additives and microstructure as well as alloy deposition are also discussed. Finally, the various models used in simulation of metal and alloy electrodeposition are described. In the second section, various aspects and requirements for industrial applications of pulse electrodeposition are set out. Thanks to electronic and electrotechnical developments in modern power supplies, these can deliver any conceivable pulse regime in terms of current and rapid voltage transients such as square wave pulses. Where suitable equipment is installed, this ensures that the deposition process can be optimised. The means by which an understanding of basic principles can be harnessed to the practical electrodeposition of metals is shown with special emphasis on identification of key pulse plating parameters. Especially helpful in this respect is a systematic approach to determining these parameters for rack and <b>barrel</b> <b>plating.</b> Finally, there is a consideration of the environmental aspects of pulse plating in terms of energy consumption and the related CO 2 emissions. The third section of the book covers in great depth, the industrial applications of pulse plating. Of these, the most important is currently copper electrodeposition for printed circuit board manufacture with special emphasis on Pulse Reverse Plating for through-hole contacting and filling of blind vias. It is in these particular applications that the strengths of Pulse Plating become especially evident. Also covered is the deposition of nickel and its alloys as well as the deposition of nickel-phosphorus deposits, electroforming and formation of nanocrystalline nickel layers. Other processes include electrodeposition of tin and its alloys and the broad topic of chromium plating for decorative or functional applications. The deposition of precious metals and their alloys is discussed and the section concludes with an in-depth treatment of zinc and zinc alloy deposition, especially zinc-nickel. The fourth and last section deals with special systems. This includes the use of pulsed current for anodising aluminium and its alloys, Electrochemical Machining (ECM) as well as electropolishing. Other applications include the deposition of nanostructured multilayers (CMM) and the potential applications of pulse plating for electrodeposition of composite coatings, especially those incorporating nano-sized second phase particles. The whole volume is systematically laid out with various aspects clearly classified. It leaves no doubt as to the huge potential of the method for future developments in electrochemical surface treatment and the associated equipment. This new work which will certainly become the accepted standard and is aimed not only at those researching new developments, but also at those working in an industrial setting and others seeking to acquire proficiency in the subject...|$|E
