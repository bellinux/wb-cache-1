5|$|The Simpson family {{attends a}} prison rodeo where Marge meets Jack Crowley, a convict whom she {{believes}} to have great artistic potential after becoming {{impressed with his}} work. She later teaches a class on <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> to the prisoners and befriends Jack. With Marge's help, Jack is granted parole under her custody. Marge soon finds a mural-painting job at Springfield Elementary School for him. Jack paints a powerful mural symbolizing school spirit with a warrior woman riding a puma, which the whole school likes, but Principal Skinner demands he tone it down using his idea of a cartoonish puma walking with two children under a rainbow in a fantasy land. Jack reluctantly gives into his wishes; however, upon its unveiling, the new mural is panned by everyone in town. Skinner blames Jack and fires him.|$|E

His father, who had taken his wife's family name of Shibata, was also an experienced ukiyo-e painter, having studied under Katsukawa Shunshō.

500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E

It was released exclusively for iTunes and Apple Music on August 7. A physical version was published on August 21.

Popjustice saw the music video in progress on October 22, 2008, in the edit they reported that the music video was produced on a green screen, but the concept of the video was to be Aguilera in an edit suite pressing various flashing buttons, editing what was her own music video. Aguilera herself discussed the production of the video, saying [...] "I really enjoyed making the video for 'Keeps Gettin' Better', <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> who likes to play around with different looks, it was a lot of fun to portray various characters within the same shoot."

The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Marge surprises Lisa {{by sending}} {{her to a}} {{performing}} arts camp for a week.

She runs away from home and seeks out Ethan and Kurt in [...] "Sprooklyn", described by the counselors as the [...] "artistic hotbed of Springfield". However, she soon learns that they have grossly exaggerated the area, which is really a run-down slum, and that they actually work at a sandwich shop. They sing a song about the difficulties of <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> during which Krusty gets beaten up for accidentally announcing he is the prison snitch. Ethan and Kurt encourage her to return to her family and think about trying to make an artistic name for herself when she is older. As Marge arrives to take Lisa home, Ethan and Kurt show off a mural that they have painted in her honor, which takes up an entire side of a building.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2016, Eno {{cited the}} conceptual, video and {{installation}} artist Jeremy Deller {{as a source}} of current inspiration for the website Just Six Degrees. [...] "Deller's work is often technically very ambitious, involving organising large groups of volunteers and helpers, but he himself is almost invisible in the end result. I'm inspired by this quietly subversive way of <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> setting up situations and then letting them play out. To me it's a form of social generative art where the 'generators' are people and their experiences, and where the role of the artist is to create a context within which they collide and create." ...|$|E
2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think about <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist,</b> though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if you can help it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate <b>being</b> <b>an</b> <b>artist</b> and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E
