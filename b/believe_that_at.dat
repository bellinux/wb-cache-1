5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} shiite sects, the {{succession}} of leadership {{following the death of}} the prophet Muhammed is of major importance to Nizaris. Nizaris <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> al-Ghadir Khumm, by God’s direct command, Mohammad designated his cousin and son-in-law Ali - husband of his daughter Fatimah - as his successor. As such, Ali became both the spiritual successor and the first Imam in the continuing line of hereditary Imams which lead up to the present 49th imam Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini.|$|E
500|$|New Line Cinema bought Jeffrey's {{treatment}} and {{hired him to}} write the original draft of the script, which featured Death as an unseen force. [...] After the script was finished, New Line Cinema submitted the script to directors, including writing partners James Wong and Glen Morgan. Both writers were willing {{to make it into}} a film, although they rewrote the script to comply with their standards. [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> one time or another we've all experienced a sense of prescience. [...] We have a hunch, a feeling, and then that hunch proves true," [...] Wong said. [...] "We want to do for planes and air travel what Jaws did for sharks and swimming".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, the {{war would}} result in the death or forced {{departure}} of most of the Bosniak and Croat population of Prijedor municipality. About 7,000 people went missing from a population of 25,000, and there are 145 mass graves and hundreds of individual graves in the extended region. There is [...] conflicting information about how many people were killed at Omarska. According to survivors, usually about 30 and sometimes as many as 150 men were singled-out and killed in the camp every night. The U.S. State Department and other governments <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> a minimum, hundreds of detainees, whose identities are known and unknown, did not survive; many others were killed during the evacuation of the camps in the Prijedor area.|$|E

500|$|Santa Anna {{reportedly}} told Captain Fernando Urizza {{that the battle}} [...] "was but a small affair". Another officer then remarked that [...] "with another such victory as this, we'll go to the devil". In his initial report Santa Anna claimed that 600Texians had been killed, with only 70Mexican soldiers killed and 300wounded. His secretary, Ramón Martínez Caro, later repudiated the report. Other {{estimates of the number}} of Mexican soldiers killed ranged from 60–200, with an additional 250–300wounded. Most Alamo historians place the number of Mexican casualties at 400–600. This would represent about one-third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which Todish remarks is [...] "a tremendous casualty rate by any standards". Most [...] eyewitnesses counted between 182–257Texians killed. [...] Some historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> least one Texian, Henry Warnell, successfully escaped from the battle. Warnell died several months later of wounds incurred either during the final battle or during his escape as a courier.|$|E
500|$|Some historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> {{an unknown}} {{time in the}} decade 899 to 909, Æthelred's health {{collapsed}} and Æthelflæd became the effective ruler of Mercia. Cyril Hart and Maggie Bailey believe that it occurred by 902. Bailey cites [...] "Mercian Register" [...] entries from 902 showing Æthelflæd acting alone or in conjunction with Edward in military operations. Irish annals called the Three Fragments also suggest that Æthelred was unable {{to take an active}} part in government from about 902, although he did attend a meeting in 903 with King Edward, Æthelflæd and Ælfwynn. In 1998 Keynes suggested that Æthelred may have been incapacitated by illness {{at the end of his}} life, but in a summary of his career in 2014 Keynes does not mention this, stating that Æthelred and Æthelflæd cooperated with King Edward in campaigns against the Vikings. Martin Ryan also makes no mention of a decline in Æthelred's health, describing him as joining Edward in encouraging thegns to purchase land in Viking territories. In Michael Livingston's view, he campaigned with Edward in Northumbria in 909, and may have died as a result of wounds sustained at the Battle of Tettenhall in 910.|$|E
500|$|Thirty-five {{seconds after}} the first Mayday call, the crew made another transmission. Homer shouted, [...] "Mayday! Mayday! Get out of here! Mayday! Get out of here!" [...] The flight {{suddenly}} dropped [...] in half a minute before the hijackers managed to stabilize the aircraft. The exact time at which Flight93 came under the hijackers' control cannot be determined. Officials <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> 09:28, the hijackers assaulted the cockpit and moved the passengers {{to the rear of}} the plane at the same time to minimize any chance of either the crew or the passengers interfering with the attack. While the other hijacked flights were taken by five-man teams, Flight93 had only four hijackers, leading to speculation of a possible 20th hijacker. The 9/11 Commission believed that Mohammed al-Qahtani was the likely candidate for this role, but was unable to participate as he had been denied entry into the United States one month earlier. With many passengers saying in phone calls that they saw only three hijackers, the 9/11 Commission believed Jarrah remained seated until the crew were overpowered and passengers were moved to the back of the aircraft and then took over the flight controls out of sight of the passengers.|$|E

500|$|Hornung's {{arguments}} {{have greatly}} influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion, but some still <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> times the gods were more unified than he allows. Jan Assmann {{maintains that the}} notion of a single deity developed slowly through the New Kingdom, beginning with a focus on Amun-Ra as the all-important sun god. In his view, Atenism was an extreme outgrowth of this trend. It equated the single deity with the sun and dismissed all other gods. Then, in the backlash against Atenism, priestly theologians described the universal god in a different way, one that coexisted with traditional polytheism. The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities, while at the same time, the multiple gods were aspects of the one. According to Assmann, this one god was especially equated with Amun, the dominant god in the late New Kingdom, whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods. James P. Allen says that coexisting notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the [...] "multiplicity of approaches" [...] in Egyptian thought, {{as well as with the}} henotheistic practice of ordinary worshippers. He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by [...] "identifying their uniform notion of 'god' with a particular god, depending on the particular situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his {{maiden speech}} in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, [...] "I am a socialist not through reading a {{textbook}} that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral.

2500|$|While {{the figure}} of Jesus Christ and his redemptive work {{are at the center}} of Pentecostal theology, that redemptive work is {{believed}} to provide for a fullness of the Holy Spirit of which believers in Christ may take advantage. The majority of Pentecostals <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> the moment a person is born again, the new believer has the presence (indwelling) of the Holy Spirit. While the Spirit dwells in every Christian, Pentecostals believe that all Christians should seek to be filled with him. The Spirit's [...] "filling", [...] "falling upon", [...] "coming upon", or being [...] "poured out upon" [...] believers is called the baptism with the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals define it as a definite experience occurring after salvation whereby the Holy Spirit comes upon the believer to anoint and empower him or her for special service. It has also been described as [...] "a baptism into the love of God".|$|E
