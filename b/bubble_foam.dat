40|$|In {{addition}} to rhythmic slug-driven Strombolian activity, Stromboli volcano occasionally produces discrete explosive paroxysms (2 per year on {{average for the}} most frequent ones) that constitute a major hazard and whose origin remains poorly elucidated. Partial extrusion of the volatile-rich feeding basalt as aphyric pumice during these events has led to consider their triggering by the fast ascent of primitive magma blobs from possibly great depth. Here I examine and discuss the alternative hypothesis {{that most of the}} paroxysms could be triggered and driven by the fast upraise of CO 2 -rich gas pockets generated by <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> growth and collapse in the sub-volcano plumbing system. Data for the SO 2 and CO 2 crater plume emissions are used to show that Stromboli's feeding magma may originally contain as much as 2 wt. % of carbon dioxide and early coexists with an abundant CO 2 -rich gas phase with high CO 2 /SO 2 molar ratio (≥ 60 at 10 km depth below the vents, compared to ∼ 7 in time-averaged crater emissions). Pressure-related modelling indicates that the time-averaged crater gas composition and output are well accounted for by closed system decompression of the basalt–gas mixture until the volcano–crust interface (∼ 3 km depth), followed by open degassing and crystallization in the volcano conduits. However, both the low viscosity and high vesicularity of the basaltic magma permit bubble segregation and <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> growth at deep sill-like feeder discontinuities and at shallower physical boundaries (such as the volcano–crust interface) where the gasrich aphyric basalt interacts with the unerupted crystal-rich and viscous magma drained back from the volcano conduits. Gas pressure build-up and <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> collapse at these boundaries will intermittently trigger the sudden upraise of CO 2 -rich gas blobs that constitute the main driving force of the paroxysms. Deeper-sourced gas blobs, driving the most powerful explosions, will be the richest in CO 2 and have highest CO 2 /SO 2 ratios. This mechanism is shown to account well for the dynamic, seismic and petrologic features of Stromboli's paroxysms and, hence, to provide a potential alternative interpretation for their genesis and their forecasting. Enhanced <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> leakage prior to a paroxysm, or foam emptying in several steps, should lead indeed to precursory upstream of CO 2 -rich gas and increasing CO 2 /SO 2 ratio in crater plume emissions. The recent detection of such signals prior to two explosions in December 2006 and March 2007 strongly supports this expectation and the model proposed in this study...|$|E

40|$|Many foods contain {{large amounts}} of {{saturated}} fatty acids (SaFa), which are considered unhealthy, and {{their presence in the}} diet is one of the contributing factors of cardio-vascular disease, obesity and the inherent risk of diabetes. It has become the driver of food producers to manufacture products with as little of these oils as they can. Reformulation work based on Elmlea whipping creams sought to address this issue, by which the ingredients of the principal formulation were taken and ever increasing levels of liquid oil were added, but keeping the total oil concentration at 34 %. Many of its’ properties were tested and the optimum formulation was found to be that containing 20 % hydrogenated and 14 % liquid oil. Further formulation work was associated with another product: ice-cream. Ice-cream distribution, particularly with its transport over the Rocky Mountains in the US, poses a large problem. Taking ice cream across the Mountains involves travelling at altitudes in excess of 2000 metres and this leads to its expansion due to the reduced air pressures. The product can spoil in transit. Further instabilities arise when extruded from a freezer. This instability was studied extensively in this work. It was seen that larger drops in pressure and at a slower rate were more detrimental to the model foam structure than small pressure differences and a fast rate. The fast pressure release seemed to have less of a detrimental effect on the resultant <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> microstructure...|$|E
40|$|The {{southeast}} crater (SEC) of Etna produced fifteen lava fountains in {{the period}} June-July 2001, immediately before the 2001 flank eruption. Here we present results from remote sensing measurements of the gas phase powering nine of these events, measured using FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrometry. The spectrometer (Bruker OPAG- 22) was located approximately 1 km distance from SEC, and spectra were collected every ~ 6 s using lava jets {{as the source of}} radiation. Spectra were analysed using a non-linear least squares fitting procedure and a forward model with spectral information from the HITRAN database. One challenge posed by measuring a lava fountain is the rapidly changing temperature of the absorbing gases. This was addressed by fitting the volcanic gas temperature together with gas amount during analysis of a SO 2 absorption band at 2500 cm- 1. With this approach we were able to robustly measure SO 2, HCl and HF and, with greater difficulty due to atmospheric interference, CO 2 and H 2 O. Previous work (Allard et al., Nature, 2005) on one similar lava fountain at SEC in June 2000 has shown that the probable mechanism driving the activity is accumulation of a <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> layer ~ 2 km beneath SEC. Here we analyse and interpret the temporal variations of SO 2 /HCl ratio during each event, and compare with contemporaneous measurements of the volcanic tremor and video recordings of the activity. We find that the measured gas composition displays a close relationship with the evolution of eruptive activity in three successive phases: i) lava effusion and steadily increasing Strombolian activity, ii) eruption paroxysm culminating in the lava fountain itself, and iii) post-paroxysmal phase with weakening Strombolian activity. Distinct gas compositions can be attributed to each phase of this sequence, constraining the physical mechanism at the origin of the fountaining event...|$|E

40|$|In June–July 2001 {{a series}} of 16 {{discrete}} lava fountain paroxysms occurred at the Southeast summit crater (SEC) of Mount Etna, preceding a 28 -day long violent flank eruption. Each paroxysm was preceded by lava effusion, growing seismic tremor and a crescendo of Strombolian explosive activity culminating into powerful lava fountaining up to 500 m in height. During 8 of these 16 events we could measure the chemical composition of the magmatic gas phase (H 2 O, CO 2, SO 2, HCl, HF and CO), using open-path Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometry at ∼ 1 – 2 km distance from SEC and absorption spectra of the radiation emitted by hot lava fragments. We show that each fountaining episode was characterized by increasingly CO 2 -rich gas release, with CO 2 /SO 2 and CO 2 /HCl ratios peaking in coincidence with maxima in seismic tremor and fountain height, whilst the SO 2 /HCl ratio showed a weak inverse relationship with respect to eruption intensity. Moreover, peak values in both CO 2 /SO 2 ratio and seismic tremor amplitude for each paroxysm were found to increase linearly in proportion with the repose interval (2 – 6 days) between lava fountains. These observations, together with a model of volatile degassing at Etna, support the following driving process. Prior to and during the June–July 2001 lava fountain sequence, the shallow (∼ 2 km) magma reservoir feeding SEC received an increasing influx of deeply derived carbon dioxide, likely promoted by the deep ascent of volatile-rich primitive basalt that produced the subsequent flank eruption. This CO 2 -rich gas supply led to gas accumulation and overpressure in SEC reservoir, generating a <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> layer whose periodical collapse powered the successive fountaining events. The anti-correlation between SO 2 /HCl and eruption intensity is best explained by enhanced syn-eruptive degassing of chlorine from finer particles produced during more intense magma fragmentation...|$|E

Hexagonal Hierarchies and Close Packing of the Plane: Overview [...] A scatter of points, spread evenly across the plane, may {{take on a}} variety of configurations: two simple regular lattices involve points that suggest squares or equilateral triangles. If one wishes to consider circular buffers around each point, then these buffers may overlap or be widely spaced. A natural issue to consider is to provide some sort of maximal coverage of the plane by the buffers: to provide a "close packing" of the plane by circles. Gauss (1831 / 40) proved that the densest lattice packing of the plane is the one based on the triangular lattice. In 1968 (and earlier), Fejes-Toth proved that that same packing is not only the densest lattice packing of the plane but is also the densest of all possible plane packings. If one thinks, then, of the circles as if they were <b>bubble</b> <b>foam,</b> the circles centered on a square grid pattern expand and collide to form a grid of squares (Boys). The circles centered on a triangular grid pattern expand and collide to form a mesh of regular hexagons, like the cells in a slice of the honeycomb of bees (de Vries). The theoretical issues surrounding tiling in the plane are complex; even deeper are those issues involving packings in three dimensional space. The reader interested in probing this topic further is referred to the Bibliography {{at the end of this}} document. Interpretation of the simple triangular grid has range sufficient to fill this document and far more. Classical Urban Hexagonal Hierarchies [...] One classical interpretation of what dots on a lattice might represent is found in the geometry of "central place theory" (Christaller, Lösch). This idea takes the complex human process of urbanization and attempts to look at it in an abstract theoretical form in order to uncover any principles which might endure despite changes over time, situation, cultural tradition, and all the various human elements that are truly the hallmarks of urbanization. Simplicity helps to reveal form: models are not precise representations of reality. They do, however, offer a way to look at some structural elements of complexity...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the Voronoi Implicit Interface Method (VIIM) is {{presented}} together with several applications in multiphase curvature flow, multiphase incompressible fluid flow, mesh generation for interconnected surfaces, and multiscale modelling of foam dynamics. The VIIM tracks {{the evolution of}} multiple interacting regions ("phases") whose motion may be determined by geometry, complex physics, intricate jump conditions, internal constraints, and boundary conditions. From a mathematical point of view, the method provides a theoretical framework to evolve interconnected interfaces with junctions. Discretising this theoretical framework leads to an efficient Eulerian-based numerical method that uses a single unsigned distance function, together with a region indicator function, to represent a multiphase system. The VIIM works {{in any number of}} spatial dimensions, accurately represents complex geometries involving triple and higher-order junctions, and automatically handles topological changes in the evolving interface, including creation and destruction of phases. Here, the central ideas behind the method are presented, implementation is discussed, and convergence tests are performed to illustrate the accuracy of the method. Several applications of the VIIM are shown, including in constant speed normal driven flow; multiphase curvature flow with constraints; and multiphase incompressible fluid flow in which density, viscosity, and surface tension can be defined on a per-phase basis and membranes can be permeable. An efficient and robust mesh generation algorithm for interconnected surfaces is also presented. The algorithm capitalises on a geometric construction used in the VIIM, known as the "Voronoi interface", to generate high-quality triangulated meshes that are topologically consistent, such that mesh elements meet precisely at junctions without gaps, overlaps, or hanging nodes. The generated meshes can be used in finite element methods for solving partial differential equations on a network of evolving interconnected curved surfaces. Finally, a scale-separated, multiscale model for the dynamics of a soap <b>bubble</b> <b>foam</b> {{is presented}}. The model leads to a computational framework for studying the interlinked effects of drainage, rupture, and rearrangement in a foam of bubbles, coupling microscale fluid flow in a network of thin-film membranes ("lamellae") and junctions ("Plateau borders") to macroscale gas dynamics driven by surface tension. Here, thin-film equations for fluid flow inside curved lamellae and Plateau borders are derived, flux boundary conditions which conserve liquid mass are developed, and local conservation laws for transport of film thickness during rearrangement are designed. From a numerical perspective, several new numerical methods are developed, including Lagrangian-based schemes for conserving liquid in the membranes during rearrangement, finite element methods to solve fourth-order nonlinear partial different equations on curved surfaces, methods to accurately solve coupled flux boundary conditions at Plateau borders and quadruple points, and projection methods to couple gas dynamics to the VIIM. Convergence tests are performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the numerical methods, and results of the multiscale model are shown for a variety of problems, including collapsing foam clusters displaying thin-film interference effects...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} bubble formation and growth at 1 atmosphere, degassing experiments using a Stromboli basalt with dissolved H 2 O or H 2 O + CO 2 were {{performed in a}} custom furnace on a beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. The glasses were synthesized at 1250 °C and 1000 MPa, with ~ 3. 0 wt%, ~ 5. 0 wt%, or ~ 7. 0 wt% H 2 O or with mixtures of H 2 O + CO 2, ~ 3. 0 wt% H 2 O and ~ 440 ppm CO 2, ~ 5. 0 wt% H 2 O and 880 ppm CO 2, ~ 7. 0 wt% H 2 O and ~ 1480 ppm CO 2, then heated on the beamline while recording the bubble growth. The 3 D bubble size distributions in the quenched samples were then studied with synchrotron X-ray microtomography. The experimental results show that bubble nucleation and growth are volatile-concentration dependent. Bubbles can easily nucleate in melts initially containing high volatile concentrations. CO 2 has no significant effect on bubble formation and growth because of low CO 2 concentrations. Multiple nucleation events occur {{in most of these}} degassing samples, and they are more pronounced in more supersaturated melts. Bubble growth is initially controlled by viscosity near glass transition temperatures and by diffusion at higher temperatures where melt viscous relaxation occurs rapidly. <b>Bubble</b> <b>foam</b> forms when bubbles are highly connected due to coalescence, and bubbles begin pop, 10 to 20 seconds after the foam is developed. The degree of bubble coalescence increases with time, and bubble coalescence can significantly change the bubble size distribution. Bubble size distributions follow power-law relations at vesicularities of 1. 0 % to 65 %, and bubble size distributions evolve from power-law relations to exponential relations at vesicularities of 65 % to 83 %. This evolution is associated with the change from far-from-equilibrium degassing to near-equilibrium degassing. The experimental results imply that during basaltic eruptions both far-from-equilibrium degassing and near-equilibrium degassing can occur. The far-from-equilibrium degassing generally generates the power-law bubble size distributions whereas the near-equilibrium degassing produces exponential bubble size distributions Bubbles begin to pop when the vesicularities attain 65 % to 83 %. Bubble expansion in the foam possibly accounts for the mechanism of magma fragmentation.
