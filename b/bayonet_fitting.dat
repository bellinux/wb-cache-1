500|$|The most {{sophisticated}} candle clocks {{of their time}} were those of Al-Jazari in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting,</b> a fastening mechanism still used in modern times. Donald Routledge Hill described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|... 380 bulb, a 12V, 2-brightness (21W/5W) {{light bulb}} on a BA15d staggered-pin <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting.</b> Typically used in car stop/tail lights.|$|E

5000|$|This was a Sten Mk.III with a [...] "Lanchester" [...] type wooden {{body and}} butt, and <b>bayonet</b> <b>fittings.</b> Sling swivels were also added. It never entered service {{due to the}} costs {{associated}} with producing it.|$|R

5000|$|Once the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 was passed, {{prohibiting the}} {{manufacture}} of firearms with bayonet lugs (among other features), the M1A no longer shipped with a bayonet lug. Although the 1994 law expired in September 2004, making bayonet lugs on newly manufactured firearms legal again (in most states), Springfield Armory has not restored that feature. Since the bayonet lug {{is attached to the}} flash suppressor, [...] "post ban" [...] rifles can easily be fitted with a <b>bayonet</b> lug by <b>fitting</b> a pre-ban flash suppressor.|$|R

50|$|The Caproni Ca.18 was a {{military}} reconnaissance aircraft built in Italy shortly prior to World War I. It became the first Italian-designed and -built aircraft to see service with the Italian armed forces. The Ca.18 was a monoplane of conventional configuration and fixed tailskid undercarriage. The wings were mounted to the fuselage with a <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting,</b> to facilitate the rapid erection and dismantling of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|They {{manufactured}} many cameras, {{such as the}} CG-5, {{which was}} one of the first cameras ever to use an Auto Focus lens, which had to be bought separately. The lenses are now rare. They were cumbersome and had two infra-red [...] "eyes" [...] on the top. They would connect by a <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting</b> similar to the Pentax K fitting, except they also had electrical contacts which would power the motor at the press of the shutter release button.|$|E
50|$|The first tangle, on April 29, 1849, {{took place}} at the {{crossing}} between ancient and new Via Aurelia; the next day the French troops advanced towards Porta Angelica and Porta Cavalleggeri but, along the whole way up to Porta San Pancrazio, the defenders, sheltered behind the wallsm seriously impeded the Frenchmen: the <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting</b> and then the standoff of the troops led by Garibaldi {{in the area of the}} Basilica of San Pancrazio forced the assailants to beat a retreat.|$|E
50|$|Butterfly {{bombs in}} a submunitions {{container}} {{could have a}} mixture of different fuzes fitted to increase disruption to the target. Additionally, when a single fuze type with two operating functions was fitted (e.g. type 41), bombs in a submunitions container could have either or both possible fuze settings selected by the Luftwaffe ground crew. Fuze variants such as the 41A, 41B, 70B1, 70B2, etc., also existed. These variants were inserted into the fuze pocket via a <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting</b> (the fuze was held in place via two steel clips) but otherwise functioned identically.|$|E
50|$|LED lamps {{are made}} of arrays of SMD modules that replace {{incandescent}} or compact fluorescent lamps, mostly replacing incandescent lamps rated from 5 to 60 watts. Such lamps are made with standard lamp connections and shapes, such as an Edison screw base, an MR16 shape with a bi-pin base, or a GU5.3 (bi-pin cap) or GU10 (<b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting)</b> and are made compatible with the voltage supplied to the sockets. They include driver circuitry to rectify the AC power and convert the voltage to an appropriate value, usually a switched-mode power supply.|$|E
5000|$|The Canon FT QL is a 35mm single-lens {{reflex camera}} {{introduced}} by Canon of Japan in March 1966. It has a Canon FL lens mount {{compatible with the}} large range of FL series lenses. The FT can also operate the later Canon FD series lenses in stop-down mode, but the earlier R series has a different lens aperture mechanism and cannot be used, although the <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting</b> is similar. The standard kit lenses were Canon's 50mm f/1.8 50mm f/1.4 and 58mm f/1.2, the body-only option was offered later.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{sophisticated}} candle clocks known to date, however, {{were those of}} Al-Jazari in 1206. It included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting,</b> a fastening mechanism still used in modern times. Donald Routledge Hill described one of al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows: The candle, whose rate of burning was known, bore against {{the underside of the}} cap, and its wick passed through the hole. Wax collected in the indentation and could be removed periodically so that it did not interfere with steady burning. The bottom of the candle rested in a shallow dish that had a ring on its side connected through pulleys to a counterweight. As the candle burned away, the weight pushed it upward at a constant speed. The automata were operated from the dish {{at the bottom of the}} candle.|$|E
50|$|As a heavy {{automatic}} rifle designed for support fire, the M1918 was not {{fitted with a}} bayonet mount and no bayonet was ever issued. Only one experimental <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting</b> was ever made for the BAR by Winchester. This was a standard, M1917 bayonet fitted at the Winchester factory with a special muzzle ring. The bayonet was attached to a standard M1918 BAR {{by means of a}} special experimental flash hider assembly. This prototype bayonet/flash hider assembly came from the Winchester in-house factory museum in New Haven, Connecticut with a tag printed on one side Winchester Repeating Arms Co./New Haven Conn., and handwitten on the other side: Combined Flash Hider, Front Sight and Bayonet Mount for Browing Automatic Rifle Model 1918 with Bayonet and Scabbard and the date - September 7, 1918. There is no evidence whatsoever of military adoption nor a military stock number, name, or classification.|$|E
40|$|General Atomics is designing, {{testing and}} {{fabricating}} {{a system for}} supplying cryogenic targets for the University of Rochester`s OMEGA laser system. A prototype system has demonstrated the filling of 1 mm diameter, 3 {micro}m wall plastic spheres to 111 MPa (1, 100 atm) with deuterium and then cooling to 18 K to condense the fuel. The production design must be capable of routinely filling and cooling targets with a 50 / 50 mix of deuterium and tritium and transferring them to a device which places the targets into the focus of 60 laser beams. This paper discusses the design {{and analysis of the}} production Fill/Transfer Station cryostat. The cryostat has two major components, a fixed base and a removable dome. The joint between the base and the dome is similar to a <b>bayonet</b> <b>fitting</b> and is sealed by a room temperature elastomeric o-ring. Since the cryostat must be housed in a glovebox, its design is driven strongly by maintenance requirements. To reach the equipment inside the cryostat, the dome is simply unbolted and lifted. The inside of the cryostat is maintained at 16 K by a closed loop helium flow system. Gaseous helium at about 1. 4 MPa (200 psi) flows through tubes which are brazed to the inner walls. Cooling is provided by several cryocoolers which are located external to the cryostat. Liquid nitrogen is used as a heat intercept and to precool the helium gas...|$|E
