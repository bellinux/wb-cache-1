5|$|Post-production {{phase was}} {{scheduled}} to <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> up in 50 days. On 19 May 2014, a puja commemorated {{the beginning of the}} film's dubbing at Hyderabad. The supporting cast of the film completed dubbing for their parts in late August 2014, and Mahesh began dubbing for his role after returning from Europe. The dubbing was completed on 10 September 2014. Aagadu was passed with an 'U/A' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification in mid September 2014. All the remaining post-production activities, including the final mixing, were wrapped up by 16 September 2014.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{contagion}} and {{to preserve}} health, all employees {{should be involved}} in keeping the factory clean. Children should bathe occasionally. The clothes of those infected with fever should be washed in cold water, then in hot and be left to fumigate before being worn again. Those who died of fever should <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> promptly in cloth and those in the vicinity advised to smoke tobacco to avoid infection.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the series started {{broadcasting}} on ATV in September 1967, principal photography had been completed for the first 20 episodes. In general, turnaround for completing all the puppet shots for each episode was two weeks or 11 working days. It was originally predicted that shooting would <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> within eight months, but filming overran until late October due {{to the demands of}} the Thunderbird 6 shoot. While production on the next Supermarionation series, , began in November it was not until early 1968 that the last episodes of Captain Scarlet were edited and completed for broadcast.|$|E

50|$|Another {{measurement}} of yarn weight, often used by weavers, <b>is</b> <b>wraps</b> per inch (WPI). The yarn <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> snugly around a ruler {{and the number}} of wraps that fit in an inch are counted.|$|R
5|$|Herring, a fish {{which takes}} well to salting, became a well {{established}} catch; the busiest harbour was Aberystwyth, which reportedly took up to 1,000 barrels of herring {{in a single}} night in 1724. Many other villages also fished for herring, generally between late August and December. Herring, along with mackerel, trout, salmon and sea trout, were the main fishes found in Welsh cuisine. Salmon was abundant and therefore a staple for the poor. Trout, which would dry out quickly when cooked, would <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> in leek leaves for cooking, or covered in bacon or oatmeal. Many fish would be served with fennel, which grew wild in abundance in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on 7 November 2014 at Pune, and Haasan {{joined the}} {{set on the}} next day. The two leads were mobbed by local people during the film's shoot at an IT hub in Pune. The next segment took place in Hyderabad at a private studio where a song was filmed with Mahesh and Haasan. The song that accompanies Mahesh's first appearance in the film was filmed at Ramoji Film City starting on 11December 2014. The third filming segment commenced on 28December 2014 at Hyderabad. Around the end of January 2015, {{it was estimated that}} the film's shooting would <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> up in a month.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} types of yarn-over, {{depending}} on how many times the yarn <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the knitting needle and on the direction (chirality) with which the yarn <b>is</b> <b>wrapped.</b> Normally, the yarn <b>is</b> <b>wrapped</b> with a right-handed chirality, i.e., counterclockwise {{when looking at the}} right-hand needle point-on.Wrapping the yarn the other way (i.e., left-handedly) will result in a plaited stitch if the stitch is knit on the following row.|$|R

5|$|Preservation of the Mary Rose and her {{contents}} was {{an essential}} part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts. After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent any immediate deterioration before the active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material that the object was made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common pond snails that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.|$|E

25|$|The capacitor's plate {{area can}} be adapted to the wanted {{capacitance}} value. The permittivity and the dielectric thickness are the determining parameter for capacitors. Ease of processing is also crucial. Thin, mechanically flexible sheets can <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> or stacked easily, yielding large designs with high capacitance values. Razor-thin metallized sintered ceramic layers covered with metallized electrodes however, offer the best conditions for the miniaturization of circuits with SMD styles.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the {{theoretical}} tension {{acting on the}} belt or rope calculated by the belt friction equation {{can be compared to}} the maximum tension the belt can support. This helps a designer of such a rig to know how many times the belt or rope must <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the pulley to prevent it from slipping. Mountain climbers and sailing crews demonstrate a standard knowledge of belt friction when accomplishing basic tasks.|$|E

25|$|The weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads {{are known}} as the warp, and the cross way threads {{are known as}} the weft. The warp which must be strong needs to be {{presented}} to loom on a warp beam. The weft passes across the loom in a shuttle, that carries the yarn on a pirn. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.|$|E
25|$|To achieve proper {{intonation}} {{and sound}} quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings {{tends to be}} quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called shimming. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.|$|E
25|$|The {{craft of}} {{bookbinding}} probably originated in India, where religious sutras were copied on to palm leaves (cut into two, lengthwise) {{with a metal}} stylus. The leaf was then dried and rubbed with ink, which would form a stain in the wound. The finished leaves were given numbers, and two long twines were threaded through each end through wooden boards, making a palm-leaf book. When the book was closed, the excess twine would <b>be</b> <b>wrapped</b> around the boards to protect the manuscript leaves. Buddhist monks took the idea through Afghanistan to China {{in the first century}} BC.|$|E
