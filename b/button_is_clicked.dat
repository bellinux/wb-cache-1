25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock <b>button</b> <b>is</b> <b>clicked.</b>|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize <b>button</b> <b>is</b> <b>clicked.</b> It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{of their}} {{generally}} faster-paced nature (and {{in some cases}} a smaller learning curve), real-time strategy games have surpassed the popularity of turn-based strategy computer games.

The common retort is that success involves not just fast clicking, but also the ability to make sound decisions under time pressure. The [...] "clickfest" [...] argument is also often voiced alongside a [...] "button babysitting" [...] criticism, which pointed out that a great deal of game time is spent either waiting and watching for the next time a production <b>button</b> could <b>be</b> <b>clicked,</b> or rapidly alternating between different units and buildings, clicking their respective button.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the assessment of}} ascending and descending stairs. It {{was presented at the}} International Society for Posture and Gait Research conference 2009. The Time Up and Down Stairs Test (TUDS) has been suggested as a measure of functional mobility [1]. This test requires subjects to walk quickly but safely up and down a 14 -step flight of stairs. Time was started when given the cue to go and stopped when the second foot returned to the floor. In order to allow for differing numbers of stairs and to separately determine ascent and descent times a method of measuring time per stair was devised. This study looks at how many stairs are needed to obtain repeatable measurements. METHODS: The sample consisted of 35 healthy young adult subjects, 23 females and 12 males, with mean age of 23. 4. The stairs had a tread of 28 cm and a rise of 17. 5 ± 1. 5 cm. The number of stairs used was 4 - 8 with the sequence randomized. The subject stood with toes on a line drawn 10 cm from the front edge of the first stair and asked to walk up the stairs as they would at home. A multimemory stopwatch was started when the subject was cued to start and the lap/split <b>button</b> <b>was</b> <b>clicked</b> on each contact with a stair and stopped when the second foot touched the top stair on ascent or the floor on descent. The first step and last step were ignored and the mean time per stair was then calculated. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test to determine differences. RESULTS: When considering the number of stairs ascended or descended {{there were no significant differences}} found in the mean time per stair measurements. When all the stair ascent data were pooled and compared to all the stair descent data a statistical difference was revealed using a Student t Test for paired data (p < 0. 0001). The mean time per stair for ascent was 0. 51 s (SD 0. 006) and for descent it was 0. 47 s (SD 0. 006). Time per stair is a useful measure of functional mobility that allows for comparison with performance during stair ascent and descent. It also allows for comparison of data collected using different numbers of stairs. From a clinical perspective the study also suggests that a four-stair module, commonly used rehabilitation facilities, could be used for assessment purposes, provided the stairs have the appropriate tread and rise dimensions...|$|R
5000|$|Each variant {{has its own}} way of {{downloading}} {{and installing}} itself onto a computer. MS Antivirus is made to look functional to fool a computer user into thinking {{that it is a}} real anti-virus system in order to convince the user to [...] "purchase" [...] it. In a typical installation, MS Antivirus runs a scan on the computer and gives a false spyware report claiming that the computer is infected with spyware. Once the scan is completed, a warning message appears that lists the spyware ‘found’ and the user either has to click on a link or a button to remove it. Regardless of which <b>button</b> <b>is</b> <b>clicked</b> -- [...] "Next" [...] or [...] "Cancel"—a download box will still pop up. This deceptive tactic is an attempt to scare the Internet user into clicking on the link or button to purchase MS Antivirus. If the user decides not to purchase the program, then they will constantly receive pop-ups stating that the program has found infections and that they should register it in order to fix them. This type of behavior can cause a computer to operate more slowly than normal.|$|E

40|$|Processes {{associated}} with undergraduate final year projects {{have always been}} a manual process which requires a lot of paperwork and could sometimes be a cumbersome and tiring task for the personnel in charge. The manual process sometimes leads to time wasting, impeding of project work because the student carrying out the project work is not able to update the lecturer on the level of execution of the project. Also due to unavailability of a content management system or repository, duplicity of previously carried out final year projects is experienced. It could be sensed by the project supervisors or the personnel in charge that this particular project has been done but where is the proof? Where is the system that out rightly bounces the topic back when the student puts it forward or bring forth a list of projects that has keywords present in the chosen project topic? This project work therefore, eliminates or reduces the error of allowing a student to carry out a project that has been done before as well as cutting down on the cost and time required by the student to produce a quality technical report.
