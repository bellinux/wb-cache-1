However, Padayappa saves her life when he {{prevents}} a bull from attacking her, {{while at the same}} time dodging the bullets she fires at him. Rather than live with the humiliation of knowing she was unsuccessful in avenging her father's death, as well as having her life saved by her enemy, Neelambari commits suicide, promising to take revenge on Padayappa in her next birth. Padayappa prays for her soul to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> and eventually attain salvation.|$|E

25|$|Hopi is {{a concept}} {{deeply rooted in the}} culture's religion, spirituality, and its view of {{morality}} and ethics. To be Hopi is to strive toward this concept, which involves a state of total reverence and respect for all things, to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with these things, and to live in accordance with the instructions of Maasaw, the Creator or Caretaker of Earth. The Hopi observe their traditional ceremonies {{for the benefit of the}} entire world.|$|E
25|$|Although Calvinists believe God and {{the truth}} of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil {{ordinances}} of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those who wield that power). Christians are obligated to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with all men, {{as far as it}} is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.|$|E
6000|$|But, more, {{that man}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with God. He <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with God the Father; {{for he is}} {{behaving}} as the Father wishes His children to behave. [...] He <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with God the Son; for {{he is trying to}} do that which God the Son did when He came not to do His own will, but His Father's; not to grasp at anything for himself, but simply to sacrifice himself for duty, for the good of man. And he <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with God the Holy Spirit; for he is obeying the gracious inspirations of that Spirit, and growing a better man day by day. And so the peace of God keeps that man's heart free from vain desires and angry passions, and his mind from those false and foolish judgments which make the world think things important which are quite unimportant; and, again, fancy things unimportant which are more important to them than the riches of the whole world.|$|R

After Richard reoccupied Jaffa and restored its fortifications, he and Saladin again discussed terms.

25|$|Their state {{reflected}} the general languishing {{of the war}} spirit on both sides, not on one only, as Charles discovered {{when he learned that}} Lord Wilmot, the lieutenant-general of his horse, was in correspondence with Essex. Wilmot was of course placed under arrest, and was replaced by the dissolute General Goring. But it was unpleasantly evident that even gay cavaliers of the type of Wilmot had lost the ideals for which they fought. Wilmot had come to believe that the realm would never <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> while Charles was King.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} before the Mongol invasion, the Cuman-Kipchaks were in {{ambiguous}} relationships with their neighbours (often through marital and martial alliances), the Kwarizmians, Byzantines, Georgians, and the Rus'; {{at a given time}} they could <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with one, at war with another. The Byzantine Empire hesitated {{to go to war with}} the Cuman-Kipchaks north of the Danube River; instead, like the Hungarians, they chose to bribe them. Since Kwarizm had more important enemies, they hired the Cuman-Kipchaks for garrison duty. There were numerous ways the Cuman-Kipchaks could make a living as nomadic warriors. One could partake in questing and raiding with their tribe and subsequently keep the spoils. Another avenue was to seek employment as a mercenary in exchange for the guarantee of loot. One could serve in a garrison, although this caused those Cumans to eventually forget their light cavalry skills and become poor infantry. This was fully exploited when the Mongol army destroyed the Cuman-Kipchak garrison in Samarkand. Cuman-Kipchak women fought beside their fellow male warriors. Women were shown great respect and would often ride on a horse or wagon while the men walked.|$|E

500|$|Persecution was not {{the only}} outlet of the Tetrarchy's moral fervor. In 295, either Diocletian or his Caesar (subordinate emperor), Galerius, issued an edict from Damascus proscribing incestuous marriages and affirming the {{supremacy}} of Roman law over local law. Its preamble insists that it is every emperor's duty to enforce the sacred precepts of Roman law, for [...] "the immortal gods themselves will favour and <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with the Roman name...if we have seen to it that all subject to our rule entirely lead a pious, religious, peaceable and chaste life in every respect". These principles, if given their full extension, would logically require Roman emperors to enforce conformity in religion.|$|E

[...] Greenwalt observed that the show raises questions about what it means to be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him. He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor's journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was [...] "initially the most damaged of all the characters", was the only one able to [...] "reconcile his actions and new man existence together" [...] and <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with himself in the end.|$|E

500|$|While White did {{not engage}} in {{military}} service during the American Revolutionary War, he remained active {{in the practice of}} law in Winchester throughout the war's duration. According to tradition, White facilitated the release of Quaker and Hessian civilian prisoners held by American Revolutionary patriots in a building {{in the southern part of}} Winchester. The Quakers and Hessians were imprisoned under the suspicion of their perceived support of British forces. The prisoners asked White to assist them with their release, and they paid him 100 Virginia pounds. [...] Following the British retreat from the Philadelphia campaign, White traveled to Philadelphia to negotiate with the [...] "executive authority" [...] concerning the prisoners' release to Pennsylvania, where public sentiment demanded their return.

500|$|... {{primarily}} {{known as}} , {{is a former}} ninja of Sunagakure and partner of Deidara. When he was a child, Sasori's parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, {{also known as the}} White Fang of Konoha, leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo who taught Sasori the art of puppetry, which he refined to fit his needs over the years. However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any of the ninja abilities they possessed during their lives for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a human puppet and using him as his main weapon. Sasori's desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once. After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with Orochimaru, and after his desertion, he was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence. [...] In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent most of the time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with Akatsuki's robe. After him and Deidara kidnap Gaara, Sasori ends up having a fight against Sakura and Chiyo, which resulted in the destruction of his heart, the only part of his humanity he kept when converting himself to a puppet, resulting in his death, but not before telling Sakura about his rendezvous with one of Orochimaru's henchmen who had been working for him as a spy. After being resurrected by Kabuto, Sasori fights Kankuro who convinces him to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with himself. Sasori comes to terms with his life and is finally able to pass on and rest in peace. In the Japanese anime, Sasori is voiced by Akiko Yajima as a child and by Takahiro Sakurai as an adult. In the English version he is voiced by Kari Wahlgren as a child and as an adult he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. His scorpion-like puppet body, Hiruko, is voiced by Yutaka Aoyama in the Japanese version and in the English version by JB Blanc.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, the Eastern Orthodox {{church has}} {{required}} {{its members to}} have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this {{will be at least}} Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior to partaking of communion, and to fast from all food and water from midnight the night before. [...] In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one's particular priest), and they must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace</b> with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone. In addition, one is expected to attend Vespers or the All-Night Vigil, if offered, on the night before receiving communion. Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist.|$|E
2500|$|Although this {{profession}} {{is seen as}} a frivolous one, nat-kadaws are in fact very religious. They still follow and uphold the precepts of Buddhism (Five Precepts), while simultaneously interacting closely with these nats. [...] Oftentimes [...] a nat-kadaw can become tormented by a specific nat. Even if they already have a human husband or wife, they decide that they must marry this nat, for only then will they <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>peace,</b> and the torment that this nat is causing them will finally cease. The marriage of a nat and a nat-kadaw is done through an extremely elaborate ceremony titled Ley-Bya-Taik. In this ceremony, the nat-kadaw identifies the particular nat {{that they would like to}} marry, and then surrenders to it. In this process mirrors are used to trap the soul (mentioned earlier) that leaves the host. Once this soul has left, the nat takes the place of it. After this transformation is complete, the nat-kadaw dances, embracing their recent marriage with a nat.|$|E
