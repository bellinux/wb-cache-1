To achieve this, a modified biological reactor with pre-installed continuous narrow <b>baffle</b> <b>walls</b> operating at extended aeration (SRT = 40 days) was designed to intentionally create a number of complete-mix activated-sludge zones. In order to compare the performance, a control reactor (SRT = 2 days) operating at conventional aeration was created to simulate the conventional activated-sludge process in the domestic STP. After the acclimatization period, the influent ammonia was increased gradually by approximately 15 mg/L and the corresponding effluent ammonia level was monitored. Based on the analysis, the nitrification kinetic of the control and modified reactor was observed to be 0. 0823 and 10. 321, respectively. The nitrification kinetic of the control reactor was considered as negligible due to the conventional activated-sludge process, which inhibits the growth of nitrifiers.

Solid holdup and solid mixing were studied in a geometrically and dynamically scaled down cold model FCCU stripper fitted with disk and donut baffles. The solid holdup was measured using a γ-ray densitometry technique with a 3 μCi strength 137 Cs radioactive source. Measurements were taken at different axial levels, for different chordal positions. An Eulerian–Eulerian approach was used to simulate the gas–solid flow in the stripper column. The CFD simulations predicted asymmetric solid holdup profiles emphasizing the importance of 3 D simulations. The CFD model predictions matched well with the solid holdup data from experiments. The CFD model also clearly predicted the recirculation and dead zones as noticed in the experimental analysis. Local defluidization zones were also noticed near the donut <b>baffle</b> <b>wall</b> regions.

40|$|The {{design of}} the plasma facing {{components}} (PFC) in ITER has evolved with the detailed {{design of the}} reactor. The structures exposed to the plasma have different requirements according to their functions. The primary wall, surrounding most of the plasma along the last closed magnetic surface, is exposed to a moderate heat flux (0. 5 MW m 2) but has to withstand the highest neutron load. The <b>baffle</b> <b>wall</b> is exposed to a peak heat flux of 3 MW m 2 and to severe erosion from neutral particles due to their high neutrals pressure in the divertor. The limiter is subjected to the same loads as the primary wall during plasma burn conditions and a higher peak heat flux (depending on its location) during the start-up and shut down phases when the plasma is leaning on its surface. The divertor vertical targets intercept the open magnetic flux surfaces near the separatrix and have to withstand the highest heat flux and erosion in their lower part. The divertor dome is located directly below the null point and works in conditions similar to the baffle. The divertor wings receive similar thermal loads as the dome but can be subjected to high heat shocks and electromagnetic forces during plasma disruption.

40|$|AbstractThe {{discharge}} {{limit of}} ammonia-nitrogen {{in the domestic}} effluent is typically subjected to the local, state and federal regulations and standards. Thus, nutrients removal forms an essential operation of domestic sewage treatment. However, the conventional activated-sludge process employed in the domestic sewage treatment plants {{are not able to}} meet the regulations, as nitrification is inhibited due to insufficient solids retention time and sludge age of the biomass. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the degradation rate of ammonia in the modified activated-sludge system through a modified, laboratory scale biological reactor. To achieve this, a modified biological reactor with pre-installed continuous narrow <b>baffle</b> <b>walls</b> operating at extended aeration (SRT= 40 days) was designed to intentionally create a number of complete-mix activated-sludge zones. In addition, a pre-anoxic compartment was also provided prior to the aerobic chamber for denitrification purpose. In order to compare the performance, a control reactor (SRT= 2 days) operating at conventional aeration was created to simulate the conventional activated-sludge process in the domestic STP. After the acclimatization period, the influent ammonia was increased gradually by approximately 15 mg/l and the corresponding effluent ammonia level was monitored. The specific substrate removal rate (kg ammonia removed per day / kg MLVSS) was plotted against the effluent ammonia (mg/l) to determine the slope of the graph, which corresponded to the nitrification kinetics (k) of the reactor. Based on the analysis, the nitrification kinetic of the control and modified reactor was observed to be 0. 0823 and 10. 321, respectively.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to establish the effectiveness of parked cars in urban street canyons as passive controls on pedestrian pollutant exposure. A numerical model of a generic street canyon was developed using a large eddy simulation (LES) model to compare personal exposure on the footpath with and without the presence of parked cars. Three configurations of car parking systems were investigated (parallel, perpendicular & 45 o parking) {{in addition to the}} influence of wind speed, wind direction and car parking occupancy. A tracer gas (CO 2) was used as a representative pollutant from vehicular sources within the street canyon models. The results indicated that parked cars may act as a temporary baffle plate between traffic emissions and pedestrians on the footpath. Reductions in exposure of up to 35 % and 49 % were attained on the leeward and windward footpaths in perpendicular wind conditions, with parallel winds allowing up to 33 % pollutant reduction on both footpaths for parallel parking. The perpendicular and 45 o car parking configurations investigated proved less successful as passive controls on air pollution exposure and an increase in pollutant concentration occurred in some models. An investigation of parking space occupancy rates was carried out for parallel parked cars. The fraction of parked cars influenced the level of reduction of pollutants on the footpaths with steady reductions in perpendicular winds, yet reductions were only evident for occupancy rates greater than approximately 45 % in parallel wind conditions. One negative impact associated with the parked cars study was the increase of pollutant levels on the roadway as the parked cars acted as a <b>baffle</b> <b>wall,</b> which trapped pollutants in the road.

40|$|The {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} (SBR) is a fill-anddraw activated sludge system for wastewater treatment. In this system, wastewater {{is added to}} a single “batch ” reactor, treated to remove undesirable components, and then discharged. Equalization, aeration, and clarification can all be achieved using a single batch reactor. To optimize {{the performance of the}} system, two or more batch reactors are used in a predetermined sequence of operations. SBR systems have been successfully used to treat both municipal and industrial wastewater. They are uniquely suited for wastewater treatment applications characterized by low or intermittent flow conditions. Fill-and-draw batch processes similar to the SBR are not a recent development as commonly thought. Between 1914 and 1920, several full-scale fill-anddraw systems were in operation. Interest in SBRs was revived in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s, with the development of new equipment and technology. Improvements in aeration devices and controls have allowed SBRs to successfully compete with conventional activated sludge systems. The unit processes of the SBR and conventional activated sludge systems are the same. A 1983 U. S. EPA report, summarized this by stating that “the SBR is no more than an activated sludge system which operates in time rather than in space. ” The difference between the two technologies is that the SBR performs equalization, biological treatment, and secondary clarification in a single tank using a timed control sequence. This type of reactor does, in some cases, also perform primary clarification. In a conventional activated sludge system, these unit processes would be accomplished by using separate tanks. A modified version of the SBR is the Intermittent Cycle Extended Aeration System (ICEAS). In the ICEAS system, influent wastewater flows into the reactor on a continuous basis. As such, this is not a true batch reactor, as is the conventional SBR. A <b>baffle</b> <b>wall</b> may be used in the ICEAS to buffer this continuous inflow.

40|$|The {{methods for}} the {{disposal}} of septage vary from place to place. If the chosen method is not appropriate and planned then it has potential to cause severe damage to both the receiving body and the surrounding environment. A typical example is Colombo City and its sewer system. Here, unsewered areas of the City and its suburbs produce high quantities of septage which is often disposed of by vacuum trucks which empty their contents into nearby manholes of the sewer network. In many developed countries septage is treated at very high cost. The main objective {{of this study is}} to develop an appropriate method for disposal of septage in a city like Colombo where a sewerage network is already available for part of the city. A field survey was carried out to find out the necessity and the frequency of emptying septic tanks as well as any other on-site sewage systems available in unsewered area. Further, the type of on-site sewage system available and its suitability to the location were also investigated. For this purpose eight locations where emptying took place very frequently were selected. In addition to this, the type of vacuum trucks in service, behaviour pattern of the workers involved, the level of service the rate payers receive from the authorities etc., were also studied. These studies revealed that the quantity of septage which need to be emptied could be reduced by a considerable amount by adopting suitable on-site sewage disposal techniques with good construction practices. This, in turn, will reduce by a significant amount unnecessary expenditure incurred by the authorities. The level of service provided presently by the Municipality was found to be inadequate. A higher level of service can be achieved by motivating the workers, increasing the number of vacuum trucks and making improvements to the current management practices. In addition to the above a pilot plant to receive the septage from the vacuum trucks was constructed at a terminal pumping station. The elements making up the pilot plant consisted of a screen, a sedimentation tank and a <b>baffle</b> <b>wall.</b> The disposed septage went through these basic elements and reached the main sewage stream at the pumping station. This preliminary treatment. revented problematic constituents getting into the sewerage system and causing heavy siltation and frequent blockages in the sewer network. Another pilot plant was also constructed at the terminal pumping station to treat the odour which is produced from the septage disposal tank and the sewage pumping station.

40|$|Abstract: Space {{restrictions}} often necessitate {{the incorporation}} of turning pools {{in the design of}} fishways. Several biological studies have identified potential problems fish have with turning pools, varying from disproportionate residence times, flow negotiating difficulties and even fish leaping out of the turning pool. Likewise, our research on fish passage times of a vertical slot fishway on the river Mosel in Germany, detected significant time lags in turning pools. A number of potential explanations have been stated in the literature including confusion associated with large vortices, turbulence and complex flows, flow characteristics exceeding the swimming abilities of the fish, or fish could be using such basins to rest. The actual activity within these turning basins remains unknown and represents an important knowledge gap. This paper presents the results of an HDX and sonar monitoring campaign, registering behaviour in a turning pool in a vertical slot fishway on the river Mosel in Germany, where increased passage times were recorded for several fish species in turning pools. Behavioural patterns like residence times, acc- and deceleration, resting and swimming tracks for both up- and downward migration are related to flow direction patterns described in a 3 D hydraulic model. The results offer insights in the behavioural characteristics of migrating fish in turbulent basins, with direct implications on technical design features like rounded basins and additional <b>baffle</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Clearwells {{are large}} water {{reservoirs}} often {{used at the}} end of the water treatment process as chlorine contact chambers. Contact time required for microbe destruction is provided by residence time within the clearwell. The residence time distribution can be determined from tracer tests and is the one of the key factors in assessing the hydraulic behaviour and efficiency of these reservoirs. This work provides an evaluation of whether the two-dimensional, depth-averaged, finite element model, River 2 DMix can adequately simulate the flow pattern and residence time distribution in clearwells. One question in carrying out this modelling is whether or not the structural columns in the reservoir need to be included, as inclusion of the columns increases the computational effort required. In this project, the residence time distribution predicted by River 2 DMix was compared to results of tracer tests in a scale model of the Calgary Glenmore water treatment plant northeast clearwell. Results from tracer tests in this clearwell were available. The clearwell has a serpentine baffle system and 122 square structural columns distributed throughout the flow. A comparison of the flow patterns in the hydraulic and computational models was also made. The hydraulic model tests were carried out with and without columns in the clearwell. The 1 : 19 scale hydraulic model was developed on the basis of Froude number similarity and the maintenance of minimum Reynolds numbers in the flow through the serpentine system and the <b>baffle</b> <b>wall</b> at the entrance to the clearwell. Fluorescent tracer slug injection tests were used to measure the residence time distribution in the clearwell. Measurements of tracer concentration were taken at the clearwell outlet using a continuous flow-through fluorometer system. Flow visualization was also carried out using dye to identify and assess the dead zones in the flow. It was found that it was necessary to ensure the flow in the scale model was fully developed before starting the tracer tests, and determining the required flow development time to ensure steady state results from the tracer tests became an additional objective of the work. Tests were carried out at scale model flows of 0. 85, 2. 06, and 2. 87 L/s to reproduce the 115, 280, and 390 ML/day flows seen in the prototype tracer tests. Scale model results of the residence time distribution matched the prototype tracer test data well. However, approximately 10. 5 hours was required for flow development at the lowest flow rate tested (0. 85 L/s) before steady state conditions were reached and baffle factor results matched prototype values. At the intermediate flow, baffle factor results between the scale model and prototype matched well after only 1 h of flow development time, with improvements only in the Morril dispersion index towards prototype values with increased flow development time (at 5 h). Similar results were seen at the highest flow tested. For fully developed flow, there was little change in the baffle factor and dispersion index results in the scale model with varied flow rate. With the addition of columns to the scale model, there was no significant change in the baffle factor compared to the case compared to without the columns, but up to a 13. 9 % increase in dispersion index as compared to the tests in the scale model without columns for fully developed flow. Further, the residence time distribution results from the scale model tests without columns matched the entire residence time distribution found in the prototype tests. However, for the model with columns, the residence time distribution matched the prototype curve well at early times, but departed significantly from it at times later in the tests. It appears the major effect of the addition of columns within a model clearwell is to increase the dispersion index and increase the proportion of the clearwell which operates as a mixed reactor. The results also showed there was good agreement between the physical model tests and River 2 DMix simulations of the scale model tests for both the flow pattern and residence time distributions. This indicates that a two-dimensional depth-averaged computer model such as River 2 DMix can provide representative simulation results in the case where the inlet flow is expected to be quickly mixed throughout the depth of flow in the clearwell...|$|E

The wetland units (of the hybrid system) included organic, inorganic media, and were planted with nineteen types of macrophytes. The wetland train was operated under hydraulic loading fluctuation and seasonal variation. The performance analyses (across the wetland units) illustrated simultaneous denitrification and organics removal rates in the first stage vertical flow wetland, due to organic carbon leaching from the employed organic media. Higher mean organics removal rates (656. 0 g COD/(m 2 ·day)) did not completely inhibit nitrification in the first stage vertical flow system; such pattern could be linked to effective utilization of the trapped oxygen, as the flow was directed throughout the media by the <b>baffle</b> <b>walls.</b> Second stage horizontal flow wetland showed enhanced biodegradable organics removal, which depleted organic carbon availability for denitrification. The final stage integrated wetland system allowed further nitrogen removal from wastewater, via nutrient uptake by plant roots (along with nitrification), and generation of organic carbon (by the dead macrophytes) to support denitrification. The system achieved higher E. coli mortality through protozoa predation, E. coli oxidation, and destruction by UV radiation. In general, enhanced {{pollutant removal}} efficiencies as demonstrated by the structurally modified hybrid wetland system signify the necessity of such modification, when operated under adverse conditions such as: substantial input organics loading, hydraulic loading fluctuation, and seasonal variation...|$|R

The characteristic {{features of the}} stirred tank, such as gas cavity and accumulation of gas at {{the two sides of}} <b>wall</b> <b>baffles,</b> can be captured by the simulation. The simulated results agree well with available experimental data. Since the improved inner-outer iterative algorithm demands no empirical formula and experimental data for the impeller region, and the approach seems generally applicable for simulating gas-liquid stirred tanks.

40|$|Proper {{management}} of wastewater {{is a major}} challenge for a developing country like India. The scarcity of water in urban areas {{has given rise to}} the requirement of reuse of treated wastewater for secondary uses. Large number of treatment processes and operations can be used in various combinations to achieve the required effluent quality of treated wastewater and large numbers of studies have been carried out on this aspect. Most of the decentralized wastewater treatment processes are land or energy intensive both of which are in shortage in urban areas. The use of non-conventional energy for treatment of domestic wastewater has not been explored. Use of non-conventional energy sources would imply adequate energy for only part of the treatment time. Such a system can be developed using solar, wind or wave energy. A laboratory scale study was carried out using a modified septic tank, anaerobic <b>baffled</b> <b>wall</b> reactor, aerobic attached growth system and constructed wetland to find out the efficiency of black water/ domestic wastewater treatment. To simulate non-conventional energy sources, partial aeration was provided to the aerobic attached growth system. The reactors were subjected to an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1. 2 kg/m 3 /day and 24 hours HRT using synthetic wastewater. Individual reactors efficiency in terms of COD, TSS, total nitrogen, and total phosphate removal were analyzed. The reactors were placed in a sequence to depict a treatment system and the performance was evaluated based on above mentioned parameters. The performance of the wastewater treatment system was also validated using real wastewater. Pilot scale studies were carried out in an apartment block with 20 - 25 residents. The treatment system was meeting the effluent quality required for reuse as specified by CPHEEO. Overall, the study demonstrated that a sustainable onsite wastewater treatment using non-conventional energy source, i. e., solar power is a viable and efficient syste...|$|R

The channel is divided into two passages by means of a thin, perfectly conductive plane <b>baffle</b> and the <b>walls</b> are uniformly heated. The effects of Brinkman number and the ratio between Grashof and Reynolds numbers on the velocity and temperature profiles and the Nusselt number on the hot wall have been analyzed. The results show that these effects depend mainly on the baffle position. ...|$|R

40|$|A finite {{difference}} method with coordinate {{transformation and}} fictitious cell approach were {{used to analyze the}} vortex generation and shedding phenomenon for sloshing liquid in 2 D tanks with baffles. The detailed description of the dynamics of vortex evolution for sloshing fluid in a tank with baffles is seldom seen in the literatures and is firstly reported in this study. The exploration of liquid sloshing in a 2 D tank with vertically bottom-mounted baffles is demonstrated. The benchmark tests of a tuned liquid damper (TLD) solved by the present numerical scheme show good agreements with the reported results. The experimental measurement is also carried out in this study and the present numerical simulation has excellent accuracy according to the comparison between the computational results and experimental measurement. The evolution of vortices inside a baffled tank in terms of vortex generation, vortex shedding and the trajectories of vortices are analyzed. Four phases of interaction processes of vortices are categorized in this work. The comprehensive discussions include the evolution of vortices and vortex shedding around the baffle tip, the vortex size generated {{in the vicinity of the}} baffle tip, the shedding frequency of the vortices, and the interaction of vortices inside the tank with various heights of the baffles and liquid depths. The vortex shedding phenomenon in the vicinity of the baffle tip is tightly correlated with the strength of the vertical jet along the <b>baffle</b> <b>walls</b> and the excitation frequency of the tank. Vortex size is closely correlated with the baffle height. When the baffle height is small (db ≤ 0. 2 d 0), the vortex size mainly grows in the horizontal direction. Instead, the vortex size dominantly develops in the vertical direction as db ≥ 0. 3 d 0. The period of the generation and shedding of vortices near the baffle tip is nearly about one half of the excitation period of the tank. The dynamics of vortex evolution is closely related to the growth and the hydrodynamic interaction of the vortices and sensitively depends on the baffle height, liquid depth, excitation frequency, and excitation displacement of the tank...|$|R

60|$|The {{thing was}} easy to decide, hard to accomplish. In this {{sensible}} roaring blackness I was sure of nothing but {{the direction of the}} wind. To this I set my face; the road had disappeared, and I went across country, now in marshy opens, now <b>baffled</b> by <b>walls</b> unscalable to Modestine, until I came once more in sight of some red windows. This time they were differently disposed. It was not Fouzilhic, but Fouzilhac, a hamlet little distant from the other in space, but worlds away in the spirit of its inhabitants. I tied Modestine to a gate, and groped forward, stumbling among rocks, plunging mid-leg in bog, until I gained the entrance of the village. In the first lighted house there was a woman who would not open to me. She could do nothing, she cried to me through the door, being alone and lame; but if I would apply at the next house there was a man who could help me if he had a mind.|$|R
