25|$|Gordon's major {{contribution}} was in {{laying the foundations}} of modern epidemiological thinking in the control of internal parasites of grazing ruminants, and sheep in particular.

40|$|Owing to the {{increasing}} importance <b>of</b> the <b>sheep</b> industry and the frequent inquiries received concerning <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> this animal, {{many of which are}} imperfectly understood by sheep raisers and veterinarians, it was deemed advisable to investigate and obtain as much information <b>of</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> occurring in this state as could be done in a comparatively short period of time, with the facilities at our command...|$|R
25|$|Following graduation, Gordon {{was granted}} a Walter and Eliza Hall Fellowship to {{continue}} postgraduate studies in Veterinary Parasitology.

40|$|Irrespective of aetiology, {{infectious}} respiratory <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> {{and goats}} contribute to 5. 6 percent <b>of</b> the total <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> small ruminants. These infectious respiratory disorders {{are divided into}} two groups: the <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> upper respiratory tract, namely, nasal myiasis and enzootic nasal tumors, and <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> lower respiratory tract, namely, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), parainfluenza, Pasteurellosis, Ovine progressive pneumonia, mycoplasmosis, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, caseous lymphadenitis, verminous pneumonia, and many others. Depending upon aetiology, {{many of them are}} acute and fatal in nature. Early, rapid, and specific diagnosis <b>of</b> such <b>diseases</b> holds great importance to reduce the losses. The advanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of antigen as well as antibodies directly from the samples and molecular diagnostic assays along with microsatellites comprehensively assist in diagnosis as well as treatment and epidemiological studies. The present review discusses the advancements made in the diagnosis of common infectious respiratory <b>diseases</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheep</b> and goats. It would update the knowledge and help in adapting and implementing appropriate, timely, and confirmatory diagnostic procedures. Moreover, it would assist in designing appropriate prevention protocols and devising suitable control strategies to overcome respiratory diseases and alleviate the economic losses...|$|R
