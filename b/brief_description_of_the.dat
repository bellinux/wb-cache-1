5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with a <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase {{in which they would}} have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|German {{geographer}} Karl Sapper {{visited the}} ruins in 1896 and published a <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruins {{together with a}} site map two years later in a 6-page pamphlet by the Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie of Leyden in the Netherlands, entitled Die Ruinen von Mixco, Guatemala. It was Sapper who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l'Homme of Paris {{under the direction of}} archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who certainly believed that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Pedro Montañés {{passed through}} the site and left {{graffiti}} with his name and the year 1752. Archives have revealed {{that he was a}} Spanish captain who visited the site on 14 August of that year. La Blanca was first documented {{in the early years of}} the 20th century. In 1905 explorer Teoberto Maler identified visible architecture at the site and marked it as El Castillito on a map of the region. Raymond E. Merwin visited La Blanca in 1913 on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He photographed the site and renamed it as Chac-Ha. At this time the site appears to have been covered in dense vegetation, making exploration of the ruins difficult and resulting in only a <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acropolis.|$|E

Until June 2010, this weather report (usually {{no longer than}} 30seconds) was also being broadcast on his personal YouTube channel, David Lynch – Daily Weather Report. An absurd ringtone ("I like to kill deer") from the website was a common sound bite on The Howard Stern Show in early 2006.|$|E
25|$|His {{intimate}} knowledge of Shakespeare's circle makes him especially attractive to literary historians. Modern scholarsA. L. Rowse is one prominent example, and others have followed his leadhave exploited Forman's manuscripts for the manifold lights they throw on the less-exposed private lives of Elizabethan and Jacobean men and women. One of Forman's patients was the poet Emilia Lanier, Rowse's candidate to have been Shakespeare's Dark Lady; another patient was Mrs Mountjoy, Shakespeare's landlady. Sixty-four volumes of his manuscripts were collected by Elias Ashmole in the seventeenth century, and are now held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Others {{can be found in}} the Plymouth Library. A <b>Brief</b> <b>Description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forman MSS. in the Public Library, Plymouth, was published in 1853.|$|E
25|$|For the non-Asian releases, {{the film}} was {{shortened}} from 288 minutes to 148 minutes and was released in some countries under the title Battle of Red Cliff. An opening narration in American English provides the historical background, whereas in the Asian release, a more <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> context of the political situation appears in scrolling form ten minutes into the film. Notable cuts include the background and motivations behind Zhuge Liang's plan to obtain 100,000 arrows, including the threat to his life, and the early parts of Sun Shangxiang's infiltration, where she befriended a northern soldier Sun Shucai (though the scene where she mourns killed Sun was not cut).

The single collection was found growing on fallen oak leaves at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, in Solano County, California in January 1856. The specimen {{was sent by}} American mycologist Moses Ashley Curtis to his British colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley, who published a <b>brief</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species in 1860, calling it Agaricus californiensis, {{in what was then}} the subgenus Mycena. Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from A.aurantio-marginatus (known today as Mycena aurantiomarginata) {{in the nature of the}} gills, and they called it [...] "a more graceful species." [...] In his 1887 Sylloge Fungorum, Pier Andrea Saccardo raised the subgenus Mycena to generic status, so the species became known as Mycena californiensis.|$|E
500|$|Attarsiya {{probably}} {{used the}} city of Milet, in west coast Anatolia, which was already under Achaean influence, as a military base. Attarsiya launched a campaign deploying an army that included 100 war chariots and attacked regions which were Hittite vassals, or at least under a certain decree of Hittite influence. Among them, he attacked the Hittite vassal, Madduwatta, likely a prince {{of the kingdom of}} Arzawa, and managed to expel him from his country. The latter found refuge in the court of the Hittite ruler and was installed by him as a vassal in Zipasla, somewhere in western Anatolia. Attarsiyas launched a second attack against Madduwatta and managed again to defeat him. The Hittite vassal was unable to provide any opposition and managed. As a result of Achaean military activity in the region, the Hittites dispatched an army under Kisnapli.

Ann Coates's 1970 children's book Dinosaurs Don't Die, illustrated by John Vernon Lord, {{tells the story of a}} young boy who lives near Crystal Palace Park and discovers that Hawkins' models come to life; he befriends one of the Iguanodon and names it 'Rock' and they visit the Natural History Museum.|$|E

It was then that Gaga actually heard the song, and personally contacted Yankovic, giving him green light to include the song on Alpocalypse, telling him that her manager had been the one to refuse permission, which was done without her knowledge or input.|$|E
