In the course of three degrees, new masons will promise to keep the secrets of their degree from lower degrees and outsiders, and to support a fellow Mason in distress (as far as practicality and the law permit). There is instruction as to the duties of a Freemason, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> Freemasons are left to explore the craft in the manner they find most satisfying. Some will further explore the ritual and symbolism of the craft, others will focus their involvement on the social side of the Lodge, while still others will concentrate on the charitable functions of the lodge.|$|E
25|$|England's death bowling was {{impressive}} during their World T20 campaign. Although England's bowlers struggled in the match against South Africa, conceding 229 runs, they bounced back and restricted Afghanistan to just 127 {{to keep their}} hopes of qualification alive. Chris Jordan was particularly impressive, taking figures of 4-28 against Sri Lanka, while David Willey took 2-26. In the final, England lost the match after Ben Stokes conceded four consecutive sixes in the final over, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> England's bowling had been successful.|$|E

60|$|The first {{observation}} which I shall beg {{leave to}} make to your Lordships is this, that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of <b>the</b> proceedings, from beginning to end, has been a mystery of iniquity, and that in no part of them have the orders of the Company been regarded, <b>but,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> contrary, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> has been carried on in a secret and clandestine manner.|$|R
25|$|Earlier {{libraries}} in the Thirteen Colonies {{belonged to}} gentlemen, {{members of the}} clergy, and colleges. Members of the Library Company soon opened their own book presses to make donations: A Collection of Several Pieces, by John Locke; Logic: or, the Art of Thinking, by the Port Royalists Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, which Franklin in his autobiography said he had read {{at the age of}} 16; Plutarch's Moralia translated by Philemon Holland; Lewis Roberts' Merchants Mappe of Commerce, and others. A bit later William Rawle added a set of Spenser's Works to the collection and Francis Richardson gave several volumes, among them Francis Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> books in Latin were few.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, {{he formed}} the Adrian Rollini Orchestra (a studio group {{assembled}} for recording), which appeared on Perfect, Vocalion, Melotone, Banner, and Romeo labels. While Rollini {{did manage to}} assemble some great talent (for example Bunny Berigan, Benny Goodman and Jack Teagarden), these records were clearly more commercial in comparison to his earlier work. Several examples have solo work and proto-swing elements, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> the records were meant to sell current pop tunes. (A number of sides have Rollini on bass sax only to switch to vibraphone during the song.) At this time Rollini also appeared as vibraphonist with Richard Himber's radio orchestra, playing a strictly secondary role in the large, string-oriented ensemble.|$|E
25|$|England {{lost the}} five match ODI series against India 5-0, with the bowlers failing {{to make much}} of an impression. India made 387/5 in the first ODI {{on their way to}} a convincing victory. Stuart Broad took four wickets in the second game, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> England’s bowlers were {{expensive}} an uneconomical, as they failed to bowl out India in the series. India won the first Test between the sides, after making 387/4 in their second innings to secure a six wicket victory. The last game of the series ended in a draw with India scoring 453 in their first innings, with Andrew Flintoff taking three wickets, although India secured the series 1-0.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric diagnoses {{take place}} {{in a wide variety of}} {{settings}} and are performed by many different health professionals. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a differential diagnosis procedure where a mental status examination and physical examination is conducted, with pathological, psychopathological or psychosocial histories obtained, and sometimes neuroimages or other neurophysiological measurements are taken, or personality tests or cognitive tests administered. In some cases, a brain scan might be used to rule out other medical illnesses, but at this time relying on brain scans alone cannot accurately diagnose a mental illness or tell the risk of getting a mental illness in the future. A few psychiatrists are beginning to utilize genetics during the diagnostic process <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> this remains a research topic.|$|E
25|$|The Whigs built {{a strong}} party {{organization}} in most states; they were weak {{only on the}} frontier. The Whigs used newspapers effectively, and soon adopted the exciting campaign techniques that lured 75 to 85% of the eligible voters to the polls. Abraham Lincoln emerged early as the leader in Illinois—where he usually was bested by an even more talented politician, Stephen Douglas. While Douglas and the Democrats were somewhat behind the Whigs in newspaper work, they made up for this weakness by emphasis on party loyalty. Anyone who attended a Democratic convention, from precinct level to national level, was honor bound to support the final candidate, whether he liked him or not. This rule produced numerous schisms, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> the Democrats controlled and mobilized their rank and file more effectively than the Whigs did.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Boyns {{had plenty}} of first-team {{opportunities}} from late May to early July, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{did not make the}} most of them. His highest score during this period was 41*, and though he claimed a List A career-best of 4–34 in the John Player League against Leicestershire he was soon back in the seconds yet again. Here, as they had on several previous occasions, the runs flowed, with scores of 105*, 87 and 78* leading to his recall. He made 71 against the New Zealanders {{in the second half of}} August, but little else was worthy of note. By 1979 Boyns' days as a Worcestershire cricketer were numbered, and indeed he made only one first-class appearance that summer, against the Sri Lankans in mid-July, although he did play six times in one-day matches. His last first-class wicket was that of Sri Lankan Roy Dias, while his last List A scalp was Sussex's Tony Pigott just a few days later.|$|E

25|$|The steady {{expansion}} and {{rapid population growth}} of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons {{for tens of thousands}} of pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized upward mobility, and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.|$|E

As {{in the previous}} two years in the USA Busoni had to depend for his living on exhausting but remunerative tours as a piano virtuoso; in addition at this period he was remitting substantial amounts to his parents, who continued to depend on his income. As a recitalist Busoni's programming and style initially raised concerns in some of Europe's musical centres. His first concerts in London, in 1897, met with mixed comments. [...] The Musical Times reported that he [...] "commenced in a manner to irritate the genuine amateurs [...] by playing a ridiculous travesty of one of Bach's masterly Organ Preludes and Fugues, but he made amends by an interpretation of Chopin's Studies (Op. 25) which was of course unequal <b>but,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> interesting". In Paris the critic Arthur Dandelot commented [...] "this artist has certainly great qualities of technique and charm", but strongly objected to his addition of chromatic passages to parts of Liszt's St. François de Paule marchant sur les flots.|$|E

Some of the tank crews, including the Rhodesians of the Special Service Battalion, were temporarily reassigned to infantry duties to assist in these patrols.

The Rhodesians of the Special Service Battalion received new, more heavily armed tanks in November–December 1944. In February 1945 the 6th Division was relieved by the American 1st Armoured Division and moved to Lucca, [...] north of Pisa, for rest and reorganisation. The Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery was refitted with M10 tank destroyers.

[...] Laverdure's body and those of six of his officers were missing, having been removed by Hammou for use as trophies but were later exchanged for Hammou's captured wives. [...] The Zaian leader displayed these trophies and captured weapons to nearby tribes to encourage them to support him, a tactic that proved particularly successful with the tribes to the north. [...] Although French forces subsequently fought several successful actions against the Zaian and recovered the captured weapons, El Herri showed that they could be beaten. [...] The battle, along with the siding of the Ottoman Empire with the Central Powers in the First World War and slow French progress on the Western Front, led to increasing numbers of recruits for Hammou.|$|E

[...] Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier, but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of [...] "professionals" [...] to the race. [...] Of his selection, he noted: [...] "You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit."
