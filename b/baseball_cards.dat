5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} {{the creation of}} new cultural forms. <b>Baseball</b> <b>cards</b> were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
5|$|Interspersed {{throughout}} his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently {{referred to his}} nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> and remained a New York Yankees fan {{throughout his}} life. As an adult {{he was fond of}} science fiction movies, but often deplored their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.|$|E

25|$|In November 1909, a {{group of}} players from the 1909 Tigers (not {{including}} Ty Cobb or Sam Crawford) toured Cuba and played 12 exhibition games against two integrated Cuban teams, Habana and Almendares. The Cuban-American Major League Clubs Series drew wide attention in Cuba, where baseball was already very popular. Demonstrating {{the high level of}} play in Cuba, the Tigers lost 8 of the 12 games to the integrated Cuban baseball teams. To take advantage of the interest in the tour of the American baseball players, the Cabañas Company printed a series of <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> showing the members of the Almendares, Habana and Detroit baseball teams.|$|E
25|$|Baseball memorabilia and souvenirs, {{including}} <b>baseball</b> <b>cards,</b> {{exploded in}} price as networks of adults became more sophisticated in their trading. This would explode yet {{again in the}} late 1990s, as the Internet, and the website eBay provided venues for collectors of all things baseball to trade with each other. Regionalized pricing was wiped away, and many objects, baseballs, bats, and the like began selling for high dollar values. This in turn brought in new businessmen whose sole means {{of making a living}} was acquiring autographs and memorabilia from the athletes. Memorabilia hounds fought with fans to get signatures worth $20, $60, or even $100 or more in their stores.|$|E
25|$|Corgan, {{who grew}} {{much faster than}} his fellow students, was a strong athlete in {{elementary}} school. In {{addition to being a}} member of his Marquardt Middle School baseball team, he collected <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> (amassing over 10,000) and listened to every Chicago Cubs game. However, by the time he began attending Glenbard North High School in Carol Stream, Illinois, he had become only an average athlete. He decided to start playing guitar when he went over to a friend's house and saw his friend's Flying V. Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used Les Paul knock-off. Corgan, Sr. steered his son stylistically, encouraging him to listen to Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix, but offered little other support, and the younger Corgan taught himself to play the instrument. His musical interests in his formative years included hard rock like Guts-era John Cale, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, and mainstream rock like Queen, Boston, ELO, Rush, and Cheap Trick. In high school, Corgan discovered alternative rock through Bauhaus and The Cure.|$|E

500|$|Thereafter, the ATC {{was back}} in {{competition}} with other tobacco companies, so it reinserted <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> into cigarette packs. In 1909, the company introduced the T206 series – {{also known as the}} [...] "white border set" [...] – of <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> of 524 players into its cigarette packs. The cards were printed at seven factories in New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Two years later, the ATC was broken up into several major companies as part of the United States Supreme Court ruling in United States v. American Tobacco Company, 221 U.S. 106 (1911).|$|E
500|$|Jordan Weisman, an American game {{designer}} and entrepreneur, commented, [...] "I love games that challenge and change our definition of adventure gaming, and Magic: The Gathering is {{definitely one of}} a very short list of titles that has accomplished that elusive goal. By combining the collecting and trading elements of <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> with the fantasy play dynamics of roleplaying games, Magic created a whole new genre of product that changed our industry forever." ...|$|E
500|$|The American Tobacco Company {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} an 1889 merger of five major {{cigarette}} manufacturers: W. Duke & Sons & Company, Allen & Ginter, Goodwin & Company, F. S. Kinney Company and William S. Kimball & Company. Because the company came to monopolize the tobacco industry, ATC did not have to conduct advertising or promotions for its products. Since <b>baseball</b> <b>cards</b> were primarily used as a sales promotion, ATC removed them from its tobacco packs, almost driving the cards into obsolescence. During the presidency of [...] "trust-buster" [...] Theodore Roosevelt, the ATC was subjected to legal action from the government, in hopes of shutting down the monopoly in the industry.|$|E

500|$|The street {{along the}} south side of the Mall of America, the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, in Bloomington, Minnesota was named [...] "Killebrew Drive" [...] in his honor. Banners that hung above the Metrodome's outfield upper deck, {{resembling}} <b>baseball</b> <b>cards,</b> showed the retired numbers: Killebrew (3), Rod Carew (29), Tony Oliva (6), Kent Hrbek (14) and Kirby Puckett (34). In 1999, he was ranked 69th on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. When the Twins moved into Target Field in 2010, Gate 3 on the southeast (centerfield) side of the stadium was named in his honor. There are also corresponding gates for the team's other retired numbers. Killebrew Canyon at Heavenly Mountain Resort is also named after the baseball star, who skied the outer limits of the resort after his retirement from baseball.|$|E

500|$|Within five years, Copeland {{decided it}} was time to sell his card {{collection}}; he chose to sell his entire 873-piece collection in a single sale, through Mastro. Mastro contacted Sotheby's, the renowned New York auction house, and asked them to accept the Copeland memorabilia collection on consignment. Sotheby's advertised Copeland's items as the [...] "Copeland Collection of Important <b>Baseball</b> <b>Cards</b> and Sports Memorabilia" [...] to attract hobbyists and other potential clients. The March 1991 auction attracted nearly 800 collectors who were interested in purchasing some of Copeland's rare memorabilia. The bidding prices far exceeded the pre-auction estimates, as a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card sold for $49,500, more than three times the initial pre-auction price estimate. Pre-auction estimates placed Copeland's T206 Honus Wagner at a price of $114,000. Within minutes of the opening bid for the T206 Wagner card, the highest bidder had put down $228,000, twice the pre-auction estimate. A bidding competition between Mike Gidwitz, Mark Friedland and an unknown phone bidder ensued. Gidwitz dropped out of the competition when the bidding reached the $300,000 mark. As Friedland made each bid, the phone bidder would counter with a bid $5,000 or $10,000 higher. Friedland dropped out of the competition after the phone bidder countered with a $410,000 bid for the card. With Sotheby's 10% buyer's premium, the final price of the card came out to $451,000, nearly four times the pre-auction estimate. The phone bidder was Wayne Gretzky, who purchased the card with advice and financial backing from his 'boss' Bruce McNall, the owner of the NHL's Los Angeles Kings. Copeland received around $5 million for the entire collection. The publicity coverage of the Sotheby's auction renewed interest in the hobby of sports memorabilia collecting. Mastro worked with Sotheby's for the next four years to facilitate sports memorabilia auctions and established himself as a leading card dealer in the industry. [...] Illusionist David Copperfield used the popularity of the card as part of a magic trick on a TV Specials. Copperfield had Gretzky sign the card, then Copperfield proceeded to tear the card into four pieces, then restoring the card, and magically removing the signature.|$|E
