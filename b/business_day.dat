5|$|In October 1929, {{the firm}} {{completed}} a huge grain elevator, with capacity of 7,000,000 bushels (246,670 cubic meters), at Port Arthur. The Depression, however, devastated the grain industry, with falling prices and little demand for exported grain. There was no {{demand for more}} grain elevators, as the existing elevators contained unsold grain, further driving prices down. Howe's company managed to survive on pre-existing government contracts, but these eventually expired and the staff of 175 had decreased to five by 1933. On the first <b>business</b> <b>day</b> of 1934, Howe's sole remaining partner resigned from the firm.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{changes in}} share price momentum {{by comparing the}} share price momentum {{before and after the}} ex-dividend date. The study was conducted using price data from shares comprising the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Shareholder Weighted Top 40 Index on 30 June 2015.

On average, the share price momentum is positive more frequently before the ex-dividend date than afterwards. Comparing before and after ex-dividend date share price momentum, there was no statistically significant difference over 10 and 21 <b>business</b> <b>days.</b> When comparing before and after ex-dividend date share price momentum over 90 <b>business</b> <b>days,</b> a statistically significant difference exists.

50|$|In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission {{stipulates}} the T+3 rule, {{that stock}} trades settle {{three days after}} purchase. The ex-dividend date is normally two <b>business</b> <b>days</b> (3 minus 1) before the record date. After September 5, 2017 the settlement period will be one day shorter. For the purpose of calculating an ex-dividend date, <b>business</b> <b>days</b> are days on which both the major stock exchanges and the banks in New York State are open. Thus Columbus Day and Veterans Day are trading <b>days,</b> but not <b>business</b> <b>days</b> for calculating an ex-dividend date, since they are legal holidays and banks are not open.|$|R
