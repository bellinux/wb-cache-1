5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the U.S. was {{planning}} its own actions against <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Michael Scheuer, {{chief of the}} CIA's <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage's Nairobi computer suggested a link between <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used {{as the foundation for}} the June 1998 New York indictment of <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid's chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> rolled through the door and confronted <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|Omar <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> son of Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> {{published}} a complaint on May 10, 2011, that the burial at sea deprived {{the family of}} a proper burial.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> in 1996. At that time, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, having just relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E
5|$|The missile {{strikes on}} al-Qaeda's Afghan {{training}} camps, aimed at preempting more attacks and killing <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> damaged the installations and inflicted an uncertain number of casualties; however, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{was not present}} at the time. Following the attacks, the ruling Taliban allegedly reneged on a promise to Saudi intelligence chief Turki al-Faisal to hand over <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> and the regime instead strengthened its ties with the al-Qaeda chief.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} al-Qaeda {{can be traced}} to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{traveled}} to Afghanistan and helped organize Arab mujahideen to resist the Soviets. Under the guidance of Ayman al-Zawahiri, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> became more radical. In 1996, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> issued his first fatwā, calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Saleh engaged several NDS agents infiltrating the Pakistani {{tribal areas}} {{to search for}} <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and other al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders. Several al-Qaeda members could be identified, but it was {{determined}} that <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was not in the area. In 2006, Saleh was presented with evidence that <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan. He shared the intelligence with former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who angrily brushed off the claim, taking no action.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a 1996 State Department warning about <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> {{both of which were}} unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was {{instructed}} to plan attacks on bin Laden's Khost camps, where CIA intelligence indicated <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed {{whether or not the}} intelligence indicated <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden's infrastructure and show the administration's commitment to combating <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> The Khost complex, which was 90 miles southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site.|$|E
5|$|In May 2015, a {{detailed}} {{article in the}} London Review of Books by journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had kept <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> According to Hersh, Pakistani officials were always aware of bin Laden's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers. Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden's location to the U.S. because American aid was declining. Pakistani officials {{were aware of the}} raid, and assisted the U.S. in carrying it out. According to Hersh, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was basically an invalid.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, {{selected}} {{members of}} Congress (the congressional leadership {{and those who}} serve on the House and Senate intelligence, homeland security, judiciary, foreign relations, and armed forces committees) were shown 15 <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> photos. In an interview with Eliot Spitzer, Senator Jim Inhofe said {{that three of the}} photos were of <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> alive for identification reference. Three other photos were of the burial-at-sea ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Saleh has {{repeatedly}} stated that Afghan intelligence believed and had shared information about Osama <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> hiding {{in an area}} close to Abbottabad, Pakistan, four years before he (<b>Bin</b> <b>Laden)</b> was killed there. Saleh had shared the information with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who had angrily brushed off the claim taking no action.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E
5|$|Though {{similar in}} claims, both Hillhouse and Hersh's {{accounts}} of the <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> death appeared {{to be based on}} different sources which The Intercept concluded might corroborate the claims if their identities were known. After the Hersh story broke, NBC News also independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> location report, and not the courier.|$|E
5|$|Two SEALs {{broke through}} the bedroom door. Bin Laden's wife Amal was {{on the edge of}} the bed {{shouting}} in Arabic at the SEALs, and Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> dived across the bed, shoving Amal at the same time, for an AKS-74U kept by the headboard. The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> and the final two hit <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders. <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E
5|$|By midday, the U.S. National Security Agency and German {{intelligence}} agencies had intercepted communications pointing to Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Two {{of the hijackers}} were known to have travelled with a <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> associate to Malaysia in 2000 and hijacker Mohammed Atta had previously gone to Afghanistan. He and others {{were part of a}} terrorist cell in Hamburg. One {{of the members of the}} Hamburg cell was discovered to have been in communication with Khalid Sheik Mohammed who was identified as a member of al-Qaeda.|$|E
5|$|In a May 2, 2011, {{interview}} with ABC News, Cheney praised the Obama administration {{for the operation}} {{that resulted in the}} killing of Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz was {{involved}} in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to extradite <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against Khartoum over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington D.C. with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> left Sudan for Afghanistan {{under pressure from the}} United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of Khartoum about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known terrorist groups and individuals.|$|E
5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} was Salim Ahmed Hamdan, {{a citizen}} of Yemen {{who worked as a}} bodyguard and chauffeur for Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden</b> had developed. Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the United States. In 2002, he was sent by the US to its new Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{said there were}} 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of what follows is thinly sourced.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{had begun}} reconnoitering Nairobi for {{potential}} targets in December 1993, using {{a team led}} by Ali Mohamed. In January 1994, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was personally presented with the team's surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E
5|$|August 20, 1998: In Operation Infinite Reach, the U.S. Navy {{launched}} 66 {{cruise missiles}} at a suspected al-Qaeda training camp outside Khost, Afghanistan, where <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{was expected to}} be. Reports said that 30 people may have been killed.|$|E
5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad <b>bin</b> <b>Laden.</b> Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|February 1994: A team of Libyans {{attacked}} bin Laden's home in Sudan. The CIA {{investigated and}} {{reported that they had}} been hired by Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia accused them of lying to make <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> more amenable to Sudanese interests.|$|E
5|$|ISI {{reported}} after questioning {{survivors of}} the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound {{at the time of}} the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive, possibly a <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> son. The ISI said that survivors included a wife, a daughter and eight to nine other children, not apparently bin Laden's. An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden's daughters told Pakistani investigators that <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> had been captured alive, then in front of family members was shot dead by American forces and dragged to a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013, a non-custom factory-made Emerson CQC-7 knife {{carried by}} Matt Bissonnette {{who served as}} point man on the mission to kill or capture Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was {{auctioned}} off for charity, netting over $35,400.|$|E
5|$|Media {{accounts}} {{had reported}} that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up. The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board. The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls {{and then into the}} house. As a result, Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was killed several minutes into the operation. Pfarrer's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house, that Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> was killed seconds into the operation, and that the main house was cleared from the top down.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama <b>Bin</b> <b>Laden)</b> and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{was killed}} in the raid and initial {{versions}} said three other men and a woman were killed as well: bin Laden's adult son Khalid, bin Laden's courier Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, al-Kuwaiti's brother Abrar and Abrar's wife Bushra.|$|E
5|$|Osama bin Laden's {{image is}} {{featured}} on {{a target for}} Casey's shooting range. Coincidentally, <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> {{was killed in a}} raid on May 1, 2011, around 16:00 Eastern Daylight Time, one day before the episode was aired.|$|E
5|$|A CBS/The New York Times {{poll taken}} after bin Laden's death showed that 16% of Americans feel safer {{as the result}} of his death while 60% of Americans of those polled believe killing <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> would likely {{increase}} the threat of terrorism against the U.S. in the short term.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid <b>bin</b> <b>Laden</b> ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|Alec Station, the CIA's unit {{dedicated}} to tracking Osama <b>bin</b> <b>Laden,</b> {{had discovered that}} two of the other hijackers, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, had multiple-entry visas to the United States well before 9/11. Two FBI agents inside the unit tried to alert FBI headquarters, but CIA officers rebuffed them.|$|E
