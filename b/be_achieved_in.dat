5|$|Crypsis means {{making the}} animal or {{military}} equipment {{hard to see}} (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent).

5|$|It is {{possible}} to achieve an extremely high Q with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose Q {{is limited by the}} resistance of the inductor coils.|$|E

He published this work, along with a commentary on Sir Thomas Hanmer, 4th Baronet's edition of Shakespeare's plays, as Miscellaneous Observations or Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth on 6 April 1745 by Edward Cave.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{can provide}} high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is {{more sensitive to the}} quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. However, good results can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.|$|E

5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage uses any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment to make the organism hard to detect by sight. It is common in both terrestrial and marine animals. Camouflage can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> many different ways, such as through resemblance to surroundings, disruptive coloration, shadow elimination, self-decoration, cryptic behavior, or changeable skin patterns and color. Animals such as the flat-tail horned lizard of North America have evolved to eliminate their shadow and {{blend in with the}} ground. The bodies of these lizards are flattened, and their sides thin towards the edge. This body form, along with the white scales fringed along their sides, allows the lizards to effectively hide their shadows. Additionally, these lizards hide any remaining shadows by pressing their bodies to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game. For example, the Amulet of the Fates slows time, {{but this does not}} affect Kratos and allows puzzle-solving that can not <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> normal game time. The Amulet of the Fates has limited usage before needing to be recharged (which occurs automatically and is represented by the Amulet of the Fates Meter). The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles). Icarus' Wings allows Kratos to glide across large chasms that cannot be crossed with normal jumping.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican {{delegation}} was freely {{elected by}} those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), {{in a rare}} exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis {{was elected to the}} Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission in uranium by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, {{opened up the}} possibility that neutrons produced by fission could create a controlled nuclear chain reaction. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might <b>be</b> <b>achieved.</b> <b>In</b> August 1939, Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning {{of the possibility of}} a German nuclear weapon project, and convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it. This resulted in support for research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Caligari {{was filmed}} in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a {{north-eastern}} suburb of Berlin. Decla {{had been making}} films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none of which could <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates {{the impression of a}} carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} {{the fabric of the}} building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of the}} Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>in</b> co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role as a working royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E
