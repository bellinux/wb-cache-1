40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} studies {{was performed to}} investigate two separate fluid impingement flow systems intended for removal of particles from a surface or deposition of particles onto a surface. One of these flow systems is generated using a nozzle that incorporates both tilted jets and suction to create {{what we call a}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>bounded</b> <b>vortex</b> flow 2 ̆ 2, consisting of an annular swirling jet and a wall-normal vortex with axial upflow into a suction outlet. The other flow system is generated by a combination of acoustic streaming and substrate heating from an ultrasonic source. The primary methods used in the study for flow field measurements included laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and particle-image velocimetry (PIV). Thermocouples are utilized for gathering temperature information from the ultrasonic induced flow. For the <b>bounded</b> <b>vortex</b> flow, different jet/suction flow rates and different nozzle-substrate separation distances were examined. In the acoustic-generated flow system, different acoustic intensities and transducer-substrate separation distances and different choices of substrate material were examined. Both flow systems achieve high levels of shear stress on the impingement surface via a combination of flow oriented toward and/or away from the surface and via formation of vortex structures near the impingement surface. In the bounded flow configuration, the vortex flow is oriented with axis normal to the impingement surface, whereas in the acoustic-generated flow a series of vortex rings form with axes parallel to the impingement surface. For both flow fields, conditions are observed with high impingement surface shear stress that are well suited to particle removal from the impingement surface. However, as the variables controlling the flows are varied, other conditions are observed in which the flow fields become unstable, leading to oscillatory flows that generally have much smaller shear stress values on the impingement surface. The rate of fluid mixing, as characterized by upward and downward flows normal to the impingement surface, is also generally decreased after these flow transitions have occurred, implying that the unstable flows will be less suited for both particle deposition on and particle removal from the impingement surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{motion of}} {{incompressible}} and ideal fluids is {{studied in the}} plane. The stability in L 1 of circular vortex patches is established among the class of all <b>bounded</b> <b>vortex</b> patches of equal strength. For planar incompressible and ideal fluid flow, the theory of Yudovich [9] establishes global well-posedness of the initial value problem with initial vorticity in L 1 (R 2) ∩ L ∞ (R 2). Because vorticity is transported in 2 d, it remains constant along particle trajectories. If Φt is the flow map, then the vorticity is given by ω(t, Φt(y)) = ω(0, y), for all t> 0 and y ∈ R 2. When the initial vorticity is a patch of unit strength, represented by the indicator (characteristic) function IΩ 0 of a bounded open set Ω 0 ⊂ R 2, the resulting vorticity is IΩt, with Ωt = Φt(Ω 0). In the special case when Ω 0 is equal to a ball B, the patch is stationary, Φt(B) = B, for all t> 0. Theorem 3, our main result, gives the stability in L 1 (R 2) of any circular patch within the class of all <b>bounded</b> <b>vortex</b> patches of equal strength. No restriction {{is placed on the}} L 1 distance of the perturbation to the ball, and the flow region is not limited to a bounded domain, but rather is the entire space R 2. Wan and Pulvirenti [8] were the first to study stability of vortex patches in L 1. They considered the case where the flow was contained in a bounded region, although for the stability of circular patches they mention that this assumption can be removed. Their key estimate, (J), shows that the total angular momenta of the patches can be used to control the L 1 difference between an arbitrary patch and a circular patch of the same total mass. They allow the strengths of the patches differ, in which case the two patches are assumed to be close in L 1. Our generalization of their inequality, given in Lemma 2, estimates the L 1 distance of an arbitrary patch to a circular patch, when bot...|$|R
40|$|A two-dimensional, incompressible, isentropic, "mainly {{inviscid}} " {{model of}} the total tem-perature variation in a von Karman vortex street is developed with special consideration to {{the distribution of the}} total temperature change in finite vortex cores.

A theoretical model for the inner flow is obtained by assuming that this is a region of low viscosity with elliptic streamlines having cyclic properties. For the highly viscous bounding regions two con-straints are imposed, namely that the contour integral of the jump in normal velocity component across the sheet be equal to zero and that the total circulation due to both regions equal the point vortex circulation seen by the outer potential flow. Results ob-tained successfully highlight the importance of vortex motion in this phenomenon and the validity of the radial equilibrium assumption in near-circular cores.

40|$|The {{effect of}} vortex {{generators}} {{in the form}} of tabs on the penetration and spreading of a jet in a cross-flow has been studied experimentally. It is found that the tab has very little effect when placed on the leeward side, i. e., on the downstream edge of the jet nozzle relative to the free-stream flow. A study of the static pressure distribution reveals significantly lower pressures on the leeward side. Thus, when placed on that side the tab does not produce a "pressure hill" of sufficient magnitude that is the primary source of streamwise vorticity in the flow field over the tab. This qualitatively explains the ineffectiveness. In comparison, there is a significant effect on the flow field when the tab is placed on the windward side, The sense of vorticity generated by the tab in the latter configuration is opposite to that of the <b>bound</b> <b>vortex</b> pair that otherwise characterizes the flow.

40|$|By using {{a special}} {{momentum}} approach {{and with the}} help of interchange between singularity velocity and induced flow velocity, we derive in a physical way explicit force formulas for two-dimensional inviscid flow involving multiple bound and free vortices, multiple airfoils, and vortex production. These force formulas hold individually for each airfoil thus allowing for force decomposition, and the contributions to forces from singularities (such as bound and image vortices, sources, and doublets) and bodies out of an airfoil are related to their induced velocities at the locations of singularities inside this airfoil. The force contribution due to vortex production is related to the vortex production rate and the distance between each pair of vortices in production, thus frame-independent. The formulas are validated against a number of standard problems. These force formulas, which generalize the classic Kutta–Joukowski theorem (for a single <b>bound</b> <b>vortex)</b> and the recent generalized Lagally theorem (for problems without a <b>bound</b> <b>vortex</b> and vortex production) to more general cases, can be used to identify or understand the roles of outside vortices and bodies on the forces of the actual body, optimize arrangement of outside vortices and bodies for force enhancement or reduction, and derive analytical force formulas once the flow field is given or known...|$|E
