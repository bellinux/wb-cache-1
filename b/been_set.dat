5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already <b>been</b> <b>set</b> by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have <b>been</b> <b>set</b> as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a dictum quoted from Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
