2500|$|Visual acuity, or resolving power, is [...] "the {{ability to}} {{distinguish}} fine detail" [...] {{and is the}} property of cone cells. It is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles. Resolution in CPD can be measured by <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> of different numbers of white/black stripe cycles. For example, if each pattern is 1.75cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye, it will subtend an angle of 1 degree, so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be {{a measure of the}} cycles per degree of that pattern. The highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes, or distinguish from a grey block, is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye.|$|E

Skube states that, while having some merit, these arguments were [...] "partly beside the point [...] U.S. News survey, for all its imperfections, performs the useful service of comparing apples with academic apples.In some ways, one might even argue that its nuts-and-bolts consumer information {{is at least as}} practical as the <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and numbers a car buyer might find in Consumer Reports or Car and Driver. What factors go into the rankings? Student retention accounts for 25% at schools U.S. News calls master's level and those that provide primarily the bachelor's degree (called 'comprehensive' schools, oddly enough)." [...] Skube also notes objections made to the reputation survey portion of the U.S. News survey and responds by stating that, [...] "one can see why." [...] However, he argues, [...] "sometimes just the facts will do, and the U.S. News manual offers them in great heaps [...] Sarah Lawrence, for example, does not take into consideration SAT or ACT scores. Don't even send 'em, it tells high school students. That tells me all I need to know about Sarah Lawrence. It tells me that Sarah Lawrence doesn't take aptitude as seriously as I'd like. The university depends far more on high school grades, which, as anyone who has taught at the college level knows, cannot be trusted. If last year's freshman classes at several colleges all had composite high school grade point averages of 3.6 to 3.8, I don't know how the intellectual caliber of one differs from another. But if one college attracted high school students whose SATs averaged 1100 to 1200, and another attracted students with SATs averaging 1300 to 1400, I know the latter is more selective. Sarah Lawrence might not care about such things, but I do." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthetic}} {{double sampling}} (SDS) (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> comprises the double sampling (DS) (X) over bar and conforming run length (CRL) sub-charts. The SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> {{has been studied}} under the assumption of known process parameters in the literature. Nevertheless, in practice, process parameters are usually unknown and are estimated from an in-control Phase I dataset. This paper investigates {{the performance of the}} SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters, in terms of the average run length (ARL), average number of observations to signal (ANOS) and standard deviation of the run length (SDRL). The performance of the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters by minimizing the out-of-control ARL and the out-of-control ANOS is compared with the corresponding chart's performance with known process parameters. In addition, the minimum number of Phase I samples required by the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters so that it has approximately the same in-control ARL and ANOS performances as the chart with known process parameters is studied. The ARL, ANOS and SDRL properties of the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters differ significantly from that of the chart with known process parameters. Therefore, suitable optimal charting parameters are introduced so that the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters has an adequate performance as its known process parameters counterpart without having to use large number of Phase I samples and sample size...|$|R

40|$|The double {{sampling}} (DS) X <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> {{one of the}} most widely-used charting methods, is superior for detecting small and moderate shifts in the process mean. In a right skewed run length distribution, the median run length (MRL) provides a more credible representation of the central tendency than the average run length (ARL), as the mean is greater than the median. In this paper, therefore, MRL is used as the performance criterion instead of the traditional ARL. Generally, the performance of the DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is investigated under the assumption of known process parameters. In practice, these parameters are usually estimated from an in-control reference Phase-I dataset. Since the performance of the DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is significantly affected by estimation errors, we study the effects of parameter estimation on the MRL-based DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> when the in-control average sample size is minimised. This study reveals that more than 80 samples are required for the MRL-based DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated parameters to perform more favourably than the corresponding chart with known parameters...|$|R

40|$|Plagiarism can be {{considered}} one of the electronic crimes and intellectual thefts, which has become one of educational challenges of research institutions. One form to represent quantitative information is charts such as line and <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> which can formulate the information in info-graphic form. The extraction of features of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is an essential process to get the data from images. Some techniques presented by researchers focused on the graphical part rather than text itself, such as Hough Transform and Learning Based method. In this study, ten features of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> images are utilized to detect and find the proportion of similarity between the charts. Some of these features can be directly extracted by OCR, while others demand finding the relationship between the text part and the graphic part to extract the data such as the real values for each bar in images. The new technique which introduced in this research can extract three values of each bar namely Start, End and Exact values depending on horizontal and vertical lines of the <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> image. In addition, the Word 2 -gram and Euclidean distance methods are used to detect and find the plagiarism. Experimental results show the ability of the system to detect plagiarism for ten possible patterns of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> plagiarisms. The performance of the system is evaluated depending on overlapping features and precision and recall. The experimental results show the ability of the system to detect not only copy and paste data of bars, but also restructuring and summarization of captions of image as well as modifications to data of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> images, such as swapping among bars, changing colors and changing scales of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> images...|$|R

50|$|Bar graphs {{can also}} be used for more complex {{comparisons}} of data with grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and stacked <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> In a grouped bar chart, for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped bar chart with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue. Alternatively, a stacked bar chart could be used. The stacked bar chart stacks bars that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However, stacked <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped bar chart are preferable.|$|E
