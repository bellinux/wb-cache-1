40|$|Objective Xanthine oxidase is {{a highly}} {{versatile}} enzyme that is widely distributed among different species. The hydroxylation of purines is catalysed by xanthine oxidase and especially the conversion of xanthine to uric acid. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are much useful, since they possess lesser side effects compared to uricosuric and anti-inflammatory agents. The present study deals with in silico and in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory analysis of commercially available terpenoids (<b>bisabolol,</b> Î²-caryophyllene, limonene, and Î±- terpinene). Methods Molecular docking studies were performed using AutoDock 4. 2 and in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity was carried out using xanthine as the substrate. In addition, enzyme kinetics was performed using Lineweaver Burkplot analysis. Allopurinol, a known xanthine oxidase inhibitor {{was used as the}} standard. Results The results revealed that <b>bisabolol</b> exhibited a lowest binding energy value of about - 7. 33 kcal/mol. All other compounds showed binding energy values ranging between - 7. 33 to - 5. 87 kcal/mol which was less than the standard (- 4. 78 kcal/mol). In the xanthine oxidase assay, IC 50 value of <b>bisabolol</b> was found to be 34. 70 Âµg/ml, whereas that of allopurinol was 8. 48 Âµg/ml. All the remaining compounds exhibited IC 50 values ranging between 34. 70 to 68. 45 Âµg/ml. Â  In the enzyme kinetic studies, <b>bisabolol,</b> Î²-caryophyllene showed non competitive and Limonene, Î±- terpinene and allopurinol showed competitive type of enzyme inhibition. Conclusion It can be concluded that terpenoids could be a promising remedy for the treatment of gout and related inflammatory disorders.

Both bioregulators (especially at 100 mg/ 1) improved plant growth parameters (plant height, branches number, fresh and dry weight) during the vegetative stage. Spermidine {{was more effective}} than stigmasterol. This effect was consequential during the flowering stage. However, at that stage, fresh and dry weights, flowers number and weight, were more affected by stigmasterol application than spermidine. At both stages, spermidine and stigmasterol, at the concentration of 100 mg/ 1 strongly affected growth. Consequently, the biochemical constituents of leaves (total sugars, phenols and indoles) were increased. Essential oil content of flowers was significantly improved by the application of both bioregulators especially at the concentration of 100 mg/ 1.

40|$|Summary. Experiments were {{conducted}} during two growing seasons (2001 / 02 and 2002 / 03) at the greenhouse {{to study the}} effect of spermidine and stigmasterol on growth, flowering, biochemical constituents and essential oil content of chamomile plant (Chamomilla recutita L., Rausch). Different concentrations (25, 50, 75 and 100 mg/ 1) of spermidine and stigmasterol were applied during the vegetative stage. Both bioregulators (especially at 100 mg/ 1) improved plant growth parameters (plant height, branches number, fresh and dry weight) during the vegetative stage.

40|$|Background: On {{account of}} {{emergence}} of multi- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains, combinations of drugs with natural compounds were tested {{to search for}} antibiotic activity enhancers. In this work we studied terpenes (α-pinene, <b>bisabolol,</b> β-elemene, (R) -limonene, (S) -limonene, myrcene, sabinene), which are the main constituents of essential oil obtained from Mutellina purpurea L., a plant with described antitubercular activity, to investigate their interactions with antibiotics against reference Mtb strains and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Methods: The serial dilution method {{was used to evaluate}} the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tested compounds, while the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated for characterization of interactions. Moreover, IC 50 values of tested compounds were determined using monkey kidney epithelial cell line (GMK). Results: The combinations of all studied terpenes with ethambutol or rifampicin resulted in a synergistic interaction. <b>Bisabolol</b> and (R) -limonene decreased the MIC for rifampicin at least two-fold for all tested strains, however no synergistic action was observed against virulent strains. The tested terpenes showed slight (<b>bisabolol)</b> or no cytotoxic effect against normal eukaryotic cells in vitro. Conclusions: The obtained enhanced activity (FICI < 0. 5) of ethambutol and rifampicin against H 37 Ra strain {{under the influence of the}} studied terpenes may be correlated to the capability of essential oil constituents to modify bacterial resistance mechanisms in general. The observed differences in avirulent and virulent bacteria susceptibility to terpenes tested separately and in combinations with antibiotics can be correlated with the differences in the cell wall structure between H 37 Ra mutant and all virulent strains...|$|E

Although this skin problem was initially described on the face, the scalp is often affected. A sensitive scalp can react with irritation to harsh surfactants or other additives which are often present in shampoos. For this reason, we developed a new rinse-off hypertolerant shampoo specifically designed for the hypersensitive and problematic scalp. Methods: The shampoo formulation {{is based on an}} extremely mild surfactant system and contains <b>bisabolol,</b> an anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory ingredient of chamomile. The shampoo is free of additives such as perfumes, silicones, colorants, parabens, paraffins, and betaine. Since skin can remain in a hyperreactive state after wounding, the status after hair transplantation was chosen as a model system to test the shampoo. Scalp condition and compatibility of each volunteer were analyzed by a plastic surgeon directly after hair transplant and after stitch removal. The plastic surgeons also rated whether they would recommend the further use of the test shampoo. Additionally, volunteers completed a self-assessment questionnaire. Results: Following hair transplantation, regular use of the shampoo resulted in a significant reduction in the extent of scabbing and erythema. This was confirmed by dermatological scalp examinations performed by the plastic surgeon as well as in volunteers&# 39; self-assessments. The plastic surgeon highly recommended the further use of the test shampoo after hair transplant to all study participants. Conclusion: Application of the test shampoo demonstrated excellent skin compatibility and product efficacy after hair transplant. The test shampoo significantly reduced the extent of scabs and erythema. Therefore, the shampoo is ideally suited for use after hair transplantation and for the treatment of sensitive scalp. The excellent skin compatibility is because of the mild surfactant system, the calming ingredient <b>bisabolol,</b> and the absence of potentially irritating ingredients.

40|$|The chamazulene and α-(−) -bisabolol {{contents}} {{and quality of}} the chamomile oil are affected by genetic background and environmental conditions. Salicylic acid (SA), as a signaling molecule, plays {{a significant role in the}} plant physiological processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical profile, quantity, and improve the essential oil quality as a consequence of the increase of chamazulene and α-(−) -bisabol using salicylic acid under normal and heat stress conditions by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. The factorial experiments were carried out during the 2011 – 2012 hot season using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The factors include four salicylic acid concentrations (0 (control), 10, 25 and 100 mg·L− 1), and three chamomile cultivars (Bushehr, Bona, Bodegold) were sown on two different planting dates under field conditions. Fourteen compounds were identified from the extracted oil of the samples treated with salicylic acid under normal and heat stress conditions. The major identified oil compositions from chamomile cultivars treated with salicylic acid were chamazulene, α-(−) -bisabolol, bisabolone oxide, β-farnesene, en-yn-dicycloether, and <b>bisabolol</b> oxide A and B. Analysis of variance showed that the simple effects (environmental conditions, cultivar and salicylic acid) and their interaction were significant on all identified compounds, but the environmental conditions had no significant effect on <b>bisabolol</b> oxide A.

(-) -a-bisabolol demonstrated to have an antinociceptive activity in the models of visceral nociception induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid and in {{the second phase of the}} test nociception was induced by intraplantar administration of formaline. (-) -a-bisabolol did not demonstrate activity in the thermal nociception model of hot plate. These findings suggests that the antinociceptive action of (-) -a-bisabolol is not linked to central mechanisms and may be related with pre inflamatory process. In the models of paw oedema induced by carragenine and dextran the animals treated with (-) -a-bisabolol showed smaller oedemas as compared to animals treated only with the vehicle. (-) -a-bisabolol was capable to reduce the paw oedemas induced by 5 - HT, but not the oedema induced by histamine, so it could relate the antiinflamatory activity of (-) -a-bisabolol to the interference in the action/liberation or in the systesis/metabolism of 5 - HT. (-) -a-bisabolol demostrated having gastroprotective activity in the absolute ethanol and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions. The mechanism of this action was pharmacologicaly tested, doing pre-treatments with L-NAME, Glibenclamide and Indomethacin. These experiments demonstrated that tha gastroprotective action of (-) -a-bisabolol seems not to be involved the nitric oxide, potassium channels ATP-dependents or the sysntesis of prostaglandines. By the way, the quantification of GSH in the gastric tissues of not lesioned animals e lesionated by ethanol or indomethacin showed that the treatment with (-) -a- <b>bisabolol</b> atenuate the decrease of GSH associated with the lesive agents, but it did not increase its levels in the animals that not recieve ethanol or indomethacin. This way (-) -a- <b>bisabolol</b> increase the disponibility of GSH in the gastric tissue, having in vivo antioxidant activity, that allows us to associate this finding to its gastroprotective action...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Eremanthus erythropappus, {{commonly}} known as candeia, is an income-generating tree native to Brazil. This {{is due to the}} high durability of its wood and its essential oil containing the active component alpha <b>bisabolol.</b> Despite this economic potential, until the early 2000 's no studies existed to explore the sustainable management in areas in which the species naturally occurs or for establishing commercial plantations. This study proposes new management strategies based on an individual tree model, and evaluates the growth behavior of candeia trees planted in different spacing. The experiment was installed in March 2002, in Carrancas municipality, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The experimental area was divided into 4 blocks with 4 different spacings as treatments. The individual model used to propose the best management system uses development of crown area as a function of DBH. The results showed that candeia trees were sensitive to initial spacing variation. With increased initial spacing, candeia trees reached competition later, as demonstrated by crown area development. Thus, candeia trees planted at a wider spacing maintain a desirable growth rate without need for thinning for a longer time, compared to trees planted at narrower spacing. The fitted individual tree model presented in this study showed consistent results and flexibility, providing alternatives for different management strategies. The best growth response was obtained for planting densities greater than 3. 75 m² per tree, which corresponds to a spacing of 1. 5 x 2. 5 m...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the activity in vitro of the plant extracts obtained from common herbs cultivated in the Lubelszczyzna region against the reference strain H. pylori ATCC 43504. Among these are thyme herbs, chamomile flowers, peppermint leaves and coneflower herbs. Herein, it was found that the MIC values of the assayed extracts were as follows: the extracts from coneflower herbs showed anti-H. pylori activity with MIC = 31. 3 - 125 μg/ml; the extracts from chamomile flowers demonstrated MIC = 31. 3 - 62. 5 μg/ ml; the extracts from peppermint leaves had MIC = 15. 6 - 250 μg/ml; and the extracts from thyme herbs revealed MIC = 15. 6 - 62. 5 μg/ml, depending on the solvent used. The most active were the extracts obtained with ethyl acetate or ethanol alcohol absolute 99. 8 %. These showing MIC within the range of 15. 6 - 62. 5 μg/ml, while the lowest activity was observed in case of the extract obtained with 70 % aqueous ethanol. This last showing MIC within the range of 62. 5 - 250 μg/ml. The MIC values of essential oil components were 15. 6 μg/ml for <b>bisabolol</b> and menthol or 31. 3 μg/ml for thymol.

40|$|BACKGROUND Herbal liqueurs are {{alcoholic}} beverages {{produced by the}} maceration or distillation of aromatic and medicinal plants in alcohol, and are also highly valued for their medicinal properties. The process conditions, {{as well as the}} number and quantity of the plants employed, will have a great influence {{on the quality of the}} liqueur obtained. The aim of this research was to optimize these important variables. RESULTS A BoxBenhken experimental design was used to evaluate the independent variables: alcohol content, amount of plant and time during the experimental maceration of plants in grape marc distillate. Four plants were assessed, with the main compound of each plant representing the dependent variable evaluated with respect to following the evolution of the maceration process. <b>Bisabolol</b> oxide A in Matricaria recutita L., linalool in Coriander sativum L. and eucalyptol in Eucalyptus globulus Labill. were quantified using a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector. Glycyrrhizic acid in Glycyrrhiza glabra L was determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector. Other dependent variables were also evaluated: total phenolic content, color parameters and consumer preference (i. e. appearance). CONCLUSION The experimental designs allowed the selection of the optimal maceration conditions for each parameter, including the preference score of consumers: 70 % (v/v) of ethanol, 40 g L 1 plant concentration and a maceration process of 3 weeks.

40|$|Background: The current {{chemotherapy}} for cutaneous leishmaniosis (CL) has {{a series}} of drug limitations such as toxic side effects, long duration, high costs and drug resistance, which requires {{the development of new}} drugs or effective alternatives to the CL treatment. Essential oils (EOs) are complex mixtures of secondary metabolites from various plants. It has been shown that several EOs, or their constituents, have inhibitory activity against protozoa. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the biological activity of different essential oils (EOs) on Leishmania (L.) amazonensis promastigotes forms, as well as their cytotoxicity on mammalian cells and chemical composition. Methods: Sixteen EOs were evaluated by mean of IC 50 / 24 h and cytotoxicity against L 6 cells (CC 50 / 24 h) using Resazurin assay. Only those EOs that presented better results for IC 50 / 24 h were submitted to GC–MS analysis to determine their chemical constitution. Results: The EO from Cinnamodendron dinisii, Matricaria chamomilla, Myroxylon peruiferum, Salvia sclarea, Bulnesia sarmientoi, Ferula galbaniflua, Siparuna guianensis and Melissa officinalis were the most active against L. amazonensis with IC 50 / 24 h ranging from 54. 05 to 162. 25 μg/mL. Analysis of EOs by GC–MS showed mainly the presence of β-farnesene (52. 73 %) and <b>bisabolol</b> oxide (12. 09 %) for M. chamomilla; α-copaene (13. 41 %), safrole (8. 35 %) and δ-cadinene (7. 08 %) for M. peruiferum; linalool (28. 80 %) and linalyl acetate (60. 08 %) for S. sclarea; guaiol (48. 29 %) and 2 -undecanone (19. 49 %) for B. sarmientoi; ethyl phthalate (13. 09 %) and methyl- 8 -pimaren- 18 -oate (41. 82 %) for F. galbaniflua; and neral (37. 18 %) and citral (5. 02 %) for M. officinalis. Conclusion: The EO from F. galbaniflua showed to be effective against L. amazonensis promastigotes forms and presented low cytotoxic activity against L 6 cells. Thus, it represents a strong candidate for future studies aiming its molecular activity on these pathogenic parasites...|$|E
40|$|Biosynthesis of {{secondary}} metabolites occurs by concerted multistep reactions in a biological (chiral) environment. Therefore, many natural products (NPs) are chiral molecules having one or several stereocenters. The biological activity of NPs and drug like molecules is generally {{dependent on the}} stereochemistry of a molecule. Thus NPs are uniquely predestined to interact with biomacromolecules, and this explains their importance as drug leads. Chiroptical methods such as electronic circular dichroism (ECD) {{have been used for}} assignment of absolute configuration since several decades, but were limited in their applicability. The rapidly developing computer technologies and a broad diversity of quantum chemical methods available now permit to study virtually any molecule by selecting the most appropriate method for each particular case, with regard to the desired accuracy, time consumption, and available computer resources. The progress in the areas of conformational analysis and quantum chemical calculation of molecular properties has widened the applicability of ECD in unambiguous determination of chiral molecules. This is especially valuable for the analysis of new molecular entities when chemical synthesis of the compound is not an option. The good agreements between the experimental and simulated ECD curves of these compounds provided the unambiguous configurational establishment. The aim of the present work was phytochemical investigation of Iranian medicinal plants, in order to identify bioactive compounds responsible for inhibition of Plasmodium falciparum. About 120 plant extracts were prepared from 40 plants traditionally used in Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) to treat malaria and screened for in vitro activity against P. falciparum. In a preliminary screen, the lipophilic extracts of Artemisia persica, Salvia hydrangea, and Salvia sahendica roots potently inhibited the growth of P. falciparum K 1 strain. HPLC-based activity profiling led to localizing and identification of the active constituents of these plant extracts. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of powerful analytical methods such as HPLC-PDA-TOF-MS, and microprobe NMR. In order to determine the absolute configurations of isolated chiral compounds, quantum chemical calculation of ECD spectra in combination with experimental ECD studies were used. This methodology successfully applied to establish the ACs of structurally diverse and conformationally rigid or flexible molecules including sesquiterpene coumarins, <b>bisabolol</b> sesquiterpenes, diterpenoids and complex isoprenoids with novel scaffolds. Activity profiling of the active n-hexane extract from the roots of Salvia sahendica against malaria resulted in the identification of eight abietane-type diterpenoids. In vitro biological activities of isolated pure compounds were determined against P. falciparum L& strain and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900 strain, and cytotoxicity in rat myoblast (L 6) cells was determined. The IC 50 values of the compounds ranged from 0. 8 µM to over 8. 8 µM against P. falciparum, and from 1. 8 µM to over 32. 3 µM against T. brucei rhodesiense. The cytotoxic IC 50 values ranged from 0. 5 - 15. 5 µM. Selectivity indices for P. falciparum were from 0. 1 to 18. 2, and 0. 1 to 1. 2 for T. brucei rhodesiense. The absolute configuration of sahandol (3) and sahandone (4) were assigned by comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra and optical rotation values. HPLC based activity profiling of the EtOAc extract of the aerial parts of Artemisia persica resulted in the isolation of a series of <b>bisabolol</b> oxide esters. Relative configurations of cyclohexenone/cyclohexene and tetrahydropyran moieties of 5 – 9 were established on the basis of 3 JH–H coupling constants and NOE difference spectra. Absolute configurations of 5 – 9 were established by comparison of experimental ECD spectra with simulated ECD data for possible stereoisomers, by TDDFT. Assignment of AC by ECD calculation is possible even though relative stereochemistry cannot establish by NMR techniques due to the flexibility of the molecule. Bisaboloids 5 – 8 exhibited in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum, with IC 50 values ranging from 2. 8 to 20. 1 µM, and selectivity indices (SI) in L- 6 cells of 3. 7 – 11. 9. Hydrangenone, perovskone and salvadione three new triterpenoids with rare carbon skeletons were isolated from aerial parts and flowers of Salvia hydrangea endemic plant to Iran. These compounds indicated significance in vitro activity against P. falciparum with IC 50 values 1. 40, 0. 18 and 1. 43 µM, respectively and acceptable selectivity index in rat myoblast L- 6 cells. ...|$|E
40|$|The recent finding as to {{the common}} {{distribution}} of antimicrobial peptides in multicellular organisms and their essential role in innate defenses has uncovered numerous possibilities for novel therapeutics. Despite the diversity of these peptides among organisms, investigations have revealed surprising similarities regarding their structure and their antimicrobial function. The insights gained from studies on antimicrobial peptides have provided new strategies and templates for the development and design of novel biomimetics {{that may be used}} in therapeutic, pharmaceutical and food applications. It is these features that are being used in the design of antimicrobially active peptide mimics in polymer and small molecule forms, some of which were investigated here for their broad spectrum activity alone and in combination with functional food ingredients (flavor and aroma compounds) capable of enhancing their activities. These novel combinations could be beneficial for targeted antimicrobial applications. The multicomponent systems developed here combine multiple functionalities - the abilities of the biomimetic polymers to breach the gram-negative outer membrane and the activities of both components against the cell membrane, and possible targets within the cytoplasm. Because they act on the conserved structure of the cell membrane, these treatments may be difficult to surmount via developed resistance. The research reported here bridges the fields of not only polymer chemistry and microbiology, but also of natural products. As an example, the functional food ingredients used to enhance biomimetic polymer activities were sesquiterpenoids, a class of naturally occurring terpenes that are found in plants where they serve as defensive agents. These compounds, including <b>bisabolol,</b> farnesol and nerolidol have previously been shown to enhance the activities of traditional antimicrobials such as antibiotics (Brehm-Stecher and Johnson, 2003). Their additional ability to dramatically enhance the activities of biomimetic antimicrobial polymers was demonstrated in the present work. Additional antimicrobial approaches were examined in this work, including the use of essential oils and metal nanoparticles. These compounds, either alone or in combination with enhancing compounds, were investigated with the aim of developing additional multicomponent antimicrobial systems. While essential oils have been used since ancient times for their antimicrobial properties, their use in some applications has been limited due to their strong odors and lack of effective activity at organoleptically acceptable levels. As a result, methods capable of enhancing their antimicrobial activities, especially in complex matrices, could be key to their advantageous use in food and clinical applications. Here, several different essential oils were combined with the polyionic compounds sodium polyphosphate and polyethylenimine and the activities of these systems were examined against a range of human pathogens. These polyions were found to be capable of potentiating the antimicrobial activities of the oils, allowing their effective use at lower levels. Metals have also been shown to be broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents in both their ionic and macrometallic forms. While these forms have been used for millennia as antimicrobials, {{little is known about the}} activities of these metals in nanoparticulate form, an area of great interest given the rapid growth of the nanotechnology sector. Therefore, a series of metal nanoparticles, including several novel alloys, were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities and for their physical (binding) interactions with microbial cell surfaces. Results from this work suggest the potential for using commercial metal nanoparticle catalysts as novel antimicrobial compounds. These could be valuable as components of antimicrobially active surfaces or therapeutics, once potentially limiting safety issues of particle migration and toxicity are addressed. Taken together, physical or chemical methods for enhancing the activities of core antimicrobials as diverse as biomimetic polymers, metal nanoparticles and essential oils or other natural compounds could provide beneficial strategies for developing effective multi-agent systems having enhanced antimicrobial properties. The resulting systems may find advantageous use in applications as diverse as food safety, environmental sanitation or clinical therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 0009899 J - PhD thesis - School of Therapeutic Sciences - Faculty of Health SciencesThe genus Eriocephalus {{commonly}} known as ‘wild rosemary’, ‘Cape snow bush’, or ‘kapokbos’ {{is a member of}} the family Asteraceae (tribe Anthemideae). The genus is endemic to southern Africa, with the highest concentration of species in the Western and Northern Cape. The genus comprises 32 species and a total of 42 taxa, which are distributed in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Lesotho. The characters used in species delimitation are purely based on morphological variation in floral and foliar parts and are highly homoplastic due to phenotypic plasticity. In many cases these features are not sufficiently distinctive, as some taxa tend to exhibit dimorphism in some character states such as the presence of opposite and alternate leaves. In some species there is extensive intergrading of the major diagnostic characters leading to uncertainty in species delimitation. Both chemical and molecular characters were used in this study in an attempt to evaluate current species delimitations in the genus, along with species-level relationships and affinities. The genus is also economically important with some of its members used as medicinals, fodder, perfumes, and cosmetics. This warrants investigation into the phytochemistry and biological activity of these species in order to determine a scientific rationale for their traditional uses. For this reason, the antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antioxidant activities, and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by the volatile oils and leaf extracts of the genus, which are relatively unknown for most members of the genus, were also investigated. Representatives of 22 species of the genus, eight of which were from Namibia and 14 from South Africa were collected from wild populations. In most cases multiple collections per population per species were considered. Aerial plant parts were hydrodistilled to obtain the essential oils, and phenolics were extracted from leaves using acetone. Essential oils were analysed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and phenolics were analysed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/UV). Biological assays were carried out using the 5 -lipoxygenase enzyme to evaluate antiinflammatory activity; disc diffusion and microtitre plate dilution assays were used to assess antimicrobial activities of selected fungi and bacteria; the TLC-DPPH and DPPHmicrotitre methods were used to investigate antioxidant activities and a TLC-bioautographic assay was used for testing the inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Total genomic DNA was extracted from silica dried leaf material. The non-coding plastid DNA regions, the psbA-trnH intergenic spacers and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA were amplified, and sequenced and analysed using the parsimony algorithm. The essential oils are largely comprised of acyclic, monocyclic, and bicyclic regular and irregular mono- and sesquiterpenes of various structural groups. Two hundred compounds were noted in the essential oils with some of the common constituents being; α- and β-pinene, yomogi alcohol, ρ-cymene, 1, 8 -cineole, camphor, 4 -terpineol, spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide, α-copaene and β-caryophyllene. Most of the species have a relatively high content of 1, 8 -cineole and camphor. Twenty-two chemotypes were noted and the potential for commercial development in the flavour, fragrance and pharmaceutical industries has been recorded. Among the favourable chemotypes noted includes the camphor, 1, 8 -cineole, <b>bisabolol</b> oxide B and nerolidol rich oils. However, due to the extensive variability in the essential oil profiles, standardization of oils in commercial development is crucial. The leaf extracts comprised of flavonoids with the flavones and flavanones as the major structural types present in most species. The terpene and flavonoid chemistry of the genus is highly divergent even among multiple individuals of the same species and hence not a good taxonomic marker for specific delimitation as no coherent groups was evident although some phytochemical congruence has been noted between some of the taxa. The DNA sequence data revealed lack of variability in the non-coding regions psbA-trnH and trnL-F among species of the genus. The nuclear DNA region (ITS) was variable but the number of characters separating taxa was too few for resolution of relationships between taxa. Presence of highly divergent paralogous repeats of ITS were also noted in some taxa. The combination of molecular and chemical data did not resolve the species delimitation problems due to the highly variable distribution of characters within a single species. The patterns of variation observed in the genus may be attributed to chemical convergence, divergence, hybridisation, differential gene expression, polymorphism and allelochemical diversification among other factors. The lack of coherence in the phylogenetic and phenetic groupings of the various taxa implies that the current species boundaries may not be a true reflection of natural taxonomic entities. The use of multiple taxa in taxonomic studies is strongly recommended due to the extensive variability noted in the chemical profiles of the taxa that is also depicted in the phylogenetic histories. It also implies that caution should be taken in bioprospecting for new natural products for commercial development, as plant chemical profiles especially from the same species can be very variable. This implies carrying out exhaustive population and genetic studies for evaluation of diversity in the study group. In the antimicrobial assay, the oils were more active against the Gram-positive bacteria (2 - 16 mg/ml) and yeasts (1 - 16 mg/ml). Bacillus cereus and Cryptococcus neofomans were the most susceptible pathogens to the oils. The extracts exhibited low activity against the test pathogens except E. aromaticus and E. pinnatus with activity of 0. 2 mg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus respectively. The susceptibility of the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans and the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus to the oils and extracts is an indication of the potential for use of the members of the genus as natural antibiotics. The essential oils exhibited antiinflammatory activities with IC 50 values ranging between 19. 0 - 98. 6 μg/ml. The oils did not show antioxidant activity at the starting concentration of 100 μg/ml but the acetone leaf extracts exhibited antioxidant activities with IC 50 values ranging between 21. 5 - 79. 6 μg/ml. The essential oils showed inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The biological activity of the oils indicates that most of the traditional uses are influenced by the presence of the oils. The in vitro biological activity of the essential oils and extracts against the test pathogens provides a scientific basis for the use of some of the members in traditional herbal remedies and validates the use of some of the members of the genus for treatment of respiratory tract infections, gastro-intestinal disorders, mental conditions, dermal infections, and inflammation. The study records the biological activities for some of the species for the first time and their potential for use in flavourings, perfumery, cosmetics, as sources of antimicrobial drugs, permeability enhancers in pharmaceutical formulations and for use as industrial oils...|$|E
