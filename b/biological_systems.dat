5|$|In ecology, {{sustainability}} (from sustain and ability) is {{the property}} of <b>biological</b> <b>systems</b> to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable <b>biological</b> <b>systems.</b> In more general terms, sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for sustainability is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. Sustainability science {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E

5|$|Examples of biologically {{important}} {{fatty acids}} include the eicosanoids, derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, that include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes. Docosahexaenoic acid {{is also important}} in <b>biological</b> <b>systems,</b> {{particularly with respect to}} sight. Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides. Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters, fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives, fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines. The fatty amides include N-acyl ethanolamines, such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter anandamide.|$|E
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain <b>biological</b> <b>systems</b> cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in all known <b>biological</b> <b>systems,</b> generally functioning as electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5grams per day, but {{most people in the}} United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in <b>biological</b> <b>systems.</b> In systems theory and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus {{may be related to the}} phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E

Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E

40|$|DE 102007030413 A 1 UPAB: 20090222 NOVELTY - The {{method for}} {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> (28) using an extracellular-metabolizing system, comprises examining the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> on a permeable support (30), guiding the gaseous medium over a surface of the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> for the formation of an exposure atmosphere above the <b>biological</b> test <b>system,</b> adding the extracellular-metabolizing system to a maintenance medium, and positioning the maintenance medium with the extracellular-metabolizing system below the permeable support. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for investigating {{the effect of a}} gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> (28) using an extracellular-metabolizing system, comprises examining the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> on a permeable support (30), guiding the gaseous medium over a surface of the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> for the formation of an exposure atmosphere above the <b>biological</b> test <b>system,</b> adding the extracellular-metabolizing system to a maintenance medium, positioning the maintenance medium with the extracellular-metabolizing system below the permeable support, adjusting the depression of the extracellular-metabolizing system admitted to the maintenance medium through the permeable support by giving a determined pressure affecting on the maintenance medium with the metabolizing system, and regulating the evaporation rate over the culture by giving a determined temperature in direct surrounding region of the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> and/or giving a determined flow rate of the gaseous medium flowing over the surface of the <b>biological</b> test <b>system.</b> The pressure effected on the maintenance medium is selected, so that the metabolizing system depresses through the permeable support and the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> does not inundate from the maintenance medium with the metabolizing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an exposure device for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> using an extracellular-metabolizing system. USE - Method for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> using an extracellular-metabolizing system useful for exposing the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> in cigarette smoke or in automobile- or industrial exhaust gases, for investigating the environmental atmospheres, work-station atmospheres or inner-space atmospheres, for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> in the field of product security, consumer protection, pharmaceutical development, production supervision or medicine technology, for investigating the effect of a gaseous medium on a <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> under the observance of {{organization for economic cooperation and}} development (OECD) guidelines, and for investigating toxicological effects, genotoxic effects, immunomodulatory or immunotoxic effects or others biological or toxicological relevant cellular changes (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method is capable of effectively, reliably and simply investigating the effect of the gaseous medium on the <b>biological</b> test <b>system</b> with high sensitivity and selectivity thus reducing the complexity of cultural practices, and capable of regulating and controlling the flow rate of the gaseous medium on the <b>biological</b> test <b>system...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that <b>biological</b> <b>systems</b> can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{naturally}} only {{occurs in}} traces in <b>biological</b> <b>systems</b> {{and has no}} known biological role, but does have effects on the body when ingested. Lithium carbonate {{is used as a}} mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in daily doses of about 0.5 to 2grams, although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness, slurred speech and vomiting, among other symptoms, and poisons the central nervous system, which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage. Its biochemistry, the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element, although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified.|$|E
