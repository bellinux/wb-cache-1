40|$|Abstract. There are {{two main}} {{shortcomings}} in the existing models for generating checking sequences based on distinguishing sequences.

Finally, a third treatment is performed to introduce two active demand aggregators, with flexible interruptible loads in real time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between a so-called "garden leave" clause and a post-termination restraint of trade clause in employment contracts, in view of the decision in Vodacom (Pty) Ltd v Motsa 2016 3 SA 116 (LC). The Labour Court grappled with the question of whether the enforcement of the garden leave provision impacts on the enforcement of a post-termination restraint of trade clause. Enforcement of both these types of clauses may be problematic. It can result in unfairness if an employee ends up being commercially inactive for a long period. The author argues that garden leave has a direct effect on the enforcement of a post- termination restraint of trade clause. Accordingly, a restraint of trade will be enforced only if the employer's proprietary interest requires additional protection <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> under the garden leave clause...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to test the {{effectiveness}} of wage-irrelevant goal setting policies in a laboratory environment. In our design, managers can assign a goal to their workers by setting a certain level of performance on the work task. We establish our theoretical conjectures by developing a model where assigned goals act as reference points to workers' intrinsic motivation. Consistent with our model, we find that managers set goals which are challenging but attainable for an average-ability worker. Workers respond to these goals by increasing effort, performance and by decreasing on-the-job leisure activities with respect to the no-goal setting baseline. Finally, we study the interaction between goal setting and monetary rewards and find that goal setting is most effective when monetary incentives are strong. These results suggest that goal setting may produce intrinsic motivation and increase workers' performance <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> using solely monetary incentives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Although static ranked lists {{remain the}} {{dominant}} Web search interface, they can limit {{the ability of}} Web searchers to find desired information when it is buried deep {{in the collection of}} search results. Web search visualization and Web search personalization are two active research directions that have shown promise for improving the user experience while searching the Web. In this paper, we propose three methods for visually representing information available within a personalized Web search system: tag clouds, term histograms, and term lists. These approaches not only describe the per-sonalization model to the searcher, but also support interactive re-ranking of the search results. While preliminary evaluations did not find improvements <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> with the personalization system, measures of subjective reactions showed an increased satisfaction in the search results.

40|$|Recent {{works have}} {{highlighted}} scale invariance or symmetry {{present in the}} weight space of a typical deep network and the adverse effect it has on the Euclidean gradient based stochastic gradient descent optimization.

We propose to tackle {{the issue of the}} weight space symmetry by constraining the filters to lie on the unit-norm manifold. Consequently, training the network boils down to using stochastic gradient descent updates on the unit-norm manifold.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{investigate}} whether {{an increase in}} dairy food consumption improves the changes in BMI and adiposity in children on an energy restricted diet. METHODS Overweight and obese children (n = 120, age: 12 - 18 y, BMI: 27 - 40 kg/m 2) were randomized to receive a calorie restricted diet providing a 500 kcal/d deficit from total energy expenditure and two (n = 40), three (n = 40) or four (n = 40) servings of dairy products/day. Anthropometric measurements in addition to serum hs-CRP and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS Among the 96 children who completed the study, significant reductions in overall BMI, BMI z-score, weight, total body fat percentage and total body fat mass were observed (p 0. 05). Overall waist/hip ratio, Serum vitamin D and lipid profile did not change significantly (p > 0. 05) apart from {{a significant increase in}} HDL-cholesterol (p 0. 05).

40|$|Competition law in many {{countries}} prohibits firms from making false claims about product quality or performance to potential buyers and also requires that the truth of specific claims be supported by adequate prior testing. This paper explores the differences between these two policies and asks, among other questions, whether a policy of mandatory prior substantiation has any incremental effect if a ban on false claims is in place. This paper develops a model in which firms have private information about their probability of having a high quality product {{and are able to}} determine product quality with certainty through costly learning. Penalties for false claims and for unsubstantiated claims create an opportunity for firms to credibly reveal their information and for signaling to emerge in equilibrium. I show that the two kinds of penalties affect the possibility of signaling in different ways, and that the mandatory substantiation requirement in many circumstances improves buyer information and social welfare <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by a ban on false claims alone.

40|$|Abnormal {{grain growth}} (AGG) {{is a highly}} {{promising}} process for solid state conversion of polycrystals into single crystals in ceramic and in-metallic materials. In this paper we investigate AGG behaviors in NbC-added Fe-Ga rolled sheets with varying thicknesses for converting polycrystalline ingots of Fe-Ga alloy into single-crystal-like rolled sheet for application as the transduction components in low-cost magnetostrictive devices. Magnetostriction values of greater than 200 ppm resulted from AGG of a large single Goss grain, (011) [100], in 0. 35 -mm to 0. 60 -mm thick sheet samples annealed at 1200 oC. Samples thinner than 0. 35 mm or thicker than 0. 60 mm developed (113) [uvw]-oriented grain growth or random orientations with low magnetostriction values. In order to understand how thickness influences grain growth behaviors, a total interface energy model has been developed that combines both grain boundary and surface energies. We investigated the hypothesis that surface energy differences between grains in conjunction with grain boundary energy act as the driving force underlying the ability to selectively develop AGG and even to promote single-crystal-like grain growth. Results obtained from modeling simulation demonstrate that {{the extent of the}} matrix consumed with AGG was determined by controlling surface energy which {{plays a major role in}} accelerating AGG <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> with the effects of just grain boundary energy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issue of whether strict {{liability}} imposed on polluters has served to reduce uncontrolled releases of toxics into the environment. To answer this question, we exploit the variation in state hazardous waste site laws across states and over time. We use data on accidents and spills involving hazardous substances and fit regressions relating the frequency of spills of selected chemicals used in manufacturing to the type of liability in force in a state and state manufacturing activity. Results vary with the chemical being analysed. For some chemicals, the presence of strict liability does not provide any additional explanatory power for the number of spills <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by the number of establishments and the sectoral composition of manufacturing. For other families of chemicals, we find that spills are more numerous in states that impose strict liability. Further investigation suggests that (i) for some of these chemicals, this could be due to unobserved state characteristics influencing spills, which may have acted to reduce the incentives of liability, and that (ii) small firms are responsible for a disproportionate number of spills, regardless of the liability structure. An alternative explanation, supported by the results of a separate regression for two liability regimes, is that only under strict liability are small firms responsible for a disproportionate number of spills...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{regional}} trading relationships in Europe, Asia, and Latin America has raised policy concerns about their impact on excluded countries and on the global trading system. Some observers worry that the multilateral system may be fracturing into discriminatory regional blocs. Others are hopeful that regional agreements will go <b>beyond</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> in the Uruguay Round and instead become building blocks for further global liberalization and WTO rules in new areas. Jeffrey Frankel shows through extensive empirical analysis that {{the new breed of}} preferential trade arrangements are indeed concentrating trade regionally. He then assesses whether regional blocs are "natural" or "supernatural" [...] that is, whether they enhance or reduce global welfare. He concludes that a move to complete liberalization within blocs, with no reduction in barriers between blocs, would push the trading system into the supernatural zone of an excessive degree of regionalization. More balanced patterns of liberalization, however, give favorable outcomes. He considers regionalism at two levels: both the formal trading arrangements that are already in effect, and the broader continent-sized groupings that are under discussion (the Americas, Europe, and the Asia Pacific). Frankel's study also assesses the political and economic dimensions of regionalization and its implications for world economic prospects and public policy. In conclusion, Frankel proposes several policy prescriptions for pursuing partial regional liberalization among blocs as a stepping stone toward global free trade. ...|$|R

These two sets of honors students are then compared to a third group of similar students, those who had comparable pre-college academic credentials as the honors students, but who {{did not participate in}} an honors program (called high-ability students; n = 108). These three student groups entered three Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education universities as first-time, full-time freshmen in fall 1997.
