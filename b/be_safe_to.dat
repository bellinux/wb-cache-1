25|$|If no UTC {{relation}} {{information is}} given {{with a time}} representation, the time {{is assumed to be}} in local time. While it may <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes daylight saving time. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.|$|E

Erythromycin also appears to <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> use during pregnancy. While {{generally regarded as safe}} during breastfeeding its use by the mother during {{the first two weeks of}} life may increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the baby. This risk also applies if taken directly by the baby during this age. It is in the macrolide family and works by decreasing bacterial protein production.|$|E
25|$|Rugby {{union is}} {{played on a}} field, known as a pitch, that should have a grassy surface, though the Laws {{permit the use of}} {{artificial}} grass, clay, sand or snow, but not permanently hard surfaces such as asphalt or concrete. The Laws do not say that the pitch needs to be flat or level, merely that the surface must <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> play on. If either team feels that the pitch is unsafe, the referee must try to resolve the issues and must not start the match if any part of the ground is considered to be dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The {{permit for}} the {{overhaul}} was found, {{but not the}} other permit stating that the pump must not be started under any circumstances due to the missing safety valve. The valve was in a different location from the pump and therefore the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. None of those present were aware that {{a vital part of}} the machine had been removed. The manager assumed from the existing documents that it would <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> start Pump A. The missing valve was not noticed by anyone, particularly as the metal disc replacing the safety valve was several metres above ground level and obscured by machinery.|$|E

25|$|The Astra 400 {{is heavy}} {{compared}} to many contemporary service pistols {{of the time}} like the Tokarev TT-33 but is similar in weight and length to the Colt 1911. The Astra 400 was designed to <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> fire with a simple blowback action unaided by any breech-locking devices. This is only possible with a heavy slide and strong recoil spring. It was fitted with an internal hammer which was considered very hard to cock. The pistol also featured grooved finger grips and left sided combined slide lock/safety behind the trigger guard. The original design was chambered in 9mm Largo, but later variants would be chambered differently so as to better fulfill different military needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} mass is an {{important}} point on an aircraft, which significantly affects {{the stability of the}} aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> fly, the {{center of mass}} must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass is ahead of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly {{to the point of being}} unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing. If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly so unstable that it is impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a stalled condition.|$|E
25|$|A cricket ball is a hard, {{solid ball}} {{used to play}} cricket. A cricket ball {{consists}} of cork covered by leather, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen. Movement in the air, and off the ground, {{is influenced by the}} condition of the ball, the efforts of the bowler and the pitch, while working on the cricket ball to obtain optimum condition is a key role of the fielding side. The cricket ball is the principal manner through which the batsman scores runs, by manipulating the ball into a position where it would <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} eight years Liszt {{continued}} to tour Europe, spending holidays with the countess and their children on the island of Nonnenwerth on the Rhine in summers 1841 and 1843. In spring 1844 the couple finally separated. This was Liszt's most brilliant period as a concert pianist. Honours were showered on him and he met with adulation wherever he went. Franz wrote his Three Concert Études between 1845 and 1849. Since he often appeared {{three or four times a}} week in concert, it could <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> assume that he appeared in public well over a thousand times during this eight-year period. Moreover, his great fame as a pianist, which he would continue to enjoy long after he had officially retired from the concert stage, was based mainly on his accomplishments during this time.|$|E
25|$|Most of Plato's {{philosophical}} {{ideas were}} communicated through his beloved teacher Socrates as {{a presence in}} the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.|$|E
25|$|But on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich {{declined}} {{to approve a}} renew and re-argue of her July29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, but {{she said that the}} decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning that it was just discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 and can not be used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the question of when the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because the jury would soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.|$|E

Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl [...] "had visited the website that contains {{a lot of the}} Slender Man information and stories [...] It would <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> say there is a connection to that." ...|$|E
500|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT, or [...] "CAT scan") is {{not necessary}} for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, {{but it can be}} useful in particular situations. In some lung diseases, especially emphysema, it is possible for abnormal lung areas such as bullae (large air-filled sacs) to have the same appearance as a pneumothorax on chest X-ray, and it may not <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> apply any treatment before the distinction is made and before the exact location and size of the pneumothorax is determined. In trauma, where it may not be possible to perform an upright film, chest radiography may miss up to a third of pneumothoraces, while CT remains very sensitive.|$|E

[...] He proceeded to question the wisdom of printing {{the story of a}} missing Arrow, and wondered whether it would <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> reveal the existence of a surviving airframe only nine years later. [...] "If it is in existence it may have to wait another 10 years. [...] Politically it may cause a lot of trouble." [...] The legend endures that one of the prototypes remains intact somewhere.|$|E

500|$|Despite the Australians' {{domination}} of the local teams, the English public showed unprecedented levels {{of interest in the}} cricket. Record gate takings were registered at most venues, even when rain affected the [...] matches, and the record attendance for a Test match in England was broken twice, in the Second Test at Lord's and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil. As a result, Australia made £82,671 from the tour, resulting in a profit of £54,172. The popularity of the team meant that they were inundated with invitations for social appointments with government officials and members of the royal family, and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements, with 103 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days. As a result, Johnson was flooded with phone calls and letters, which he had to attend to by himself, as he was the only administrator among the touring party. Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson's tireless work would cause health problems because he [...] "worked like a slave day and night" [...] and that [...] "it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through". The journalist Andy Flanagan said that Johnson was [...] "'on the ball' every minute of the waking day, and it would <b>be</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> say half the night too." ...|$|E
500|$|But {{there is}} some {{opposition}} {{to the idea of}} an empowered global parliament. A 2007 BBC poll of approximately 12,000 respondents asked, [...] "How likely would you be to support a Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies?" [...] Of those polled, 19.1% responded [...] "Very unlikely–it is a bad idea"; 14.9% responded [...] "Quite unlikely–but it might work"; 23.1% said [...] "Quite likely–but with reservations"; and 14.4% said [...] "Very likely–it is a good idea". The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions. This is not democracy." [...] In addition, a Civicus article warns, [...] "With an unexpected backlash against civil society in the offing (despite the good efforts of the UN General Assembly President, Jan Eliasson, to reverse the trend), citizen participation at the UN is diminishing quickly.
