50|$|A bus turnout, bus pullout, <b>bus</b> <b>bay,</b> bus lay-by (UK), or {{off-line}} {{bus stop}} is a designated {{spot on the}} side of a road where buses or trams may pull out of the flow of traffic to pick up and drop off passengers. It is often indented into the sidewalk or other pedestrian area. A <b>bus</b> <b>bay</b> is, in a way, the opposite of a bus bulb. With a bus bulb, the point is to save the bus the time needed to merge out of and back into moving traffic, at the cost of temporarily blocking that traffic while making a stop. With a <b>bus</b> <b>bay,</b> the goal is to not block traffic while the bus is stopped, but at the cost of the time necessary to merge back into flowing traffic. Bus bays, therefore, will generally produce longer dwell times than bus bulbs.|$|E
