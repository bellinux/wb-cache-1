The objective is also to recognize and monitor changes {{in the design and}} construction environments {{as well as in the}} software platforms. In Finland <b>building</b> <b>product</b> modelling has, after 10 - 15 years of preliminary research, evolved into a piloting phase where the developed modelling methods are currently tested in real-life projects. One quite possible – and even more desired – future scenario is that <b>building</b> <b>product</b> modelling will become an essential collaborative working platform of the building projects within the next 10 years. ...|$|R

25|$|As AMC began {{development}} of the next Jeep in 1985, management created a business process that {{is now known as}} product lifecycle management (PLM). According to François Castaing, Vice President for Product Engineering and Development, the smallest U.S. automaker was {{looking for a way to}} speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors. The XJC's development was aided by computer-aided design (CAD) software systems making the engineers more productive while new communication allowed potential conflicts to be resolved faster thus reducing costly engineering changes because all drawings and documents were in a central database. The system was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its enterprise, thus connecting everyone involved in designing and <b>building</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E

40|$|The term {{computer-integrated}} construction (CIC) {{is often}} used to describe a future type of construction process characterised by the extensive use of information technology. The key to successful CIC is the comprehensive integration of currently isolated computing applications in different phases of the construction process. Among the several types of data exchange standards needed to support such integration, the standards for structuring the information describing <b>buildings</b> (<b>building</b> <b>product</b> data models) are particularly important. No fully operational <b>building</b> <b>product</b> data models have as yet been formally standardised either on the national or international level, but the topic has been a subject of intensive research during the last few years. <b>Building</b> <b>product</b> data model proposals are usually defined using object-oriented information modelling techniques. The research which is presented in this summarising thesis was carried out primarily during the years 1988 - 92 at the Technical Research Centre of Finland. The report begins with a brief introduction to the general background of research concerning CIC and <b>building</b> <b>product</b> data models. Fundamental concepts of object orientation and product modelling are explained in a separate chapter. In order to position the author's research results, the "state of the art" in this research field is briefly reviewed. The research results are presented against the background of a kernel-aspect model framework, in line with current thinking among several leading researchers in this field. The results can loosely be classified into three distinctive groups: a number of requirements which <b>building</b> <b>product</b> data models should fulfil; specific information structures in <b>building</b> <b>product</b> data models; and the integration of product models with other types of information used in the construction process. The specific information structures which were studied include the abstraction hierarchies used in <b>building</b> <b>product</b> data models, the type object mechanism and information structures needed for modelling spaces and enclosing objects. The report ends with a discussion of the results, comparing them with the proposals and results of other researchers. Some directions for further research are also outlined. reviewe...|$|R

Since 1970, Aalborg and the northern suburb of Nørresundby have become a major administrative centre, thanks in part to the offices of the Region Nordjylland established in the east of the city.
