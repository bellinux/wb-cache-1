50|$|Most {{commercial}} griddles have {{a single}} thermostat control for every 12 in of unit width, though some may have only one thermostat for every 24 in.

The thermostat control will not react quickly (if at all) to a surface load that is not relatively close to the probe, whether embedded or <b>bottom</b> <b>mounted,</b> resulting in less control and wider temperature variations on the cooking surface.

50|$|Snap action {{thermostats}} are {{the most}} common control used in heavy duty commercial griddles with medium-to-heavy production demands. These controls are called “snap action” because the control mechanism will turn the burner valve or electrical element fully on or completely off, with no modulation or intermediate heat source operation - effectively ‘snapping’ the heat source on or off. While not as responsive as solid state controls, snap action controls can maintain a griddle surface temperature within +/- 15°F (8°C) of set point if the thermostat bulb is embedded assuming a 1-inch (25mm) thick steel plate. This operating temperature range may be pushed to +/- 20 to 25°F (10°C to 13°C) if the probe is <b>bottom</b> <b>mounted</b> due to the additional thermal hysteresis introduced by the plate material.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a fundamental resource for appliance engineers to understand the dynamic constraints involved in the design of automatic washing machines. This is accomplished through the development and examination of basic models. The fundamental characteristics of the suspension system are determined for top and <b>bottom</b> <b>mount</b> horizontal axis washers. Similitude is used to discuss the characteristics of vertical axis washers. ^ The fundamental models developed for the suspension systems show good correlation with the dynamic response of actual washing machines. It is possible to use these fundamental models to determine limits or bounds upon the suspension stiffness of the system for both top and <b>bottom</b> <b>mount</b> suspension designs. The stability of <b>bottom</b> <b>mount</b> suspension systems is discussed. From the analysis of the suspension designs, the need for dynamic balancing of the clothes load during the spin extraction cycle is established. ^ The need for dynamic balancing is a prominent observation of the suspension system analysis. Hence, a review of auxiliary mass damper designs is presented with emphasis on application to automatic washing machine design. Design criteria for using dynamic balancers are discussed and the limitations of these devises are explained. Liquid ring balancers show the most promise due to cost; however, mechanical balancers are more effective in controlling the system 2 ̆ 7 s response. Finally, a new type of dynamic balancer, the elastic mass balancer, is developed. ^ The dynamic constraints imposed upon the washing machine design are typically tub deflection and walk performance for a given unbalanced load. The theory of walk is established using fundamental models to explore specific environmental interactions. Design criteria are developed from this analysis which will enable the washer suspension engineer to gain valuable insight into the walk response of the washing machine during the spin extraction cycle. It is shown that the spin speed achievable is dependent upon the suspension design. Without a suspension, the washing machine can only achieve spin speeds of 200 RPM while actual machines achieve spin speeds of 1600 RPM. The use of walk as a design constraint is discussed for washing machine design. ^ Finally, the design observations for a washing machine using dynamic constraints are discussed. Through the use of these observations, a design engineer will be able to determine the benefits and limitations of a suspension design on the dynamic response of a washing machine prior to the actual development of the system. Therefore, this study gives the design engineer insights on the design of washing machine suspension systems based upon the dynamic constraints imposed upon the system by the consumer. The use of these insights should reduce the time required to develop a useful suspension system and improve the quality of the suspension design before actual construction of the product is initiated. ...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the idle}} zone and/or high {{pressure}} arch (if applicable) is the friction zone. In the friction zone, {{a variety of}} brushes are used to clean all of the vehicle's surfaces. Wrap-around brushes (wraps) clean the front, sides, and rear of a car. A set of wraps consists of two offset brushes which are attached to overhead arms which are generally mounted over {{the center of the}} tunnel. Some wrap-around brush designs use jointed side-mounted arms to increase the brush's front and rear contact time. Wraps typically rotate with the vehicle's direction of travel. Some wrap-around brushes are capable of switching direction while cleaning the front of a car to prevent customers' license plates from being bent. Wraps are supplemented by side brushes (ranging in size from 18 inches cm up to 63 inches cm tall or higher). Side brushes may be either top or <b>bottom</b> <b>mounted.</b> To conserve space, side brushes are often staggered in the space occupied by a set of wraps or placed under top surface cleaning components, such as top brushes or mitters. Side brushes rotate against the vehicle's direction of travel to increase cleaning power. Top brushes are rotating brush assemblies which clean the vehicle's top surfaces. A top brush can face either the entrance or exit of the tunnel to assist in cleaning the car's front or rear. Some specialized top brushes are designed to achieve more contact time with the front or rear of vehicles. To prevent damage, a top brush can be programmed to retract if an ultrasonic pick-up truck bed detection system detects a pick-up truck with an open bed. In many car washes, top brushes are either supplemented by or replaced with mitters. Mitters are components which suspend cloth strips or sheets over the tunnel while utilizing motion to increase friction against the car's surface. A mitter's motion can be front to back, side to side, rotational, circular, or diagonal. The friction zone may also include specialized front grill and rear brushes. Front grill brushes clean the front, and in many cases, the sides of vehicles. They often appear as side washers with an unusually long and bent arm. Instead of bent arms, some front grill brushes use jointed arms. Like standard side washers, a grill brush may be either top or bottom driven. Rear brushes appear as a specialized tall side washers with long arms that face the entrance of the tunnel. Once a car's mirror passes a rear brush, the brush makes contact with the vehicle's side, where it then continues to engage until the assembly cleans the rear of the car. Additional high pressure components may also be present in the main friction zone.|$|E
