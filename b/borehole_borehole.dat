40|$|Groundwater flow in {{fractured}} bedrock {{is controlled}} by the location, orientation and aperture of individual fractures {{as well as by the}} interconnectedness of the individual fractures into a network. The interconnectedness of individual fractures can be determined through pumping tests. It has been noted that, during a pumping test, the hydraulic response at observation wells in fractured bedrock is different from the hydraulic response observed in unconsolidated porous media (Tiedeman and Hsieh, Ground Water 39 : 68 - 78, 2001). A 24 -hour pumping test was performed in a crystalline bedrock groundwater system. The pumping well is a 15 -cm diameter, 30 -m deep open bedrock borehole which intersects a significant transmissive fracture(s) at only one depth interval over the 23 -m uncased portion of the <b>borehole.</b> <b>Borehole</b> geophysical logging of the pumping well indicated two open fractures at a depth of 15 m below ground surface: a fracture dipping westnorthwest at an angle of 8 ° from the horizontal, and a fracture dipping northwest at an angle of 36 °. The geophysical logging data identified this zone as containing one or more transmissive fractures, but were not able to resolve if one or both of these fractures contributed groundwater to the borehole. The pumping rate was varied during the course of the pumping test, from 4 liters per minute (L/min) to 7 L/min to 0 L/min and then t...|$|E
40|$|Drilled {{boreholes}} {{generally are}} the only feasible means to access the subsurface for the emplacement of downhole electrodes for most hole–hole and hole–surface resistivity experiments. However, {{the very existence of}} the borehole itself creates the potential for significant noise due to the inevitable conductivity contrast that develops between the borehole walls and the formation. Borehole cylindrical noise develops whenever a current source is placed in a drilled <b>borehole.</b> <b>Borehole</b> geometries may range from nearly perfect cylinders to highly, irregular, rugose holes in consolidated rock, to relatively minor, collapsed, disturbed zones in caving sediments. Boreholes in non-caving formations generally are filled with artificial, conductive materials to afford crucial, electrical continuity between downhole electrodes and the borehole walls. Filled boreholes form cylindrically shaped heterogeneities that create significant noise due to preferential current flow up and down the conductive columns. Selected conditions are simulated with a finite difference model to illustrate the significance of borehole cylindrical noise on hole–hole and hole–surface mise-à-la-masse electrical potentials near a current electrode. Mise-à-la-masse electrical potentials measured during a field tracer experiment also are presented. These measurements are used to illustrate significant errors may develop in the interpretation of apparent resistivity estimates out to a distance of several meters from the current source if borehole cylindrical noise is not recognized and accounted for in the analysis of electrical potential data...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} work undertaken at Morestead, Twyford {{as part of}} a BGS {{research project}} “Nitrate Fluctuations in Groundwater”. The project uses the same site as that described in Stuart et al. (2008 a) for the project “Nitrate Mass Balance in the Saturated Zone”. A new <b>borehole</b> (<b>Borehole</b> B) was drilled in October 2008, located 10 m {{to the west of the}} existing one (Borehole A) to complement the existing infrastructure. During drilling the cuttings were inspected but no systematic recording of lithology was undertaken, as this information was already available in detail from the adjacent <b>borehole.</b> <b>Borehole</b> B was completed to a depth of 70 m and was cased to a depth of 12. 7 mbgl; remaining unsupported below this. It should be stated that the casing protruded approximately 0. 16 m above ground level. Initial geophysical characterisation was undertaken to evaluate the hole and its suitability for further testing. A multi-level sampler was installed in Borehole B during autumn 2008 when the groundwater level was low. The aim was to capture samples as the water table rose towards the anticipated spring 2009 high. The sampler worked well for most of the period, but there were issues with bottles not filling consistently, and the sampler length was insufficient to cope with rapid water level rise following heavy rainfall or snow melt. Samples retrieved were analysed for chloride, sulphate and nitrate (as NO 3), which ranged between 16. 9 and 68. 8 mg/l, 11. 7 and 29. 9 mg/l, and < 0. 6 and 60. 1 mg/l, respectively. Concentrations of nitrate appeared to increase as the water table rose above 20. 5 mbgl; below this depth there is significant noise. Concentrations of sulphate and chloride both increased as the water table rose. Gamma and resistivity logs identified marl horizons which correlated with the Borehole A core as reported in Stuart et al. (2008 a). Fluid and flow logs also indicate hydraulic layering within the Chalk. Temperature and conductivity logs suggested vertical flow below c. 25 m below casing top, which is was also supported by heat pulse flow meter (HPFM) and impeller flow logs. This flow regime was unaltered by pumping from a depth of 21. 5 m indicating reasonable permeability in the Chalk above this depth. A nitrate sonde was also run before and during pumping. The results are currently awaiting calibration and are not available at the time of reporting. Groundwater levels were monitored in Borehole A and fluctuated over a range of 13. 5 m, from around 10 to 23. 5 mbgl, between December 2006 and the beginning of March 2009. However, numerous gaps in the data remain due to water levels exceeding the range of the pressure transducer initially installed in the borehole. Water levels were notably responsive to rainfall between December and February, for example between 25 th January 2009 and 23 rd February 2009 the water table rose by 8. 7 m. The aquifer appears less responsive during summer and autumn when there is likely to be a greater soil moisture deficit...|$|E

40|$|During the {{evaluation}} of a proposed site for an underground nuclear test at the Department of Energy`s Nevada Test Site (NTS) {{it was important to}} measure the bulk density of the geological formation in which the test was to be executed. The most satisfactory method for this measurement is the density log. This is a measurement system in which a gamma-ray source and detector are mounted in an instrument (a sonde) which is lowered into a borehole by a multi-conductor cable, and the number of gamma rays detected is used to infer the bulk density. At NTS many of the boreholes of interest are air-filled, with diameters as large as 3. 65 m, drilled in partially-saturated media. Consequently the commercial equipment and calibration procedures are not suitable for NTS conditions. The count rate from a density sonde is strongly affected by any gap between the sonde and the borehole wall, especially if the gap is filled with air rather than water. Modern commercial density logs employ two detectors, and use one of the detectors to compensate for borehole conditions such as mudcake and gap. The commercial compensation algorithms assume that the sonde is parallel to the borehole wall; a reasonable assumption for oilfield conditions but not for NTS conditions. Moreover, in an air-filled <b>borehole,</b> <b>borehole</b> diameter affects both the calibration and the compensation. Therefore we could not use commercial algorithms to deal with NTS conditions. For many years, no appropriate two-detector algorithm was available for the NTS situation. Consequently we developed special algorithms for a single-detector sonde, which was equipped to measure the gap directly. Recently a two-detector algorithm was developed, which appears to be satisfactory if the sonde is calibrated in the appropriate-diameter borehole. In this report we describe the calibration procedures and the algorithms for both methods...|$|E

The specific aims of the investigation were to assess the potential for obtaining a groundwater supply of similar magnitude and chemical character to the nearby Chapeltonmoss Spring. Of the trial <b>boreholes,</b> <b>Borehole</b> 1 and <b>Borehole</b> 3 proved to be too low yielding to support a test yield.

40|$|The {{cross-measure}} <b>borehole</b> {{technique has}} been shown by the Bureau of Mines {{to be an effective}} method of controlling methane liberated by fracturing the roof strata in longwall gobs where overburden is less than 750 ft (229 m). <b>Boreholes</b> are drilled into roof strata before mining operations affect the roof strata. Longwall mining fractures the roof strata and releases methane from source beds. Surface exhausters or vacuum pumps are used to draw the gas to the surface through an underground pipeline and vertical exhaust hole. The captured methane is thus prevented from entering the mine's ventilation system. About 71 pct of the methane produced by longwall mining in the Lower Kittanning Coalbed was captured by the cross-measure <b>boreholes.</b> <b>Borehole</b> spacing is an important factor affecting the performance of the technique. Interference tests and measurements of methane flows in return air indicate <b>borehole</b> spacing in the Lower Kittanning Coalbed should be limited to about 200 ft (61 m) except on the first 600 ft (183 m) of the longwall, where spacing should be reduced to about 100 ft (30 m) to capture the large quantities of methane released when the first large roof fall occurs.

40|$|Measurement of {{groundwater}} physical properties of porosity and hydraulic conductivity in porous or fractured rock environments, and assessing water quality generally requires drilling a <b>borehole.</b> <b>Boreholes</b> provide accurate information {{at a point}} source, and a combination of <b>boreholes</b> {{can be used to}} infer regional-scale (i. e. 2 to 1500 km) characteristics. However, is there a better way to fill in the gaps? Electrical and electromagnetic geophysical techniques are sensitive to electrical properties of the subsurface.

In addition, the interaction of electrical charges with porous sediment grains and within fractures can be used to determine fluid flow without ever drilling a hole. APPROACH The primary challenge for geophysicists is to link observations of electrical properties uniquely with hydraulic properties.

First, I conducted a desk review of archived reports, memos, data, and drill logs from the original construction of I- 82 and previous geotechnical investigations commissioned by WSDOT. Findings of this desk review are reported in Part III. Second, WSDOT drillers drilled two new <b>boreholes</b> at the Prosser Landslide site above the buttress and instrumentation was installed within the <b>boreholes.</b> <b>Borehole</b> logs produced from the 2013 drilling can be found in Appendix A of this report. Material retrieved from the suspected failure zone during drilling was tested at the WSDOT Materials Lab by WSDOT personnel for its mechanical properties including Atterberg limits, grain-size analysis, and residual shear strength (Appendix B). Samples were also analyzed for mineral content using X -ray powder diffraction (XRD). These data and observations are reported in Part III and Appendix C. Finally, using drill logs produced by WSDOT from the latest drilling and from historic drilling campaigns, I constructed a 2 -D geologic model of the landslide site. This model is the basis for slope stability analysis reported in Part IV and Appendix D. This study concludes that the deformation observed in the eastbound lanes of I- 82 could be the result of continued landslide movement, despite previous remediation efforts...|$|R

The PBO consists of several major observatory components: a network of 1100+ permanent, continuously operating Global Positioning System (GPS) stations many of which provide data at high-rate and in real-time, 78 <b>borehole</b> seismometers, 74 <b>borehole</b> strainmeters, 28 shallow <b>borehole</b> tiltmeters, and six long baseline laser strainmeters. These instruments are complemented by InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) and lidar imagery and geochronology.|$|R
