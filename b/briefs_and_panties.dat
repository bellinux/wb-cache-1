5000|$|Contemporary reviews have {{similarly}} {{praised the}} album. AllMusic saidIan Dury's primary appeal lies in his lyrics, which are remarkably clever sketches of British life delivered {{with a wry}} wit. Since Dury's accent is thick and his language dense with local slang, much of these pleasures aren't discernible to casual listeners, leaving the music to {{stand on its own}} merits. On his debut album, New Boots <b>and</b> <b>Panties!!,</b> Dury's music is at its best, and even that is a bizarrely uneven fusion of pub rock, punk rock, and disco. Still, Dury's off-kilter charm and irrepressible energy make the album gel.Reviewing the 1998 reissue, Tom Doyle of Q believed that [...] "New Boots <b>and</b> <b>Panties!!</b> remains the creative yardstick he Dury can never quite measure up to", while BBC Music stated, [...] "Dury's work quickly mellowed (well, relatively), but the combination of cheeky ire, libertarianism and jazzed-up music hall punk on New Boots ... was defiant, original and, 35 years later, stands as a mighty missing link between The Kinks and Blur." [...] The Encyclopedia of Popular Music calls New Boots <b>and</b> <b>Panties!!</b> [...] "the late Ian Dury's greatest album; rarely has a musical artist been so loved and respected ... He should be remembered for his dynamite band the Blockheads and this necessary album".|$|R
