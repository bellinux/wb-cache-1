5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity.

Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order.

The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis abandoned his inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
