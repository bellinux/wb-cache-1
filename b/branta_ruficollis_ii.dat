5000|$|The {{red-breasted goose}} (<b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis)</b> is a brightly marked species of goose in the genus Branta from Eurasia. It is {{sometimes}} separated in Rufibrenta but appears {{close enough to}} the brant goose (Branta bernicla) to make this unnecessary, despite its distinct appearance. It is currently classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Branta is a Latinised form of Old Norse Brandgás, [...] "burnt (black) goose and ruficollis is from the Latin rufus [...] "red" [...] and collis [...] "necked".|$|R

5000|$|Taymyr Nature Reserve (Таймырский заповедник) (also Taimyrsky) is a Russian 'zapovednik' (strict nature reserve) {{located in}} the {{northern}} lowlands of Siberia, on the Taimyr Peninsula, and {{on the coast of}} the Laptev Sea of the Arctic Ocean. The reserve includes the most northern forest of Dahurian larch in the world, and also the most northern mainland mountain range in the world. The protected area was established to protect the breeding grounds of the Red-breasted goose (<b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis)</b> as well as the summer residences of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and the biodiversity of the Lake Taymyr. The reserve is situated about 120 km east of the town of Norilsk, and 3,000 km northeast of Moscow, in the Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District of Krasnoyarsk Krai. [...] In 1995, the site was designated a UNESCO MAB (Man and Biosphere) Reserve. [...] The reserve was formally established in 1979, and covers an area of 1781928 ha.|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{predator}} protection and similar habitat hypotheses {{in relation to}} red-breasted goose, <b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis,</b> nesting associations. Geese began laying 1 - 3 weeks after all associated species. In almost all cases they nested on the mainland only if raptors were also present and always followed raptors when they changed eyries between years. They selected peregrines, Falco peregrinus, and snowy owls, Nyctea scandiaca, as associates in preference to rough-legged buzzards, Buteo lagopus, even though the latter were several times more abundant along river corridors. Nest defence experiments with a surrogate Arctic fox, Alopex lagopus, showed {{that this could be}} explained by differences in nest defence intensity, rather than habitat types selected. Similar experiments also suggested that gulls were much less aggressive than owls or falcons. Foxes rarely approached, and were easily repelled from goose colonies associated with owls and peregrines, but gulls were apparently incapable of repelling foxes. Breeding success was much higher for geese nesting with raptors than for those on islands and geese apparently preferred to nest with owls in peak lemming years than to remain on islands. These findings support the hypothesis that red-breasted geese actively choose to nest near raptors; however, they probably associate with gulls primarily because both species select fox-free islands. Compared with other studies, red-breasted geese nesting with raptors and on islands apparently represent two extremes in a continuum of nesting associations generally seen in birds. We discuss why the behaviour might have evolved and argue that this may be the only known bird species whose evolution has been facilitated primarily by the exploitation of the nest defence behaviour of aggressive raptorial hosts.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} explain the {{distribution}} of red-breasted geese <b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis</b> over different nesting habitats. To be safe from land predators red-breasted goose colonies were restricted to i) islands on rivers, ii) cliffs with peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus, and iii) the close proximity of snowy owl Nyctea scandiaca and rough-legged buzzard Buteo lagopus nests. Among years nest site availability varied by fluctuations in numbers of owls and buzzards in association with cycles in lemming abundance, but {{the total number of}} goose nests found in the study area did not vary. The distribution of geese, in combination with data on reproductive success, suggested a despotic mechanism: at cliffs, goose numbers were constant among years with an invariably high reproductive success, whereas large fluctuations in numbers on islands coincided with opposite trends in success. Apparently, geese nesting with owls or buzzards moved to the few islands present in the study area during years when these birds of prey were absent. Consequently, in such years the average density of geese on islands was more than twice as high as at cliff colonies (5. 4 and 2. 3 pairs per ha of foraging habitat, respectively). Colony size at cliffs may have been restricted by territorial behaviour of the geese, though there is evidence that, additionally, the host falcons also limited the number of nesting geese. Apparently rare in closely related species, we observed a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive success during the nest phase, and attribute this to limited food resources, reinforced by the high frequency of territorial interactions. This leads to the conclusion that, in addition to predation pressure, nesting density is an important agent in the link between lemming cycles and goose breeding success...|$|R
40|$|The {{red-breasted goose}} <b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis</b> is a {{globally}} threatened species (IUCN Vulnerable) {{and the only}} European goose species currently in decline. Working on the wintering grounds on the Black Sea Coast, we address two potential causes of decline of this species for the first time: lead poisoning, and contamination from pesticides. We quantified the densities of spent Pb shot in three wetlands used by the geese in north-east Bulgaria, and analysed the Pb concentration in the faeces of red-breasted geese and the more abundant greater white-fronted geese Anser albifrons, using Al concentration {{as an indicator of}} soil ingestion. Pb shot densities in sediments were low, and we found no evidence for Pb shot ingestion in red-breasted geese. On the other hand, we found that the geese were feeding on wheat whose seeds were treated with four fungicides: thiram, tebuconazole, difenoconazole and fludioxonil, and the two first were even detected in geese faecal samples. Using data on the daily food intake, we estimated the exposure levels of the geese to these fungicides, both by measuring the concentrations remaining on seeds and by estimating the amount used to coat the seeds at the time of sowing. We found that the exposure rates estimated during the sowing period for both geese species can exceed the recognized hazardous doses for thiram, {{and to a lesser extent}} for tebuconazole, which indicates that some pesticides may be playing a previously overlooked role in the decline of red-breasted geese. The field study was supported by the Life project LIFE/NAT/BG 09 / 00230 “Safe Ground for Redbreasts”.

40|$|Phylogenetic incongruence can {{be caused}} by {{analytical}} shortcomings or can be the result of biological processes, such as hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting and gene duplication. Differentiation between these causes of incongruence is essential to unravel complex speciation and diversification events. The phylogeny of the True Geese (tribe Anserini, Anatidae, Anseriformes) was, until now, contentious, i. e., the phylogenetic relationships and the timing of divergence between the different goose species could not be fully resolved. We sequenced nineteen goose genomes (representing seventeen species of which three subspecies of the Brent Goose, Branta bernicla) and used an exon-based phylogenomic approach (41, 736 exons, representing 5887 genes) to unravel the evolutionary history of this bird group. We thereby provide general guidance on the combination of whole genome evolutionary analyses and analytical tools for such cases where previous attempts to resolve the phylogenetic history of several taxa could not be unravelled. Identical topologies were obtained using either a concatenation (based upon an alignment of 6, 630, 626 base pairs) or a coalescent-based consensus method. Two major lineages, corresponding to the genera Anser and Branta, were strongly supported. Within the Branta lineage, the White-cheeked Geese form a well-supported sub-lineage that is sister to the Red-breasted Goose (<b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis).</b> In addition, two main clades of Anser species could be identified, the White Geese and the Grey Geese. The results from the consensus method suggest that the diversification of the genus Anser is heavily influenced by rapid speciation and by hybridization, which may explain the failure of previous studies to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within this genus. The majority of speciation events took place in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene (between 4 and 2 million years ago), conceivably driven by a global cooling trend that led to the establishment of a circumpolar tundra belt and the emergence of temperate grasslands. Our approach will be a fruitful strategy for resolving many other complex evolutionary histories at the level of genera, species, and subspecies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{development}} and energy exploration are increasing in the Arctic. Important breeding habitats for many waterbird species, which have previously been relatively undisturbed, {{are now being}} subjected to these anthropogenic pressures. The conservation of the habitats and the species they support is a significant challenge for sustainable development. Even if governments and corporates operating in this fragile environment are committed to sustainable development, there is little information available to avoid, mitigate and manage environmental risk and impacts. Taking a risk management perspective, we followed the International Finance Corporations (IFC) Performance Standard 6 (PS 6) criteria on Environmental and Social Sustainability and developed an approach to identify "critical habitat", as defined in IFC PS 6, for waterbird species breeding in the Arctic. While the range of these waterbirds is roughly known, more accuracy is needed for proper risk assessment. We have therefore gone a step further by modelling suitable habitat within these ranges. Depending on {{the relevance of the}} species for IFC PS 6 and the level of certainty we separated the classes likely and potential critical habitat. We tested the approach for Russian breeding populations of five Anatidae species (White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons, Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Brent Goose Branta bernicla, Redbreasted Goose <b>Branta</b> <b>ruficollis</b> and Bewick's Swan Cygnus columbianus bewicki). Likely critical habitats were identified through a review of literature and available data for these waterbird species and multi-species congregations. To address the information gap for most of the Russian Arctic a species distribution modelling approach was used. The outputs of this approach were labelled as potential critical habitat, indicating the lower level of certainty than likely critical habitat. Based on existing information the amount of likely critical habitat is estimated to be at least x,xxx,xxx km 2. For the five Anatidae species, X,XXX,XXX km 2 potential critical habitat was identified; 95 % of these areas were outside of the area boundaries of likely critical habitat for the species. Insufficient data in the east of the study area did affect the results, as some areas known to support breeding populations were not identified as suitable. Conversely, species' distributions may be overpredicted in other areas; It should also be recognized that the analyzed species currently have depressed populations and may therefore only utilize a proportion of suitable habitat available. For risk assessment purposes however, it is better to predict false positives, rather than false negatives. The study indicates that there are large areas in the Arctic that are potentially important for each of the Anatidae species modelled, but are not yet recognised as key important areas. The results confirm that there is still much to learn about waterbird distribution and abundance in the Russian Arctic. Synthesis and applications: The critical habitat maps produced do not just provide a new source of information for the economic development sector, but provide {{it in a way that}} is relevant to the sector and directly applicable. The maps are useful for initial risk assessments of potential developments, to identify likely impacts and to consider mitigation options, in accordance with IFC PS 6. Risk assessors should exercise caution and detailed surveys for any development in areas predicted to be suitable for each species should be carried out...|$|R
