5|$|Financial markets on the {{continent}} are expected to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more liquid and flexible {{than they were in}} the past. The reduction in cross-border transaction costs will allow larger banking firms to provide a wider array of banking services that can compete across and beyond the eurozone. However, although transaction costs were reduced, some studies have shown that risk aversion has increased during the last 40 years in the Eurozone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{computer}} users and manufacturers were becoming {{concerned about the}} rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> cheaper and faster.|$|E

5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea, {{commonly}} known as the blushing morel, is a species of ascomycete fungus in the family Morchellaceae. A choice edible species, the fungus was originally described as new to science in 1998 by mycologists Gastón Guzmán and Fidel Tapia from collections made in Veracruz, Mexico. Its distribution was later revealed to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more widespread after several DNA studies suggested that it is common in the West Coast of the United States, Israel, Australia, and Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in zirconium would cause it to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of zirconium and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free zirconium is the main source for hafnium.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in {{the middle}} of September affected some of the same areas along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico as the August hurricane. It was first detected on the evening of September 10 in the southeastern Gulf, although its track may <b>be</b> <b>far</b> off from the actual storms movement {{due to a lack of}} available information. Its first data point in the hurricane database lists it as possessing sustained winds of , placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm followed a broad northward curve through the central Gulf of Mexico, making landfall along the Mississippi River Delta of Louisiana on the night of September 14. It continued toward the north-northeast, dissipating on September 16.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more elaborate {{than a single}} thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{on reports}} from airmen {{that there were}} no signs of enemy {{activity}} and the islands might have been evacuated, General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force. The campaign began on 29February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros, the third-largest island in the group. By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the shape to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that is easier to solve is that the shape is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.|$|E

The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more varied and less selectiveit {{is known to}} eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E

5|$|During {{the entire}} {{course of his}} {{campaign}} in Dalmatia and Croatia, Tvrtko was also engaged in skirmishes in the east of his realm, which prevented him from focusing all of his manpower on expansion westwards. The Kingdom of Bosnia was believed to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> from {{the reach of the}} Ottomans during Tvrtko I's reign, shielded by a belt of independent Serbian statelets. George II of Zeta, however, purposely enabled the Turks to launch raids against Bosnia, first in 1386 (of which little is known) and again in 1388. In the second instance the Ottoman and Zetan invaders, led by Lala Şahin Pasha, penetrated as far as Bileća. The Battle of Bileća, which took place in late August 1388, ended with the victory of the Bosnian army, led by Duke Vlatko Vuković.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would <b>be</b> <b>far</b> more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E

5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to <b>be</b> <b>far</b> superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E
