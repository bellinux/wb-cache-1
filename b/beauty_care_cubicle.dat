40|$|International audienceGOALS OF WORK: Cancer {{patients}} are offered {{more and more}} access to <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> during their stay in the hospital. This kind of intervention has not been evaluated yet. Primary objective of our research was to determine what type of evaluation strategy to be implemented (as a supportive care with quality of life and/or medical benefits; as a service providing immediate comfort); intermediate objective was to investigate in scientific terms (psychological, sociological) the experience of <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> by patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients (all users of <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> provided by hospital, 58 female, most of them treated for breast cancer, two male, mean age 53 years) and 11 nurses and physicians, from four French cancer centres were included. We used direct observation and semi-structured interviews, conducted by a sociologist and a psychologist; different types of <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> were concerned. RESULTS: All the interviewed patients were satisfied. Patients appreciated acquiring savoir-faire {{on how to use}} make-up and on personal image enhancement. Psychological and social well-being benefits were mentioned. The <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> was not alleged to be reducing the side effects of the treatments, but it had helped patients to accept or bear the burden of them. Providing care beyond that which is directly curative was appreciated by the patients as a sign that they were treated as a "whole" person. CONCLUSION: The survey brings valuable clues concerning <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> experience by cancer patients; it suggests the relevance of quantitative evaluation of the immediate and long-term effects on the quality of life...|$|R
40|$|The writer {{carries out}} a {{research}} for her thesis entitled A Study of Cohesive Devices Used in <b>Beauty</b> <b>Care</b> Television Advertisements. She conducts this study because cohesive devices are important features that make <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> television advertisements communicative. This thesis {{is limited to}} the <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> television advertisements in these television channels: RCT 1, SCTV, Indosiar, TransTV, Antv, Lativi, TV 7 and TPI from July 2003 to October 2003 at 4 p. m. up to 9 p. m. The research problems which come up in this research are: what cohesive devices are used in <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> television advertisements and what types of cohesive devices are most often used in <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> television advertisements. For the analysis, she uses theory of cohesive devices by Halliday et al (1976). This study is focused on cohesive devices since the function of cohesive devices is to link one sentence to another sentence in the text, and they make a text easier to understand and more communicative. The writer analyses the data by classifying the cohesive devices. Based on the analysis, she found that there are 63 grammatical cohesive devices and 66 lexical cohesive devices. After getting the findings, she makes a conclusion. In the conclusion, she finds that ellipsis, reference, conjunction and reiteration are the types of cohesive devices which are most often used.

40|$|Purpose: Traditionally, oral estrogens {{have been}} used for hormone {{replacement}} therapy. However, in Japan, additional estrogen formulations {{have been used}}, including transdermal patches and transdermal gels. The latter have a unique commonality with cosmetics because both of them are applied to the skin. <b>Beauty</b> <b>care</b> {{is one of the most}} important lifestyle factors for women, and it has been reported that the amount of attention paid to <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> has an effect in determining whether or not women will choose to undergo HRT during menopause. Therefore, our study focused on estrogen formulations and <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> practices. Patients and methods: Fifty women who use hormone replacement therapy were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Tohoku University Hospital. They were treated with oral conjugated estrogen (n = 11), transdermal 17 β-estradiol patch (n = 11), and transdermal 17 β-estradiol gel (n = 28). They completed a questionnaire to assess their lifestyle (<b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> practices and exercise habits) and their compliance.

Patients and methods: Fifty women who use hormone replacement therapy were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Tohoku University Hospital. They were treated with oral conjugated estrogen (n = 11), transdermal 17 &szlig; -estradiol patch (n = 11), and transdermal 17 &szlig;-estradiol gel (n = 28). They completed a questionnaire to assess their lifestyle (<b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> practices and exercise habits) and their compliance. The transdermal gel users were further interviewed about their subjective impressions regarding &ldquo;smell&rdquo;, &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo;, &ldquo;spreadability&rdquo;, and &ldquo;irritation&rdquo; on the skin using a five-grade scale. Results: There were no differences in the usability of medicines and patient compliance among the estrogen formulations. We observed a positive tendency between the level of <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> and transdermal gel use (P = 0. 0645, ordinary logistic regression analysis). The gel users placed top priority on a lack of &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo; but the subjective impression regarding &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo; was worst among the four factors (P &lt; 0. 01, Steel&ndash;Dwass test). Correspondence analysis showed that the subjective impressions of transdermal gel corresponding to usability in the range of &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; to &ldquo;very good&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo; greatly affected the usability of the formulation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the level of attention to <b>beauty</b> <b>care</b> plays some role in the choice of estrogen formulations.
