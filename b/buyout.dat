Roberts, {{all of whom had}} {{previously}} worked together at Bear Stearns, where they completed some of the earliest leveraged <b>buyout</b> transactions. Since its founding, KKR has completed a number of transactions including the 1989 leveraged <b>buyout</b> of RJR Nabisco, which was the largest <b>buyout</b> in history to that point, as well as the 2007 <b>buyout</b> of TXU, which is currently the largest <b>buyout</b> completed to date. KKR has completed investments in over 160 companies since 1977, completing at least one investment in every year except in 1982 and in 1990.|$|E
5|$|After the 1987 {{resignation}} of Jerome Kohlberg at age 61 (he later founded {{his own private}} equity firm, Kohlberg & Co.), Henry Kravis succeeded him as senior partner. Under Kravis and Roberts, the firm {{was responsible for the}} 1988 leveraged <b>buyout</b> of RJR Nabisco. RJR Nabisco proved to be not only the largest <b>buyout</b> in history to that time, at $25 billion ($31.1 billion, including assumed debt) as well as a high-water mark and sign {{of the end of the}} 1980s <b>buyout</b> boom. RJR—Nabisco, which would remain the largest <b>buyout</b> for the next 17 years, was chronicled in , and later made into a television movie starring James Garner.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, KKR was one {{of seven}} private equity firms {{involved}} in the <b>buyout</b> of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged <b>buyout</b> completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest <b>buyout</b> of a technology company until the Blackstone-led <b>buyout</b> of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable {{given the number of}} firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.|$|E

50|$|Compliance <b>buyouts</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as amnesty <b>buyouts)</b> allow National Hockey League (NHL) teams to buy-out a player's contract by paying him two-thirds of the remaining value of a contract over twice the remaining length of the contract. If the player is under 26 years old, then the team may pay the player just one-third of the remaining contract value. In ordinary-course <b>buyouts,</b> the team's NHL salary cap hit for the player is stretched {{over a period of}} twice the remaining length of the contract.

5|$|The <b>buyout</b> of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged <b>buyout</b> transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the <b>buyout</b> boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E

The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the <b>buyout</b> and slashed jobs.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{a number}} of {{leveraged}} <b>buyout</b> transactions were completed which, for the first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged <b>buyout</b> in terms of nominal purchase price.

However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved.

Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities.
