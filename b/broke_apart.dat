5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped over {{hundreds of millions of}} years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> about 180million years ago.|$|E
5|$|When Charles X Gustav {{left the}} Commonwealth and headed westwards for an anti-Danish counterstrike, the Swedish–Brandenburgian–Transylvanian {{alliance}} <b>broke</b> <b>apart.</b> Rákóczi of Transylvania {{was unable to}} withstand the combined Austrian and Polish–Lithuanian forces without Swedish support, and after a pursuit into Ukraine he was encircled and forced to capitulate, {{with the rest of}} the Transylvanian army defeated by the Tartars.|$|E
5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet that <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> in July 1992 and {{collided with}} Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen {{in any of the}} other cards. Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit the card for a water test, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. The card <b>broke</b> <b>apart,</b> and as a result, the card was dismissed as a fake.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Miller {{earned the}} further ire of his CO by flying {{unauthorised}} leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports {{saying that the}} Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, the CO ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller {{came back to the}} air base and bellylanded. The plane <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana {{gradually}} <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> and Antarctica {{as we know it today}} was formed around 25million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, {{after the}} {{successful}} release of 'Himera' followed by sold-out tours and headlining the NASHEstvie festival, Kipelov refused to start recording the new album, already written by Dubinin and Holstinin. He stated his wish {{to start a}} solo career. He was supported by two of his Aria bandmates Sergey Terentyev and Alexander Maniakin, {{as well as by}} the band's manager Rina Lee, opposing the band's leaders Vitaly Dubinin and Vladimir Holstinin, and the producer Yuri Sokolov. This disagreement <b>broke</b> Aria <b>apart</b> after 'Judgement Day', August 31, 2002.|$|R
5|$|On 10 January 1957, a B-52 {{returning}} to Loring Air Force Base from a routine instrument training mission <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> in midair and crashed near Morrell, New Brunswick, Canada, killing {{eight of the}} nine crew on board. Co-pilot Captain Joseph L. Church parachuted to safety.

5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Nazi Germany and Italy, the latter annexing or occupying the Croatian Littoral, although the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of World War II and the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy reversed wartime Italian territorial gains, awarding the entire region and adjacent territory to Yugoslavia and the Federal State of Croatia. After the fall of communism, Yugoslavia <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> as Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991. Although the region suffered an economic decline during the Croatian War of Independence, there was no fighting in the region.|$|E
50|$|The union {{also led}} efforts to form Maritime Federation of the Pacific, which brought {{all of the}} {{maritime}} unions together for common action. That federation helped the sailors' union win {{the same sort of}} contract after a long strike in 1936 that the ILA had achieved in 1934. Rivalries between the two unions, however, soon <b>broke</b> the federation <b>apart.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} they've worked on their previous albums, by jamming and recording hundreds of loops spontaneously, using their Deeler software, then piecing together the loops and adding vocals. About the process, Danny Seim added [...] "We made big strides building skeletal song structures, and did a decent job collaborating as the ideas began to take shape. But just when a song became familiar to one of us, the other two members <b>broke</b> it <b>apart</b> again, breaking each others’ hearts along the way. We rerecorded, rebuilt, and ultimately resented each other. And believe it or not, we’re all proud of the results." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jakob Maersk was {{carrying}} 88,000 tons {{of crude oil}} from Kharg Island in Iran while entering the Port of Leixões {{in the northern part}} of Portugal to discharge the oil to the Sacor Refinery. Receiving aid from tug boats, the ship grounded on a sand bank, causing a huge explosion and subsequent fire that burned for days. [...] The explosion <b>broke</b> the ship <b>apart,</b> spilling crude oil into the water.|$|R
5|$|MV New Carissa was a {{freighter}} {{that ran}} aground {{on a beach}} near Coos Bay, Oregon, United States, during a storm in February 1999 and subsequently <b>broke</b> <b>apart.</b> An attempt to tow the bow section of the ship out to sea failed when the tow line broke, and the bow was grounded again. Eventually, the bow was successfully towed out to sea and sunk. The stern section remained on the beach near Coos Bay. Fuel on board the ship was burned off in situ with napalm, but a significant amount was also spilled from the wreckage, causing ecological damage to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|Mir was {{constructed}} between 1986 and 1996 {{and was the}} world's first modular space station. It was the first consistently inhabited long-term research station in space, and previously held the record for longest continuous human presence in space, at eight days short of ten years. Mir's purpose {{was to provide a}} large and habitable scientific laboratory in space, and, through a number of collaborations, including Intercosmos and Shuttle-Mir, was made internationally accessible to cosmonauts and astronauts of many different countries. The station existed until March 23, 2001, at which point it was deliberately deorbited, and <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> during atmospheric re-entry.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Japanese surrender, the Second United Front between the KMT and the Communists <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> and the Chinese Civil War resumed. Hu Lanqi again worked under Li Jishen, persuading various KMT commanders to defect to the Communist side. At that time, the Sichuan general Yang Sen was serving as Governor of Guizhou Province, who hired her as Chief Editor of the Guizhou Daily. She urged Yang Sen {{to abandon his}} support for Chiang Kai-shek, but Yang had {{commanded}} attacks against the Communists {{in the past and}} did not believe they would forgive him. He eventually retreated to Taiwan with Chiang in 1949.|$|E
50|$|On 2 April 1943, the French trawler Simon Duhamel II {{was spotted}} off Cape d´Alboran, {{some time after}} 06:00, after straggling from convoy TE-20 due to a problem with her engines. U-755 fired at the trawler at 06:24, with one {{confirmed}} hit to the midship. This hit caused an explosion that <b>broke</b> the vessel <b>apart,</b> sinking in a mere four minutes. Only one man of her fifty-three-man crew survived, being rescued two days later.|$|R

25|$|As PAD was attacked, it {{stepped up}} its protests by seizing the government's {{temporary}} offices at Don Mueang Airport, and the seizure and closure of Suvarnabhumi Airport after the arrest of Chamlong Srimuang, one of its leaders. The sieges ended in December when the Constitutional Court dissolved the PPP and banned its executive board from political office after finding it guilty of election fraud. The Constitutional Court dissolved two coalition partners of the PPP on similar charges, which <b>broke</b> the coalition <b>apart.</b> Prime minister Somchai resigned.|$|R
5|$|The Sun-grazing comets {{observed}} in 1843 (Great Comet of 1843) and 1963 (Comet Pereyra) {{seem to be}} closely related and belong to the subgroup I, although when their orbits are traced back to one previous perihelion, {{the differences between the}} orbital elements are still rather large, probably implying that they <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> from each other one revolution before that. They may not be related to the comet of 1106, but rather a comet that returned about 50 years before that. Subgroup I also includes comets seen in 1695, 1880 (Great Southern Comet of 1880) and in 1887 (Great Southern Comet of 1887), as well as the vast majority of comets detected by the SOHO mission (see below).|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Virginia Seismic Zone, located in the Piedmont region. The Virginia Piedmont area was formed originally {{as part of a}} zone of repeated continental collisions that created the ancestral Appalachian Mountains, a process that started during the Ordovician period with the Taconic orogeny and finished during the Carboniferous Period with the Alleghanian orogeny. The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated as normal faults in extension during the Mesozoic Era as the supercontinent Pangaea <b>broke</b> <b>apart.</b> During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E
5|$|When Osiel {{was arrested}} in 2003, Antonio and Costilla Sánchez took {{the lead of the}} {{criminal}} organization, and Los Zetas eventually <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> from the Gulf Cartel in 2010. However, Antonio was killed in an eight-hour shootout between Gulf Cartel gunmen and soldiers of the Mexican Navy in Matamoros on 5 November 2010. According to the Mexican government, ten people were killed that day in Matamoros, but local media outlets suggested that over 40 people were killed by gunfire. One anonymous law enforcement officer, witnesses, and several local newspapers indicated over 100 were killed in Matamoros.|$|E
5|$|In 721/2, {{the main}} {{phase of the}} Second Arab–Khazar War began on the Caucasus front. In the winter of this year, 30,000 Khazars {{launched}} an invasion of Armenia and inflicted a crushing defeat on {{the army of the}} local governor Mi'laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani at Marj al-Hijara in February/March 722. In response, Caliph Yazid II (r. 720–724) sent al-Jarrah with 25,000 Syrian troops to Armenia, placing him in command of the Umayyad offensive against the Khazars. Al-Jarrah was swiftly successful in driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, and fought his way north along the western coast of the Caspian Sea, recovering Derbent and advancing onto the Khazar capital of Balanjar. The Khazars tried to defend the city by ringing the citadel with a laager of wagons, but the Arabs <b>broke</b> it <b>apart</b> and stormed the city on 21 August 722 (or 723). Most of Balanjar's inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north. The Arabs also took the town of Wabandar, and even approached Samandar (near modern Kizlyar).|$|R
2500|$|That weather {{turned into}} a violent nor'easter, a storm with gale force winds out of the east and northeast, which forced the vessel dangerously close to the {{breaking}} waves along the shoals of Cape Cod.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{decipher}} the combined effect of extensional tectonics and halokinesis on formation of structural features in the Marib-Shabwa basin of Yemen. Based on seismic interpretations, a close relationship has been found between the tectonic position in half-grabens and full-grabens and the developed salt structures in these subbasins. The hinge margin and hanging wall of half-grabens are characterized by salt rollers and salt pillow zones. Diapir zones, tilted basinward by uplift, dominate the footwall sides. Elongated diapirs formed in the axial zone of full-grabens that display changing structural character along strike: they are reverse fault-bounded at their middle portions in response to local contractional effects in the overburden; whereas toward their ends, the diapirs become normal fault-flanked indicating local extensional stresses. Accommodation zones among small-scale half-grabens are associated with normal-faulted asymmetric or non-faulted symmetric diapirs.

5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|Born in Moss Side, Manchester to {{politically}} active parents, Pankhurst was introduced {{at the age}} of 14 to the women's suffrage movement. On 18 December 1879, she married Richard Pankhurst, a barrister 24 years older than her, known for supporting women's rights to vote; they had five children over the next ten years. He supported her activities outside the home, and she founded and became involved with the Women's Franchise League, which advocated suffrage for both married and unmarried women. When that organisation <b>broke</b> <b>apart,</b> she tried to join the left-leaning Independent Labour Party through her friendship with socialist Keir Hardie but was initially refused membership by the local branch on account of her gender. While working as a Poor Law Guardian, she was shocked at the harsh conditions she encountered in Manchester's workhouses.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth {{approaching}} from the southeast, {{it was too}} late for Leissègues to escape. Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron <b>broke</b> <b>apart</b> with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels and set them on fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} continued {{past the}} end of the runway, traveling another 800 feet and striking a security fence and an ILS localizer array. The aircraft then collided with a structure built to support the landing lights for runway 22L, which extended out into the Arkansas River. Such structures are usually [...] - i.e. designed to shear off on impact - but because the approach lights were located on the unstable river bank, they were firmly anchored. The collision with the nonfrangible structure crushed the airplane's nose and destroyed {{the left side of the}} plane's fuselage, from the cockpit back to the first two rows of coach seating. The impact <b>broke</b> the aircraft <b>apart</b> into multiple large sections, which came to a rest short of the river bank.|$|R
50|$|At 5:00 am, Custer's {{exhausted}} men reached Champlain, and wearily set out too few pickets. The British 11th Hussars led by Lt. Colonel Alexander Roberts Dunn, captured {{one of the}} American pickets {{and surprised}} the sleepy Americans with a charge over the bridge, killing the unarmed Americans outside. The 6th Michigan fired on the Hussars from inside the houses in Champlain, their Spencer Repeating Rifles far outweighing the British firepower. The nearby 1st Michigan cavalry charged into town with sabers in hand, and met the Hussars in swirling melee. Custer and Dunn engaged in single combat, but the fight <b>broke</b> them <b>apart.</b> The rapidly approaching 55th Foot turned the cavalry battle into an infantry battle, and the Americans fought on dismounted. Custer fed any newly arriving men into the battle {{as soon as they}} arrived, but his ammunition began to run low, and by 6:20 am, British artillery arrived to pour fire into the town. With the dawn, the Scots Fusilier Guards and the Second Battalion of the Grenadier Guards waded into Champlain, forcing Custer's men to the west. South of Coopersville Bridge, Wolseley had the difficult task of forcing his men to disengage from the XI Corps and retreat northwest to Champlain to escape the approaching XII Corps.|$|R
