50|$|The {{electrode}} lines, which {{look like}} a 110 kV-powerlines with 2 conductors, use similar, but smaller pylons as the main line. In opposite to the main line, all strainers are free-standing lattice towers with a single crossbar, while the <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> of the electrode line are usually concrete poles with a single crossbar made of steel. Only <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> of extraordinary height are built as lattice towers.|$|R

50|$|The <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> have {{a single}} crossbar, {{carrying}} one conductor on a suspension insulator {{at each end of}} it.Two types of strainers are used: lattice towers similar to the <b>suspension</b> <b>towers,</b> but equipped with strainer insulators and of stronger design and much more often pole-type towers with a central pole supported by two diagonal bars. The latter towers carry only one conductor, and there are always 2 such towers close together.|$|R

40|$|Obtaining small intact organelles {{is crucial}} to avoid {{artefacts}} in oil <b>body</b> <b>suspension</b> or emulsion. This work was undertaken to recover high quality of oil bodies from sunflower seeds. Organelle integrity could be lost if high forces are imposed on the tissue/material during their recovery. Pre-soaking before wet milling and multiple washing with alkaline buffer was performed to isolate a high quality oil <b>bodies</b> <b>suspension.</b> It was evident from different physical measurements like particle size, zeta-potential and light microscopy that pre-soaking had a significant influence on the oil <b>body</b> <b>suspensions</b> with no significant sign of aggregation or coalescence. It was also observed that the resultant washed oil <b>body</b> <b>suspensions</b> are highly surface charge indicating very stable suspension phase behaviour. The physical state of the seed during wet milling has {{a significant impact on}} the quality of the oil <b>body</b> <b>suspension...</b>|$|R
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope <b>suspension</b> <b>tower</b> was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope <b>suspension</b> <b>tower,</b> the tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|R

50|$|The used towers are {{designed}} for carrying a single circuit in a single level. As conductors bundle conductors of 4 ropes are used. Nearly all <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> are poertal pylons, most of them guyed, but also several free-standing. The free-standing portal pylons carry the conductor in the middle on a V-shaped insulator, while the outmost conductors are as at the guyed <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> carried by a normal suspension insulator. As strainers triple towers are used whereby a fourth tower is required for strainers without or with less direction change for keeping the required distance of the outmost conductor to the tower. Also transposing towers are implemented as monopolar towers whereby two additional towers are required.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{had a clear}} water-way of 688 ft. Its <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> were 48 ft {{above the}} level of the roadway, where they were 22 ft thick. The roadway was {{slightly}} curved upwards, 16 ft above high water, and the extreme length {{from the back of the}} piers on shore was 822 ft, supporting 688 ft of roadway. There were eight chains, composed of wrought-iron bars, each five inches deep and one thick. Four of these had six bars in each chain; and four had only three, making thirty-six bars, which form a dip in the centre of about 29 ft. From these, vertical rods were suspended, which supported the roadway, formed of strong timbers covered with granite. The width of the carriageway was 20 ft, with two footways of 5 ft. The chains passed over the <b>suspension</b> <b>towers,</b> and were secured to the piers on each shore. The <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> were of stone, and designed as archways of the Tuscan order. The approaches were provided with octagonal lodges, or toll-houses, with appropriate lamps and parapet walls, terminating with stone pillars, surmounted with ornamental caps. Construction of the bridge cost some £80,000. It was operated as a toll bridge.|$|R
