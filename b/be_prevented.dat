5|$|Some {{antioxidant}} supplements may promote {{disease and}} increase mortality in humans under certain conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.|$|E

5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary {{studies in which}} a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed {{does have an}} {{inclination}} to gain weight easily, which can <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.|$|E

Angelos petitioned the United States Government to permit a series. United States Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen wrote to the State Department, asking that the series <b>be</b> <b>prevented.</b> The United States Department of the Treasury denied Angelos' request {{on the grounds that}} American money may not be spent in Cuba under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917.|$|E
5|$|Mild iron {{deficiency}} can <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> or corrected by eating iron-rich foods and by cooking in an iron skillet. Because iron {{is a requirement}} for most plants and animals, {{a wide range of}} foods provide iron. Good sources of dietary iron have heme-iron, as this is most easily absorbed and is not inhibited by medication or other dietary components. Three examples are red meat, poultry, and insects. Non-heme sources do contain iron, though it has reduced bioavailability. Examples are lentils, beans, leafy vegetables, pistachios, tofu, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by {{reducing}} exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving {{indoor and outdoor}} air quality. While treatment can slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E

5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E
5|$|Some American {{settlers}} {{claimed that}} smallpox could <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> through the ingestion of lettuce, and an Iranian belief suggested {{consumption of the}} seeds when afflicted with typhoid. Folk medicine has also claimed it {{as a treatment for}} pain, rheumatism, tension and nervousness, coughs and insanity; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found. The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} can <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will {{become accustomed to}} being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E

5|$|Tank {{bursting}} due to overpressure may <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> by a pressure-relief {{burst disc}} fitted to the cylinder valve, which bursts if the cylinder is overpressurised and vents air {{at a rapid}} controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure. Accidental rupture of the burst disc can also occur during filling, due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated pressurization cycles, but is remedied by replacement of the disc. Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Taylor v.

Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} excess thyroid hormone {{typically}} {{respond to the}} administration of a non-selective beta blocker, such as propranolol (as most of the symptoms are driven by increased levels of adrenaline {{and its effect on}} the β-adrenergic receptors).

5|$|The {{movement}} of bog turtles between colonies facilitates genetic diversity. If this movement were to <b>be</b> <b>prevented,</b> or limited in any significant way, the species {{would have a}} higher likelihood of becoming extinct because genetic diversity would fall. Some aspects of a bog turtle's movement that remain unresolved include: phenomena that motivate bog turtles to move outside their natural habitat; the distances an individual {{can be expected to}} travel each day, week, and year; and how separation of small groups affects the genetics of the species.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including lack of control over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must <b>be</b> <b>prevented</b> from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E
