5|$|Although {{the term}} lipid is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for fats, fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides. Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives (including tri-, di-, monoglycerides, and phospholipids), {{as well as other}} sterol-containing metabolites such as cholesterol. Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> to synthesize lipids, some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, Hardy {{announced}} that {{both he and}} Jeff had finally left TNA, following years of speculation, with their contracts expiring that week. Though the two sides were reportedly close to a contract agreement, talks began to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> changes in management prompted their departure from the company. The TNA World Tag Team Championships were vacated due to the Hardys' departure and was explained on TNA television in a segment where The Hardys would teleport to their next Expedition of Gold destination, but a technicality resulted in them disappearing and the belts appearing {{in the arms of}} Decay.|$|E

5|$|Ray of Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer Madonna. It was {{released}} on February 22, 1998 by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. After giving birth to her first child, Madonna started working on the album with producers Babyface and Patrick Leonard. Following failed sessions with them, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with English producer William Orbit. The recording took place over four months and experienced problems with Orbit's hardware arrangement, which would <b>break</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> recording {{would have to be}} delayed until they could be repaired.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E

5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{four and a}} half months at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California, beginning in mid-June 1997, the longest Madonna had ever worked on an album. For most of the recording process, only three other people were in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would <b>break</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|E

25|$|Some {{plastics}} are now {{referred to}} as being 'degradable', 'oxy-degradable' or 'UV-degradable'. This means that they break down when exposed to light or air, but these plastics are still primarily (as much as 98 per cent) oil-based and are not currently certified as 'biodegradable' under the European Union directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC). Biopolymers will <b>break</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> some are suitable for domestic composting.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} are insectivorous or carnivorous {{and have}} rather simple and comparatively short digestive tracts, meat being fairly simple to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> digest. Digestion is slower than in mammals, reflecting their lower resting metabolism and {{their inability to}} divide and masticate their food. Their poikilotherm metabolism has very low energy requirements, allowing large reptiles like crocodiles and the large constrictors to live from a single large meal for months, digesting it slowly.|$|E
25|$|The gradual <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> tearing apart of Ewi’s Kingdom after 19th {{century by}} {{the advent of}} British colonial rule is made poignant with the grant of {{political}} and territorial autonomy to various towns and villages under Ewi’s influence in the pre-colonial era. This is further strengthened by the creation of modern local government system and the composition of Council of Chiefs with the re-grading {{of the status of}} Chiefs and granting of full autonomies to natural rulers in several communities.|$|E

25|$|Following the harvest, {{the vines}} {{continues}} {{the process of}} photosynthesis, creating carbohydrate reserves to store in the vine's roots and trunks. It will continue doing this until an appropriate level of reserves have been stored. At that point the chlorophyll in the leaves begin to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> the leaves change color from green to yellow. Following the first frost the leaves begin to fall as the vine starts to enter its winter dormancy period. The following spring, the cycle begins again.|$|E
25|$|The amount, {{structure}} and chemical composition of pectin differs among plants, within a plant over time, and {{in various parts}} of a plant. Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{accurate}} to speak of ozone depletion in middle latitudes rather than holes. Total column ozone declined below pre-1980 values between 1980 and 1996 for mid-latitudes. In the northern mid-latitudes, it then increased from the minimum value by about two percent from 1996 to 2009 as regulations took effect {{and the amount of}} chlorine in the stratosphere decreased. In the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, total ozone remained constant over that time period. There are no significant trends in the tropics, largely because halogen-containing compounds have not had time to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> release chlorine and bromine atoms at tropical latitudes.|$|E

25|$|In 1916 it was {{suggested}} by naval planners to bring the CC-class submarines to the east coast. During 1917 that became a reality as the Admiralty ordered the two subs and Shearwater to Europe. On 21 June 1917 the three ships left Esquimalt. Off Cape Blanco, the fleet ran into a gale and CC-2 rolled heavily in the seas, seawater contaminating the sub's batteries. Half the crew was incapacitated by chlorine gas. The high seas also caused the propellers on both the submarines to be tossed out of the water, in turn causing the engines to over-rev. The stabilisation of this problem later caused the battery cells to start to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> eventually short-circuit and start electrical fires.|$|E
25|$|In 1942 Potts {{returned}} to Australia and in April {{he was promoted}} to temporary brigadier and given command of the 21st Brigade, stationed in south-east Queensland. At this time the Japanese had established a beachhead on the north coast of New Guinea. It was clear to Potts that the 21st would soon be fighting in the jungle. He devised and implemented the first specific jungle training for Australian troops. Potts took his troops up into the Blackall Range, where the thick scrub and steep grades gave these experienced desert fighters an idea of what lay ahead for them. War game exercises indicated that in such country communications would <b>break</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> evacuation of wounded would be difficult.|$|E
25|$|If {{too much}} damage {{is present in}} mitochondria, a cell {{undergoes}} apoptosis or programmed cell death. Bcl-2 proteins are layered {{on the surface of}} the mitochondria, detect damage, and activate a class of proteins called Bax, which punch holes in the mitochondrial membrane, causing cytochrome C to leak out. This cytochrome C binds to Apaf-1, or apoptotic protease activating factor-1, which is free-floating in the cell's cytoplasm. Using energy from the ATPs in the mitochondrion, the Apaf-1 and cytochrome C bind together to form apoptosomes. The apoptosomes bind to and activate caspase-9, another free-floating protein. The caspase-9 then cleaves the proteins of the mitochondrial membrane, causing it to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> start a chain reaction of protein denaturation and eventually phagocytosis of the cell.|$|E
