5|$|Architectural {{historian}} S.Allen Chambers described Literary Hall as {{an anomaly}} because the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> and fenestration patterns, which invoke early Federal and Greek Revival design elements, are adorned with details more {{characteristic of the}} Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|All Eurasian {{composite}} bows {{derive from}} the same nomad origins, but every culture that used them has made its own adaptations to the <b>basic</b> <b>design.</b> The Turkish, Mongolian, and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport. Recent Turkish bows are optimized for flight shooting.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>basic</b> <b>designs</b> for KVMs: {{clamshell}} and lay-flat.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} <b>basic</b> <b>designs</b> {{have been}} invented for high-acceleration linear motors: railguns and coilguns.|$|R

5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|After <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> {{work was}} {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the North Carolina {{class was}} slowed by the {{aforementioned}} material issues, the changes {{made to the}} <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> after this date—namely the substitution of 16-inch for 14-inch guns—and the need to add both length and strength to the slipways already present in the navy yards. Increased use of welding was proposed as a possible way to reduce weight and bolster the structural design, as it could have reduced the ships' structural weight by 10%, but it was utilized in only about 30% of the ship. The costs associated with welding {{and an increase in}} the time of construction made it impractical.|$|E

5000|$|The Navy Technical Department (Kampon) {{used the}} Ukurus <b>basic</b> <b>designs</b> {{for the new}} drawings. It was a chimera of Mikura and Ukuru classes.|$|R
50|$|These {{elements}} were set within {{a grid of}} inlaid square designs surrounded by thousands of tiny diamonds and triangles. Most of the square designs were symmetrical with respect to rotations of 180 degrees, which allowed several <b>basic</b> <b>designs</b> to be turned and flipped to form derivative versions, adding complexity and obscuring the underlying patterns in which the <b>basic</b> <b>designs</b> had been arranged. This surprising play with symmetry indicates that the Phrygian woodworkers were clever, imaginative artisans with a pronounced mathematical orientation.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the nosewheel to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{under the}} code name Project 28, the Indian Navy placed {{an order for}} four ASW corvettes. The corvette's design was {{originally}} planned {{to be based on}} the Russian corvette Project 2038.2, however the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> was later provided by the Indian Navy's Directorate of Naval Design, followed by the detailed design by GRSE. The design includes many stealth ship features, including reductions in acoustic signature and vibration of the vessels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and so he turned to less {{expensive}} vessels to modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the same <b>basic</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

5|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Colin Cantwell {{created the}} concept model that {{established}} the TIE fighter's ball-cockpit and hexagonal panels design for Star Wars (1977). Star Wars creator George Lucas liked the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> {{consisting of two}} panels connected by a stick with a ball-shaped cockpit, but Cantwell's concept had few details. Joe Johnston created additional details, such as the cockpit window and the attachment points between the solar panels and the hull.|$|E
5|$|That month, {{the city}} {{announced}} that the Pritzker family had donated $15million to fund Gehry's bandshell and an additional nine donors committed a total of $10million. The day of this announcement, after {{it became clear that}} Cindy Pritzker would fund the project, Gehry agreed to the design request. In November, when his designs for both the pavilion and bridge were unveiled, Gehry already had the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> for the bandshell, but said the bridge's design was very preliminary and not well-conceived because funding for it was not committed. The BP Pedestrian Bridge is designed to serve as a buffer against street noise, helping the pavilion's acoustics.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} <b>basic</b> <b>design,</b> such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E
5000|$|The Kawasaki Ninja ZX-9R was a {{motorcycle}} in the Ninja sport bike series from the Japanese manufacturer Kawasaki produced from 1994 until 2003. There were five model incarnations across two <b>basic</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R

5|$|The SECR Kclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-4 tank {{locomotive}} {{designed in}} 1914 by Richard Maunsell for express passenger duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), which operated between London and south-east England. The Southern Railway (SR) K1class was a three-cylinder variant of the Kclass, designed in 1925 to suit a narrower loading gauge. They {{were among the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) types to use and improve upon the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> principles of power and standardisation established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The locomotives were based on the GWR 4300class, improved by the Midland Railway's ideals of simplicity and ease of maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The SECR Nclass was {{a type of}} 2-6-0 ("mogul") steam {{locomotive}} designed in 1914 by Richard Maunsell for mixed-traffic duties on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). Built between 1917 and 1934, {{it was the first}} non-Great Western Railway (GWR) type to use and improve upon the <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward. The Nclass was based on the GWR 4300 Class design, improved with Midland Railway concepts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> of the {{national}} flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree No.214 of June 7, 1995. The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes: a red upper stripe covering two-thirds of the flag's height, and green lower stripe covering one-third. A vertical red-on-white Belarusian decorative pattern, which occupies one-ninth of the flag's length, is placed against the flagstaff. The flag's ratio of width to length is 1:2.|$|E

5000|$|... Dresden's tram fleet {{was made}} up of 166 modern tramsets (with 31 older trams). [...] Most of the trams {{operating}} in Dresden are articulated low floor cars, of two different <b>basic</b> <b>designs,</b> each of which has several variants.|$|R
50|$|The female Balochi suit {{consists}} of the head scarf, long dress and a shalwar. Balochi women wear loose dresses which are embroidered in local designs which include Balochi silk-thread chain-stitch embroidery. Balochi embroidery alone has 118 different <b>basic</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ships {{used the}} <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> of the Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce {{design and construction}} time. Their hulls were completed very quickly, but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished. They were delivered to the Royal dockyards in 1872 and commissioned for fitting out, {{but a number of}} years elapsed before that process was completed as little sense of urgency remained.|$|E
5|$|The {{uniform and}} {{insignia}} of the Boy Scouts of America gives a Scout visibility {{and creates a}} level of identity within both the unit and the community. The uniform is used to promote equality while showing individual achievement. While uniforms are similar in <b>basic</b> <b>design,</b> they do vary in color and detail to identify the different divisions of Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Varsity Scouts, Venturers, and Sea Scouts.|$|E
5|$|A popular product, {{with a lower}} screen {{resolution}} and performance than the two Retina models that followed it but a lighter build and longer battery life, it remained in the Apple line-up as an entry-level iPad model for three years until March 2014, latterly with a silent upgrade to a die-shrunk version of the A5 processor. Its <b>basic</b> <b>design</b> formed {{the core of the}} first iPad mini, which had the same screen pixel count and similar features at a smaller size. The iPad 2 has been able to run six major versions of iOS, from 4 to 9, the only iOS device {{to be able to do}} so. The iPhone 4S is a close second with support from iOS 5 to iOS 9, as well as the iPhone 5, which was supported from iOS 6 to iOS 10.|$|E
