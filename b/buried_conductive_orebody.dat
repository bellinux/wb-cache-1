From our model study, we conclude that 3 -D inversion of either Z or Q recovers the “true” structure equally well. This, in particular, further promotes MT survey layout where measurements of both (electrical and magnetic) fields are conducted on a subset of survey sites (say, on a coarser grid, or even at a single reference site), and measurements of only electric field on an entire (dense) grid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract - One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of grounding systems is to safely inject fault currents into the soil; such currents flow through any <b>buried</b> <b>conductive</b> objects (e. g. other earth electrodes) eventually present along their path. As a result, even though grounding systems may be metallically isolated, they become coupled due to {{the flow of the}} earth-current and interferences occur. Due to this unwanted coupling, dangerous potentials may arise over the "passive" electrode, which may expose persons to the risk of electric shocks.

When a source is operated at or {{below the surface of}} the Earth in the vicinity of a <b>conductive</b> <b>orebody,</b> these probes provide, after appropriate processing, the secondary vector magnetic field attributed to this body. Proper inversion of the resulting datasets requires as a first step a clear understanding of the electromagnetic interaction of model signals with model bodies. In this paper, the response of a <b>conductive</b> ellipsoid <b>buried</b> at shallow depth in a half-space Earth is investigate by a novel hybrid approach combining the localized nonlinear approximation and the low frequency scattering theory. The ellipsoidal shape indeed fits a large class of scatterers and yet is amenable to analytical calculations in the intricate world of ellipsoidal harmonics, while the localized nonlinear approximation is known to provide fairly accurate results at least for low contrasts of conductivity between a scattering body and its host medium. In addition, weak coupling of the body to the interface is assumed. The primary field accounts for the presence of the interface, but multiple reflection of the secondary field on this interface is neglected. After analyzing the theoretical bases of the approach, numerical simulations in several geometrical and electrical configurations illustrate how estimators of the secondary magnetic field along a nearby borehole behave with respect to a general-purpose method-of-moments (MoM) code.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{investigation}} by Kelvin Probe Microscopy (KPM) of buried graphitic microchannels fabricated in single-crystal diamond by direct MeV ion microbeam writing. Metal deposition of variable-thickness masks was adopted to implant channels with emerging endpoints and high temperature annealing was performed in order to induce the graphitization of the highly-damaged buried region. When an electrical current was flowing through the biased buried channel, the structure was clearly evidenced by KPM maps of the electrical potential of the surface region overlying the channel at increasing distances from the grounded electrode. The KPM profiling shows regions of opposite contrast located at different distances from the endpoints of the channel. This effect is attributed to the different electrical conduction properties of the surface and of the buried graphitic layer.

40|$|Presence of {{cultural}} refuse has long posed {{a serious challenge}} to meaningful geological interpretation of near surface controlled?source electromagnetic data (CSEM). Cultural refuse, such as buried pipes, underground storage tanks, unexploded ordnance, is often highly conductive and magnetically permeable. Interpretation of the CSEM response in the presence {{of cultural}} noise requires an understanding of electromagnetic field diffusion and the effects of anomalous highly conductive and permeable structures embedded in geologic media. While many numerical techniques have been used to evaluate the response of three dimensional subsurface conductivity distributions, {{there is a lack of}} approaches for modeling the EM response incorporating variations in both subsurface conductivity ? and relative permeability ?r. In this dissertation, I present a new three dimensional edge?based finite element (FE) algorithm capable of modeling the CSEM response of <b>buried</b> <b>conductive</b> and permeable targets. A coupled potential formulation for variable ? using the vector magnetic potential A and scalar electric potential V gives rise to an ungauged curl?curl equation. Using reluctivity (v= 1 /mu), a new term in geophysical applications instead of traditional magnetic susceptibility, facilitates a separation of primary and secondary potentials. The resulting differential equation is solved using the finite element method (FEM) on a tetrahedral mesh with local refinement capabilities. The secondary A and V potentials are expressed in terms of the vector edge basis vectors and the scalar nodal basis functions respectively. The finite element matrix is solved using a Jacobi preconditioned QMR solver. Post processing steps to interpolate the vector potentials on the nodes of the mesh are described. The algorithm is validated against a number of analytic and multi dimensional numeric solutions. The code has been deployed to estimate the influence of magnetic permeability on the mutual coupling between multiple geological and cultural targets. Some limitations of the code with regards to speed and performance at high frequency, conductivity and permeability values have been noted.

40|$|The {{examination}} of inverse problems represents a fascinating, diverse and difficult area of study. Almost any problem in mathematics, physics and engineering has an associated inverse problem. The method of quasi-solutions {{allows one to}} reformulate inverse problems as a function minimization involving the associated forward problem. The function to minimize {{is known as a}} penalty function or cost function and is defined as the least squares difference between some measured quantity and a quantity computed by the forward solver. This strategy avoids the need to construct the inverse operator. The forward problem is often well posed and can be solved quickly and accurately by various numerical solution techniques. The cost function, however, is typically a complicated multidimensional, multimodal surface. These properties make it difficult to locate the global minimum where the quasi-solution exists.;The simulated annealing algorithm performs well at minimizing functions with multiple local minima and hence has been employed in the quasi-solution of the inverse problem. Regularization techniques in the area of inverse problems attempt to better condition the problem by removing the local minimum from the cost function. Focus in this work has been placed on finding the global minimum of the multimodal cost function rather than strongly regularizing the penalty function. Two physical applications are chosen to test the feasibility of the proposed inversion method.;The first application involves the mise-a-la-masse electromagnetic prospecting technique from geophysics. This technique attempts to recover the size, shape and orientation of <b>buried</b> <b>conductive</b> ore bodies based on surface measurements. Here, a finite difference method is employed to solve the potential equation in a 3 D semi-infinite medium.;The second application focuses on the scattering of acoustic waves by a 2 D inhomogeneous medium.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{attractive}} sources of green energy has roots in the popular recycling theme of other green technologies, now known by the term "energy scavenging. " In its most promising conformation, energy scavenging converts cyclic mechanical vibrations in the environment or random mechanical pressure pulses, caused by sources ranging from operating machinery to human footfalls, into electrical energy via piezoelectric transducers. While commercial piezoelectrics have evolved to favor lead zirconate titanate (PZT) for its combination of superior properties, the presence of lead in these ceramic compounds raises resistance to their application in anything "green" due to potential health implications during their manufacturing, recycling, or in-service application, if leaching occurs. Therefore {{in this study we}} have pursued the application of aluminum nitride (AlN) as a non-toxic alternative to PZT, seeking processing pathways to augment the modest piezoelectric performance of AlN and exploit its compatibility with complementary-metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. 	Such piezoelectric transducers have been categorized as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which despite {{more than a decade of}} research in this field, is plagued by delamination at the electrode/piezoelectric interface. Consequently the electric field essential to generate and sustain the piezoelectric response of these devices is lost, resulting in device failure. Working on the hypothesis that buried conducting layers can both mitigate the delamination problem and generate sufficient electric field to engage the operation of resonator devices, we have undertaken a study of silver ion implantation to experimentally assess its feasibility. As with most ion implantation procedures employed in semiconductor fabrication, the implanted sample is subjected to a thermal treatment, encouraging diffusion-assisted precipitation of the implanted species at high enough concentrations. The objective of this study is to understand the resulting phase transformation behavior during Ag precipitation with the intent to ultimately control the electrical operation of AlN piezoelectric resonators in energy scavenging applications. 	In this work, multiple source reactive ion sputtering was employed to deposit a thin film of AlN on a 525 microns thick Si substrate, followed by ion implantation (Ag cathode) into the aluminum nitride, and subsequent thermal annealing. Computer simulations were conducted to elucidate the projected range of the silver in the AlN epilayer as a result of the ion implantation process. A myriad of characterization methods including Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), rocking curve, electron microscopy was employed to quantify the concentration of silver, morphology of silver precipitates, as well as the composition, crystallinity and degree of damage in the ion-implanted AlN samples with respect to thermal annealing conditions. The presence, or lack of precipitates in the samples was utilized to draw conclusions about the feasibility of developing a <b>buried</b> <b>conductive</b> layer in a ceramic matrix via ion implantation. 	Computer simulations results obtained via TRIM and TRIDYN confirmed that the maximum concentration of silver lied within 30 - 47 nm from the surface. The RBS data verified the presence of Si, Al, N, Ag, and O 2, whose concentration varied with temperature. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy corroborated the crystallinity of the AlN epilayer. Electron diffraction confirmed both the epitaxy of the AlN film on the (001) Si substrate and the crystalline quality of the epilayer prior to and after the thermal annealing treatment. Electron microscopy revealed that the sputtered AlN film grew epitaxially in a columnar morphology and silver precipitates did form in some of the aluminum nitride samples implanted but only in those implanted with a higher concentration of Ag under high-energy implantation conditions. 	It is concluded that the Ag implanted region does indeed have potential as a buried contact layer for piezoelectric activation and sensing if the critical concentration and appropriate thermal conditions can be attained...|$|R
40|$|Development {{of silicon}} based {{electronics}} have revolutionized our every day life {{during the last}} three decades. Nowadays Si based devices operate close to their theoretical limits that is becoming a bottleneck for further progress. In particular, for the growing field of high frequency and high power electronics, Si cannot offer the required properties. Development of materials capable of providing high current densities, carrier mobilities and high breakdown fields is crucial for a progress in state of the art electronics. Epitaxial graphene grown on semi-insulating silicon carbide substrates has a high potential to be integrated in the current planar device technologies. High electron mobilities and sheet carrier densities make graphene extremely attractive for high frequency analog applications. One of the remaining challenges is the interaction of epitaxial graphene with the substrate. Typically, much lower free charge carrier mobilities, compared to free standing graphene, and doping, due to charge transfer from the substrate, is reported. Thus, a good understanding of the intrinsic free charge carriers properties and the factors affecting them is very important for further development of epitaxial graphene. III-group nitrides have been extensively studied and already have proven their high efficiency as light sources for short wavelengths. High carrier mobilities and breakdown electric fields were demonstrated for III-group nitrides, making them attractive for high frequency and high power applications. Currently, In-rich InGaN alloys and AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility structures are of high interest for the research community due to open fundamental questions. Electrical characterization techniques, commonly used for the determination of free charge carrier properties, require good ohmic and Schottky contacts, which in certain cases can be difficult to achieve. Access to electrical properties of <b>buried</b> <b>conductive</b> channels in multilayered structures requires modification of samples and good knowledge of the electrical properties of all electrical contact within the structure. Moreover, the use of electrical contacts to electrically characterize two-dimensional electronic materials, such as graphene, can alter their intrinsic properties. Furthermore, the determination of effective mass parameters commonly employs cyclotron resonance and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations measurements, which require long scattering times of free charge carriers, high magnetic fields and low temperatures. The optical Hall effect is an external magnetic field induced optical anisotropy in  conductive layers due to the motion of the free charge carriers {{under the influence of the}} Lorentz force, and is equivalent to the electrical Hall effect at optical frequencies. The optical Hall effect can be measured by generalized ellipsometry and provides a powerful method for the determination of free charge carrier properties in a non-destructive and contactless manner. In principle, a single optical Hall effect measurement can provide quantitative information about free charge carrier types, concentrations, mobilities and effective mass parameters at temperatures ranging from few kelvins to room temperature and above. Further, it was demonstrated that for transparent samples, a backside cavity can be employed to enhance the optical Hall effect. Measurement of the optical Hall effect by generalized ellipsometry is an indirect technique requiring subsequent data analysis. Parameterized optical models are fitted to match experimentally measured ellipsometric data by varying physically significant parameters. Analysis of the optical response of samples, containing free charge carriers, employing optical models based on the classical Drude model, which is augmented with an external magnetic field contribution, provide access to the free charge carrier properties. The main research results of the graduate studies presented in this licentiate thesis are summarized in the five scientific papers. Paper I. Description of the custom-built terahertz frequency-domain spectroscopic ellipsometer at Linköping University. The terahertz ellipsometer capabilities are demonstrated by an accurate determination of the isotropic and anisotropic refractive indices of silicon and m-plane sapphire, respectively. Further, terahertz optical Hall effect measurements of an AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility structures were employed to extract the two-dimensional electron gas sheet density, mobility and effective mass parameters. Last, in-situ optical Hall effect measurement on epitaxial graphene in a gas cell with controllable environment, were used to study the effects of environmental doping on the mobility and carrier concentration. Paper II. Presents terahertz cavity-enhanced optical Hall measurements of the monolayer and multilayer epitaxial graphene on semi-insulating 4 H-SiC (0001) substrates. The data analysis revealed p-type doping for monolayer graphene with a carrier density in the low 1012 cm− 2 range and a carrier mobility of 1550 cm 2 /V·s. For the multilayer epitaxial graphene, n-type doping with a carrier density in the low 1013 cm− 2 range, a mobility of 470 cm 2 /V·s and an effective mass of (0. 14 ± 0. 03) m 0 were extracted. The measurements demonstrate that cavity-enhanced optical Hall effect measurements can be applied to study electronic properties of two-dimensional materials. Paper III. Terahertz cavity-enhanced optical Hall effect measurements are employed to study anisotropic transport in as-grown monolayer, quasi free-standing monolayer and quasi free-standing bilayer epitaxial graphene on semi-insulating 4 H-SiC (0001) substrates. The data analysis revealed a strong anisotropy in the carrier mobilities of the quasi freestanding bilayer graphene. The anisotropy is demonstrated to be induced by carriers scattering at the step edges of the SiC, by showing that the mobility is higher along the step than across them. The scattering mechanism is discussed based on the results of the optical Hall effect, low-energy electron microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction and Raman measurements. Paper IV. Mid-infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry and mid-infrared optical Hall effect measurements are employed to determine the electron effective mass in an In 0. 33 Ga 0. 67 N epitaxial layer. The data analysis reveals slightly anisotropic effective mass and carrier mobility parameters together with the optical phonon frequencies and broadenings. Paper V. Terahertz cavity-enhanced optical Hall measurements are employed to study the free charge carrier properties in a set of AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility structures with modified interfaces. The results show that the interface structure has a significant effect on the free charge carrier mobility and that the sample with a sharp interface between an AlGaN barrier and a GaN buffer layers exhibits a record mobility of 2332 ± 73 cm 2 /V·s. The determined effective mass parameters showed an increase compared to the GaN value, that is attributed the the penetration of the electron wavefunction into the AlGaN barrier layer...|$|R

Tunability {{of the direct}} band gap from 0. 65 eV (InN) to 6. 2 eV (AlN) by alloying, high breakthrough voltages and intrinsic mobilities, {{as well as the}} formation of highly mobile 2 d electron gases (2 DEG) at heterointerfaces make these compounds ideal for many applications. ^ GaN and Ga-rich alloys are well studied and current research is mainly device-oriented. For example, choice and quality of the gate dielectric significantly influence device performance in high-electron mobility transistors (HEMT) which utilize highly mobile 2 DEGs at heterointerfaces. Experimental access to the 2 DEG channel properties without influence from parasitic currents or contact properties are desirable. In- and Al-rich ternary alloys are less explored than Ga-rich compounds. For InN and In-rich alloys, while many material parameters such as stiffness constants or effective mass values are largely unknown, reliable p-type doping is a major challenge, also because p-type conducting channels are <b>buried</b> within highly <b>conductive</b> n-type material formed at the surface and interfaces preventing electrical characterization. For AlN and high-Al content alloys, doping mechanisms are not understood and reliable fabrication of material with high free-charge carrier (FCC) concentrations was achieved just recently. Difficulties to form ohmic contacts impair electrical measurements and optical characterization is impeded by lack of high-energy excitation sources. ^ In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry over the wide spectral range from the THz to VUV in combination with optical Hall effect (generalized ellipsometry with applied magnetic field) from THz to MIR are applied in order to investigate the phonon modes and FCC properties in group-III nitride heterostructures. Adequate model descriptions and analysis strategies are introduced which allow contact-less characterization of the anisotropic IR dielectric function tensor and phonon mode parameters in arbitrarily oriented uniaxial compounds often used as substrate material such as bulk single-crystalline rutile TiO 2, to characterize the phonon and FCC parameters in Al-rich AlGaN:Si thin films including effective mass tensor, and to identify and characterize buried p-type conducting channels within InN:Mg samples. THz optical Hall effect is introduced as novel, contactless method to investigate sheet density, in-plane effective mass, and in-plane mobility parameters for 2 DEGs formed within group-III nitride based HEMT structures.

40|$|Finite-element {{solutions}} to the three-dimensional geophysical electromagnetic forward modeling problem in the frequency domain are presented. The method is firstly examined for {{the solution to the}} E-field Helmholtz equation. Edge-element basis functions are used for the electric field. An alternative method is also used which is based on decomposing the electric field into vector and scalar potentials in the Helmholtz equation and in the equation of conservation of charge. Edge element and nodal element basis functions are used respectively for the vector and scalar potentials. This decomposition is performed with the intention of satisfying the continuity of the tangential component of the electric field and the normal component of the current density across the inter-element boundaries, therefore finding an efficient solution to the problem. The computational domain is subdivided into unstructured tetrahedral elements. The system of equations is discretized using the Galerkin variant of the weighted residuals method, with the approximated vector and scalar potentials as the unknowns of a sparse linear system. Both iterative and direct solvers are used for the {{solutions to}} the E-field and decomposed systems. A generalized minimum residual solver with an incomplete LU preconditioner is used to iteratively solve the system. The direct solver, MUMPS, is used to provide the direct solution to the system of equations. The forward modeling methods are validated using a number of examples. The fields generated by small dipoles on the surface of a homogeneous half-space are compared against their corresponding analytic solutions. The next example provides a comparison with the results from an integral equation method for a long grounded wire source on a model with a <b>conductive</b> block <b>buried</b> in a less conductive half-space. The decomposed method is also verified for a large conductivity contrast model where a magnetic dipole transmitter-receiver pair moves over a graphite cube immersed in brine. Solutions from the numerical approach are in good agreement with the data from physical scale modeling of this scenario. Another example verifies the solution for a resistive disk model <b>buried</b> in marine <b>conductive</b> sediments. For all examples, convergence of the solution that used potentials was significantly quicker than that using the electric field. The inductive and galvanic components of the electromagnetic response are also investigated for the above examples. Furthermore a detailed investigation of these effects are presented for models with varying conductivity contrasts. The characteristics of the solutions in terms of implicitly and explicitly enforcing the Coulomb gauge condition are investigated for the decomposed system. Numerical computations show that for the above-mentioned grounded wire example the electromagnetic response is significantly affected by the contribution from the galvanic part. By contrast for the example where a magnetic dipole excites a graphite cube immersed in brine solutions, the inductive scenario dominantly contributes to the model’s electromagnetic response...|$|R
40|$|Obtaining {{information}} regarding the resistivity structure of the subsurface from marine CSEM data involves complex processes. 1 D and 2 D forward and inverse modelling are currently the standard approaches used to produce geoelectrical models, with 3 D inversion fast becoming a realizable method. However, these methods are time consuming, require expert knowledge to produce reliable results, and suffer from the non-uniqueness of the EM problem. There is therefore considerable scope for developing imaging techniques for marine CSEM data {{that do not require}} lengthy, time consuming computations, but make use of entire datasets. These could provide a “first look” for possible structural information conveyed by the data, and may provide starting points or other constraints for inversion. In this thesis, a number of different imaging techniques for marine CSEM data are assessed, with particular reference to applications in hydrocarbon exploration. T-X and F-K imaging are widely used seismic reflection processing techniques that can be applied to CSEM data. Features produced in the T-X and F-K domains by 1 D subsurface resistivity structures are investigated. The dip of an arrival corresponding to a subsurface resistive feature is found to depend on its resistivity, with reduction in resistivity producing steeper dipping events. The separation of arrivals according to their dips in the T-X domain is used as a basis for the attempted separation of the airwave, by filtering in the F-K domain. However, this does not prove to be useful. Secondly, in a adaptation of the F-K migration method used in seismic processing, EM migration is investigated, following the approach by (Tompkins, 2004 b). The results of the migration method are compared and contrasted to a 1 D smooth inversion algorithm. It is found that the migration is mostly dependent on the conductivity contrast across a geoelectrical boundary, whereas the inversion recovers the resistivity thickness product (transverse resistance). Hence, EM migration is a viable alternative to inversion and usefully complements it in regions of large conductivity contrasts. Normalized ElectroMagnetic Imaging (NEMI) extends the standard approach of normalizing the recorded electric field data by a 1 D background model, to identify large lateral resistivity variations over a survey area. This is achieved by firstly sorting the data based on sensitivity to the target layer, and then distributing the normalized anomaly in the horizontal plane between the source and receiver using a simple quasitomographical approach. In some scenarios this provides a reasonable estimation of the lateral extent of a 3 D resistive body <b>buried</b> in a <b>conductive</b> background. Lastly, Apparent Resistivity Imaging (ARI) is adapted for the use with the marine CSEM method. This generates pseudo-sections in which offsets are mapped into apparent depths. This study shows that whilst vertical resolution of resistive bodies is poor, lateral resolution is high and provides a good estimate of the true extent of a target body. Apparent resistivity pseudo-sections therefore provide a very effective means of “first look” imaging and assessment of marine CSEM data.
