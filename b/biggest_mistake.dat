5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E

25|$|According to Berlusconi's {{political}} and entrepreneurial opponents, Berlusconismo {{is only a}} form of demagogic populism, comparable to Fascism, in part because Berlusconi has defended aspects of the regime of Benito Mussolini, {{even though he has}} criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> was signing up to exterminate the Jews. Conrastingly his supporters compare Berlusconismo to French Gaullism and Argentinian Peronism.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{a severe}} ankle injury that he {{suffered}} during the Celtics pre-season training camp, the franchise {{was no longer}} interested in offering him a contract because Gerald Henderson had taken his place, and his injury would keep him out for the foreseeable future. It was then that Galis decided to pursue a professional career in Greece's Basket League. Later, while playing in Greece, he would be offered NBA contracts by the Celtics and the New Jersey Nets. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, FIBA did not have professional status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the national team level. Since playing for the Greek national team {{meant so much to}} him, he stayed in Greece. Celtics legend Red Auerbach later said that the single <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> he ever made in his career was not keeping Galis.|$|E

500|$|The European leg of {{the tour}} seemed to garner mostly {{unfavorable}} reviews from the media, although there were positive reviews as well. Bowie was frustrated how the reviews in Europe changed from initially positive to negative, blaming the early start of the tour in some outdoor venues for the poor reception. He said, [...] "the <b>biggest</b> <b>mistake</b> that was made on that tour, was opening in the daylight. The whole reason for the entire damn show was lost." [...] He noted that reviews from indoor shows (where the set and lighting were more effective) were quite positive.|$|E

He led the team with 30 goals and 54 points, seventh best in the league, and scored four goals in one game that were all assisted by Billy Taylor on a night where the latter player set an NHL record with seven assists.
