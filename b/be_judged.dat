40|$|Can’t one truly <b>judge</b> {{that one}} <b>is</b> <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly <b>judge</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness that one <b>is</b> <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> now <b>judging</b> that p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R

5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> authentic by their thickness.|$|E

5000|$|Stevens's main {{assertion}} {{was that}} using magnitude estimations/productions respondents {{were able to}} make judgements on a ratio scale (i.e., if x and y are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant k such that x = ky). In the context of axiomatic psychophysics, [...] formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions p and q, and three stimuli, x, y, z, if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times y, then t = pq times x should be equal to z. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ( [...] , [...] ). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, [...] formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times y, and if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times y, then z should equal z.

5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can <b>be</b> <b>judged,</b> so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E

5|$|The first Championship {{was awarded}} at a Cardiff show in 1928, to {{a red and}} white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach.

5|$|Identified world zinc {{resources}} total about 1.9–2.8 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States, {{with the}} largest reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically based (location, grade, quality, and quantity) {{at the time of}} determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount of zinc reserves is not a fixed number and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109–305 million tonnes are in use.|$|E
