5|$|The {{ship was}} built at Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co., Ltd on Tyneside. She was laid down on 2 April 1906, and {{launched}} at 3 p.m. on 13 April 1907 by Lady Allendale. On 28 December 1907, while still fitting out, she {{was hit by}} the collier Oden, {{which resulted in the}} buckling of beams and frames in the hull and five <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> being stove in. She was officially completed on 16 March 1909. On 18 March, she sailed from the Tyne to Portsmouth, where she would be commissioned. On the way, she collided with the brigantine Mary Ann, and stood by until the lifeboat John Birch arrived from Yarmouth to take the brigantine in tow.|$|E
25|$|In 1802 {{there was}} a partial failure, {{probably}} due to the sides bowing and transferring too much weight to the base where they joined to the deck. After remedial work it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber baulks. Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by puddling.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the cello}} has two {{important}} features: a bass bar, which is {{glued to the}} underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden sound post, a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates.</b> The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument's sound.|$|E

40|$|A WIG(Wing-In-Ground effect) craft flies {{close to}} the water surface by {{utilizing}} a cushion of relatively high pressurized air between its wing and water surface. This implies that when one designs such craft {{it is important to}} have lightweight structures with adequate strength to resist external loads with some margins. To investigate this requirement, this paper deals with the structural analysis of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of small WIG craft having a design landing weight of 1. 2 -ton. As building materials for the WIG craft, pre-preg carbon/epoxy composites are considered. The strength information of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> is obtained using the first-ply-failure analysis in conjunction with a mid-plane symmetric laminated plate theory. As a result, the first-ply-failure location, load and deflection of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> are obtained. The calculated strength information is compared with the water reaction load for the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> of seaplanes considered when they land on the water surface –the same fluid-structure interaction mechanism as that of WIG craft. In the calculation of seaplane water reaction load information, the rules shown in FAR(Federal Aviation Regulations) Part 25 are used. Through the comparison, the structural integrity of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> for the WIG craft is checked...|$|R
25|$|While Sampo had {{not been}} damaged in the war, she was docked at the Hietalahti {{shipyard}} for extensive maintenance and repairs — when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> had been replaced. In December 1922 Sampo struck a rock in the port of Loviisa and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, {{but there was no}} time for repairs and for the rest of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller. Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of Sampo hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while Sampo was assisting a Finnish steamship Albert Kasimir, the stern propeller shaft snapped when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the foredeck. Murtaja towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 1958, Nyon was on {{a voyage}} from Leith, Midlothian to Dakar, Senegal when she ran aground at St. Abbs Head, Berwickshire. At the time there was dense fog in the area. Two forward holds were breached, {{with a total of}} five holes between them. The fishing boat Emulate of Eyemouth brought bags of cement to Nyon, which were used in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to plug the holes. The British tugs George V and Beamish attempted to refloat the ship without success. On 20 November, 23 of the crew were taken off by a lifeboat. That day, {{the decision was made to}} cut the ship in two, salvaging the stern portion. Wijsmuller Salvage of the Netherlands were awarded the contract under Lloyd's Open Form rules. The ocean-going tugs Simson and Hector were despatched to Scotland. On 21 November, the operation to separate the two parts of the ship began. The sides were cut on 23 November, leaving just the <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> intact. Although all four tugs attempted to separate the two sections, they were unsuccessful. On 25 November, it was decided to use explosives to part the two sections of the ship. This was achieved on 27 November. The stern part of Nyon was towed to North Shields, Northumberland, arriving on 28 November. The bow section was left in situ and was destroyed in a gale some days later. Following further work to strengthen the stern section, it was towed to Bolnes, Zuid Holland, Netherlands, in February 1959. A new bow section was manufactured by NV Boeles Shipyards, Bolnes, and fitted on 8 June 1959.|$|E

500|$|Above {{the upper}} armour belt {{there was a}} deck that ran {{the full length of}} the ship that {{consisted}} of a [...] armour plate laid on [...] deck plating. At the top of the waterline belt was two layers of [...] armour. It also extended the full length of the ship, but not the full width; it curved downward behind the belt and was connected to the lower edge of the belt by a 20-millimetre plate. It continued downward to the ship's inner <b>bottom</b> <b>plates</b> and formed a sort of torpedo bulkhead. This bulkhead was [...] {{from the side of the}} ship and extended for a length of [...] It was backed with coal bunkers.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror {{began in}} 1979, {{starting}} with a blank manufactured by Corning from their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> each one inch (25.4mm) thick, sandwiching a honeycomb lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed {{by the end of}} 1981; it was washed using 2,400 gallons (9,100 L) of hot, deionized water and then received a reflective coating of [...] 65nm-thick aluminum and a protective coating of 25nm-thick magnesium fluoride.|$|E

50|$|In 1986 the OM-4 was {{improved}} to a tougher OM-4Ti (OM-4T in USA) version, with titanium top and <b>bottom</b> <b>plates,</b> improved weatherproofing and high-speed flash sync. This last version was discontinued in 2002.|$|E
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF {{is similar}} in {{form-factor}} to Leica M-mount cameras, being slightly larger than the archetypal Leica M3 design in all dimensions, and just slightly heavier when batteries are fitted.

40|$|In this paper, {{the thermal}} {{performance}} of cross-corrugated and v-groove solar air collectors {{has been compared}} under {{a wide range of}} configuration and operating conditions. For cross-corrugated collectors, the air flow channel is formed by the wavelike absorbing plate and the wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> which are transversely positioned, whereas for v-groove collectors it is formed by the v-groove absorbing plate and the flat <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> The use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> in cross-corrugated collectors is to achieve better thermal performance by enhancing the heat transfer rate inside the air flow channel via augmented turbulence. It is found that cross-corrugated collectors are superior to v-groove ones for all the configurations and operating conditions considered, confirming that the use of the transversely positioned wavelike <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> in cross-corrugated collectors improves the thermal performance. The results also show that a slender configuration along the air flow direction, a small gap between the absorbing <b>plate</b> and the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> a selected coating on the absorbing plate and the glass cover that has a very high absorptivity of solar radiation but quite a small emissivity of thermal radiation, an air mass flow rate per unit area of collector above 0. 1 kg/m 2 ·s, and maintaining the inlet fluid temperature close to that of the ambient fluid, will lead to improved thermal performance for both collectors. However, it is found that the mean gap between the cover and the absorbing plates, thexemissivity of thermal radiation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> the solar insolation, and the inclination of the collectors have negligible effects on the efficiencies of both collectors...|$|R

50|$|Diffusion-type cloud {{chambers}} will {{be discussed}} here. A simple cloud chamber consists of the sealed environment, a warm top plate and a cold <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> It requires a source of liquid alcohol at the warm side of the chamber where the liquid evaporates, forming a vapor that cools as it falls through the gas and condenses on the cold <b>bottom</b> <b>plate.</b> Some sort of ionizing radiation is needed.|$|R
40|$|Water {{infiltration}} in wood frame walls {{leads to}} different water transport phenomena: water runoff and spreading {{of water on}} the sheathing, water infiltration into the insulation, water flow on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and into the bottom plate-sheathing joint, water uptake by sheathing, stud and <b>bottom</b> <b>plate,</b> and leakage of water from the joint sheathing-bottom plate. A laboratory test was designed to quantify the different transport flows. For the water infiltration rates and duration tested, water infiltration into the insulation and leakage are found likely to occur. Water uptake and spreading {{of water on the}} sheathing can lower these flows. OSB and fibreboard show no spreading. The spreading of plywood depends on the surface characteristics and fiber direction. Leakage will more likely occur at high infiltration rates. The amounts of water flowing on the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> and taken up by the <b>bottom</b> <b>plate</b> are more limited. Water infiltrating at the stud and flowing down the stud into the stud-bottom plate joint, will be substantially taken up by the stud in longitudinal direction...|$|R
