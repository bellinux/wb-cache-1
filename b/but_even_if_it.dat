It is a mid-tempo R song written by Carey, Eric Hudson, Priscilla Renea, Taylor Parks and Ilsey Juber.

In response, Carey said that the song was not a reflection of her personal life, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was, she would not publicly confirm who it was written about. Critical response to the song was positive, with many critics praising Carey's vocals and her comical songwriting, specifically {{with regard to the}} reference about Fritos.

2500|$|Only Rosario {{fulfilled}} these requirements, he wrote. Campbell {{countered that}} the expression [...] "southerly", in the treaty, {{was to be}} understood in a general sense, that Rosario Strait did not separate the continent from Vancouver Island, but the San Juan Islands from Lummi Island, Cypress Island, Fidalgo Island, and others, and that navigability was not germane to the issue, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was, Haro Strait was the wider and more direct passage. Finally he challenged Prevost to produce any evidence showing that the treaty framers had intended Rosario Strait. Prevost responded to the challenge by referring to American maps showing the boundary running through Rosario Strait, included one by John C. Frémont, produced for and published by the US government, and another by [...] John B. Preston, Surveyor-General of Oregon in 1852. To the other points, Prevost repeated his statements about Rosario Strait's navigability—the channels between Lummi, Cypress, and Fidalgo islands not being navigable—and that a line through Rosario would be southerly, while one through Haro {{would have to be}} drawn westerly. The two continued to discuss the issue into December 1857, until it was clear what each side's argument was and that neither would be convinced of the other. Prevost made a final offer at the sixth meeting, December 3. He suggested a compromise line through San Juan Channel, which would give the US all the main islands except San Juan Island. This offer was rejected and the commission adjourned, agreeing to report back to their respective governments. Thus ambiguity over the water boundary remained.|$|E
