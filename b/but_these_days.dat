500|$|In 2010, Moore told Wired that DC {{offered him}} {{the rights to}} Watchmen back, if he would agree to prequel and sequel projects. Moore said that [...] "if they said that 10 years ago, when I asked them for that, then yeah it might have worked [...] <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> I don't want Watchmen back. Certainly, I don't want it back under those kinds of terms." [...] DC Comics co-publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee responded: [...] "DC Comics would only revisit these iconic {{characters}} if the creative vision of any proposed new stories matched the quality set by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 25 years ago, and our first discussion on any of this would naturally be with the creators themselves." [...] Following months of rumors about a potential Watchmen follow-up project, in February 2012 DC announced it was publishing seven prequel series under the [...] "Before Watchmen" [...] banner. Among the creators involved are writers J. Michael Straczynski, Brian Azzarello, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein, and artists Lee Bermejo, J. G. Jones, Adam Hughes, Andy Kubert, Joe Kubert, and Amanda Conner. Though Moore has no involvement, Gibbons gave the project his blessing.|$|E
500|$|Michael Tedder of New York {{felt that}} the main story was weak and that the [...] "plot line might have made more sense last year, with Andy trying to take his mind off {{troubles}} with Erin or Robert California by trying to regress to his college days without it working, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> Andy is the boss and has the girl." [...] He did, however, compliment the appearance of Colbert, writing that [...] "it was still nice to see the two Daily Show alums sparring again." [...] He was also complimentary towards the [...] "little tidbits", such as Dwight's subplot. Bonnie Stiergnberg of Paste {{felt that the}} episode was too rushed and that the storylines {{did not have a}} chance to naturally play out. She wrote that, [...] "Each thread provided some interesting character development or set up future storylines, but, crammed together in the same 21 minutes, they made for a slightly disjointed-feeling episode." [...] WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer gave the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it the [...] "first dud of the ninth season". He criticized the story, saying that [...] "the plot's failure [...] the goal of the story was not met by the means the writers chose to employ; there was no sense of grand scope or deep-rooted history, just Andy being petty and refusing {{to let go of the}} past as he's challenged by his old friend." [...] Kratzer called Dwight and Nellie's subplot the [...] "most successful story" [...] in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, {{with most}} critics commending the song's uplifting theme and lyrical content. Immediately after premiering on radio, Sam Lansky of Idolator remarked: [...] "The song is classic Kelly Clarkson, although much less bruised {{than many of}} her heartbreak anthems: The production is clean and sparkly, with a propulsive back-beat and clear vocals." [...] Neon Limelight wrote, [...] "The upbeat song is really less about her career and more about where she is now in her life and her [...] ability to appreciate what really matters." [...] Hardeep Phull of the New York Post gave the song three stars, saying: [...] "this is the euphoric sound of her (Clarkson) looking to the future. The Texan sounds high on life, and it makes [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] {{one of the best}} songs she’s recorded in years — warm, upbeat and boasting a chorus so big, you could land a plane on it." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News also added, [...] "Kelly Clarkson is still pop's sassy [...] "Miss Independent", <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> she's a bit more willing to ask for help. Clarkson's uplifting new single [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] not only pays homage to her strong-willed musical persona, but also to the people who have helped her grow into the woman she is today." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was the pub {{that first}} {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the bar counter being used to serve the beer. Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum {{number of people in the}} shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the [...] "vault", other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere. By the early 1970s there was a tendency to change to one large drinking room and breweries were eager to invest in interior design and theming.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his play}} Peace, Aristophanes {{imagined}} that the tragic poet Sophocles had turned into Simonides: [...] "He may be old and decayed, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> if you paid him enough, he'd go to sea in a sieve." [...] A scholiast, commenting on the passage, wrote: [...] "Simonides {{seems to have been}} the first to introduce money-grabbing into his songs and to write a song for pay" [...] and, as proof of it, quoted a passage from one of Pindar's odes ("For then the Muse was not yet fond of profit nor mercenary"), which he interpreted as covert criticism of Simonides. The same scholiast related a popular story that the poet kept two boxes, one empty and the other full - the empty one being where he kept favours, the full one being where he kept his money. According to Athenaeus, when Simonides was at Hieron's court in Syracuse, he used to sell most of the daily provisions that he received from the tyrant, justifying himself thus: [...] "So that all may see Hieron's magnificence and my moderation." [...] Aristotle reported that the wife of Hieron once asked Simonides whether it was better to be wealthy or wise, to which he apparently replied: [...] "Wealthy; for I see the wise spending their days at the doors of the wealthy." [...] According to an anecdote recorded on a papyrus, dating to around 250 BC, Hieron once asked the poet if everything grows old: [...] "Yes," [...] Simonides answered, [...] "all except money-making; and kind deeds age most quickly of all." [...] He once rejected a small fee to compose a victory ode for the winner of a mule race (it was not a prestigious event) but, according to Aristotle, changed his mind when the fee was increased, resulting in this magniloquent opening: [...] "Greetings, daughters of storm-footed horses!" [...] In a quote recorded by Plutarch, he once complained that old age had robbed him of every pleasure but making money. [...] All these amusing anecdotes might simply reflect {{the fact that he was}} the first poet to charge fees for his services—generosity is glimpsed in his payment for an inscription on a friend's epitaph, as recorded by Herodotus. Herodotus also mentions an earlier poet Arion, who had amassed a fortune on a visit to Italy and Sicily, so maybe Simonides wasn't the first professional poet, as claimed by the Greeks themselves.|$|E

6000|$|All this {{elaboration}} of warfare lengthens the scale between theoretical efficiency and absolute unpreparedness. There {{was a time}} when any tribe that had men and spears was ready for war, and any tribe that had some cunning or emotion at command might hope to discount any little disparity in numbers between itself and its neighbour. Luck and stubbornness and the incalculable counted for much; it was half the battle not to know you were beaten, and it is so still. Even to-day, a great nation, it seems, may still make its army the plaything of its gentlefolk, abandon important military appointments to feminine intrigue, and trust cheerfully to the homesickness and essential modesty of its influential people, and the simpler patriotism of its colonial dependencies when it comes at last to the bloody and wearisome business of [...] "muddling through." [...] <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> of the happy-go-lucky optimist are near their end. War is being drawn into the field of the exact sciences. Every additional weapon, every new complication of the art of war, intensifies the need of deliberate preparation, and darkens the outlook of a nation of amateurs. Warfare in the future, on sea or land alike, will be much more one-sided than it has ever been in the past, much more of a foregone conclusion. Save for national lunacy, it will be brought about by the side that will win, and because that side knows that it will win. More and more it will have the quality of surprise, of pitiless revelation. Instead of the seesaw, the bickering interchange of battles of the old time, will come swiftly and amazingly blow, and blow, and blow, no pause, no time for recovery, disasters cumulative and irreparable.|$|E
