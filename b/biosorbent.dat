40|$|The {{performances}} of nine <b>biosorbents</b> derived from dead fungal biomass were investigated {{for their ability}} to remove Reactive Black 5 from aqueous solution. The biosorption data for removal of Reactive Black 5 were readily modeled using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Kinetic analysis based on both pseudo-second-order and Weber-Morris models indicated intraparticle diffusion was the rate limiting step for biosorption of Reactive Black 5 on to the <b>biosorbents.</b> Sorption capacities of the <b>biosorbents</b> were not correlated with the initial biosorption rates. Sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting biosorption examined by an artificial neural network model showed that pH was the most important parameter, explaining 22 %, followed by nitrogen content of <b>biosorbents</b> (16 %), initial dye concentration (15 %) and carbon content of <b>biosorbents</b> (10 %). The biosorption capacities were not proportional to surface areas of the sorbents, but were instead influenced by their chemical element composition. The main functional groups contributing to dye sorption were amine, carboxylic, and alcohol moieties.

30|$|Tests at {{different}} solution temperatures (15, 30, 45, and 60  °C) were {{performed with the}} Cd 2 + initial concentration the highest removal percentages for the three biosorbents (80  mg L− 1 for <b>biosorbent</b> C, 120  mg L− 1 for <b>biosorbent</b> E, and 80  mg L− 1 for <b>biosorbent</b> E + T). During this stage, the solutions’ pH (5.5), <b>biosorbent</b> mass (0.4  g), stirring speed (200  rpm), and contact time between <b>biosorbent</b> and solution (60  min) were kept constant.|$|E
30|$|The <b>biosorbent</b> dosage is an {{important}} parameter because this determines the capacity of a <b>biosorbent</b> for a given initial concentration. The biosorption efficiency for Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II) and pb(II) ions {{as a function of}} <b>biosorbent</b> dosage was investigated. The percentage of the metal biosorption steeply increases with the <b>biosorbent</b> loading up to 0.5  g/ 0.1  L. This result {{can be explained by the}} fact that the biosorption sites remain unsaturated during the biosorption reaction, whereas the number of sites available for biosorption site increases by increasing the <b>biosorbent</b> dose. The maximum biosorption was attained at <b>biosorbent</b> dosage, 0.5  g/ 0.1 L. Therefore, the optimum <b>biosorbent</b> dosage was taken as 0.5  g/ 0.1 L for further experiments. This can be explained by when the <b>biosorbent</b> ratio is small, the active sites for binding metal ions on the surface of Sjp is less, so the biosorption efficiency is low. As the <b>biosorbent</b> dose increased, more active sites to bind metal ions, thus it results an increase in the biosorption efficiency until saturation.|$|E

Two types of <b>biosorbents</b> containing a marine microalga, Heterosigma akashiwo (Hada) Hada or a purple non-sulfur bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides were prepared. The microorganisms inactivated by steam sterilization were immobilized in casein floc and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde. In the present immobilizing method, we obtained the <b>biosorbents</b> comprising as much as 67 % of microorganism on a dry-weight basis. Simple metal binding models were applied to explain the adsorption mechanism of bivalent metal ions to the <b>biosorbents.</b> The results showed that casein acted as both the immobilizing material and the adsorbent material. The adsorption of bivalent metal ions to the <b>biosorbents</b> was due to bidentate binding to the acidic sites on casein and monodentate binding to the acidic sites on microorganisms.

40|$|Biosorption with macroalgae is a {{promising}} {{technology for the}} bioremediation of industrial effluents. However, {{the vast majority of}} research has been conducted on simple mock effluents with little data available on the performance of <b>biosorbents</b> in complex effluents. Here we evaluate the efficacy of dried biomass, biochar, and Fe-treated biomass and biochar to remediate 21 elements from a real-world industrial effluent from a coal-fired power station. The <b>biosorbents</b> were produced from the freshwater macroalga Oedogonium sp. (Chlorophyta) that is native to the industrial site from which the effluent was sourced, and which has been intensively cultivated to provide a feed stock for <b>biosorbents.</b> The effect of pH and exposure time on sorption was also assessed. These <b>biosorbents</b> showed specificity for different suites of elements, primarily differentiated by ionic charge. Overall, biochar and Fe-biochar were more successful <b>biosorbents</b> than their biomass counterparts. Fe-biochar adsorbed metalloids (As, Mo, and Se) at rates independent of effluent pH, while untreated biochar removed metals (Al, Cd, Ni and Zn) at rates dependent on pH.

The efficiency of the <b>biosorbents</b> is tested for the determination of malathion using batch experiments under controlled conditions as a function of pH, contact time, initial malation concentration and the optimization amount of <b>biosorbents.</b> The quantification of malathion in aqueous samples, before and after equilibration with <b>biosorbents</b> is carried out by existing spectrophotometric method based on the oxidation of malathion with excess N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and Rhodamine B at (?max = 550 nm) is used for the unconsumed NBS.

30|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted to investigate the effect of dosage of both natural and treated biosorbents on the biosorption of cadmium and zinc at five different dosages i.e. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5  g, keeping contact time 60  min, pH 4, initial metal ion concentration 10  mg/L and agitation speed 150  rpm. It was found that in case of Cd biosorption, as the <b>biosorbent</b> dosage increases from 0.1 to 0.3  g, a gradual increase in the biosorption efficiency occurs followed by {{a significant increase in}} metal uptake at 0.5  g dose i.e. 71.9 %; further increase in the quantity of <b>biosorbent</b> leads to consistent metal removal with a minor change, as a result of which equilibrium is established (Fig.  2). So, 0.5  g of natural <b>biosorbent</b> was found to be sufficient for removing a considerable quantity of Cd. Similarly, when acid treated <b>biosorbent</b> was used, the same dose removed 95.3 % of cadmium and equilibrium is accomplished since further increase in <b>biosorbent</b> dosage resulted in a negligible change in the metal uptake. For zinc biosorption, the figure shows that 1  g each of natural and acid treated <b>biosorbent</b> was enough to remove 76.7 and 91.1 % Zn, respectively.

40|$|Pleurotus ostreatus spent {{mushroom}} substrate compost (PSMC) is {{an agricultural}} waste from mushroom cultivation farms. The potential of PSMC as <b>biosorbent</b> for heavy metal biosorption {{in batch mode}} was explored in this study. The optimization and evaluation of washing pretreatment in <b>biosorbent</b> preparation, advanced characterisation of <b>biosorbent,</b> optimization of biosorption, evaluation of existing models, application of <b>biosorbent</b> and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling were investigated. Parameters of 20 g/L <b>biosorbent</b> concentration, two hours immersion time and three cycles of washing pre-treatment were determined as the optimized washing pretreatment conditions in <b>biosorbent</b> preparation. Besides effectively remove contaminants, this new approach not only increased heavy metal biosorption efficiency but also exhibited good repeatability and reproducibility for Ni(II) biosorption efficiency and different batches <b>biosorbent</b> respectively. Results from advanced characterization indicated that PSMC <b>biosorbent</b> has surface area of 5. 5544 x 10 - 1 m 2 /g. The basic component of PSMC is lignocelluloses while minor components are chitin and protein. Carboxyl, hydroxyl and amide functional groups of these components {{were involved in the}} heavy metal biosorption process. Heavy metal biosorption process is complex and involved several simultaneous mechanisms including ion exchange, chemisorptions and complexation. An adopted approach using the experimental design of TORCHIA 13 C ssNMR was applied in <b>biosorbent</b> advanced characterisation analysis. It has ascertained that complexation occurred through lignin-Pb(II) complexes. In order to shorten the time to obtain reliable results and reduced the usage of <b>biosorbent,</b> another adopted approach using half saturation constant concentration was established for optimization of heavy metal biosorption. The half saturation constant <b>biosorbent</b> was found to be at 0. 08 g for Pb(II) and 0. 7 g for both Cu(II) and Ni(II). In single, bi- and multi-heavy metal iii biosorption, the selectivity of <b>biosorbent</b> followed the order of Pb(II), Ni(II) and finally Cu(II). This observation corresponded to the descending order of heavy metal electronegativity. Experimental data are well fitted to Langmuir isotherm, pseudo second-order kinetic and thermodynamic models (r 2 > 0. 88). These data fittings indicate that heavy metal biosorption is a monolayer, not uni-molecular and spontaneous exothermic reaction. Chemisorptions act as rate limiting step in heavy metal biosorption. For application of <b>biosorbent</b> in treatment of automobile wastewater containing Ni(II), a lower biosorption efficiency was observed when compared to single heavy metal solution due to competition of cations and protons for the similar binding sites. In addition, the experiments were not operated under optimised conditions. For heavy metals recovery study, a high recovery of heavy metal from <b>biosorbent</b> about 90...|$|E

Modern design of utilization of these proteins in vitro was studied and the prospects of the use of these microorganisms for biosorption of heavy metal ions and biometallurgy. For the first time it was possible to obtain the content of iron ions below the limit allows by the standart in wastewater treatment of Slavutych city (Kyivska region) from iron ions using magnetically-labeled <b>biosorbent</b> based on the yeast S. cerevisiae...|$|E
30|$|The {{pore size}} of algal {{biosorbents}} was 3 – 9 micrometre, and the radii of cadmium ion was 95  pm (Pauling 1960).The smaller ionic radii of cadmium ion and larger pore size of algal <b>biosorbent</b> facilitate higher adsorption. Surface area of <b>biosorbent</b> {{plays an important}} role in the adsorption process. The average surface area of <b>biosorbent</b> was estimated about 12  m 2 /g which is very much favourable for the sorption of heavy metals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Biosorbents</b> for remediating aquatic {{environmental}} media polluted with hazardous {{heavy metals}} and metalloids such as Pb(II), Cr(VI), Sb(III and V), and As(III and V) were prepared from lignin waste, orange and apple juice residues, seaweed and persimmon and grape wastes using simple and cheap methods. A lignophenol gel such as lignocatechol gel was prepared by immobilizing the catechol functional groups onto lignin from sawdust, while lignosulfonate gel was prepared directly from waste liquor generated during pulp production. These gels effectively removed Pb(II). Orange and apple juice residues, which {{are rich in}} pectic acid, were easily converted using alkali (e. g., calcium hydroxide) into <b>biosorbents</b> that effectively removed Pb(II). These materials also effectively removed Sb(III and V) and As(III and V) when these were preloaded with multi-valent metal ions such as Zr(IV) and Fe(III). Similar <b>biosorbents</b> were prepared from seaweed waste, which is rich in alginic acid. Other <b>biosorbents,</b> which effectively removed Cr(VI), were prepared by simply treating persimmon and grape wastes with concentrated sulfuric acid...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{industrial}} effluents contain toxic metals {{that must}} be removed. Removal can be accomplished with biosorption techniques. It is an alternative to using man-made ion-exchange resins, which cost ten times more than <b>biosorbents.</b> The cost is so much less, because the <b>biosorbents</b> used are often waste from farms or they are very easy to regenerate, {{as is the case}} with seaweed and other unharvested biomass.|$|R

The process can be reversed to collect a highly concentrated solution of metal contaminants. The <b>biosorbents</b> can then be re-used or discarded and replaced.|$|R

The effect of metal concentration, <b>biosorbent</b> concentration, temperature and pH on lead adsorption were investigated. The maximum uptake of lead by Aspergillus flavus cells was 144. 5 mg lead/g dry cell. The highest uptake of lead by this <b>biosorbent</b> was occurred at pH 4 and temperature 40 0 C...|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} <b>biosorbent</b> dosage on the biosorption of phenol and cyanide was {{determined}} {{within the range}} of <b>biosorbent</b> dose 5 – 60  g/L and the results are characterized in Fig.  3 b. It is identified that the rise in <b>biosorbent</b> concentration caused in an increase in percent biosorption of phenol and cyanide due to the more availability of the surface area or transferable active sites, but reduced the biosorption due to the incomplete accumulation or overlapping of <b>biosorbent,</b> which outcomes in a reduction in active surface area for the biosorption. It can be understood from Fig.  3 b that removal efficiency, increased with increasing <b>biosorbent</b> dose for both phenol and cyanide, but after a definite dosage, the removal efficiency was not increased considerably (Mondal et al. 2008). Thus, the optimum amounts of CSAC dose for additional biosorption experiments were designated as 30  g/L for both phenol and cyanide.|$|E
40|$|The used of nonliving {{aquatic plants}} {{for the removal}} of toxic heavy metals as <b>biosorbent</b> has been study recently. The {{objective}} {{of this study is to}} investigate the capability of Eichhornia crassipes as the <b>biosorbent</b> in removal of ferrum from aqueous solution in laboratory scale. <b>Biosorbent</b> dosage, contact time, temperature and pH were chose as the parameters for this study. The experiment was carried out in conical flask with initial concentration of ferrum solution was 10 mg/L and then agitated in orbital shaker at 175 rpm. HACH spectrophotometer was used to measure the final concentration of the ferrum solution. Increasing the <b>biosorbent</b> dosage result more surface area for ferrum ions to bind with functional groups exist in <b>biosorbent.</b> The removal of ferrum increased in early stage and the optimum contact time was 60 minutes. Prolonged the contact time in this study, do not give better result for removal of ferrum. Optimum temperature was at 25 oC and removal of ferrum decreased by increasing the temperature because it can damage the binding site in <b>biosorbent.</b> Competition with H+ will occur at acidic condition and at alkaline condition cause the precipitation of ferrum. Optimum removal of ferrum was achieved at pH 6. As the conclusion, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is suitable for development of efficient <b>biosorbent</b> {{for the removal of}} ferrum from wastewater stream...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of <b>biosorbents</b> and biochars from various biowastes (such as the agricultural and food industries and algal and fungal biomass) has received considerable attention {{because of their}} potential use in the removal and recovery of elements, such as precious metals and heavy metals from water and wastewater. Recovery of these metals from their aqueous solutions has emerged as an exciting area of research {{as a result of}} increasing or fluctuating prices of metals (eg, precious metals), limited availability of their deposits, and the ever-increasing demand and time- and energy-consuming processes needed to mine metal deposits. This review will summarize the various sources of metals, the available biowastes of the agricultural and food industries, and preparation methods for <b>biosorbents</b> and biochars from biowastes. We will focus on metal and heavy metal removal and recovery from waste and wastewater, methods for metal recovery, pretreatment and modification of <b>biosorbents</b> and biochars for enhanced metal sequestration, and strategies to provide stability to <b>biosorbents</b> and biochars to maximize resource recovery. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Samples {{of various}} Sargassum species were {{collected}} in the Hong Kong marine environment and used for studies on biosorption of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to determine the removal capacity and removal efficiency of the <b>biosorbents.</b> The DEHP removal ability was similar among beached seaweed and three freshly collected Sargassum species. Different physico-chemical factors were evaluated {{in order to enhance}} the performance of the <b>biosorbents.</b> Under optimized conditions (25 mg biomass, initial pH 4, 25 degreesC, 40 mg L- 1 DEHP), the mean removal capacity of beached seaweed and Sargassum siliquastrum was 5. 68 and 6. 54 mg g(- 1), respectively. Examination of the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms showed that the biosorption phenomenon by these <b>biosorbents</b> could well be described by these models. Desorption of DEHP was also assessed with methanol, which showed the most satisfactory desorbing ability. Further study in multiple adsorption-desorption of DEHP by the <b>biosorbents</b> demonstrated the reusability of both beached seaweed and S. siliquastrum for biosorption of DEHP...|$|R
