5|$|The {{addition}} of a multiplayer mode to Jedi Knight was met positively, but questions arose to why {{there are so few}} multiplayer maps and why single-player maps cannot be used in the multiplayer mode.

Ignoring the protestations of his wife, Black leaves to {{investigate}} the parkland where one of the earlier bodies was uncovered. A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|Jains believe Mahavira {{attained}} omniscience {{at the age}} of 42, under a Sala tree on {{the banks}} of River Rijupalika near Jrimbhikagrama. He preached, then died {{at the age of}} 72. The Jain Śvētāmbara tradition believes his death occurred in 527 BC, while the Digambara Jain tradition <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> happened in 510 BC. His jiva (soul) is believed in all Jain traditions to be in Siddhashila (abode of the liberated souls).|$|E
5|$|John {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as the despot of Valona in 1350 and his documented {{presence in the}} Albanian lands only dates to 1349. However, he was most likely bestowed the title as early as 1345 or 1346, when Stephen Dušan was proclaimed Emperor (Tsar). American scholar John Fine <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> happened immediately after Stephen Dušan's coronation in 1346. Along with Stephen Dušan's half-brother, Simeon Uroš, and Jovan Oliver, John {{was one of three}} people to bear that title under Stephen Dušan.|$|E

While Tywin chastises Jaime for causing the recent troubles with the Starks, he nevertheless <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> war is the perfect opportunity for the Lannisters {{to set up a}} dynasty as the new rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Tywin gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, the seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion.|$|E
5|$|Sladden is {{overcome}} {{by a powerful}} telekinetic force emanating from the alien craft and flees to the sanctuary of a church. Sladden tells Quatermass he saw a vision of hordes of the alien creatures. Quatermass <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> is a race memory. Seeking proof, he returns to Hobbs End, bringing a machine Roney {{has been working on}} which taps into the primeval psyche. While trying to replicate the circumstances under which Sladden was affected, he notices that Judd has fallen under its influence. Using Roney's machine, he is able to record her thoughts.|$|E
5|$|According to {{an article}} in the New Rochelle Pioneer the film was {{produced}} in New Rochelle and according to a news release the film was shot in the mountains during real blizzard weather. Bowers <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> film was shot during the winter and kept for its later June release. The winter of 1909 through 1910 contained two notable snow events that might have possibly been used in the production. A major snow storm from December 25 to December 26, 1909, would make its way through New York City with snow total of about 10 inches and wind gusts up to 58mph. A second major snow event occurred three weeks later, on January 14 through 15, 1910, with New York City getting 15 inches of snow. Another lesser snow event, deemed a blizzard in the press, was recorded in early February.|$|E

5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E
5|$|The mid-ground shows a crowd scene {{above the}} group of mourners, {{separated}} by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground {{are reflected in the}} shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on the man to his right wearing a red turban. Smith <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground. Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.|$|E
5|$|Believing Joshua {{will attempt}} another {{break-in}} but will avoid putting innocents in danger, Olivia has Fringe Division statistician Astrid identify three remotely located banks {{and decides to}} investigate them. Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered the bank to be trapped in the amber. Joshua <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> {{to be the only}} way to force the Fringe team to end their investigation. Matthew escapes the quarantine while Fringe agents Charlie and Lincoln rescue Olivia in time before the amber sets in. Olivia returns to Matthew the next day and confirms the case is closed, but not before collecting a skin sample that, should she ever need it, conclusively proves that it was Matthew in the amber before.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the {{assisted}} suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests {{it was the right thing}} to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye <b>believes</b> <b>this</b> cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. Piquet finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|E

Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an {{employee}} who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer.
