50|$|A {{controversial}} World <b>Bank</b> <b>report</b> (see The East Asian Miracle 1993) credited neoliberal {{policies with}} {{the responsibility for the}} boom, including maintenance of export-led regimes, low taxes, and minimal welfare states; institutional analysis also states some state intervention was involved. However, many have argued that industrial policy had a much greater influence than the World <b>Bank</b> <b>report</b> suggested. The World <b>Bank</b> <b>report</b> itself acknowledged benefits from policies of the repression of the financial sector, such as state-imposed below-market interest rates for loans to specific exporting industries. Other important aspects include major government investments in education, non-democratic and relatively authoritarian political systems {{during the early years of}} development, high levels of U.S. bond holdings, and high public and private savings rates.|$|R

This paper reviews short-comings in the research base of the World <b>Bank</b> <b>Report</b> on education in sub-Saharan Africa, and highlights their implications for the possible uptake of Bank recommendations by African governments. It argues that the <b>Bank</b> <b>Report</b> reflects significant research gaps stemming {{from a lack of}} complementarity; selective inattention to certain types of information and knowledge; sweeping diplomatically sensitive categories of knowledge under the carpet; and a historical neglect of certain areas of research. Against this background the paper analyses some issues which need to be resolved {{to pave the way for}} meaningful adoption of Bank recommendations. These precursors include dilemmas relating to national ideology, liberalization and a growing marginalization of public education, as well as responses to changing values and social ethics and the need for initiative and creativity...|$|R
