50|$|Different accents {{within a}} given {{language}} may have their own characteristic <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> resulting in one accent being perceived as, e.g., more 'nasal', 'velarized' or 'guttural' than another. According to Cruttenden, “The articulatory setting of a language or dialect may differ from GB British. So some languages like Spanish may {{have a tendency to}} hold the tongue more forward in the mouth, while others like Russian may have a tendency to hold it further back in the mouth. Nasalization may be characteristic of many speakers of American English, while denasal voice … is frequently said to occur in Liverpool". A more detailed exposition can be read in Gili Gaya (1956).Non-native speakers typically find the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> one of the greatest challenges in acquiring a foreign language's pronunciation. Speaking with the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> of their own native language results in a foreign accent, even if the individual sounds of the target language are produced correctly. See Messum (2010).|$|E
5000|$|In {{phonetics}} the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> is {{the default}} position or standard settings of a speaker's organs of articulation {{when ready to}} speak. An alternative term is articulatory setting.Different languages each have their own <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> which means that native speakers will share a certain position of tongue, lips, jaw, possibly even uvula or larynx, when preparing to speak. These standard settings enable them to produce the sounds and prosody of their native language more efficiently. Honikman suggests thinking of {{it in terms of}} having a “gear” for English, another for French, and so on depending on which language is being learned; in the classroom, when working on pronunciation, the first thing the learner must do is to think themselves into the right gear before starting on pronunciation exercises. Jenner (2001) gives a detailed account of how this idea arose and how Honikman has been credited with its invention despite a considerable history of prior study.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>Basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> {{is used in}} a {{slightly}} different sense to refer to a hypothesized articulatory “baseline” which is neutral in respect of individual vowels and consonants. This is done in the phonetic framework section of Chomsky and Halle (1968) for the purposes of explaining various distinctive features in terms of their deviation from the neutral position.; more recently, Odden has written “ …some features are characterized in terms of the ‘neutral position’ which is a configuration that the vocal tract is assumed to have immediately prior to speaking. The neutral position, approximately that of the vowel ɛ, defines relative movement of the tongue” It is not clear if this should be taken to refer only to English.|$|E

The experimental conditions vary the spectrum and level of noise distorting the speech in the training and test set. The perceptually inspired features generally perform better when there is a mismatch between the training and test noise spectrum and level, but worse when the test and training noises match. 1...|$|R

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The final {{objective}} of this study involves the acquisition of received French pronunciation {{on the part of}} native speakers of siSwati. However, considering the sole aspect of phoneticophonological competence in the context of foreign language learning needs to be justified. Hence, we explain which role phonology plays in contemporary linguistics (chapter I). Further, we commit ourselves in chapter II to accommodating foreign language phonology in the framework of contrastive linguistics. This results in testing the development of foreign language pronunciation against the contrastive analysis hypothesis. To support this, we evaluate the degree to which L 2 learners inherit the well-established phonological representation of Ll in their attempt to communicate in a foreign language. Secondly, we are convinced that it is needful to consider the way in which our learners decode phonological intelligibility into observable phonetic facts. This leads us to analyse the physioacoustic "surface" features of our learners' <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Accordingly, we justify why the analysis and comparison of the phonological systems involved are to be complemented by experimental analyses of the recorded speech data. The formant tracking of the vowels and selected spectrographic analyses of the consonants in chapters IV, V and VI allow us to show to what extent the phonological abstract of the languages involved are decoded differently according to the respective bases of articulation. To achieve this, we rely on adequate experimental analyses and 'statistical tests. The first Part of chapter V identifies and compares the vowel qualities of the two languages by means of their first two formants, while the second part investigates the spectrographic differences between the siSwati and French consonant charts. To become familiar with the physio-acoustic characteristics of the target language, we introduce the French articulatory setting in chapter VII. Turning to the final aim of our contrastive and corrective undertaking, we need to select the most beneficial method of diagnosing the characteristics of our learners' foreign accent. Moreover, we design corrective strategies that will help our learners attain faithful speech performance in the targetlanguage community. Therefore, chapter III assesses {{the extent to which the}} verbo-tonal method of corrective phonetics can be instrumental in overcoming siSwati-induced French. Further, the error analysis of the recorded interlanguage discourse results in designing ad hoc corrective strategies to be implemented (chapter VIII) ...|$|E

40|$|Investigations of metaphorical meaning {{constitution}} and meaning (in-) variance have revealed {{the significance of}} semantic and semiotic domains and the contexts within which they function as basis for the grounding of metaphorical meaning. In this article some of the current views concerning the grounding of metaphorical meaning in experience and embodiment are explored. My provisional agreement with Lakoff, Johnson and others about the “conceptual” nature of metaphor rests on an important caveat, viz. that this bodily based conceptual structure which lies at the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> linguistic <b>articulations</b> <b>of</b> metaphor, is grounded in a deeper ontic structure {{of the world and}} of human experience. It is the “metaphorical” (actually “analogical”) ontological structure of this grounding that is of interest for the line of argumentation followed in this article. Because Johnson, Lakoff and other’s proposal to ground metaphorical meaning in embodiment and neural processes is open to being construed as subjectivist and materialist, I shall attempt to articulate the contours of an alternative theory of conceptual metaphor, meaning and embodiment which counteracts these possibilities. This theory grounds metaphorical meaning and meaning change in an ontological and anthropological framework which recognises the presence and conditioning functioning of radially ordered structures for reality. These categorisations in which humankind, human knowledge and reality participate, condition and constrain (ground) analogical and metaphorical meaning transfer, cross-domain mappings, and blends in cognition and in language, provide the basis for the analogical concepts found in these disciplines...|$|R

40|$|Speech sounds can be {{classified}} on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> their underlying articulators or on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> the acoustic characteristics resulting from particular articulatory positions. Research in speech perception suggests that distinctive features are based on both articulatory and acoustic information. In recent years, neuroelectric and neuromagnetic investigations provided evidence for the brain’s early sensitivity to distinctive features and their acoustic consequences, particularly for place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> distinctions.
