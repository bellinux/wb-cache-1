5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the {{subsequent}} development of the Trafford Park industrial estate {{in the north of}} the town– the first planned industrial estate in the world– had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many {{opposition}} figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe {{was sentenced to death}} in absentia and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.|$|E

5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence {{of money in the}} film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from the endeavor led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, eight percent of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area {{with the rest of the}} United States, established a truly national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region.|$|E
5|$|The pink whipray is {{valuable}} to ecotourism at {{sites in the}} Maldives, French Polynesia, and elsewhere; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of food. The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray ecotourism by banning all exports of ray products in 1995. In 2005, stingray ecotourism at Moorea brought in over €500,000. However, a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism {{in the form of}} bite and impact injuries, stemming from artificially high ray density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pink whipray as Vulnerable overall. Although the species has a wide distribution that includes refuge regions with few conservation threats such as the population off northern Australia. By contrast the Southeast Asian population is heavily fished.|$|E

25|$|A {{building}} boom in South Brooklyn started in about 1902 and 1903. Thousands of people started {{coming to the}} area from Manhattan and from other places. In 1905 and 1906 realty values increased by about 100 percent, and land values increased. This growth was spurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of improved transportation access.

25|$|Bakunin {{thought that}} {{religion}} originated {{from the human}} ability for abstract thinking and fantasizing. According to Bakunin, religion is sustained by indoctrination and conformism. Another factor in the survival of religion is the existence of poverty, suffering and exploitation in real life, from which religion promises the salvation in the afterlife. Oppressors take advantage from religion, according to Bakunin, because many religious people reconcile themselves with injustice on earth <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of happiness in heaven.|$|E

25|$|The {{discipline}} {{and organization of}} a Roman legion made it a superb fighting unit. The Romans preferred infantry to cavalry because infantry could be trained to retain the formation in combat, while cavalry tended to scatter when faced with opposition. While a barbarian army could be raised and inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of plunder, the legions required a central government and taxation to pay for salaries, constant training, equipment, and food. The decline in agricultural and economic activity reduced the empire's taxable income and thus its ability to maintain a professional army to defend itself from external threats.|$|E

The first to file a land patent was Micheal Pfeiffer on January 20, 1883, who claimed two sections of land he already resided on near and immediately north of the mouth of Sycamore Canyon.

The marriage probably took place in 1283, when Jeanne was still of child-bearing age. Her dowry consisted of the lands held by the sire of Beaujeu in Bugey and Valromey, lands which lay in an area of Savoyard expansion between the Rhône and the Ain.|$|E

In August 1876, Star and Bullock, attracted to Deadwood <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>promise</b> of a great deal of business stemming from the gold rush, purchased a lot there from Al Swearengen and Henry Beaman. They opened the Office of Star and Bullock, Auctioneers and Commission Merchants.
