25|$|There is {{no single}} yield curve {{describing}} the cost of money for everybody. The {{most important factor in}} determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness. The yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.|$|E

Especially in countries where budget deficits and sovereign debts have increased sharply, a crisis of confidence has emerged with the widening of <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> spreads and risk insurance on CDS between these countries and other EU member states, most importantly Germany.

Looking at short-term government bonds with a maturity of {{less than one year}} the list of beneficiaries also includes Belgium and France. While Switzerland (and Denmark) equally benefited from lower interest rates, the crisis also harmed its export sector due to a substantial influx of foreign capital and the resulting rise of the Swiss franc. In September 2011 the Swiss National Bank surprised currency traders by pledging that [...] "it will no longer tolerate a euro-franc exchange rate below the minimum rate of 1.20 francs", effectively weakening the Swiss franc.

2500|$|The example {{given in}} {{the table at the}} right is known as a LIBOR curve because it is {{constructed}} using either LIBOR rates or swap rates. [...] A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks.

[...] The spread between the LIBOR or swap rate and the government <b>bond</b> <b>yield,</b> usually positive, meaning private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing, of similar maturity is a measure of risk tolerance of the lenders.

2500|$|Under unusual circumstances, {{long-term}} {{investors will}} settle for lower yields now {{if they think}} the economy will slow or even decline in the future. Campbell R. Harvey's 1986 dissertation showed that an inverted yield curve accurately forecasts U.S. recessions. An inverted curve has indicated a worsening economic situation in the future 7 times since 1970. The New York Federal Reserve regards it as a valuable forecasting tool in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. In addition to potentially signaling an economic decline, inverted yield curves also imply that the market believes inflation will remain low. This is because, {{even if there is}} a recession, a low <b>bond</b> <b>yield</b> will still be offset by low inflation. However, technical factors, such as a flight to quality or global economic or currency situations, may cause an increase in demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} three ECB policies involving {{government bond}} purchases, the Securities Markets Programme (SMP), the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), and the 3 -year Long-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) using an event-study approach. Focusing on Italy, Spain and Portugal, {{we find that}} the policies reduced sovereign <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> dramatically. We decompose the policy impact on sovereign yields into effects via default risk, market segmentation of sovereign bonds and redenomination risk. We find that: (a) Default risk and sovereign bond segmentation effects were the dominant channels through which the SMP and the OMT affected sovereign <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> of Italy and Spain; (b) Redenomination risk may have been present at times and {{it may have been a}} third policy channel for the SMP and OMT in the case of Spain and Portugal, but not for Italy. (c) The effects of the LTROs on sovereign yields were generally small except for Spain for which they appear to have reduced sovereign <b>bond</b> <b>yields</b> via the market segmentation channel.
