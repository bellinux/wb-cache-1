5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost {{double that of}} the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west <b>block</b> <b>is</b> for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² of office space with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The <b>block</b> <b>is</b> irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E
50|$|In Amsterdam, <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> {{installed}} before crosswalks, at medians and on tram and subway platforms. Both warning {{blocks and}} directional <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> installed {{according to the}} same rules as in Japan. Netherlands-specific <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> used in addition to blocks configured like those in Japan. Most directional <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> white or grey while warning <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> yellow or grey. Where directional and warning <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> used together {{the color of the}} <b>blocks</b> <b>is</b> often not uniform. Netherlands-specific blocks include some with thin recessed lines. With very little surface irregularity, such <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> extremely difficult to detect with the feet or a white cane. Grooves carved into the pavement at subway station platforms are also difficult for people with impaired vision to recognize.|$|R

5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each <b>block</b> <b>is</b> updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E
5|$|The kitchen {{block was}} {{added in the}} late 15th century or early 16th century and has no direct {{connection}} {{with the rest of}} the house.

The solar separated from the hall by a screens passage.|$|E
5|$|The library <b>block</b> <b>is</b> {{predominantly}} clad in glass, {{fitted with}} horizontal fins, on its frontage {{with the main}} road. The alfresco café had a street frontage and was spread into the shared forecourt.

5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} <b>block</b> <b>is</b> {{on the same}} axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E
5|$|The {{west side}} (numbers 14–18 and 18A, 19 and 20) was {{designed}} by John Pinch the younger in 1830 and differs from Wood's original design as the central <b>block</b> <b>is</b> in Neo-Grecian style. The Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) now occupies 16–18. The south side (numbers 5–13) was originally left open, but is now occupied by a hotel.

5|$|A {{district}} {{is governed by}} a District Collector, who is better known as a District Magistrate (DM) {{in the state of}} West Bengal. A DM is an officer from either Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or West Bengal Civil Service (WBCS), and is appointed by the State Government of West Bengal. Each {{district is}} divided into subdivisions, except the Kolkata district, which contains urban area only, administered by Kolkata Municipal Corporation. A subdivision is governed by a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), better known as a Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO). Other than urban units such as town municipalities, a subdivision contains 'community development blocks' (also known as CD blocks or blocks). A block consists of urban units such as census towns and rural units called gram panchayats. A <b>block</b> <b>is</b> administered by a Block Development Officer (BDO), who is appointed by the Government of West Bengal.|$|E
5|$|Chestnut Street is also largely residential. The 200 {{block of}} West Chestnut {{features}} old supports for the Big Four Bridge and the 100 block of West Chestnut holds the Grisamore House, which was separately {{placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983. On East Chestnut, the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 <b>block</b> <b>is</b> filled with bungalows. St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, a Spanish-flavored neo-Baroque structure with a Moorish-styled rectory, {{is located on the}} 300 block of East Chestnut.

They were the first tower <b>blocks</b> to <b>be</b> built in Sheffield and were constructed by a London firm because no Sheffield contractor felt confident to take on the project. One of the <b>blocks</b> <b>was</b> demolished in the mid 1990s after it was found that it had been built on a fault and was unsafe. The two remaining <b>blocks</b> <b>were</b> refurbished and re-clad in 1998. Six more tower <b>blocks</b> <b>were</b> built at Callow Mount, Drive and Place in 1962 at the northern end of Gleadless Valley close to Newfield Green and these too were re-clad and modernised in the late 1990s.|$|R

5|$|Posing as a nurse, Eva wheels Diabolik past {{groups of}} people. He sneaks into the morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the <b>block</b> <b>is</b> loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on the tracks and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes when the train arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it and return it to their hideout.|$|E
