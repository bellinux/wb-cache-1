5|$|The bullpens, reconfigured {{between the}} 2014 and 2015 seasons, are raised above the playing field, which allows fans to see {{pitchers}} warming up. Both bullpens are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the Indians' bullpen {{closer to the}} field. Like the majority of ballparks, the Indians' dugout is along the third <b>base</b> <b>line</b> and the visitors' dugout is located along the first <b>base</b> <b>line.</b> When the ballpark was built it contained 121 luxury boxes. A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 2015 seasons removed six of them for a new total of 115, the second most in Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first <b>base</b> <b>line</b> in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
5|$|Culbreth was the first-base umpire for Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza's no-hitter {{against the}} Detroit Tigers on July 26, 2010. In the third inning, Tigers manager Jim Leyland was {{ejected from the}} game by second-base umpire Marty Foster. Garza's no-hitter was the first by a Rays pitcher. Culbreth was at second base on June 1, 2012, when New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. This no-hitter {{was the first to}} be thrown by a Mets pitcher. Santana benefited from a close call on the third <b>base</b> <b>line</b> by umpire Adrian Johnson; the Carlos Beltr√°n line drive {{appeared}} to be fair, but Johnson ruled it foul.|$|E
50|$|Like Sievers, Wolfenden {{constructed}} all of {{the sounding}} lengths on a single segment at 45 degrees from the <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> for the rays, starting with points located for each C in the range designed at 54, 102, 192.5, 364 and 688mm from the upper point. The four vertices for the rays are then located by the intersections of the horizontal <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> extended from the lower C in each octave with a second line angled from the upper {{starting point for the}} string line, however, which he specified should both be at 51.5 degrees to the <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> and that the <b>base</b> <b>lines</b> have a 35:13 ratio with {{the difference between the two}} octave lengths.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Greer {{served as the}} home field for the Father Ryan High School {{football}} team. Father Ryan returned to playing at Greer from 2006 through 2008, before moving to a new school athletic complex for the 2009 season. Depending on the Sounds' schedule, some of the school's home games were held at the visiting school's field (with Father Ryan designated as the home team) or at other unused local high school fields. In the football configuration, the field runs along the first <b>base</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Now {{travelling}} {{parallel to}} and immediately {{west of the}} Halton‚ÄìPeel regional boundary and Oakville‚ÄìMississauga city boundary, the six-lane Highway407 progresses northwest alongside a power transmission corridor, with subdivisions {{to the east and}} greenspace to the west. The route continues as such northwest to Highway401, passing under Lower <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> (which continues east as Eglinton Avenue) and interchanging at Britannia Road and Derry Road before crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway's (CP) Galt Subdivision. At Highway401, the route makes a sharp curve to the northeast, while ramps weave across both freeway over several kilometres, interconnecting them. It enters Peel Region at the Winston Churchill Boulevard (Peel Regional Road19) overpass and follows another power transmission corridor just north of the Brampton‚ÄìMississauga boundary.|$|E
5|$|Seating at the {{ballpark}} includes fixed stadium seats, general admission bleachers, some with contoured seats, and eighteen skyboxes located on the third floor. As of 2014, total seating capacity is 10,300.

5|$|The cursive {{style has}} many unorthodox {{characteristics}} uncommon to Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the <b>base</b> <b>line</b> depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Trot Nixon {{extended}} the Red Sox lead to {{two in the}} top of the fourth, hitting a single to right field that scored Mueller, who had started the rally with a two-out double to left-center. Johnny Damon then led off the Red Sox's fifth inning with a double to right. Singles by Orlando Cabrera and Ram√≠rez, to right and left respectively, scored Damon to make it 3‚Äì0. With two out, Mueller singled along the first <b>base</b> <b>line,</b> enabling Cabrera to score the Red Sox's fourth run. Suppan was replaced by Al Reyes, which meant none of the Cardinals three starting pitchers had finished five innings during the series.|$|E
5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring run after run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for the Rays. Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer turned in his first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6‚Öì innings. His counterpart Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but neither would factor in the decision. After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies loaded the bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third <b>base</b> <b>line</b> to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E

5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Edgar Mart√≠nez‚Äîthe second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first <b>base</b> <b>line</b> and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
5|$|M-102 is an east‚Äìwest state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey of the state, and the roadway is also called <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> Road in places. As a county road or city street, 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow Vernier Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at Vernier Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile Road name extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E
5|$|M-40 crosses into Allegan County near <b>Base</b> <b>Line</b> Lake. The highway follows Jenner Street {{along some}} curves near {{the banks of}} the Kalamazoo River as the {{trunkline}} enters the south side of Allegan. M-40 meets M-89, and the two highways run concurrently into downtown together on Cedar Street. At the intersection with Cutler Street, M-40/M-89 meets the western end of M-222 and M-40/M-89 turns west onto Cutler Street. The street name changes to Western Avenue as M-40/M-89 curves north and northwest, crossing the Kalamazoo River and leaving town. North of Lake Allegan, M-89 separates and runs west toward Fennville, and M-40 extends to Hamilton, crossing the Rabbit River. The highway runs through more farms and approaches the outskirts of Holland. The trunkline crosses over I-196 and follows Lincoln Road through an industrial area on the southeast side of town. At 48th Street, the highway turns west until meeting Lincoln Avenue. There, M-40 turns north for several blocks before ending at the intersection with BLI-196/US31.|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} we {{describe}} {{a method of}} comparison of stands according to the appearance of plants.
