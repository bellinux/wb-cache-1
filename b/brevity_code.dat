500|$|Overseas {{training}} {{continued with}} the annual NORKA exercises through 2001, when NORKA was discontinued {{in favor of}} NOMAD (North Sea Operations for Mutual Air Defence), a multi-nation ACMI training exercise held annually at RAF Waddington, which Swiss contingents began attending in 2000. Training in night operations, called NIGHTWAY, began in 1998at Ørland MAS, Norway, and continued annually except for 1999and 2005. Training abroad with NATO nations reflected the changing realities of neutrality, also reflected in 1997 by the official discontinuation within the Swiss Air Force of the [...] "Bambini Code" [...] {{in favor of the}} NATO <b>Brevity</b> <b>Code.</b> The Bambini Code, invented in 1941, was an amalgam of terms in French, German, and Italian for accurate voice communications during high-stress flight operations while the NATO terms are entirely in English and largely developed by the United States Air Force.|$|E

5000|$|The Bambini-Code was a <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> {{used for}} {{tactical}} radio voice communications by the Swiss Air Force (SAF). It {{was developed by}} the SAF during World War II and was used until 1998. It is sometimes referred to as the [...] "fifth national language" [...] of Switzerland.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{following}} example of a typical casual Morse code conversation between two stations there is extensive use of such: Morse <b>code</b> abbreviations, <b>brevity</b> <b>codes,</b> Morse prosigns and other such conventions.|$|R
50|$|As the SAF {{started to}} have regular {{communications}} with foreign air forces in Switzerland and abroad, the Bambini-Code {{was no longer}} suitable. For example, with the retirement of the Hawker Hunter from SAF service in 1994, SAF pilots in the United States learning to fly its replacement the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet found {{they could not be}} understood when using the Bambini-code. So in 1998 the SAF changed to the NATO standard multiservice tactical <b>brevity</b> <b>code.</b> This was also at the time the SAF switched from using the metric system of measurement to the Imperial units of feet and miles per hour, although it kept the use of litres rather than gallons as the measurement unit for fuel. The NATO <b>Brevity</b> <b>Code</b> is now the standard code for the SAF at any time.|$|E
50|$|Active radar homing (ARH) is {{a missile}} {{guidance}} method {{in which a}} missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to Semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously. NATO <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> for an air-to-air active radar homing missile launch is Fox.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} colloquially {{referred}} to as T-Lands Police Station - probably a reference to Marine Police <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> for a marine police station on [...] "Land" [...] at [...] "Tsim Sha Tsui".

50|$|To make Morse code {{communications}} {{faster and}} more efficient, there are many internationally agreed patterns or conventions of communication which include: extensive use of abbreviations, use of <b>brevity</b> <b>codes</b> such as the RST code, Q code, Z code {{as well as the}} use of Morse prosigns. The skills required to have efficient fast conversations with Morse comprise more than simply knowing the Morse code symbols for the alphabet and numerals. Skilled telegraphists must also know many traditional International Morse code communications conventions.|$|R
5000|$|The AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM (pronounced [...] "am-ram"), is {{a modern}} beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) capable of {{all-weather}} day-and-night operations. Designed with 7-inch diameter instead of 8-inch diameter form-and-fit factors, and employing active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance, it {{has the advantage of}} being a fire-and-forget weapon when compared to the previous generation Sparrow missiles. When an AMRAAM missile is being launched, NATO pilots use the <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> Fox Three.|$|E
5000|$|The Q code is a {{standardized}} collection of three-letter codes {{all of which}} start with the letter [...] "Q". It is a <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> initially developed for commercial radiotelegraph communication and later adopted by other radio services, especially amateur radio. To distinguish the use of [...] "Q" [...] codes transmitted as questions from those transmitted as statements, operators used the Morse question mark code (dit dit dah dah dit dit) as a prefix to the [...] "Q" [...] code.|$|E
50|$|Fox is a <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> used by NATO {{pilots to}} signal the {{simulated}} or actual release of an air-to-air munition or other combat function. Army aviation elements may use a different nomenclature, as the nature of helicopter-fired weapons is almost always air-to-surface. 'Fox' is short for 'foxtrot', the phonetic designation for the letter 'F', which is short for 'fire'. The radio call announcing that a weapon has been fired is intended to help avoid friendly fire, cuing other pilots {{to ensure that they}} do not maneuver into the path of harm.|$|E
50|$|Data {{is usually}} read from {{a video camera}} or a video card in the YCbCr data format (often informally called YUV for <b>brevity).</b> The <b>coding</b> process varies greatly {{depending}} on which type of encoder is used (e.g., JPEG or H.264), but the most common steps usually include: partitioning into macroblocks, transformation (e.g., using a DCT or wavelet), quantization and entropy encoding.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the Random Access Zipper (RAZ), a simple, purely-functional data structure for editable sequences. A RAZ combines {{the structure of}} a zipper with that of a tree: like a zipper, edits at the cursor require constant time; by leveraging tree structure, relocating the edit cursor in the sequence requires logarithmic time. While existing data structures provide these time bounds, none do so with the same simplicity and <b>brevity</b> of <b>code</b> as the RAZ. The simplicity of the RAZ provides the opportunity for more programmers to extend the structure to their own needs, and we provide some suggestions for how to do so...|$|R
5000|$|The AE86 {{generation}} of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota Sprinter Trueno is a small, lightweight coupe or hatchback introduced by Toyota in 1983 {{as part of the}} fifth generation Toyota Corolla lineup. For the purpose of <b>brevity,</b> the insider-chassis <b>code</b> of [...] "AE86" [...] depicts the 1600 cc RWD model from the range. In classic Toyota code, the [...] "A" [...] represents the engine that came in the car (4A series), [...] "E" [...] represents the Corolla, [...] "8" [...] represents the fifth generation (E80 series) and [...] "6" [...] represents the variation within this generation.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a list}} of American {{standardized}} <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> words. The {{scope is}} limited to those brevity codes used in multiservice operations and does not include words unique to single service operations. While these codes are not authoritative in nature, all services agree to their meanings. Using the codes eases coordination and improves understanding during multiservice operations. The codes are intended for use by air and ground operations personnel at the tactical level. Code words that are followed by an asterisk (*) may differ in meaning from NATO usage.|$|E
50|$|The AIM-7 Sparrow is an American, medium-range {{semi-active}} radar homing {{air-to-air missile}} {{operated by the}} United States Air Force, United States Navy and United States Marine Corps, {{as well as other}} various air forces and navies. Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM. The Self-Defence Forces of Japan also employ the Sparrow missile, though it is being phased out and replaced by the Mitsubishi AAM-4. NATO pilots use the <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> Fox One in radio communication to signal launch of a Semi-Active Radar Homing Missile such as the Sparrow.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of Sidewinder variants utilize infrared homing for guidance; the AIM-9C variant used semi-active radar homing {{and served as}} the basis of the AGM-122 Sidearm anti-radar missile. The Sidewinder is the most widely used missile in the West, with more than 110,000 missiles produced for the U.S. and 27 other nations, of which perhaps one percent have been used in combat. It has been built under license by some other nations including Sweden. The AIM-9 is one of the oldest, least expensive, and most successful air-to-air missiles, with an estimated 270 aircraft kills in its history of use. When firing a Sidewinder, American and NATO pilots use the <b>brevity</b> <b>code</b> FOX-2. In addition to fixed-wing aircraft, some modern helicopters, such as the Bell AH-1Z Viper, can be equipped with the Sidewinder.|$|E
40|$|Three {{object-oriented}} implementations of {{a prototype}} solver of the advection equation are introduced. The presented programs {{are based on}} Blitz++ (C++), NumPy (Python) and Fortran's built-in array containers. The solvers constitute implementations of the Multidimensional Positive-Definite Advective Transport Algorithm (MPDATA). The introduced codes serve as examples for how the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and new language constructs from C++ 11 and Fortran 2008 allow to reproduce the mathematical notation used in the literature within the program code. A discussion on the tradeoffs of the programming language choice is presented. The main angles of comparison are <b>code</b> <b>brevity</b> and syntax clarity (and hence maintainability and auditability) as well as performance. All performance tests are carried out using free and open-source compilers. In the case of Python, a significant performance gain is observed when switching from the standard interpreter (CPython) to the PyPy implementation of Python. Entire source code of all three implementations {{is embedded in the}} text and is licensed {{under the terms of the}} GNU GPL license...|$|R
30|$|Programming {{languages}} {{have long}} impacted {{the development of}} distributed systems. While much middleware and distributed systems code continues to be developed today using mainstream languages such as Java and C++, several forces have recently combined to drive {{a renewed interest in}} other programming languages. The result of these forces has been an increase in the use of programming languages such as Erlang, Scala, Haskell, and Clojure that allow programming at a higher level of abstraction affording better modularity, enhanced speed of development, and added power of reasoning about systems being developed. Such languages {{can also be used to}} develop embedded domain specific languages that can expressively and succinctly model issues inherent in distributed systems including concurrency, parallelism, and fault tolerance. In this paper, we first present a history of programming languages and distributed systems, and then explore several alternative languages along with modern systems built using them. We focus on language and application features, how problems of distribution are addressed, concurrency issues, <b>code</b> <b>brevity,</b> extensibility, and maintenance concerns. Finally, we speculate about the possible influences today’s alternative programming languages could have on the future of middleware and distributed systems development.|$|R
5000|$|The AIM-54 Phoenix is a radar-guided, {{long-range}} {{air-to-air missile}} (AAM), carried in clusters {{of up to}} six missiles on the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, its only operational launch platform. The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile. The combination of Phoenix missile and the AN/AWG-9 guidance radar was the first aerial weapons system that could simultaneously engage multiple targets. Both the missile and the aircraft were used by the United States Navy and are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by the shorter-range AIM-120 AMRAAM, employed on the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Following the retirement of the F-14 by the U.S. Navy, the weapon's only current operator is the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force. <b>Brevity</b> <b>code</b> [...] "Fox Three" [...] was used when firing the AIM-54.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} {{operational}} centers available, wartime operational centers in mountain caverns (these were later refitted to FLORAKO operations centers) and an operations center for peace time at Dübendorf, {{this is right}} next to the surveillance squadron building and is now used by the civilian Skyguide as a test center. The consoles were equipped with a trackball (forerunner of the computer mouse) and allowed to edit each radar track quickly, when the FLORIDA system could not identify it automatically itself. Each console had several displays showing always best intercepiton path (the path was shown in several numbers who stood for height, speed,..) for the allocated intercept aircraft flying {{under the control of the}} tactical fighter controller (TFC) on this console. The TFC transmit this by radio to the Aircraft by using the Bambini-Code (a in World War II by the Swiss Air Force developed tactical code like the today used <b>Brevity</b> <b>code).</b> Each operations center was also equipped with a large status board which indicated the most important information of all the military airfields.|$|E
