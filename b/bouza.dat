2500|$|Tensions among gangs {{following}} the acquittal of {{officers in the}} Rodney King beating trial in Los Angeles led to one of Minneapolis' darkest moments. On September 25, 1992, Officer Jerome (Jerry) Haaf was taking a break at the officers' popular Pizza Shack restaurant in Phillips and was shot behind the back by two Vice Lord gang members. The investigator with him was also wounded. Haaf died from his wounds at Hennepin County Medical Center and the members were later caught, convicted and sent to prison. Chief John Laux suggested the murder was possibly retaliation for an earlier incident in which Metro Transit Police removed a blind black man {{who did not have}} bus fare. At a community meeting earlier in the evening at North Community High School, gang members interrupted calling police brutality and insensitivity. [...] The group's message had exacerbated a real ongoing issue of police brutality in the latter century. Former police chief Tony <b>Bouza</b> who oversaw the department in the 1980s called the force at the time [...] "brutal." [...] Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, an African-American herself, stated in 1994 that excessive force was a problem.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bouza</b> was grievously unpopular {{with the}} police {{officers}} he led in Minneapolis.

[...] In a cost-cutting move, he also instituted a promotion freeze that interrupted the careers of hundreds of officers. The citizenry generally noted that <b>Bouza</b> was installed as an agent of change in the police department and that this was a cause of his unpopularity among the rank and file.|$|E

50|$|A beer type {{known as}} <b>bouza</b> (بوظة), based on barley and bread, has been {{consumed}} in Egypt since beer first made its {{appearance in the}} country, possibly {{as early as the}} Predynastic era. Despite sharing names with boza, an alcoholic beverage consumed in Turkey and the Balkans, it is not the same beverage. <b>Bouza,</b> and beer in general, was referred to as mizr in Egypt, and also keshkab, during the middle ages. The latter refers to <b>bouza</b> spiced with mint, lemon leaves, nigella, pepper or rue, historically consumed in the coastal provinces of Egypt. The beverage is traditionally homebrewed, following a 5,000 year-old method of preparation that closely resembles depictions of beer-brewing on ancient Egyptian murals. The alcohol content of <b>bouza</b> can reach up to 7%, depending on how long it's left to ferment. It is often associated with the working class and is seen as an inexpensive alternative to commercial beer.|$|E
