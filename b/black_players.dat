5|$|The APFA, {{which later}} {{became known as}} the National Football League (NFL), had a limited number of <b>black</b> <b>players.</b> In the league's first seven years, nine African-Americans played in the APFA/NFL. Two <b>black</b> <b>players</b> took part in the league's inaugural season: Fritz Pollard and Bobby Marshall. In 1921, Pollard coached in the league, {{becoming}} the first African-American to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Lafayette Leopards {{were not}} the only team to face racism in El Paso. In September 1950, a regular season game between Loyola University (Los Angeles) (now Loyola Marymount University) and the Texas College of Mines was {{cancelled}} because of the policy that excluded <b>black</b> <b>players</b> from playing in El Paso. Finally on October 27, 1950, officials took a vote that allowed the Texas college to include <b>black</b> <b>players</b> in games at the El Paso location. A year after the grant was passed, the Sun Bowl hosted its first integrated football game between the College of the Pacific (now University of the Pacific) and Texas Tech University.|$|E
5|$|He {{was one of}} four <b>black</b> <b>players</b> on the 1939 UCLA Bruins {{football}} team; {{the others}} were Woody Strode, Kenny Washington, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the team's four backfield players. At a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football, this made UCLA college football's most integrated team.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> to {{represent}} East Africa was J.K. [...] "Ted" [...] Kabetu (Mombasa Sports Club), who {{played on the}} wing against Richmond F.C. in 1972: {{he was also the}} first <b>black</b> rugby <b>player</b> at Mombasa Sports Club and, in 1974, the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> to captain a rugby club in East Africa. Another Nairobi School former pupil, Chris Onsotti (then of Impala R.F.C., later of Mwamba R.F.C.) was the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> {{to represent}} East Africa as a forward, playing prop on the Fourth Tuskers tour of Ireland 1972.|$|R
5000|$|Trawick may {{not have}} been the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> in the CFL. There is {{photographic}} evidence that Robert [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson was the first African-American player, with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, in 1930. He was a porter with the railways and is in a team picture from that year. Otherwise Gabe Patterson was the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> to play for the Green Riders. Ulysses Curtis was the Toronto Argonauts' first <b>black</b> <b>player.</b>|$|R
50|$|Grant Fuhr was {{the first}} black goalie in the NHL and the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> to win the Stanley Cup. When his career was over, he {{was the first}} <b>black</b> <b>player</b> {{inducted}} into the Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|R
5|$|In December 2015, Boston Globe {{columnist}} Adrian Walker proposed renaming Yawkey Way and Yawkey station {{because their}} current namesake, Tom Yawkey, was a racist {{who made the}} Red Sox the last major league team to hire <b>black</b> <b>players.</b> In August 2017, amid racial tension, the Red Sox organization began advocating {{for the city to}} change the street's name. A bill to change the station's name was filed in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of <b>black</b> <b>players</b> was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E
5|$|During the season, Robinson pursued {{potential}} major-league interests. The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson {{and other}} <b>black</b> <b>players</b> on April 16. The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson {{was subjected to}} racial epithets. Robinson left the tryout humiliated, and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, Tom Casey {{became the}} first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> {{inducted}} into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, three years before New York Giant Emlen Tunnell {{became the first}} <b>black</b> <b>player</b> in the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|R

50|$|Jerry LeVias {{had many}} other {{scholarship}} offers to good integrated schools, but {{he chose to}} attend SMU. LeVias became the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> signed to a football scholarship in the Southwest Conference. In 1966, LeVias made his debut, one week after John Hill Westbrook of Baylor became the first <b>black</b> <b>player</b> {{to play for a}} conference team. Fry received abuse for recruiting a <b>black</b> <b>player</b> to SMU in the form of hate mail and threatening phone calls, but he downplayed the treatment, because the harassment of LeVias was much, much worse.|$|R
5|$|Gillom {{played for}} the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships. Gillom, who also played {{basketball}} and other sports, earned All-Ohio honors at Massillon {{and was one of}} several <b>black</b> <b>players</b> on the team {{at a time when many}} northern high schools excluded them. Brown's policy was to use his best players, regardless of race. Gillom set school records for points scored in a season and touchdown passes caught in a season. His record of 108 points in a season still stands.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk started {{negotiations}} to end apartheid in South Africa with Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). During negotiation, the white South African Rugby Board and the non-racial South African Rugby Union merged {{to create the}} South African Rugby Football Union. Rugby {{at the time was}} seen by black South Africans as a symbol of white supremacy. The ANC demanded that the new SARFU improve development of <b>black</b> <b>players.</b> This was because the Springboks team consisted solely of white players at the time, though <b>black</b> <b>players</b> were eligible for selection for the Springboks following the merger of the two governing bodies. Following the yes vote in the South African apartheid referendum in March 1992, the IRB lifted restrictions on tours of South Africa. It was announced that the return test would be against New Zealand. This was criticised in South Africa as the Springboks had not played full international rugby for 11 years and it was felt it would not be competitive however New Zealand were invited because it was felt appropriate after the events around the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour.|$|E
5|$|Jack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919– October 24, 1972) was an American {{professional}} baseball second baseman {{who became the}} first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. When the Dodgers signed Robinson, they heralded the end of racial segregation in {{professional baseball}} that had relegated <b>black</b> <b>players</b> to the Negro leagues since the 1880s. Robinson {{was inducted into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Though Payton had {{established}} himself as one of Mississippi's best running back prospects, he received no invitations from Southeastern Conference colleges, which accepted few <b>black</b> <b>players</b> at the time. After originally committing to Kansas State University, he decided to pursue his collegiate career at the historically black school Jackson State University (MS) where his older brother Eddie played football. He was never recruited by the University of Kansas, according to then-coach Don Fambrough as Payton claimed in his autobiography.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of an {{unofficial}} color line that excluded <b>black</b> <b>players,</b> Lillard did not play in the NFL after 1933. He remained active in football, playing for minor league and semi-professional teams, including the New York Brown Bombers, with whom he spent three seasons. Lillard was also a pitcher in Negro league baseball for five seasons from 1932 to 1944, and a guard in basketball for the future Harlem Globetrotters. After his athletic career, he became an appliance store employee and died in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted {{people to think about}} the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with <b>black</b> <b>players</b> in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that <b>black</b> <b>players</b> would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, but he and footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, {{before his}} father imposed {{a ban on}} {{competitive}} cricket, Constantine had played briefly for Shannon Cricket Club; {{he returned to the}} club in 1920. Initially, he appeared in the second team, but after scoring 50 runs in an hour during his third game, was promoted to the first eleven. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines; Shannon was mainly for black lower middle-class players such as teachers or clerks. The club was competitive and highly motivated, partly as a reaction to the racial discrimination that its players and supporters encountered in their daily lives. Constantine's cricket thrived in this atmosphere, and the club helped to form some of his political views. He particularly noticed that in Trinidadian and West Indian cricket, white and light-skinned players were often favoured over <b>black</b> <b>players</b> of greater ability.|$|E
5|$|The Browns' first game, {{against the}} Miami Seahawks, {{took place on}} a warm late-summer evening in September. The crowd was the second-largest ever for a {{professional}} football game. The game was well-attended {{in part because of}} team owner Arthur B. McBride's promotion of the new team, but also because the Browns' two <b>black</b> <b>players</b> helped draw a large African-American crowd. Miami's team, drawn mainly from the Southern United States, was overmatched by Cleveland. The score was 27–0 at halftime and the final was 44–0. Browns end Mac Speedie scored the team's first points on a 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cliff Lewis. Otto Graham came in at quarterback in the second quarter and threw a touchdown to Dante Lavelli. Placekicker Lou Groza kicked three field goals, and the Browns had two defensive touchdowns. Miami never advanced past the Browns' 39-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some <b>black</b> <b>players</b> believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight <b>black</b> <b>players</b> on the Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show}} up for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a continuation of a boycott of spring practice by the players, and they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases the discrimination was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure that all students, regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment.|$|E
5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade <b>black</b> <b>players</b> from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced to stay in a separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E
