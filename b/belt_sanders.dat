50|$|A {{belt sander}} is a sander used in shaping and {{finishing}} wood and other materials. It {{consists of an}} electric motor that turns a pair of drums on which a continuous loop of sandpaper is mounted. <b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> may be handheld and moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the sanding belt. Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are sometimes mounted on a work bench, in which case they are called bench sanders. Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are often combined with a disc sander.|$|E
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{can vary}} {{in size from}} the small {{handheld}} unit shown in the illustration to units wide enough to sand a full 1.2 by 2.5 m (4-by-8 foot sheet) of plywood in a manufacturing plant. Some <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> can be as large as 1.2 × 0.7 m.Sanding wood produces {{a large amount of}} sawdust. Therefore, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> employed in woodworking are usually equipped with some type of dust collection system. It may be as simple as a cloth filter bag attached to a portable sander or a large vacuum system to suck dust particles away into a central collector.|$|E
50|$|Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{are used}} for {{removing}} non-ferrous metals, such as aluminum. Non-ferrous metals tend to clog grinding wheels, quickly making them useless for grinding soft metals. Because the small grooves in the sandpaper are opened up as they go around the arc of the drive wheel, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are less prone to clogging.|$|E

5000|$|Belt-sander {{racing is}} the {{practice}} of racing <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> competitively. <b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{were one of the}} first power tools used in the growing field of power tool drag racing wherein a pair of stock or modified <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long extension cords. Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them, causing the sanders to race {{towards the end of the}} track spitting wood dust along the way. Both stock sanders and modified sanders race down a [...] long track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast, or very slow depending on the power of the motor. The fastest time on a 75-foot track was 2.2103 seconds recorded by Dudley Harper's Sudden Death Racer of San Marcos, Texas. Sudden Death raced on that date at the Legends Raceway in Rockport, Texas. The peak velocity of that belt sander at the finish line was in the range of 50 - 60 mph.|$|E

50|$|Porter-Cable is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} power tools. The company {{is known for}} introducing a number of noteworthy power tools, such as the first portable <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> helical-drive circular saw, and portable band saw. It is a subsidiary of Stanley Black & Decker.|$|R
30|$|Using a <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> we sanded all {{sections}} to a high-grade polish using progressively finer paper. Each {{section was}} cross-dated using standard dendrochronological techniques {{to determine the}} exact calendar year (Dietrich and Swetnam 1984, Baisan and Swetnam 1990) and the approximate {{beginning and end of}} growth change periods (Mutch and Swetnam 1995).|$|R
50|$|In 1926, Chief Engineer Art Emmons {{invented the}} {{portable}} electric <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> called the Take-About Sander, {{and the company}} began to develop a niche in portable electric power tools. In 1929, Emmons invented the helical-drive circular saw, a compact, lightweight design that {{is still the most}} widely used circular saw design produced today.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{were one}} of the first power tools used in the growing field of power tool drag racing wherein a pair of stock or {{modified}} <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long extension cords. Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them, causing the sanders to race {{towards the end of the}} track spitting wood dust along the way. Stock sanders race down a 15 m track, while modified sanders race on a 25 m track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast or very slow, depending on the power of the motor. For example, some can go as fast as 8 km/h (5 mph) etc.|$|E
50|$|By early 1953, Porter-Cable manufacturing, {{a company}} in the {{business}} of producing portable power tools and <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> employed more than 400 people in their plant at 1714 North Salina Street, originally the H. A. Moyer carriage factory. The toolmaker bought the original factory from the Moyer family.|$|E
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{can have}} a very {{aggressive}} action on wood and are normally used only for the beginning stages of the sanding process, or used to rapidly remove material. Sometimes they are also used for removing paints or finishes from wood. Fitted with fine grit sand paper, a belt sander {{can be used to}} achieve a completely smooth surface.|$|E
5000|$|Belt grinder, {{which is}} usually used as a {{machining}} method to process metals and other materials, {{with the aid of}} coated abrasives. Analogous to a <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> (which itself is often used for wood but sometimes metal). Belt grinding is a versatile process suitable for all kind of applications, including finishing, deburring, and stock removal.|$|R
5000|$|RLF Brands {{continues}} to manufacture and market {{a variety of}} add-on tools that can be run by the [...] headstock. These tools include a bandsaw (little changed from the original 1957 version), wood shaper, jointer, <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> strip sander, scroll saw and thickness planer. Changes from one function to the other is usually less than 90 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Fancier {{versions}} use clips, teeth or clamps to {{hold the}} paper in place. Commercial versions can be constructed of various materials. They are usually sized to hold a quarter or half sheet of sandpaper. Some versions use the sandpaper belts intended for a power <b>belt</b> <b>sander.</b> Construction workers often use commercial one-piece sanding blocks consisting of a foam plastic block with an abrasive coating.|$|R
50|$|For {{more than}} two decades, Bertie's Inn in Reading, Pennsylvania has held a fundraiser called Bertie's Inn Belt Sander Race. Riders sit on and race {{hand-held}} <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> on a 40-foot-long plywood track. All team entry fees ($50), food sales and T-shirts sales are donated to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Their most recent race was July 16, 2016.|$|E
50|$|As he had {{in other}} caucus states and among other largely white, rural electorates in the farm <b>belt,</b> <b>Sanders</b> won a large victory over Hillary Clinton in North Dakota. Sanders won in the cities of Fargo, Bismarck, and Grand Forks where he had campaigned heavily, and he also swept most other rural, {{conservative}} counties in the state. The caucus did not require participants to register before voting due to the state's small population.|$|E
50|$|If {{no power}} {{equipment}} is available, {{this can be}} done with files if the piece of steel has not yet been hardened. Grinding wheels, or small <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are usually what a beginner uses. Well equipped makers usually use a large industrial belt grinder, or a belt grinder made specifically for knife making. Pre-polish grinding on a heat treated blade can be done if the blade is kept cool, to preserve the temper of the steel. Some knife makers will use a coolant mist on the grinder to achieve this.|$|E
50|$|While at the house, Marybeth and Ben {{discover}} {{her brother}} and father's remains. Marcus, Shawn, Misty and Jenna hear a noise in a bush. Marcus goes to investigate and discovers {{that it was only}} a racoon. Victor then surprises the group and injures Jenna with a <b>belt</b> <b>sander.</b> Marybeth and Ben return and attack Victor. While the other survivors flee, Shawn tries fighting Victor, but instead is killed. Victor then kills Jenna.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Nathan, who has {{returned}} to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. Nathan relays this information to the remaining survivors, who realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident a wrench launched by a <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> hits him in the face, killing him.|$|R
40|$|Model-based {{analysis}} and inversion of thermography data relies on knowledge of thermal diffusivities. Through-thickness diffusivity is readily measured using the flash method [1]. In composite materials, lateral diffusivities may be drastically {{different from the}} through-thickness values, {{but there is no}} comparable simple and standard approach for measuring those lateral thermal diffusivities. Welch, Heath, and Winfree [2] proposed a technique based on laser line pulse excitation, but that approach requires a reasonably powerful laser and thermal camera with the concomitant costs and safety requirements. In this presentation, we show a simple and low cost (but not entirely nondestructive) system and method for in-plane thermal diffusivity measurement for composites. It is conceptually similar to the flash method but uses a mechanical heat source (<b>belt</b> <b>sander)</b> rather than a flash and multiple layers of the specimen are laminated together and encased in insulating foam. A thermistor measures the temperature and embedded software performs a curve-fitting (thermographic signal reconstruction) process to measure the inflection point of the temperature-time curve [3] and therefore the thermal diffusivity. The device is built from open source hardware and software, with a materials cost well under $ 200 (not including the <b>belt</b> <b>sander)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|All modern sanding {{projects}} are completed with specialized sanding machines. The majority of material is removed by large 220 volt belt or drum sander. <b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are preferred for the continuous sand paper belt design to prevent sanding machine marks in floors. The belt sander {{was invented by}} Eugen Laegler in 1969 out of Güglingen, Germany. 90% of the area can be reached with the belt/drum sander. The remaining 10% left such as edges, corners, under cabinets, and stairs, are sanded by an edge sanding machine. A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|E
50|$|While {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} are extremely helpful, they also produce {{large amounts of}} noise and vibrations. Using power tools without hearing protection {{over a long period}} of time can put a person at risk for hearing loss. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that a person should not be exposed to noise at or above 85 dB, for the sake of hearing loss prevention. Most power tools, including drills, circular saws, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> and chainsaws, operate at sound levels above the 85 dB limit, some even reaching over 100 dB. NIOSH strongly recommends wearing hearing protection while using these kinds of power tools.|$|E
50|$|Band Filing {{takes place}} on a machine similar to a <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> used like a band saw. Band files are {{sectioned}} {{so that they can}} be made from stiff material, as they need to be to effectively remove material yet still work in a constant feed. A band filing operation can be used to remove small amounts of material with good accuracy. The cutting teeth of the file are arranged closely on the file and are used as part of a finishing process.|$|R
50|$|Other useful {{power tools}} are a <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> {{especially}} if using recycled timber or for finishing rough-sawn timber. A thicknesser/planer is only needed if building many boats or larger vessels, {{as it is}} usually cheaper to pay a joiner {{to do this for}} a small amount of timber. A bench saw is useful if you buy larger sectioned timber, which may be considerably cheaper and need to saw it to the correct size, but again a timber yard will do this for a small charge.|$|R
5000|$|Harkawik's work often {{contains}} an unacknowledged temporal component:"For instance, in Harkawik's installation Flesh & Flash (retrofitted) (all works 2010)--a single {{photograph of the}} artist's hand gripping a bulbous daikon, the index finger mangled (having once been injured by a <b>belt</b> <b>sander),</b> appeared for weeks to be the work's only component. However, on the final night of the show, Harkawik, adding paint to the photo's surface, introduced a latticelike wooden construction {{to the wall and}} a chair to the space, thoughtfully positioned for ideal viewing." ...|$|R
