5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it <b>bounces</b> in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. <b>Bounces</b> from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and <b>bounces</b> at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
40|$|We present herebelow a {{model for}} <b>bouncing</b> {{droplets}} consisting of two masses joined by a spring and a damper <b>bouncing</b> onto an oscillating plate. We analyze the dynamics through the <b>bouncing</b> threshold and spatio-temporal diagrams. We obtain an analytic expression for the threshold. Resonance and Anti-resonance phenomena are found and investigated. The behavior of the <b>bouncing</b> spring is compared to the <b>bouncing</b> droplet dynamics. In particular, key features of the <b>bouncing</b> droplet dynamics are reproduced...|$|R

5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring <b>bounces</b> on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade <b>bounces</b> and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it <b>bounces</b> off a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.|$|E

40|$|In <b>bouncing</b> cosmology, the {{primordial}} fluctuations are generated in a cosmic contraction phase before the <b>bounce</b> {{into the current}} expansion phase. For a nonsingular <b>bounce,</b> curvature and anisotropy grow rapidly during the <b>bouncing</b> phase, raising questions about the reliability of perturbative analysis. In this paper, we study the evolution of adiabatic perturbations in a nonsingular <b>bounce</b> by nonperturbative methods including numerical simulations of the nonsingular <b>bounce</b> and the covariant formalism for calculating nonlinear perturbations. We show that the <b>bounce</b> is disrupted in regions of the universe with significant inhomogeneity and anisotropy over the background energy density, but is achieved in regions that are relatively homogeneous and isotropic. Sufficiently small perturbations, consistent with observational constraints, can pass through the nonsingular <b>bounce</b> with negligible alteration from nonlinearity. We follow scale invariant perturbations generated in a matter-like contraction phase through the <b>bounce.</b> Their amplitude in the expansion phase {{is determined by the}} growing mode in the contraction phase, and the scale invariance is well preserved across the <b>bounce.</b> Comment: 38 pages + appendices, 22 figure...|$|R
5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and <b>bounces,</b> with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, {{written by the}} Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batsman can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no ball — an illegal delivery — the batsman cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batsman to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it <b>bounces,</b> must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batsman's body without first touching his bat, {{in line with the}} wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batsman may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with his bat, he is struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batsman, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the <b>bouncing</b> ball {{has been}} a popular theme in {{computer}} demo effects since the 1950s, when a <b>bouncing</b> ball demo was released for Whirlwind computers. It later became the primary theme for the early Atari games Pong and Breakout. Commodore released a <b>bouncing</b> ball demo at the 1978 Consumer Electronics Show, to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time animation showing a red-and-white spinning ball <b>bouncing</b> and casting a shadow, this <b>bouncing</b> ball became the official logo of the Amiga company. Within the context of this tradition of <b>bouncing</b> ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a <b>Bouncing</b> Ball demo for the Atari VCS/2600, with a spinning and <b>bouncing</b> ball, at the same event. Following these semi-official demonstrations, the <b>bouncing</b> ball theme has reappeared in various demoscene productions.|$|R

5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which <b>bounces</b> light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E

40|$|Two discs {{moving from}} {{opposite}} points in space, overlapping and {{stopping at the}} other disc’s starting point, {{can be seen as}} either <b>bouncing</b> or streaming through each other. With silent displays, observers report the discs as streaming, whereas if a sound is played when the discs touch each other, observers report the discs as <b>bouncing.</b> The origin of the switch from streaming to <b>bouncing</b> response is not known yet. The sound either shifts perception toward that of an impact-elastic event (i. e., a <b>bounce)</b> or subtracts the attention that is necessary to perceive the discs as streaming. We used either impact-similar (abrupt amplitude attack, gradual decay) or impact-dissimilar sounds (gradual amplitude attack, abrupt decay) and found that the first sounds induce the <b>bouncing</b> response, whereas the latter, although as distracting as the first, render streaming and <b>bouncing</b> responses equally frequent at most. We interpret the audiovisual <b>bouncing</b> effect as resulting from attention subtraction, which raises the number of <b>bounce</b> responses in comparison with silent displays, and from perception, which further increments the number of <b>bounce</b> responses and turns the response into a strong <b>bounce</b> response...|$|R

25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer <b>bounces</b> {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and <b>bounces</b> up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Oyster {{farms are}} well {{detected}} by SAR. Characteristics of polarimetric {{features of the}} oyster farming structures are presented in this paper. The results of AIRSAR L-band POLSAR data and experiments in laboratory are discussed. HH- and VV-polarized signals showed strongly returns from the target area in the AIRSAR image. The ratio of single <b>bounce</b> to double <b>bounce</b> scattering depends of vertical pole height, direction of horizontal pole to azimuth pass, and incidence angle as well as sea surface conditions. Radar returns from vertical poles are stronger than those from horizontal poles by 10. 5 dB. Single <b>bounce</b> components are as strong as double <b>bounce</b> components and more sensitive to antenna look direction. Double <b>bounce</b> shows linear relation with height of vertical poles, which implies double <b>bounced</b> components are more useful to determine water level than total power. L-band HH-polarization generally produces strong radar returns among the three polarizations. Double <b>bounce</b> is main scattering mechanism in oyster farms standing above seawater, while single <b>bounce</b> is stronger than double <b>bounce</b> when bottom surface is exposed to air...|$|R

40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} the various {{conditions in which}} {{there can be a}} <b>bouncing</b> universe solution in f(R) gravity. In the article an interesting method, to analyze the <b>bouncing</b> FRW solutions in a spatially flat universe using f(R) gravity models using an effective Einstein frame description of the process, is presented. The analysis shows that a cosmological <b>bounce</b> in the f(R) theory need not be described by an equivalent <b>bounce</b> in the Einstein frame description of the process where actually there may be no <b>bounce</b> at all. Nevertheless the Einstein frame description of the <b>bouncing</b> phenomena turns out to be immensely important as the dynamics of the <b>bounce</b> becomes amenable to logic based on general relativistic intuition. The theory of scalar cosmological perturbations in the <b>bouncing</b> universe models in $f(R) $ theories has also been worked out in the Einstein frame. Comment: 41 pages, 17 figures, article. The revised version has some major modification in the section containing cosmological perturbations, some minor corrections and a discussion on the stability of the <b>bouncing</b> solution.
