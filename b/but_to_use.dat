5|$|Despite Negev's achievements, {{they were}} also given an order to retreat, as the Israeli command {{did not wish to}} fight in broad daylight. The {{retreating}} forces had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a route similar to the ones they came from, which slowed down their movement. Most of the machine guns that they had brought had broken down in the sandy environment, and could not provide them with cover. They were also carrying a multitude of wounded soldiers. Muhammad Naguib decided to use the armored vehicles in his operational reserve against the retreating forces, fearing a possible cut-off {{from the rest of the}} Egyptian forces in Palestine. According to Simha Shiloni, commander of the Negev Beasts battalion, the Israelis, especially the wounded, thought that all was lost when this happened. However, the vehicles stopped eventually as they got bogged down in the sands, and the troops made it back to Nitzanim. Sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed in the retreat.|$|E

According to Amennakht, Paneb ordered his stone workers not only to steal stone from the worksite of Seti II, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this stone to build columns for his personal tomb. In one case, he not only ordered his workers to make a plaited bed, but made their wives weave clothing for him. In addition, he stole several work tools, breaking one (Recto 2.13). Some tools were apparently of great value, as the workers searched for an entire month for a tool he stole before he snuck it back onto the worksite.|$|E
25|$|Above all {{however, the}} Albert Ground had been {{established}} as a business {{with the aim of}} making money and fees were charged to those who wanted to use it, including the NSW Cricket Association.

By then inter-colonial games had become so important and popular that the NSWCA had little choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Albert Ground for these at least. In all, five first-class matches were played at the Albert Ground between the 1870 and 1877 seasons.|$|E

The managers pleaded that they hurry with the laundry and they quickly washed them. However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. The laundry workers had forgotten to remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.|$|E

The single seat was placed high in the fuselage to give the best visibility and an 800lb-capacity hopper was fitted {{in front of the}} cockpit.|$|E

500|$|Sorkin {{fought with}} the ABC network during the first season {{over the use of}} a laugh track and a live studio audience. The laugh track was widely decried by critics as jarring, with Joyce Millman of Salon.com {{describing}} it as [...] "the most unconvincing laugh track you've ever heard". Sorkin commented that: [...] "Once you do shoot in front of a live audience, you have no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the laugh track. Oftentimes [...] {{is the right thing to}} do. Sometimes you do need a cymbal crash. Other times, it alienates me." [...] The laugh track was gradually dialed down and was gone by the end of the first season. Sorkin was triumphant in the second season when ABC agreed to his demands, unburdening the crew of the difficulties of staging a scene for a live audience and leaving the cast with more time to rehearse.|$|E

500|$|In {{keeping with}} Sifton's policy of {{excluding}} all prominent {{players in the}} A affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out). Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's. In response to the A's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A and concerned that the bill {{did not include a}} commitment to use the money to do so, opposed it. The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction. At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the 1913 election. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new railway policy [...] "made it proper for me to support and join his government".|$|E
500|$|In response, Ferdinand {{took control}} of the village {{at the foot of the}} {{mountain}} and encircled the site. He surveyed the locale for two days to identify the most promising angle of attack. The customary equipage of siege warfare—the siege tower, the trebuchet, and the crossbow—would be ineffective. The distance between the curtain wall and the valley floor and the angle of the hill placed the Godesburg out of range. The besiegers had no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> expensive artillery, although the angle would decrease its effectiveness. Ferdinand initially placed three cannons at the foot of the mountain, in Godesberg village. Daily, cannonballs and mortar shells smashed against the castle's walls. Nightly, the defenders repaired the damage. At the following sunrise, the assault began anew. Ferdinand's cannons were ineffective against the fortification, as were his mortars; in the course of the cannonade, return fire even managed to destroy a few of his own pieces. From his place of safety in the north, Gebhard understood well the potential of the loss of the Godesburg, yet he was relatively helpless to help his garrison. In an effort to garner financial support from the Protestant states, in November 1583 he wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, in London: [...] "Verily, the Roman Antichrist moves every stone to oppress us and our churches ..." ...|$|E
