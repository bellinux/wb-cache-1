The results were as follows: 1) Irrespective of the routes <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> and life or death of vaccines, the production of antiboies in mice remained almost independent of the sorts of rickettsial strains. 2) In the case <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> living vaccines, the production of antibodies was the best in those inoculated by intracutaneous route and decreased in the sequence as follows; subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral and intratracheal. 3) In the case <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> inactivated vaccines, the inoculation by intraperitoneal route produced the antibodies in the largest amount, and the antibody production decreased in the following order; intracutaneous, subcutaneous, intracerebral and intratracheal. Namely, the production of antibodies in mice largely depends {{on the nature of}} vaccines as well as the <b>inoculation</b> routes.

Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15708 was freeze-dried and microencapsulated by spray-coating. The effect <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> free whole cell or microencapsulated cells at three points during manufacture (milk before renneting, at cheddaring or at salting) on the viable counts in cheese and whey was investigated. Microencapsulation had no effect on viable counts, chemical parameters (lactose, lactic acid, total nitrogen, nitrogen soluble in TCA, moisture) or sensory properties during manufacturing or storage of the fresh cheeses for 14 days. <b>Inoculation</b> <b>of</b> the bifidobacteria in milk before renneting resulted in higher viable counts in comparison to other points <b>of</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Bifidobacteria added at the salting step, which survived pressing, were subsequently more stable during storage than those inoculated in milk.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the possibility <b>of</b> <b>inoculation</b> and reinoculation with a trypanosomatid isolated from bats that is morphologically, biologically and molecularly similar to Trypanosoma cruzi, {{to protect against}} infection by virulent strains.

Parasitemia and survival were monitored and animals were sacrificed for histopathological analysis. Animals immunized with Trypanosoma cruzi-like strain RM 1 presented decreased parasitemia, independently of the number <b>of</b> <b>inoculations</b> or the presence of adjuvant. In spite of this reduction, these animals did not present any protection against histopathological lesions. Severe eosinophilic infiltrate was observed and was correlated with the number <b>of</b> <b>inoculations</b> <b>of</b> Trypanosoma cruzi-like strain RM 1. These findings suggest that prior inoculation with this strain did not protect against infection but, rather, aggravated the tissue inflammatory process...|$|R

The major observation from these studies was that the immunogenicity of low concentrations of antigen was dependent on the route <b>of</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Intratracheal, intravenous, or footpad <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> low numbers of SRBC (10 (7)) did not stimulate development of AFC in hilar lymph nodes. However, intraperitoneal <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> the same concentration of antigen induced an immunoglobulin M AFC response in the hilar lymph nodes. Moreover, both intraperitoneal and intratracheal <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> 10 (7) SRBC primed the mice for an anamnestic AFC response to a subsequent intratracheal <b>inoculation</b> <b>of</b> 10 (7) SRBC.

By the beginning of the 18th century, the Royal Society in England was discussing the practice <b>of</b> <b>inoculation,</b> and the smallpox epidemic in 1713 spurred further interest.
