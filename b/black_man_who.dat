5|$|After {{rendering}} non-combat {{service in}} the Spanish–American War, Morrow graduated from the University of Cincinnati Law School in 1902 and opened his practice in Lexington, Kentucky. He {{made a name for}} himself almost immediately by securing the acquittal of a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been charged with murder based on an extorted confession and perjured testimony. He was appointed U.S. District Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky by President William Howard Taft in 1910 and served until he was removed from office in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson. In 1915, he ran for governor against his good friend, Augustus O. Stanley. Stanley won the election by 471 votes, making the 1915 contest the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history.|$|E

5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E

25|$|Many Hollywood {{cartoons}} {{from the}} 1930s {{are based on}} feature films. Therefore, it was only natural for Leon Schlesinger's cartoon studio to parody the 1936 Warner Bros. musical film The Green Pastures, itself an adaptation of a play by Marc Connelly which won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1930. The Green Pastures features an all-black cast and proved a success for Warner Bros., despite generating controversy. Animator Friz Freleng had directed the short Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in 1936. The cartoon lampoons African American religious beliefs to the backdrop of jazz music and {{tells the story of}} a rural <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> shirks church on Sunday in favor of worldly pastimes and finds himself in Hell as a result. Clean Pastures was thus keeping with his past work. Freleng even reuses animation of a jitterbugging couple from the Sunday Go to Meetin' Time in Clean Pastures. The short's use of caricatures of famous performers was in the same vein as such Freleng films as At Your Service, Madam and Coo-Coo Nut Grove.|$|E

500|$|Linder {{affirms that}} {{it creates a}} {{dichotomy}} between [...] "success (whiteness) versus failure (blackness)." [...] Pimentel and Sawyer, as well as Linder, identify Larabee {{as the one who}} makes this separation clear when he manifests his disregard of African American Vernacular English. The co-authors wrote that Larabee implies that [...] "legitimate forms of intelligence can only be achieved through a Eurocentric perspective, thus advancing the message that Akeelah must be rescued from her African-American ways of knowing, in order to be considered intellectual." [...] Another contraposition commented by scholars was [...] "between the supportive Dr. Larabee and Akeelah's skeptical mother." [...] Pimental and Sawyer said she is portrayed as [...] "an African-American obstructionist", while scholar Gloria Ladson‐Billings asserted she represents the stereotype of [...] "ignorant Black woman". Although Fuchs said the film was able to avoid the [...] "white authority figure saves the underclass child" [...] plotline by introducing Larabee, Ladson‐Billings, Linder, and Pimentel and Sawyer opined that it did not. After all, Larabee, as Linder described, is [...] "a non-threatening <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has assimilated to white culture and who can be depended on to help assimilate others".|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} of the second parley flag, Eyre {{launched}} a full-scale assault upon the fort and its roughly 150 defenders. [...] Stephen Hempstead, a sergeant in Shapley's Company, recounted, [...] "When the answer to their demand had been returned… the enemy were soon in motion, and marched with great rapidity, in a solid column… they rushed furiously and simultaneously to the assault of the southwest bastion and the opposite sides." [...] As the British neared the ditch, they were met by a bombardment of grapeshot that killed and wounded many. [...] This briefly scattered them, but they reformed into two units. [...] Eyre led one force against the southwest bastion, where American fire repulsed the assault, seriously wounding Eyre and several of his officers. (New London historian Frances Manwaring Caulkins asserted that Eyre was mortally wounded, while Benedict Arnold reported that Eyre survived.) [...] Major William Montgomery led the second party to an abandoned redoubt just east of the fort. [...] From there, they moved across the ditch and assaulted the ramparts. [...] This unit gained the bastion against fierce resistance, but Montgomery was killed by the thrust of a 10-foot pike from Jordan Freeman, a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had previously been a slave in service to Colonel Ledyard. [...] Montgomery's men were finally able to open a gate from inside, and the British force poured into the fort. [...] Seeing that the fort was penetrated, Colonel Ledyard ordered a cease fire and prepared to surrender it to the British.|$|E

Despite sexual initiation beginning prior to entering college, participants discussed how the college environment presented them with new information, experiences, and attitudes.
