The 2001 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission assessed Croatia’s compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (BCP).

40|$|Clearing {{has been}} an {{important}} part of the banking system and will always remain a part of it for years to come. Clearing in banking indicates the transfer of fund from one person to another. This clearing of the fund can take place in 2 ways either through cash or through cheque. There has been no major change in the cash transactions except for the changes in the value of money. However, the cheque clearing system has undergone a lot of changes. The origin of cheque can be traced back to the first century AD, where banks in and around Persia used to issue letters of credit called “Sakks” wherein the banks used to pay the identified payees as per the instructions. This eliminated the cumbersome process of carrying money or gold which was very risky. Changes have taken place in cheque clearing over the period of time. From ordinary cheque clearing to MICR clearing and finally to the latest in clearing ‘Cheque Truncation System’. This is a conceptual paper which tries to explore the changes that have taken place in the <b>bank</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>system</b> in the past, present and will also try to visualise the future of bank clearing...|$|E

Focus of the seminar was the {{development}} of information technology in Swedish banks, starting with the first use of electronic computers in the late 1950 s and the 1960 s. The seminar covered aspects dealing with technical issues, hardware issues and system and software issues. Different technical systems and products were discussed. IBM {{played an important role}} as a major supplier but beside other international players there were also some Swedish initiatives in the early years. The use of methods and methodological questions were discussed. In the first years everything was built from scratch, including operating systems, terminal interfaces and so on. The use of methods, at least documented methods, were sparse in the pioneering years. As the use of computers increased and the systems themselves grew larger, standards began to emerge and there was a number of infrastructure issues and the establishment of common platforms. Good examples of the development are the electronic <b>bank</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>system</b> as well as the two giro systems, Postgirot and Bankgirot.

Germany has taken steps to enhance accounting and auditing practices and to align corporate governance with best international practices. The German banking system is resilient, but relevant indicators show some deterioration. The main vulnerability facing all sectors of the insurance industry is the pressure on capital ratios and risk-bearing capacity from the poor performance of investment portfolios.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{detailed}} historical survey of Suffolk Banking System. The System is a voluntary and private <b>bank</b> note <b>clearing</b> <b>system</b> in New England {{at the dawn}} of American capitalism, and continued for about 40 years (1819 - 1858). Managing this System by the Suffolk Bank in Boston, cash reserves of New England Banks were fixed on the Suffolk Bank. Besides every bank note value, issued by New England Banks, was not depreciated but defended perfectly. So currency and credit order in New England was more stabilized than other districts in the then United States. Therefore, this historical experiment has been successfully evaluated as "Laissez- Faire efficient payment system", and has given strong support to Hayekian free-banking theory. However, that evaluation is open to question. In this survey, it is clarified the historical-limited dynamic structure of Suffolk Banking System in connection with business cycle, the Suffolk Bank's business performance (analyzing the Bank's balance sheet), public state government's ratification, and inter-bank strained corresponding network. So it is demonstrated that the System surged unstably because was tossed about the business cycle and the discordance between the Suffolk Bank and participating banks, not always as "Laissez- Faire efficient payment system. " And it's argued about the institutional inheritance from Suffolk Banking System to National Banking System and Federal Reserve System. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the observance of financial system standards and financial stability is complex owing to the multitude of macroeconomic and structural factors affecting stability. Therefore, assessments of standards in terms of technical criteria for compliance needs to be reinforced with additional information on other factors affecting risks {{in order to assess}} financial stability. Preliminary evidence from country data on observance of Basel Core Principles (BCPs) suggests that indicators of credit risk and bank soundness are primarily influenced by macroeconomic and macroprudential factors and that the direct influence of compliance with Basel Core Principles on credit risk and soundness is insignificant. BCP compliance could, however, influence risk and soundness indirectly through its influence on the impact of other macro variables.

It was built around smartcard based electronic wallet functions: money is loaded from the bank, via bank cards, to customer cards, to merchant cards, and finally back to the <b>bank</b> through a <b>clearing</b> <b>system</b> [1].

40|$|The {{effects of}} note monopolisation on the {{amplitude}} {{of money and}} credit cycles are studied. Note monopolisation trades clearing for leakage. If the central bank's reserve ratio is larger {{than that of the}} commercial banks, and if the currency-deposit ratio is sufficiently large, the leakage effect could domi-nate the loss-of-clearing effect (base expansion), such that the credit capacity of the banking system decreases. This was the case when the Bank of Sweden gained a note monopoly in 1904. Money and credit cycles should therefore have become smaller. Swedish bank data for 1871 – 1938 reveal that money cycles became smaller, but credit cycles larger. The latter is attributed to an increasing time-demand deposit ratio, which increases the credit capacity of the <b>banking</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Clearing</b> mechanism; Credit expansion; Currency-deposit ratio; Fiduciary money; Free banking; Leakage; Money multiplier...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{key areas}} of central banking reform {{in a sample}} of {{centrally}} planned economies undergoing transition to market-based systems. The discussion draws mainly on the experiences of four countries, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and China. Significant efforts have been made, or are under consideration, in all countries to develop a more efficient framework for monetary management, and to provide greater autonomy to central banks in macro stabilization policies. These objectives call for a coordinated approach to strengthening a wide range of central banking functions simultaneously, and require that a core mass of supporting financial sector reforms be implemented to ensure effective transformation and stabilization with minimal transitional costs.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the extent of}} retail banking integration in the Communauté Economique et Monétaire d''Afrique Centrale (CEMAC) {{and the level of}} bank competition at the regional level. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative indicators, the paper finds some evidence of price convergence in average interest rate spreads. However, this observed fact is not supported by an increase in cross-border flows in retail loans and deposits, and price convergence may merely reflect excess liquidity in the region. Other data also indicate that bank competition within the CEMAC as a region is limited, complementing the findings on integration. Addressing shortfalls in legal and regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, and markets would facilitate integration.
