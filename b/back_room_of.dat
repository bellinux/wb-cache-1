The shop was {{directly}} opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors. Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the exterior scenes taking place in New Jersey were filmed on location, with the {{majority of}} the interior shots—including most indoor shots of the Soprano residence, the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the strip club Bada Bing!, and Dr. Melfi's psychiatrist's office—filmed at Silvercup Studios in New York City.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating {{both black and}} white patients. He started a school in the evenings, teaching children. He established what has been called the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E
50|$|In {{its very}} early days, the Tammany Society {{met in the}} <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> various taverns, most often in Barden's Tavern on Broadway near Bowling Green. These <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> served as {{unofficial}} campaign headquarters on election days.|$|R

50|$|Jessie: Niles's son, a {{computer}} hacker, {{and almost as}} good with machines as his dad. Jessie survives using his craftiness, as evidenced in their idea to hide out from the original slaughter in the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the Forsetti Station's theatre. He is voiced by Jason Marsden.|$|R
5|$|That year, {{the couple}} decided {{to open up}} an occult store, named The Warlock Shop, at 300 Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights, New York City; {{alongside}} this venture, they also founded a company, Earth Religion Supplies, Inc, which would later go into publishing. Officially opening on June 21, 1972, the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the shop would {{also be used for}} weekly lectures and would be rented to various occult groups who wanted to assemble there.|$|E
5|$|The Minoan Brotherhood {{was officially}} inaugurated on January 1, 1977. Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven, it {{initially}} began at his and Geraci's shared flat, {{where they were}} joined by their friend Joseph Cupolo. Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood, the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller, who was soon followed by Bruce-Michael Gelbert. Not long after, Cupolo moved to New Orleans, where he founded a second coven, known as Phaistos Grove. In 1977, Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym, and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year. A stage director and part-time bartender, Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski, which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship. However, when Buczynski announced that he {{had fallen in love with}} Muto, it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci, who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979. Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street, but did not share his boyfriend's magico-religious beliefs, instead being a far left atheist. He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft, and encouraged him to aim for an academic education; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma (GED). The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate, rarely meeting from late-1978 through early 1979. He did however bring in Tony Fiara in late 1979, who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition, which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement. That year, Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a covenstead, which he moved to the Earth Star Temple, the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> The Magickal Childe, Herman Slater's new shop.|$|E

50|$|Segni {{was also}} a {{professor}} of law at University of Sassari. Straightforward, witty and courteous, Segni was more at ease in the classroom or the law court than in the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> Italian politics. He died on 1 December 1972, in Rome. The frail, often ailing Segni, was affectionately called malato di ferro—"the invalid with the iron constitution".|$|R
25|$|The <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the temple, the opisthodomos, usually {{served as}} a storage space for cult equipment. It could also hold the temple treasury. For some time, the opisthodomus of the Athenian Parthenon {{contained}} the treasury of the Delian League, thus directly protected by the deity. Pronaos and opisthodomos were often closed off from the peristasis by wooden barriers or fences.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{was the son}} of Chinese immigrants. He {{was born}} in the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the family's laundry on Carondelet Street, in the part of New Orleans known as Central City.

25|$|Interior {{scenes were}} {{initially}} {{supposed to be}} filmed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, but to simplify cross-country logistics, {{the decision was made}} to use the facilities of Greenwich Studios in North Miami instead, and only carry out post-production in L.A. In a few scenes particularly in earlier episodes, Greenwich Studios' rear loading dock is repeatedly portrayed as the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the Gold Coast Shipping building, where the offices of the vice squad are located.|$|E
5000|$|Early Ohio Republicans such as Salmon P. Chase staffed many {{important}} national offices. Chase coined the phrase [...] "Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men". Starting in the 1880s, Ohio's Marcus A. Hanna {{was a significant}} power in the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the national Republican party. In the 1890s, Hanna led the conservative {{wing of the party}} against Theodore Roosevelt's progressive movement.|$|R

25|$|The pair leave, {{and walk}} along the streets taking turns {{carrying}} the disguises and discussing how to split the money. This serves to introduce some levity and ease the narrative out of the emotional climax of the scene, helping to prepare the audience for the twists and emotion of the following scene, the true climax of the play. Tamashima Ittō is invited into the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the shop for a drink, perhaps in part in thanks for pointing out the thieves.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, Stravinsky {{composed}} Funeral Song (Погребальная песня), Op. 5 {{to commemorate}} the death of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The piece premiered 17 January 1909 in the Grand Hall of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory but was then lost until September 2015, when it resurfaced in a <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the city's Conservatoire. It was played again {{for the first time}} in over a century on 2 December 2016. The rediscovery generated much enthusiasm and, as a result, over 25 performances are scheduled in 2017 and beyond.|$|E
25|$|The OBPA holds {{a breakfast}} event every Wednesday at a Denny's {{restaurant}} in Oceanside, California. The breakfast starts at 8 am although members start showing up {{as early as}} 6:30 am to get {{a head start on}} the festivities. The group occupies the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls. Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa. Some come for the camaraderie while others find relief discussing the rigors of combat with people who have had similar experiences.|$|E

25|$|In 1837, Echeverría {{founded the}} Asociación de Mayo, at the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> his store. The meeting was first viewed favorably by top functionaries of the Rosas government, {{even though they}} were {{considered}} suspicious by the Sociedad Popular Restauradora (Rosas' government's political arm). In the same year, the French blockade of the Río de la Plata started, which first for cultural reasons, then political, defined them as anti-Rosas. The threats of the para-military group, the Mazorca, Sastre did not flee to Montevideo, as several of his friends had done. The government's displeasure and the stopping of imports from France caused the bankruptcy of his bookstore. In 1840, Sastre published a novel, Cartas a Germania.|$|E
25|$|On 14 December 1999, former Beatle Paul McCartney {{returned}} to the New Cavern Club stage to play his last gig of 1999 publicising his new album, Run Devil Run. It has around 40 live bands performing every week; both tribute and original bands, although most perform their own material. The <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the Cavern is {{the most frequently used}} location for touring acts and ticketed events, in more recent times playing host to The Wanted, Adele and Jessie J. The Cavern is also used as a tour warm-up venue with semi-secret gigs announced at the last moment. The Arctic Monkeys did this in October 2005, Jake Bugg in November 2013, as well as many others before them, such as Travis and Oasis.|$|E
25|$|At 2.30 pm, {{the police}} {{set fire to}} the {{building}} {{to try to make the}} rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building. Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building. He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E
50|$|Although destined {{by birth}} to a {{secondary}} role, Contarini took naturally to the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> power, and proved just as adept at attending the Senate of Venice as {{he might have been}} as a Senator. Nor was his public life totally non-existent: {{he was elected to the}} Council of Ten, even serving as savio of the Council, and in March 1655, he served as Vice-Doge for the period between the death of Doge Francesco Molin and the election of Carlo Contarini.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Fairfax {{stayed behind}} {{a moment to}} fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and {{proceeded}} to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating the front and <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard's castle.|$|R

25|$|Giosue's elder brother, Gennaro Gallucci, {{was shot}} dead on November 14, 1909, in the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> the family bakery. The assassin entered the bakery and yelled for Gennaro. When he appeared, he {{was shot and killed}} immediately. His {{activities}} as a collector of protection payments had caught the attention of the authorities earlier, and he had to leave New York City for a while. Gennaro arrived in New York from Italy in December 1908, having escaped from prison after serving 23 years of a life sentence for murdering two men. He lived on East 109th Street with his brother, Giosuè, and sister-in-law, Assunta. Soon after his arrival, the police began receiving complaints about extortion practices, but when the plaintiffs were told that they had to confront him in court, they dropped the charges.|$|E
25|$|The View {{initially}} {{formed around}} a cover band at school, playing their own versions of bands such as Squeeze and the Sex Pistols. Lead singer Kyle Falconer, guitarist Peter Reilly, bassist Kieren Webster and original drummer Michael Annable all attended St John's RC High School, They began by performing {{a number of}} their own songs and cover versions at school talent contests. The deputy head teacher of St John's stated that he knew the band would go far and he told them {{to push for a}} record deal. The View entered the school talent contest four times but were only successful twice. Following this, the band set up base to write their own material in a <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> The Bayview Pub, a bar owned by Falconer's cousin. They progressed to play more cover gigs and weddings around the Dundee area, including the Centenary Bar in Central Dundee and a caravan park in Arbroath. The band were later ejected from their base in The Bayview, following singer Kyle Falconer reportedly riding a scooter along the bar.|$|E
25|$|Bogan {{was placed}} in the <b>back</b> <b>room</b> <b>of</b> a local saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, the next day in fact, he took {{advantage}} of the poor security and made an escape during a roaring blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. He was right, as two weeks later Bogan, burning up with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan {{in the back of the}} Sweeney Saloon. The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.|$|E
50|$|Born in Northport, New York, Ulrich {{lives in}} Providence, Rhode Island. In 2001 in {{response}} to a national call for citizens to bolster the American economy through shopping, Ulrich began a project to document consumer culture. This project, Copia, is a series of large scale photographs of shoppers, retail spaces, and displays of goods. Initially focused on big-box retail establishments and shoppers, the series expanded to include thrift stores, <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> retail businesses, art fairs and most recently empty retail stores and dead malls.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1830s, the Paris police counted 271 wandering street musicians, 220 saltimbanques, 106 players of the barbary organ, and 135 itinerant street singers. The goguettes , or working class singing-clubs, continued to grow in the popularity, meeting in the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> cabarets. The repertoire of popular songs ranged from romantic to comic and satirical, to political and revolutionary, especially in the 1840s. in June, 1848, the musical clubs were banned from meeting, as the government tried, without success, to stop the political unrest, which finally exploded into the 1848 French Revolution.|$|R
60|$|He {{proceeded}} {{to draw a}} picture of the alternative--himself living like a fangless lion about the <b>back</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> a house in which his stepdaughter was mistress, an inoffensive old man, tenderly smiled on by Elizabeth, and good-naturedly tolerated by her husband. It was terrible to his pride to think of descending so low; and yet, for the girl's sake he might put up with anything; even from Farfrae; even snubbings and masterful tongue-scourgings. The privilege of being in the house she occupied would almost outweigh the personal humiliation.|$|R
