5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive <b>blackberries,</b> which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
5|$|Green rosellas {{generally}} forage in {{the canopy}} or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. They {{come to the}} ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of <b>blackberries</b> or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman.

The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|The <b>BlackBerry</b> PIN (Personal Identification Number) is an eight-character {{hexadecimal}} {{identification number}} {{assigned to each}} <b>BlackBerry</b> device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though <b>BlackBerry</b> technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server-side), and are locked to each specific <b>BlackBerry.</b> <b>BlackBerry</b> devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the <b>BlackBerry</b> Messenger application. <b>BlackBerry</b> PINs are tracked by <b>BlackBerry</b> Enterprise Servers and the <b>BlackBerry</b> Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a <b>BlackBerry</b> device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the <b>BlackBerry</b> Push Service, are typically directed to a <b>BlackBerry</b> device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center, and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the last mile to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the <b>BlackBerry</b> PIN would be replaced by users' <b>BlackBerry</b> ID starting in 2013 with {{the launch of the}} <b>BlackBerry</b> 10 platform.|$|R
5|$|Invasive weeds are {{prevalent}} in, {{and damaging}} to, the park. Species common in other formerly occupied {{parts of the}} foothills are also common in the park. Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, <b>blackberries,</b> common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina).

Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, <b>blackberries,</b> and thistles.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, <b>blackberries,</b> cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
