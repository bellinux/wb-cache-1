The embroidery threads of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in <b>backstitch</b> while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches. The looser twist of the yarn {{may be one of the}} reasons that the replica sections are less well-preserved.|$|E

60|$|The table d'hôte {{was served}} by waitresses {{dressed in the}} quaint and comely costume of the Swiss peasants. This {{consists}} of a simple gros de laine, trimmed with ashes of roses, with overskirt of scare bleu ventre saint gris, cut bias on the off-side, with facings of petit polonaise and narrow insertions of pâte de foie gras <b>backstitched</b> to the mise en sce`ne {{in the form of}} a jeu d'esprit. It gives to the wearer a singularly piquant and alluring aspect.|$|R
50|$|Corded {{quilting}} (also {{known as}} Marseilles quilting, Marseilles embroidery, marcella, or Zaans stitchwork) is a decorative quilting technique popular {{from the late}} 17th through the early 19th centuries. In corded quilting, a fine fabric, sometimes colored silk but more often white linen or cotton, is backed with a loosely woven fabric. Floral or other motifs are outlined in parallel rows of running stitches or <b>backstitches</b> to form channels, and soft cotton cord is inserted through the backing fabric using a blunt needle and drawn along the quilted channels to produce a raised effect. Tiny quilting stitches in closely spaced rows fill the motifs and provide contrast to the corded outlines.|$|R
50|$|A {{versatile}} {{and easy to}} work stitch, <b>backstitch</b> is ideal for following both smooth and complicated outlines and as a foundation row for more complex embroidery stitches such as herringbone ladder filling stitch. Although superficially similar to Holbein stitch, commonly used in blackwork embroidery, <b>backstitch</b> differs {{in the way it}} is worked, requiring a single journey only to complete a line of stitching.|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>backstitch</b> is used {{to outline}} shapes in modern cross-stitch, in Assisi {{embroidery}} and occasionally in blackwork.|$|E
50|$|Running stitch, Holbein or double-running stitch, satin stitch and darning stitch are all classed as {{straight}} or flat stitches. <b>Backstitch</b> is also sometimes {{included in this}} category.|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} phase-resolved OCT {{blood flow}} is detected from phase changes between successive A-scans. Especially in high-speed OCT systems {{this results in}} a short evaluation time interval. This method is therefore often unable to visualize complete vascular networks since low flow velocities cause insufficient phase changes. This problem was solved by comparing B-scans instead of successive A-scans to enlarge the time interval. In this paper a detailed phase-noise analysis of our OCT system is presented in order to calculate the optimal time intervals for visualization of the vasculature of the human retina and choroid. High-resolution images of the vasculature of a healthy volunteer taken with various time intervals are presented to confirm this analysis. The imaging was performed with a <b>backstitched</b> B-scan in which pairs of small repeated B-scans are stitched together to independently control the time interval and the imaged lateral field size. A time interval of ≥ 2. 5 ms was found effective to image the retinal vasculature down to the capillary level. The higher flow velocities of the choroid allowed a time interval of 0. 64 ms to reveal its dense vasculature. Finally we analyzed depth-resolved histograms of volumetric phase-difference data to assess changes in amount of blood flow with depth. This analysis indicated different flow regimes in the retina and the choroid. © 2012 Optical Society of America...|$|R
50|$|The {{stitches}} {{used for}} counted thread blackwork are double running or holbein stitch, <b>backstitch,</b> and sometimes stem stitch. Historically {{it was done}} on plain weave fabric. Modern stitchers often use even weave fabric made especially for counted thread work.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all drop-feed sewing {{machines}} can vary their stitch length; this is typically {{controlled by a}} lever or dial {{on the front of}} the machine. They are usually also capable of pulling the fabric backwards, to form a <b>backstitch.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{stitches}} {{and their}} variations are named {{according to the}} position of the needle and direction of sewing (running stitch, <b>backstitch),</b> the form or shape of the stitch (chain stitch, feather stitch) or the purpose of the stitch (tailor's tack, hem stitch).|$|E
50|$|Common {{examples}} of intarsia include sweaters with large, solid-colour features like fruits, flowers, or geometric shapes. Argyle socks and sweaters are normally done in intarsia, although the thin diagonal lines are often overlaid {{in a later}} step, using Swiss darning or sometimes just a simple <b>backstitch.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Backstitch</b> is {{most easily}} worked on an even-weave fabric, where the threads {{can be counted}} to ensure regularity, and is {{generally}} executed from right to left. The stitches are worked in a 'two steps forward, one step back' fashion, along the line to be filled, {{as shown in the}} diagram.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patterns}} and effects created {{depend on the}} stitches and the thicknesses of the threads used. Some of the stitches include <b>backstitch,</b> chain stitch and hemstitch. The result is an open work pattern, jali (lace) or shadow-work. Often the embroiderer creates mesh-like sections by using a needle to separate threads in the ground fabric, and then working around the spaces. It consists of 32 stitches: ...|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} corded quilting, Marseilles work or piqué marseillais, this {{technique}} {{was developed in}} Marseille in the early eighteenth century, and became an important local industry. The two layers of plain fabric are stretched together without wadding, and intricately stitched together using <b>backstitch,</b> or after the mid-18th century, the more swiftly achieved running stitch. There were narrow channels in the embroidered design through which fine cord or rolled fabric was threaded using a special needle to create a three-dimensional effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backstitch</b> or {{back stitch}} and its {{variants}} stem stitch, outline stitch and split stitch are {{a class of}} embroidery and sewing stitches in which individual stitches are made backward to {{the general direction of}} sewing. In embroidery, these stitches form lines and are most often used to outline shapes and to add fine detail to an embroidered picture. It is used as a hand-sewing utility stitch to attach definitively and strongly two pieces of fabric together. It is also used for writing.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{and most}} basic stitch found in kanthas is the running stitch. The predominant {{form of this}} stitch is called the phor or kantha stitch. The other forms of stitches used are the Chatai or pattern darning, Kaitya or bending stitch, weave running stitch, darning stitch, Jessore stitch (a variation of darning stitch), threaded running stitch, Lik phor or anarasi or ghar hasia (Holbein) stitches. The stitches used in modern-day kantha are the Kasmiri stitch and the arrowhead stitch. Stitches like the herringbone stitch, satin stitch, <b>backstitch</b> and cross-stitch are occasionally used.|$|E
50|$|The quilt is {{made from}} two layers of linen, {{stitched}} together with wadding in between. <b>Backstitch</b> in cream and brown linen thread defines a series of pictures with captions that have been brought into relief by inserting rolls of cotton stuffing to raise sections of the design, a technique known as trapunto. The stuffing could have been introduced during the quilting process, or because the backing layer is looser in weave, its threads could have been parted to introduce the stuffing; some elements are done using cord quilting.|$|E
50|$|The first {{pattern book}} for {{embroidery}} published in England was Moryssche & Damaschin renewed & encreased very popular for Goldsmiths & Embroiderers by Thomas Geminus (1545).

5000|$|Back {{stitches}} {{pass through}} the fabric ground in an encircling motion. The needle in the simplest <b>backstitch</b> comes up {{from the back of}} the fabric, makes a stitch to the right going back to the back of the fabric, then passes behind the first stitch and comes up to the front of the fabric to the left of the first stitch. The needle then goes back to the back of the fabric through the same hole the stitch first came up from. The needle then repeats the movement to the left of the stitches and continues. Some examples of a back stitch are: ...|$|E
50|$|Redwork {{is a form}} of American embroidery, {{also called}} art needlework, that {{developed}} in the 19th century and was particularly popular between 1855 and 1925. It traditionally uses red thread, chosen because red dyes were the first commercially available colorfast dyes, in the form of Turkey red embroidery floss. Redwork designs are composed of simple stitches and were mainly used to decorate household objects in the 19th and 20th centuries, especially quilts. Patterns for individual quilt blocks were sold for a penny in the United States, making them popular and affordable. In the 21st century, redwork has seen a resurgence among crafters. The main stitch used in redwork is <b>backstitch</b> or outline stitching, formerly known as Kensington stitch. Redwork was a common introductory form of embroidery taught to children in the 19th and 20th century. Children would make quilts decorated with redwork motifs, with motifs of various sizes prior to approximately 1910 and uniform sizes after that year. It was also a way for women with skills in pattern stamping or embroidery to generate their own source of income from the home.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{embroidery}} machinery used in {{the garment}} textile industry, the machines have been adapted to deposit and stitch fiber roving material onto a base material. Roving material, mostly common carbon fibers, from about 3.000 up to 50.000 filaments can be applied. The preform is produced continuously by the placement of a single roving. The roving material pulled of a spool is guided by a pipe which is positioned {{in front of the}} stitching needle. The roving pipe and the frame, where the base material is fixed onto, move synchronized stepwise to perform a zigzag stitch relative to needle position. The stitching head equipped with roving spool, pipe and needle can rotate arbitrarily 360 degrees. During each stitch the upper thread is pulled through the base material and looped around the lower thread spool. Hence a double <b>backstitch</b> is performed. Currently, up to 800 stitches per minute can be achieved. The base material can be a 2D-textile such as woven or non-woven fabric or a matrix-compatible foil material for thermoplastic composites. The stitching path can be designed in form of a pattern either with the help of classical design embroidery software or more recent by use of 2D-CAD systems. Afterwards necessary information of the stitch positions are added to the pattern with the help of so-called punch software and finally transferred to the TFP machine.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the level of university students' hand sewing skills and knowledge, and to examine the retention of the learning up to the high school. Moreover, teaching contents necessary for elementary school students to acquire hand sewing skills are also considered. This research was composed of a questionnaire on hand sewing knowledge, a questionnaire on the memory of courses and confidence in skills, a practical examination to evaluate hand sewing skills and a survey of the actual state of basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth. The research was conducted on 417 university students. 209 men and 208 women, the survey being conducted in June and December 2015. and in June and November 2016. The following results were obtained: 1) There were many items regarding which the students only half understood regarding hand sewing knowledge. The problem in the questionnaires was a low response rate and a low percentage of correct answers. 2) The evaluations for hand sewing skills were significantly higher for women than for men with ball knots, ball beads, plain stitch, half <b>backstitch,</b> and back stitches. Around 10 percent of all students could not sew a half <b>backstitch,</b> a <b>backstitch</b> or a hem stitch. 3) About half the students could not sew a straight stitch. Moreover, about half the students could not hold cloth suitably to perform a plain stitch. It was found that students who could hold cloth correctly were able to perform a straight stitch. 4) Furthermore, basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth were found {{to be related to the}} skill evaluations...|$|E
