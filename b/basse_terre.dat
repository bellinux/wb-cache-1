60|$|But {{all this}} {{grandeur}} and richness culminates, toward the southern end, in one great crater-peak 5000 feet in height, {{at the foot}} of which lies the Port of <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre,</b> or Bourg St. Francois.|$|E
60|$|The next {{link in the}} chain, as {{the steamer}} runs southward, is St. Vincent; a single volcano peak, like St. Kitts, or the <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre</b> of Guadaloupe. Very grand are the vast sheets, {{probably}} of lava covered with ash, which pour down from between two rounded mountains just above the town. Rich with green canes, they contrast strongly with the brown ragged cliffs right and left of them, and still more with the awful depths beyond and above, where, underneath a canopy of bright white clouds, scowls a purple darkness of cliffs and glens, among which lies, unseen, the Souffriere.|$|E
60|$|Guadaloupe, {{as some of}} my {{readers may}} know, consists, {{properly}} speaking, of two islands, divided by a swamp and a narrow salt-water river. The eastward half, or Grande Terre, which is composed of marine strata, is hardly seen in the island voyage, and then only at a distance, first behind the westward <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre,</b> and then behind other little islands, the Saintes and Mariegalante. But the westward island, rising in one lofty volcanic mass which hides the eastern island from view, is perhaps, for mere grandeur, the grandest in the Archipelago. The mountains--among which are, it is said, fourteen extinct craters--range upward higher and higher toward the southern end, with corries and glens, which must be, when seen near, hanging gardens of stupendous size. The forests seem to be as magnificent {{as they were in}} the days of Pere Labat. Tiny knots on distant cliff-tops, when looked at through the glass, are found to be single trees of enormous height and breadth. Gullies hundreds of feet in depth, rushing downwards toward the sea, represent the rush of the torrents which have helped, through thousands of rainy seasons, to scoop them out and down.|$|E
60|$|The traveller, {{at least}} so I think, would remark also, with some surprise, the seeming {{smallness}} of these islands. The <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre</b> of Guadaloupe, for instance, is forty miles in length. As you lie off it, it does not look half, or even a quarter, of that length; and that, not merely because the distances north and south are foreshortened, or shut in by nearer headlands. The causes, I believe, are more subtle and more complex. First, the novel clearness of the air, which makes the traveller, fresh from misty England, fancy every object far nearer, and therefore far smaller, than it actually is. Next the simplicity of form. Each outer line trends upward so surely toward a single focus; each whole is so sharply defined between its base-line of sea and its background of sky, that, like a statue, each island is compact and complete in itself, an isolated and self-dependent organism; and therefore, like every beautiful statue, it looks much smaller than it is. So perfect this isolation seems, that one fancies, at moments, that the island does not rise out of the sea, but floats upon it; that it is held in place, not by {{the roots of the}} mountains, and deep miles of lava-wall below, but by the cloud which has caught it by the top, and will not let it go. Let that cloud but rise, and vanish, and the whole beautiful thing will be cast adrift; ready to fetch way before the wind, and (as it will seem often enough to do when viewed through a cabin-port) to slide silently past you, while you are sliding past it.|$|E
6000|$|In 1797 an {{eruption}} hurled out pumice, ashes, and sulphureous vapours. In the great crisis of 1812, indeed, the volcano was quiet, leaving the Souffriere of St. Vincent {{to do the}} work; but {{since then he has}} shown an ugly and uncertain humour. Smoke by day, and flame by night--or probably that light reflected from below which is often mistaken for flame in volcanic eruptions--have been seen again and again above the crater; and the awful earthquake of 1843 proves that his capacity for mischief is unabated. The whole island, indeed, is somewhat unsafe; for the hapless town of Point-a- Pitre, destroyed by that earthquake, stands not on the volcanic <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre,</b> but {{on the edge of the}} marine Grande Terre, near the southern mouth of the salt-water river. Heaven grant these good people of Guadaloupe a long respite; for they are said to deserve it, as far as human industry and enterprise goes. They have, as well, I understand, as the gentlemen of Martinique, discovered the worth of the 'division of labour.' Throughout the West Indies the planter is usually not merely a sugar-grower, but a sugar-maker also. He requires, therefore, two capitals, and two intellects likewise, one for his cane-fields, the other for his 'ingenio,' engine-house, or sugar-works. But he does not gain thereby two profits. Having two things to do, neither, usually, is done well. [...] The cane-farming is bad, the sugar-making bad; and the sugar, when made, disposed of through merchants by a cumbrous, antiquated, and expensive system. These shrewd Frenchmen, and, I am told, even small proprietors among the Negroes, not being crippled, happily for them, by those absurd sugar-duties which, till Mr. Lowe's budget, put a premium on the making of bad sugar, are confining themselves to growing the canes, and sell them raw to 'Usines Centrales,' at which they are manufactured into sugar. They thus devote their own capital and intellect to increasing the yield of their estates; while the central factories, it is said, pay dividends ranging from twenty to forty per cent. I regretted much that I was unable to visit in crop-time one of these factories, and see the working of a system which seems to contain one of the best elements of the co- operative principle.|$|E

50|$|The species' {{greatest}} threat is {{from its own}} relative. The green iguana has been introduced to the Lesser Antilles as an invasive species and directly competes with the Lesser Antillean iguana for food and resources.

Captive Lesser Antillean iguanas are currently kept at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Chester Zoo, Memphis Zoo, and the San Diego Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species. All individuals originate from the Commonwealth of Dominica. Breeding and keeping the species in captivity is difficult. Mating and egg laying have occurred at each institution but most of the eggs have been infertile, a single individual was successfully hatched at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in 1997 and in 2000 eight iguanas were hatched.

40|$|The time {{associated}} with speciation varies dramatically among lower vertebrates. The nature {{and timing of}} divergence is investigated in the fantastic dwarf gecko Sphaerodactylus fantasticus complex, a nominal species that occurs on the central Lesser Antillean island of Guadeloupe and adjacent islands and islets. This is compared to the divergence in the sym-patric anole clade from the Anolis bimaculatus group. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of numerous gecko populations from across these islands, based on three mitochondrial DNA genes, reveals several monophyletic groups occupying distinct geographical areas, these being Les Saintes, western <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre</b> plus Dominica, eastern <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre,</b> Grand Terre, and the northern and eastern islands (Montserrat, Marie Galante, Petite Terre, Desirade). Although {{part of the same}} nominal species, the molecular divergence within this species complex is extraordinarily high (27 % patristic distance between the most divergent lineages) and is compatible with this group occupying the region long before the origin of the younger island arc. Tests show that several quantitative morphological traits are cor-related with the phylogeny, but in general the lineages are not uniquely defined by these traits. The dwarf geckos show notably less nominal species-level adaptive radiation than that found in the sympatric southern clade of Anolis bimculatus, although both appear to have occupied the region for a broadly similar period of time. Nevertheless, the dwarf gecko populations on Les Saintes islets are the most morphologically distinct and are recognized as a full species (Sphaerodactylus phyzacinus), as are anoles on Les Saintes (Anolis terraealtae) ...|$|E

40|$|Regional strike-slip {{faulting}} {{can control}} magma movements, deform volcanoes and may destabilise their flanks. The {{aim of this}} study is to address this problem by comparing two natural examples, <b>Basse</b> <b>Terre</b> Island volcanoes, Lesser Antilles and Maderas volcano, Nicaragua, with analogue experiments. The field and remote sensing analyses of their structures reveal that Guadeloupe volcanoes, which developed in a 145 ?-striking sinistral transtensional fault zone, are dominantly fractured in a 090 ?- 120 ? direction, which is parallel to the maximum principal horizontal stress and to the elongation direction of the summit graben of analogue models. This graben is bordered by the Sigmoid-I fault, or Y shear structure, and has facilitated the formation of the Beaugendre and Vieux-Habitants valleys by faulting, erosion or collapse. This structure has also influenced the injection of dykes and the transport of hydrothermal fluids. The comparison of Maderas volcano with the analogue models confirms that the volcano has developed parallel to a 135 ?-striking dextral transtensional fault zone and is also gravitationally spreading over a weak substratum. This study illustrates how regional strike-slip faulting and gravitational loading combine to produce a clear set of structures within volcanic edifices, which control the location of intrusive zones, hydrothermal activity and collapse directions...|$|E
