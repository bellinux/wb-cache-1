5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Deangelo {{makes it}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> still in his {{hospital}} gown, with an IV tube trailing from his arm. His attempts to tell a bar joke come out as random gibberish. Gabe and Jim lead him out of the office after Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) calls for an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on the phone to berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E
25|$|During {{her first}} term in {{political}} office, Hanson {{and her younger}} children were guarded by security for extended amounts of time daily. Hanson was under escort almost completely, and while her younger children were largely kept out of public exposure, they were escorted to-and-from school and on other activities. The mail received at Hanson's office was moved to another location and checked before it was re-distributed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 2011, Moore {{announced}} that he was forming an exploratory committee to run in the Republican presidential primaries in 2012. When that campaign failed to gain traction, he began to draw speculation in the media as being a potential Constitution Party presidential contender. In November 2011, Moore withdrew his exploratory committee and ended all speculation of a presidential candidacy when he instead {{announced that}} he would in 2012 seek his former post of Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. On November 6, 2012, Moore won election <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Alabama Chief Justice, defeating replacement Democratic candidate Bob Vance.|$|E
25|$|In retirement, Necker {{occupied}} {{himself with}} literature and produced his famous Traité de l'administration des finances de la France (1784). He also {{spent time with}} his beloved only child, who married the ambassador of Sweden in 1786 and became Madame de Staël. In 1787, Necker was banished to 40 leagues from Paris by a lettre de cachet for his very public exchange of pamphlets and memoirs attacking his successor as minister of finance, Charles Alexandre de Calonne. Yet in 1788, the country was struck by both economic and financial problems {{to the point of}} emergency, and Necker was called <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> of Director-General of Finance to stop the deficit and save France from financial ruin.|$|E
25|$|The reorganizing {{also made}} a drastic change to the {{corporate}} culture. While ND previously had allowed {{a high degree of}} autonomy for its employees and divisions, issues became increasingly top-managed. Motivation and sales dropped, and the company lost much of its ability to get employees to work free overtime. In early 1991 a new round of layoffs was carried through, followed by a new reorganization. New control mechanisms were introduced to ensure that all employees understood the new model. Few employees would admit to not understanding it, but in reality most did not, enhancing the problem. New rounds of lay-offs took place in June and September, the latter consisting of 500 people. ND lost all its large customers and signed no large contracts in 1990 and 1991. One of the main reasons was that sales personnel were forced to call <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> to confirm every step in negotiations.|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, {{but there was a}} light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|At first, Jim's and Dwight's sales call {{appears to}} be a fiasco, but it is soon clear that the joint force of Jim's straight-and-honest sales approach, along with Dwight's aggressive, erratic tactics, is a very {{successful}} partnership. Ryan asks Stanley if he could lead on this call so Stanley can critique him, which Stanley obliges. [...] However, Ryan freezes up and fails when he realizes that Stanley's clients are all black. [...] Stanley laughs at an annoyed Ryan during the entire trip <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> [...] Phyllis and Karen first stop at a beauty parlor, emerging with gaudy makeovers. [...] Their sales call is a success because, as Phyllis knew, the client obviously likes women with that kind of look, as evidenced by the photo of his wife. Returning to the office, Phyllis tells Karen that she's pleased that Jim got over his crush on Pam. Karen confronts Jim with this information, and he reassures her that his crush has passed.|$|E

At the show, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{and his partner}} Gil critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as [...] "motel art", not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a [...] "boyfriend's gesture" [...] with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on {{the wall next to}} his office.|$|E

While riding <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office,</b> he is run off the road by a mysterious van. Shawn wakes up in the hospital, and after he gets out, Gus informs him that he discovered another fake inhaler. Shawn returns to Henry's house to finish the dog house. Henry confirms that the lunch was poisoned, and Shawn returns to the bee. He disguises himself as the new spellmaster in order to enter the booth, and discovers that Cavanaugh had found out that Miklous Prochazka (Richard Zeman) was helping his son (Alexander Calvert), a contestant in the bee, to cheat by spelling out his son's words to him in Morse code using electrical impulses that were transferred to his false inhaler.

2500|$|A Financial Times interviewer, Emily Stokes, {{wrote in}} 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as [...] "an instinct. You must choose writers carefully, having {{read all of}} their work, rather than being swayed by 'reputations that are, shall we say, overpromoted', and then {{anticipate}} their needs, sending them books and news articles" [...] while seeking greater clarity, comprehensiveness and freshness in the writing. Stokes commented that Silvers [...] "radiates a genial warmth [...] {{it is part of}} the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views." [...] Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: [...] "The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and upset. You have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [...] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm terribly sorry, I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'" [...] James Atlas wrote of a typical day for Silvers: [...] "In the late afternoon, he'd rush out to a lecture at the Council on Foreign Relations, show up at a dinner party, and then head <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office</b> to deal with the next breaking crisis." [...] His New York Times obituary noted: [...] "Silvers brought to [...] a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion. ... loath to grant interviews. ... He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justman {{registered}} immediate {{concerns over}} the potential cost of attempting to film the treatment. He had particular concerns about a time portal effect, a scene involving a mammoth {{and the number of}} exterior and night shoots that would be required. Despite this, Roddenberry asked Ellison {{to turn it into a}} shooting script and set aside a desk for him in the assistant director's room, expecting him to attend the office every day until he finished it. Ellison ended up with a smaller office of his own at his request, but disliked it sufficiently that he spent the majority of his time on set. He would play loud rock and roll music in the office, and then leave it for the set. On one occasion story editor John D. F. Black caught him on set during the filming of [...] "Mudd's Women" [...] and had him escorted <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>office.</b> The music went on, and Black went back to tell Ellison to turn it down, but the writer had already climbed out the window and left. But on other occasions, he would work late into the night and slept on the couch in Justman's office. As the delays added up, the slots assigned to [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever" [...] were reallocated to other episodes. Although this period was later claimed to be of various lengths, Ellison completed the first draft teleplay in three weeks, handing it to Justman on June 7. Black later said that Ellison always had [...] "40 things going" [...] in reference to him doing multiple assignments at once. In response, Ellison said that doing multiple assignments at the same time was simply how screenwriters earned a living in the 1960s.|$|E
