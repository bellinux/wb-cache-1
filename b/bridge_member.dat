Based on existing fatigue experiment results of welded members with initial crack and the fatigue experiment results of welded <b>bridge</b> <b>members</b> under constant stress cycles, the crack would keep semi-elliptical shape with variable ratio of a/c during the crack propagation. Based on the concept of continuum damage accumulated on the tip of fatigue cracks,the fatigue damage law suitable for steel <b>bridge</b> <b>members</b> under traffic loading is modified to consider the crack growth.

The methodology {{is applied to}} evaluate the structural reliability of <b>bridge</b> steel <b>members</b> subject to compression, tension, shear and bending. The steel truss members, floor beam and stringer of a typical span located on the Jacques-Cartier Bridge in Montreal are evaluated using this methodology. Data for the evaluation was obtained from a comprehensive inspection and sampling program on the bridge involving tests on 74 steel coupons. The results of the evaluation are then compared {{to the results of}} the evaluation using the load and resistance factors method and the mean load method outlined in the draft version of the CHBDC, 1998, (Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code). In this application, the advanced reliability analysis indicates that the estimation of the reliability of <b>bridge</b> <b>members,</b> in their current condition, using the loads and resistance factors method specified in the code may be too conservative.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of crack growth {{with a view}} to fatigue damage accumulation on the tip of cracks is discussed. Fatigue life of welded components with initial crack in bridges under traffic loading is investigated. The study is presented in two parts. Firstly, a new model of fatigue crack growth for welded <b>bridge</b> <b>member</b> under traffic loading is presented. And the calculate method of the stress intensity factor necessary for evaluation of the fatigue life of welded bridge members with cracks is discussed. Based on the concept of continuum damage accumulated on the tip of fatigue cracks, the fatigue damage law suitable for steel <b>bridge</b> <b>member</b> under traffic loading is modified to consider the crack growth. The proposed fatigue crack growth can describe the relationship between the cracking count rate and the effective stress intensity factor. The proposed fatigue crack growth model is then applied to calculate the crack growth and the fatigue life of two types of welded components with fatigue experimental results. The stress intensity factors are modified by the factor of geometric shape for the welded components in order to reflect the influence of the welding type and geometry on the stress intensity factor. The calculated and measured fatigue lives are generally in good agreement, at some of the initial conditions of cracking, for a welded component widely used in steel bridges...|$|E

The anticipated life of FRP repairs for shear strengthening of <b>bridge</b> <b>members</b> under repeated service loads is uncertain. Field and laboratory tests of FRP repaired CRC deck-girders were performed to evaluate high-cycle fatigue behavior. An in-service 1950 's vintage CRC deck-girder bridge repaired with externally bonded carbon fiber laminates for shear strengthening was inspected and instrumented. FRP strain data were collected under ambient traffic conditions. In addition, eight full-size girder specimens repaired with bonded carbon fiber laminate for shear strengthening were tested in the laboratory under repeated loads. Results indicated relatively small in-situ FRP strains, laboratory fatigue loading produced localized debonding along the FRP termination locations at the stem-deck interface, the fatigue loading did not significantly alter the ultimate capacity of the specimens...|$|R

40|$|Timber bridges {{are used}} on {{all types of}} rail lines {{including}} important main transcontinental routes. The large number of these structures makes it critical that the limited maintenance funds available be targeted to structures in greatest need of repair. A combined structural dynamic and ultrasonic inspection approach has been proposed for identification of suspect structural members and in-situ evaluation of suspect elements [1]. Results of preliminary field tests were presented which showed the potential for this technique.

Ultrasonic inspection is used for more extensive local evaluation of the suspect elements identified in the global testing.

This work extends these concepts to a small scale laboratory investigation to test the validity of the method used.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of crack behavior under fatigue remains {{a critical issue}} in addressing the performance of steel bridges. Single edge notches in general provide a very well defined load and fatigue crack size and shape environment for estimation of the stress intensity factor K, which is not found in welded elements. ASTM-E 647 SE(T) specimens {{do not appear to}} provide ideal boundary conditions for proper recording of acoustic wave propagation and crack growth behavior observed in steel bridges, but do provide standard fatigue crack growth rate data. Acoustic emission (AE) has been increasingly used for assessment and prediction of fatigue cracks in steel <b>bridge</b> <b>members.</b> In steel <b>bridge</b> <b>members,</b> AE transducers are commonly attached {{to the surface of the}} plate from which the crack is initiated, hence producing a through-thickness crack growth monitored by the transducer.

30|$|This {{issue has}} been a {{fascinating}} research subject with direct field application since the diffusion of pre-stressed concrete and keeps attracting the interest of researchers. A comprehensive overview {{of the problem is}} available in Dal Lago (1973) with specific reference to pre-stressed members and in CEB (1984). Martin (1977) introduced the multiplier method for the estimation of long-term camber/deflection in the version most commonly used in normative approaches. More recently, Barr and Angomas (2010) analysed the camber of bridge deck members and compared it with different analytical and numerical methods of estimation, attributing the differences mainly to the effect of temperature. Roller et al. (2011) found an over-estimation of the camber values in time by analysing a <b>bridge</b> <b>member</b> with reference to the American standards. A comparison between experimental deflection and numerical prediction was also performed in Tadros et al. (2011). Breccolotti and Materazzi (2015) performed experimental testing on the deformative behaviour in storage of a widely diffused wing-shaped roof element. The influence of the curing process and thermal history during early stage hardening was described in Roller et al. (2003), Storm et al. (2013) and Lee et al. (2016 a, b). Rosa et al. (2007) calibrated a visco-elastic model {{on the basis of a}} series of field measurements of the camber evolution in bridge girders. A fully coupled sectional-based mechanical model was presented in Pisani (2012) and applied to a case study in Bamonte and Pisani (2015).|$|E
40|$|Concrete structuresâ€™ {{service life}} lasts decades. In order {{to deal with}} all the {{probable}} degradations and deteriorations in the whole life span, the concept of concrete structuresâ€™ Life-Cycle Design was introduced into China in the 1980 s. However, until this day, Life-Cycle Design is still more of a concept to most structure designers and engineers, rather than a practical method. This paper provides a hierarchical method for concrete structuresâ€™ Life-Cycle Design, in which the design process is divided into five levels. Safety should be the fundamental requirements for all concrete structures, so as to guarantee a reliable quality. For structures located in severe environments, durability design is necessary so as to ensure the designed service life. Further, when specific economic requirements are set for concrete structures, life-cycle cost (LCC) should be considered carefully in selecting the optimal scheme. Besides, those concrete structures designed to be environmental-friendly should also take into account the specific environmental assessment criteria. Nowadays, user-friendly schemes have attracted increasing attention too; therefore, customersâ€™ demands should also be fully involved in the design process. Considering all the design levels mentioned above, diverse designing criteria are provided accordingly. This paper also uses a road <b>bridge</b> <b>member</b> which exposed to chloride attack in marine environment as an example to illustrate this hierarchical design method. Using the life-cycle-based hierarchical design method, a probable scheme that is safe, durable, economic, environmental friendly, and user friendly is provided...|$|E
40|$|With bridge {{infrastructure}} in Minnesota aging, advancing techniques for ensuring bridge safety {{is a fundamental}} goal of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT). Developing health monitoring systems for fracture-critical bridges is an essential objective in meeting the stated goal. This report documents the implementation of two, 16 -sensor, acoustic emission monitoring systems {{in one of the}} tie girders of the Cedar Avenue Bridge, which is a fracture-critical tied arch bridge spanning the Minnesota River between Bloomington and Eagan, MN. The goal of the project is to develop a process for using acoustic emission technology to monitor one of the girders of the bridge while continuously collecting data from the monitoring systems. Given the cost of acoustic emission sensing equipment, an approach was adopted to space the sensors as widely as possible. Fracture tests were conducted on a specimen acoustically connected to the bridge to simulate fracture in a <b>bridge</b> <b>member.</b> Sets of criteria were developed to differentiate between acoustic emission data collected during fracture and ambient bridge (i. e. AE noise) data. The sets of criteria were applied to fracture test data and AE noise data to determine the validity of the criteria. For each criteria set, a period of Cedar Avenue Bridge monitoring data was analyzed. The results of the analysis of each period showed that the criteria could differentiate between the bridge AE noise data and the fracture test data. The AE noise data never met all of the criteria in the set, whereas all criteria were met during each of the applicable fracture tests...|$|E
