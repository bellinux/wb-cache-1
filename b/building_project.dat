40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} {{industry has been}} increasingly adopting green building because of its advantages over conventional building. However, implementing successful green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> entails difficulties in terms of cost performance. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the critical factors that affect the cost performance of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> during their pre-project planning phase. This study validates the relationship between certain critical factors and the cost performance of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), a data mining-based feature selection method, is applied to a data set comprising 53 green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> The results of the study show that 10 out of 64 project definition rating index (PDRI) factors exert most of the influence on the cost performance of the green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> These results will help the project stakeholders deliver green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> more successfully in terms of cost performance...|$|R
40|$|Project owners play a {{vital role}} in {{delivering}} green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> in the <b>building</b> sector. However, their motivation for effective delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> is currently unknown due to limited studies on the subject. Therefore, this study investigated project owners’ motivation for delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> by surveying 150 Green Star Accredited Professionals (GSAPs), who are the representatives of project owners’ interests in delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> in the Australian building sector. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and thereafter confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), findings revealed that project owners’ drivers of motivation for delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> can be classified into internal (INT) and external (EXT) motivation factors. The internal ones comprise improved quality of life, pro-environmental altruism, enhanced reputation, and persuasive influence, while the external ones comprise market appeal and financial and nonfinancial incentives provided by the government. The INT is more important than the EXT, but both are complementary of one another in driving the delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> The hypotheses that significant differences exist between public and private owners’ motivation, and commercial and noncommercial owners’ motivation for delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> are rejected. Thus, the theoretical position that INT and EXT complement rather than undermine one another is supported in this study. Furthermore, the comparison of this study with related studies in the United States indicates that the motivations for delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> are geographically different. In summary, this study has derived the factors of project owners’ motivation for delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Project owners can rely on either or both of the factors combined for successful delivery of their own projects. The government can use the factors to identify appropriate policies to enact and implement to increase project owners’ motivation for delivering green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> in the <b>building</b> sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{delivery}} of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> {{is often more}} difficult than non-green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> thereby resulting in low project performance. In order to overcome the difficulties and improve the delivery performance of green <b>building</b> <b>projects,</b> there is need to explore the perceived relationship between motivation and owner commitment (OC) based on the self-determination theory (SDT) of motivation. However no previous research has empirically tested this relationship {{in the context of}} green building delivery performance. Therefore this study evaluated this relationship using survey data from 150 project owners of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> in the Australian building sector. Data obtained was analyzed using both confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis of eight hypotheses (H 1 -H 8). The SEM results reveal that OC has direct positive relationship with traditional delivery performance (TDP). Additionally, only the internal motivation (INT) of project owners has direct positive relationship with sustainability delivery performance (SDP), and this relationship is partially mediated by OC. The external motivation (EXT) has no direct positive relationship with OC, and neither TDP nor SDP. The study concludes that OC helps to improve the TDP of green <b>building</b> <b>projects,</b> while the INT of project owners is required to increase their commitment (OC) towards improving the SDP of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> In addition, the EXT of project owners is not effective to increase their commitment (OC), as well as not contributing to improve TDP and SDP of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Theoretically, the application of SDT of motivation helps to contribute to the knowledge of how to improve the delivery performance of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> in the field of construction management and engineering. Practically, this study will help project owners to contribute to improve the delivery performance of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> This study also provides the direction in which policies for encouraging the development of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> and associated practices should take in both Australia and the US henceforth...|$|R

5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} <b>building</b> <b>project</b> was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II {{gave her}} in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
5|$|Control of the <b>building</b> <b>project</b> {{passed from}} the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} {{increasing}} costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a global}} trend of green <b>{{building}}</b> <b>projects</b> over the world. In mature green building markets like the United States and Australia, there are well established green building certification systems and advanced technologies are often used in green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> On the other hand, in developing green building markets such as India and Korea, green building certification systems are still evolving {{and there is a}} steady {{increase in the number of}} green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Despite the difference in the two kinds of green building markets, green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> may face similar needs and challenges for successful project execution. Through questionnaire survey, this study aims to identify the success factors and failure factors of green <b>building</b> <b>projects,</b> and to compare the factors in mature green building markets with those in developing green building markets. Over 37 green building experts have completed the survey in this study. The findings show that commitment from project participants and effective collaboration among participants are common key success factors for green <b>building</b> <b>projects,</b> whereas cost consideration and lack of incentives from government are major failure factors in both kinds of green building markets. The findings also show different perceived importance of issues like collaboration, green <b>building</b> technologies, and <b>project</b> delivery methods in the two kinds of markets.

This study aims to investigate the magnitude of workplace accident costs to building contractors and identify factors influencing workplace accident costs of <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Data were collected using multiple techniques (structured interviews, archival records and questionnaires) from 47 completed <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> in Singapore. Data were analyzed using bivariate correlation analysis and moderated regression analysis. It is found that the average direct accident costs, indirect accident costs and total accident costs of <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> account for 0. 165 %, 0. 086 % and 0. 25 % of contract sum, respectively. It is concluded that workplace accident costs of <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> are influenced by accident rates, project hazard level, project size, company size and the involvement of sub-contractors. The {{findings of this study}} may enhance decision makers' understanding of financial implications of workplace accidents in their <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> and motivate them to undertake accident prevention initiatives voluntarily...|$|R

In December 1930, Byne discovered Santa Maria de Ovila, a 700-year-old Cistercian monastery, and Hearst paid $97,000 for it. The monastery was taken apart and removed illegally, but the Spanish government was changing hands and was not effective in stopping Hearst's hired men. Some 10,000 stones were shipped to a warehouse in San Francisco at a total cost of about $1million.|$|E
5|$|According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple {{was built}} atop {{what is known}} as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and {{destroyed}} by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's <b>building</b> <b>project,</b> which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod’s great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.|$|E

40|$|Project {{owners are}} very {{important}} project participants involved {{in the delivery of}} green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> By virtue of their commitment, or owner commitment (OC), they can ensure successful delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> However, the indicators of OC are yet to be identified in the literature. As a result, information and knowledge of how OC leads to the successful delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> is currently unknown. Therefore, this study carried out a systematic literature of review of 47 scholarly publications in the area of project delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects</b> to identify the indicators of OC. Findings reveal 9 indicators of OC, with varying degrees of importance depending on their frequency in the reference sources. The study concludes that there are 9 important indicators of OC. Additionally, the indicators can influence project performance such cost, time, quality and sustainability rating metrics, thereby ensuring successful delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> The findings in this study have implications for project owners of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Therefore a framework of implementation of OC was proposed. Project owners can apply the framework to guide their commitment from selection of project participants at the design stage to encouragements for improved performance at the construction stage in a sequential manner. Future research should explore and confirm the factor structure of the indicators of OC in order to identify their underlying relationships. In addition, the use and effectiveness of the framework of OC should be validated by utilizing it for practical delivery of green <b>building</b> <b>projects.</b> Department of <b>Building</b> and Real Estat...|$|R
