40|$|Summary. Oestrone and {{dihydrotestosterone}} had {{no significant}} action. Other steroids inhibited maturation. The stage of maturation most affected and the median effective concentration (MEC) {{at this stage}} varied with different steroids. The predominant effect of pregnenolone (MEC = 6 =. =m),progesterone (MEC = 5 =. =m), androstenedione (MEC = 28 =. =m) and oestradiol- 17 =bMEC = 23 =. =m) was to block maturation after the resumption of meiosis but before completion of the first meiotic division. Testosterone was also effective at this stage (MEC = 23 =. =m) but at higher concentrations it prevented germinal vesicle <b>breakdown</b> (<b>MEC</b> = 40 =m) without causing oocyte degeneration. The inhibitory actions of all steroids were reversible in oocytes exposed for 4 or 18 h...|$|E
40|$|The DNA damage {{checkpoint}} plays {{a crucial}} role in maintaining functional DNA replication forks when cells are exposed to genotoxic agents. In budding yeast, the protein kinases Mec 1 (ATR) and Rad 53 (Chk 2) are especially important in this process. How these kinases act to stabilize DNA replication forks is currently unknown but is likely to have important implications for understanding how genomic instability is generated during oncogenesis and how chemotherapies that interfere with DNA replication could be improved. Here we show that the sensitivity of rad 53 mutants to DNA-damaging agents can be almost completely suppressed by deletion of the EXO 1 gene, which encodes an enigmatic flap endonuclease. Deletion of EXO 1 also suppresses DNA replication fork instability in rad 53 mutants. Surprisingly, deletion of EXO 1 is completely ineffective in suppressing both the sensitivity and replication fork <b>breakdown</b> in <b>mec</b> 1 mutants, indicating that Mec 1 has a genetically separable role in replication fork stabilization from Rad 53. Finally, our analysis indicates that a second downstream effector kinase, Chk 1, can stabilize replication forks in the absence of Rad 53. These results reveal previously unappreciated complexity in the downstream targets of the checkpoint kinases and provide a framework for elucidating the mechanisms of DNA replication fork stabilization by these kinases...|$|R
40|$|As {{both the}} major {{input and output}} of the hippocampal formation, the entorhinal cortex (EC) {{occupies}} a pivotal position in the medial temporal lobe. The discovery of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) has led to this region being widely implicated in spatial information processing. Importantly, the EC is also the first area affected by dementia pathology, with neurons appearing particularly susceptible to degeneration. Despite this, {{little is known about}} how pathology affects the functional output of mEC neurons, either in their ability to coordinate firing to produce network oscillations, or to represent information regarding the external environment. This thesis will use electrophysiological techniques to examine how dementia pathology contributes to the <b>breakdown</b> of <b>mEC</b> neuronal networks using the rTg 4510 mouse model of tauopathy. The first 2 results chapters will show how the anatomical organisation along the dorso-ventral axis of the mEC has profound influence on the network activity that can be observed both in brain slices and awake-behaving mice. It will further show how deficits in network activity in rTg 4510 mice occur differentially across this axis, with dorsal mEC appearing more vulnerable to changes in oscillatory function than ventral. The third results chapter will begin to explore the relationship between global network activity and the external environment, showing that rTg 4510 mice display clear deficits in the relationship between oscillation properties and locomotor activity. Finally, the underlying basis for these changes will be examined, through the recording of single-unit activity in these mice. It will show a decreased tendency for mEC neurons to display firing rates modulated by running speed, as well as an almost complete breakdown of grid cell periodicity after periods of tau overexpression. Understanding how dementia pathology produces changes to neuronal function and ultimately cognition is key for understanding and treating the disease. This thesis will therefore provide novel insights into the dysfunction of the EC during dementia pathology...|$|R
