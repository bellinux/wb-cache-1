25|$|Second, {{some believe}} there is a {{difficulty}} in fitting them into Paul's biography as we have it. They, like Colossians and Ephesians, were written from prison <b>but</b> <b>suppose</b> Paul's release and travel thereafter.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>suppose</b> we rename 0 and 1 to 1 and 0 respectively. Then {{it would}} still be Boolean algebra, and {{moreover}} operating on the same values. However it would not be identical to our original Boolean algebra because now we find ∨ behaving the way ∧ used to do and vice versa. So there are still some cosmetic differences to show that we've been fiddling with the notation, despite the fact that we're still using 0s and 1s.|$|E
2500|$|Example: [...] {{suppose a}} ship {{intended}} to sail bearing east ("Levante") from point A to point B. <b>But</b> <b>suppose</b> that winds forced it to sail on a southeast-by-east course (SEbE, [...] "Quarto di Scirocco verso Levante"). [...] Southeast-by-east is three quarter winds (or 33.75°) away from east (on a 32-point compass, {{in order of}} quarter-winds away from east, 1 quarter is east-by-south, 2 quarters is East-southeast, 3 quarters is southeast-by-east). [...] That means that the navigator should consult the third row,q=3, on the toleta.|$|E

2500|$|Imagine {{that during}} the winter couples {{do not want to}} go out, but want to acquire more scrip for the summer. To compensate, the {{administration}} can lower the amount of extra scrip returned when parents want to borrow in the winter, and increase rates in the summer. [...] Depending upon the strength of the seasonality of babysitting, this might work. [...] <b>But</b> <b>suppose</b> the seasonality is so strong that no one wants {{to go out in the}} winter even when the administration sets its interest rates to zero. That is, suppose no parents want to go out even when they can borrow money for free. In this hypothetical situation, the co-op has fallen into a liquidity trap.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{have already}} {{discovered}} that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized {{that the number of}} the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. <b>But</b> <b>suppose</b> the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? ...|$|E
2500|$|The Flatiron Building {{has become}} an icon of New York City, and the public {{response}} to it was enthusiastic, but the critical response to {{it at the time}} was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of the engineering involved. Montgomery Schuyler, editor of Architectural Record, said that its [...] "awkwardness [...] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation." [...] He praised the surface of the building, and the detailing of the terra-cotta work, but criticized the practicality of the large number of windows in the building: [...] " [...] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close {{in front of him and}} close behind him and close on one side of him. <b>But</b> <b>suppose</b> he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?" ...|$|E
