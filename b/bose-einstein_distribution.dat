30|$|A less {{widely known}} and less {{developed}} aspect of low-dimensional physics concerns {{the impact of}} dimensionality of a system on its thermal and statistical properties. The derivation of the basic Fermi-Dirac or <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distributions</b> from maximal information entropy under the boundary conditions of given energy and particle number (if we use a grand canonical ensemble) {{does not depend on}} the number of dimensions. However, the calculation of partition functions and thermodynamic quantities from the Fermi-Dirac or <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distributions</b> involves d-dimensional integrals; therefore, thermal properties of a system will depend on the number of dimensions in which particles can move. I would hope that the introduction in this section can serve as a brief compendium and overview of basic aspects of this dependence of thermal properties on d. We will find that the specific heat in particular is affected by d. Due to the particular relevance of confined fermionic charge and spin carriers for nano-technology, we will focus on low-dimensional implications of Fermi-Dirac statistics.|$|R
50|$|This {{equation}} is more useful than the principal one above, yet still incomplete, since f cannot be solved unless the collision term in f is known. This term cannot be found as easily or generally {{as the others}} - it is a statistical term representing the particle collisions, and requires knowledge of the statistics the particles obey, like the Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac or <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distributions.</b>|$|R
25|$|The <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>distribution,</b> which {{applies only}} to a quantum system of non-interacting bosons, is easily derived from the grand {{canonical}} ensemble.

25|$|In mathematics, the polylogarithm (also {{known as}} Jonquière's {{function}}, for Alfred Jonquière) {{is a special}} function Lis(z) of order s and argument z. Only for special values of s does the polylogarithm reduce to an elementary function such as the natural logarithm or rational functions. In quantum statistics, the polylogarithm function appears as the closed form of integrals of the Fermi–Dirac distribution and the <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>distribution,</b> and {{is also known as}} the Fermi–Dirac integral or the Bose–Einstein integral. In quantum electrodynamics, polylogarithms of positive integer order arise in the calculation of processes represented by higher-order Feynman diagrams.|$|E

40|$|A new hybrid Multiphase Simulated Annealing Algorithm using Boltzmann and <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distributions</b> (MPSABBE) is proposed. MPSABBE was {{designed}} for solving the Protein Folding Problem (PFP) instances. This new approach has four phases: (i) Multiquenching Phase (MQP), (ii) Boltzmann Annealing Phase (BAP), (iii) Bose-Einstein Annealing Phase (BEAP), and (iv) Dynamical Equilibrium Phase (DEP). BAP and BEAP are simulated annealing searching procedures based on Boltzmann and <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distributions,</b> respectively. DEP is also a simulated annealing search procedure, which is applied at the final temperature of the fourth phase, which {{can be seen as}} a second Bose-Einstein phase. MQP is a search process that ranges from extremely high to high temperatures, applying a very fast cooling process, and is not very restrictive to accept new solutions. However, BAP and BEAP range from high to low and from low to very low temperatures, respectively. They are more restrictive for accepting new solutions. DEP uses a particular heuristic to detect the stochastic equilibrium by applying a least squares method during its execution. MPSABBE parameters are tuned with an analytical method, which considers the maximal and minimal deterioration of problem instances. MPSABBE was tested with several instances of PFP, showing that the use of both distributions is better than using only the Boltzmann distribution on the classical SA...|$|R

2500|$|Planck's law arises as a {{limit of}} the <b>Bose–Einstein</b> <b>{{distribution}},</b> the energy distribution describing non-interactive bosons in thermodynamic equilibrium. In the case of massless bosons such as photons and gluons, the chemical potential is zero and the <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distribution</b> reduces to the Planck distribution. [...] There is another fundamental equilibrium energy distribution: the Fermi–Dirac distribution, which describes fermions, such as electrons, in thermal equilibrium. The two distributions differ because multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state, while multiple fermions cannot. At low densities, the number of available quantum states per particle is large, and this difference becomes irrelevant. In the low density limit, the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac distribution each reduce to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.|$|E

40|$|A {{proof of}} the quantum $H$-theorem taking into account nonextensive effects on the quantum entropy $S^Q_q$ is shown. The positiveness of the time {{variation}} of $S^Q_q$ combined with a duality transformation implies that the nonextensive parameter $q$ lies in the interval [0, 2]. It is also shown that the equilibrium states are described by quantum $q$-power law extensions of the Fermi-Dirac and <b>Bose-Einstein</b> <b>distributions.</b> Such results reduce to the standard ones in the extensive limit, thereby showing that the nonextensive entropic framework can be harmonized with the quantum distributions contained in the quantum statistics theory.
