5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower {{form the basis for}} a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.|$|E
5|$|As Minister of Education, ML Pin {{established}} the Regional Education Development Project including higher education, which aimed {{to study the}} needs and limitations of education systems in the provinces. Spanning over two years, results of the project included the improvement of cooperation between government officials and Muslim locals in the four southernmost provinces, recognition {{of the need for}} children living near the Malay and Cambodian borders to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the Thai language before starting school, and the experimental development of a curriculum based on learners' needs and interests at Suranaree School.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those who might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because {{it was believed that}} they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{breadth of}} commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts {{that the average}} person knows is very large. Research {{projects}} that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time. A major {{goal is to have}} the computer understand enough concepts to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> by reading from sources like the Internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.|$|E

The South China tigers of the project has since been successfully rewilded and are fully capable of hunting and surviving on their own. This project is also very successful in the breeding of these rewilded South China tigers and 14 cubs have been born in the project of which 11 survived.

25|$|Sebastian Stoskopff {{was born}} in 1597 in Strasbourg. His father was {{employed}} by the city since 1590 and acted as a mounted courier or royal escort, driving a one-horse carriage. In 1614, Stoskopff's father asked the Strasbourg council for help for his 17-year-old son. He wanted him to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the craft of painting, since Sebastian had already been extremely talented in drawing and painting since he was 15. The council agreed to provide their support and probably sent the young artist at first to the Strasbourg painter and copper engraver, Friedrich Brentel. However, he only learned how to further refine his drawing and was not, as hoped, introduced {{to the art of}} painting.|$|E

25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do not want to hear from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{begin the}} process of {{language}} acquisition by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes language-specific, i.e. they learn how to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences that may well be contrastive in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of plosives, whereas Thai has three categories; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the contrastive ones, their perception becomes categorical. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age. Some researchers have proposed that infants may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called statistical learning. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness).|$|E

500|$|A {{perceptron}} {{was a form}} {{of neural}} network introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt, who had been a schoolmate of Marvin Minsky at the Bronx High School of Science. Like most AI researchers, he was optimistic about their power, predicting that [...] "perceptron may eventually <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> make decisions, and translate languages." [...] An active research program into the paradigm was carried out throughout the 60s but came to a sudden halt with the publication of Minsky and Papert's 1969 book Perceptrons. It suggested that there were severe limitations to what perceptrons could do and that Frank Rosenblatt's predictions had been grossly exaggerated. The effect of the book was devastating: virtually no research at all was done in connectionism for 10 years. Eventually, a new generation of researchers would revive the field and thereafter it would become a vital and useful part of artificial intelligence. Rosenblatt would not live to see this, as he died in a boating accident shortly after the book was published.|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E
500|$|She is a {{powerful}} necromancer; while she is surveying dead bodies in a battlefield {{it is noted that}} [...] "If she had tried to raise up the entire army on the field to return to war, the laws of Erebus would have yielded, and a hostpulled from the Stygian Avernus by her terrible powerwould have gone to war." [...] It {{is for this reason that}} she is sought by Pompey the Great's son, Sextus Pompeius. He wants her to perform a necromantic rite so that he might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the outcome of the Battle of Pharsalus. Erichtho complies and wanders amidst a battlefield to seek out a cadaver with [...] "uninjured tissues of a stiffened lung". She cleans the corpse's organs, and fills the body with a potion (consisting of, among other things, a mixture of warm blood, [...] "lunar poison", and [...] "everything that nature wickedly bears") so as to bring the dead body back to life. The spirit is summoned, but, at first, refuses to return to its old body. She then promptly threatens the entire universe by promising to summon [...] "that god at whose dread name earth trembles". Immediately following this outburst, the corpse is reanimated and offers a bleak description of a civil war in the underworld, as well as a rather ambiguous (at least, to Sextus Pompeius) prophecy about the fate that lies in store for Pompey and his kin.|$|E
