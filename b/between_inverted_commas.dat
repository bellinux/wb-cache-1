60|$|But {{that his}} Works, {{whatever}} might be their reception upon the stage, made but little impression upon the ruling Intellects of the time, may {{be inferred from}} the fact that Lord Bacon, in his multifarious writings, nowhere either quotes or alludes to him.[10]--His dramatic excellence enabled him to resume possession of the stage after the Restoration; but Dryden tells us that in his time two of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher were acted for one of Shakspeare's. And so faint and limited was the perception of the poetic beauties of his dramas in the time of Pope, that, in his Edition of the Plays, with a view of rendering to the general reader a necessary service, he printed <b>between</b> <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> those passages which he thought most worthy of notice.|$|E

50|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>commas</b> are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} first one is right-leaning, and the second one is left-leaning, coming after the ending punctuation mark of the direct speech sentence. If what the <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> enclose is not a sentence in itself but only a part thereof, the second <b>inverted</b> <b>comma</b> stands left-leaning directly to the ending character. This is the same as in the so-called British or logical quoting.|$|R

6000|$|I {{think those}} speeches which are related--those parts where the speaker repeats a speech, such as Glaucus's {{repetition}} of Circe's words, should have <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> to every line. In this {{there is a}} little confusion.--If we divide the speeches into identical and related; and to the former put merely one <b>inverted</b> <b>Comma</b> at the beginning and another at the end; and to the latter <b>inverted</b> <b>Commas</b> before every line, the book will be better understood at the 1st glance. Look at pages 126, 127, you will find in the 3d line the beginning of a related speech marked thus [...] "Ah! art awake--" [...] while, at the same time, in the next page the continuation of the identical speech is marked in the same manner, [...] "Young man of Latmos--" [...] You will find on the other side all the parts which should have <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> to every line.|$|R

60|$|And <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> are so inhospitable. If {{you must}} take in another man's offspring, you should surely {{try to make the}} poor foundlings feel at home.

I never see <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> but I think of the necessary persecuted mediæval Jew in yellow gabardine.|$|R

60|$|In this edition, the {{greatest}} care {{has been taken}} to preserve the exact words of the author, as he first published them; where he altered or added to the text in subsequent editions, it is marked with an <b>inverted</b> <b>comma,</b> or inserted in the notes. Obsolete words and customs are explained; the numbering of his sections is continued, in addition to which, it is divided into chapters for family reading, upon the plan of the late Rev. J. Ivimey; double <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> denote quotations of Scripture.|$|R

60|$|In all {{editorial}} {{notes the}} titles given by Wordsworth to his Poems are invariably printed in italics, not with <b>inverted</b> <b>commas</b> before and after, as Wordsworth himself so often printed them: {{and when he}} gave no title to a poem, its first line will be invariably placed within <b>inverted</b> <b>commas.</b> This plan of using Italics, and not Roman letters, applies also to the title of any book referred to by Wordsworth, or by his sister in her Journals. Whether they put the title in italics, or within commas, it is always italicised in this edition.|$|R

50|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>commas</b> {{are also}} used when trying to stress a curious use of a word: that is, to {{illustrate}} that a word is not used as it normally is, or simply to emphasise it.
