5|$|Later in the 20th century, as disruptively {{patterned}} uniforms became widespread, winter {{variants of}} patterns such as Flecktarn were developed, the <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> (such as green) being replaced with white {{to form a}} Schneetarn (snow camouflage pattern). Aircraft deployed in winter have sometimes been snow camouflaged, as with Sepecat Jaguars on exercise in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} has three subspecies, with the {{nominate}} subspecies, T. p. philomelos, covering {{the majority of}} the species' range. T. p. hebridensis, described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913, is a mainly sedentary (non-migratory) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is the darkest subspecies, with a dark brown back, greyish rump, pale buff <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> to the underparts and grey-tinged flanks.|$|E
40|$|Background: Software {{product line}} {{engineering}} provides an effective mechanism to implement variable software. However, using preprocessors to realise variability, which is typical in industry, is heavily criticised, because it {{often leads to}} obfuscated code. Using <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> to highlight code annotated with preprocessor statements to support comprehensibility has shown effective, however, scalability to large software product lines (SPLs) is questionable. Aim: Our goal is to implement and evaluate scalable usage of <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> for industrial-sized SPLs. Method: We designed and implemented scalable concepts in a tool called FeatureCommander. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a controlled experiment with a large real-world SPL with over 99, 000 lines of code and 340 features. We used a within-subjects design with treatments colours and no colours. We compared correctness and response time of tasks for both treatments. Results: For certain kinds of tasks, <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> improve program comprehension. Furthermore, subjects generally favour <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> compared to no <b>background</b> <b>colours.</b> Additionally, subjects who worked with <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> {{had to use the}} search functions less frequently. Conclusion: We show that <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> can improve program comprehension in large SPLs. Based on these encouraging results, we continue our work on improving program comprehension in large SPLs. I...|$|R

5|$|T. p. clarkei, {{described}} by German zoologist Ernst Hartert in 1909, and named for William Eagle Clarke, breeds {{in the rest}} of Great Britain and Ireland and on mainland Europe in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and possibly somewhat further east. It has brown upperparts which are warmer in tone than those of the nominate form, an olive-tinged rump and rich yellow <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> to the underparts. It is a partial migrant with some birds wintering in southern France and Iberia. This form intergrades with the nominate subspecies in central Europe, and with T. p. hebridensis in the Inner Hebrides and western Scotland, and in these areas birds show intermediate characteristics. Additional subspecies, such as T. p. nataliae of Siberia, proposed by the Russian Sergei Buturlin in 1929, are not widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from a palette of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one <b>background</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general <b>background</b> <b>colour.</b> Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E

5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only one level in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's <b>background</b> <b>colour.</b> Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E

25|$|This ident {{remained}} with the station {{until the end}} of its existence with some modifications, firstly the jingle was altered to nine notes on a guitar a few years later, and then the background was revealed to be blue in 1969 with the introduction of colour (blue was the <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> of the ident as used in black and white, being shot with black background and white star would have given too much contrast and overexposed the camera). This ident with blue <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> was maintained after the introduction of colour transmissions because this still provided a good contrast on black and white TV sets. This ident, occasionally supplemented by a subsequent caption stating 'The Station that serves the South', lasted until the company went off air in 1982.|$|E

The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite <b>background</b> <b>colour</b> of the German painter Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
