However, there has been insufficient consideration of how drivers may respond to FCWS. This driving simulator study focused on alarm timing and its impact on driver response to alarm. The experimental investigation considered driver perception of alarm timings and its influence on trust at three driving speeds (40, 60 and 70 mile/h) and two time headways (1. 7 and 2. 2 s). The results showed that alarm effectiveness varied in response to driving conditions. Alarm promptness had a greater influence on ratings of trust than improvements in braking performance enabled by the alarm system. Moreover, alarms which were presented after <b>braking</b> <b>actions</b> had been initiated were viewed as late alarms.

Some of these phenomena {{is followed by a}} change in tread profile which results in frequent wheel reprofiling to keep rich comfort of the vehicle. In this study, a series of full-scale tread braking experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel tread profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and tread braking. The presented results show that the maximum tread depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop <b>braking</b> <b>actions.</b> This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel tread induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from tread braking.

The feature being with constant ground following traction, and steering accomplished by front wheels (or sled in winter); full power was supplied to both tracks {{all the time and}} transmitted to the ground so there was no loss of tractive effort when turning. Lombard and most other crawlers used a rigid bed inside the tracks which would be lifted off the ground at times, and track-steer crawlers reduce power through clutch or <b>brake</b> <b>action</b> to their tracks to turn, losing additional tractive effort. With its payload carrying ability, the Linn did not require trailers or wagons to move a load, something which off-road terrain does not always permit, and no dead weight or ballast was needed for traction, as simply more payload could be added.|$|R

40|$|Heavy haul trains up {{to several}} {{kilometers}} long, as illustrated in Fig. 1, are widely used to transport minerals in South Africa. The cost of train scheduling and human resources can be reduced when long and heavy haul trains are used instead of short trains. Energy consumption, running time, and in-train forces are the main concerns relating to the control of long heavy haul trains [1]. Braking control is a fundamental issue in heavy haul train operations when in-train forces and safe operation are considered. As an improvement of the older pneumatic braking systems, electrically controlled pneumatic braking systems developed in the 1990 s provide various benefits, for instance, instantaneous response to the engineer’s commands on all vehicles, graduated release of brakes, and continual replenishment of braking air reservoirs [2]. To improve the operational performance of heavy haul trains, energy-saving entails speed-switching or distance-switching algorithms, where the operation of a train consists of periods of powering, coasting, and stopping [3], [4].

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the performances of the energy dissipation of a new railway disc brake concept, intended for an urban exploitation. Because of the increase in the rates of trains and subways as well as the number of passengers, brakes have become increasingly a major safety component. In urban exploitation, these systems are subjected to multiple <b>braking</b> <b>actions</b> and have operational limits. A new concept based on a liquid-cooled system is suggested to decrease the energy storage in the disc. A numerical model of this new concept was realized and its performances were estimated by comparing temperature evolution at the friction interface with that obtained with the classical brake. The temperatures reached on a single stop with the cooled concept are higher than those of a classical brake. However, an important temperature decrease is observed at the end of braking so that, for successive brakings, the liquid-cooling principle causes an overall decrease in temperature. Moreover, the use of a material with a high thermal effusivity increases the part of the flow generated at the interface transmitted to the pad and thus reduces the surface temperature...|$|R
