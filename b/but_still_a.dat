5|$|August 9, 1976- Hurricane Belle {{parallels}} the Delmarva Peninsula, prompting officials to issue hurricane warnings for the Delaware coastline. The {{core of the}} hurricane passes slightly {{to the east of}} the state, and consequentially produces lighter winds and less rainfall than expected <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> powerful storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1771, {{using the}} {{combined}} 1761 and 1769 transit data, the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande calculated the astronomical unit {{to have a}} value of 153 million kilometers (±1 million km). The precision was less than had been hoped for because of the black drop effect, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> considerable improvement on Horrocks's calculations.|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E

5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> subject – kissed the Queen's hand.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the most intense North Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Wilma of 2005, tying for seventh overall. Additionally, it made the third most intense Atlantic hurricane landfall. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that formed on August 13, 2007, Dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through the Saint Lucia Channel and into the Caribbean. It strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of Jamaica on August 20. The storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August21 as a powerful Category5 storm. It crossed the peninsula and emerged into the Bay of Campeche weakened, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> hurricane. It strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near Tecolutla in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 22. Dean drifted to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern United States. Dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure, only behind Cyclone George in the Australian region, and tied with Felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-day}} rest, the Lady Vols resumed their season with {{three games in}} five days, {{starting}} with their final non-conference opponent, Memphis, on the road. UT started strong, taking a 16–6 lead {{to open up the}} game, only to give it back up. Memphis delighted its home crowd by taking a 38–31 lead with two minutes to go in the half, but Tennessee rallied and took a two-point lead to the locker room. Once again, Tennessee pulled away in the second half, 91–65, behind three players who scored over twenty: Holdsclaw (31), Randall (21), and Catchings (20). The next game was against Auburn, a program that is traditionally competitive within the conference. Once again, Summitt's team started the game strong, leading 32–16 before Auburn woke up, cutting the lead to five by the half. However, the Tigers would not get any closer than this, as Holdsclaw's 39 points helped Tennessee to yet another win, 79–63. The final game of this stretch was the rematch with Vanderbilt, played on President's Day in front of a sellout crowd at the Commodores' quirky Memorial Gymnasium and a national television audience on ESPN. The Commodores started off strong, taking a 16–7 lead in front of their home crowd. However Tennessee responded with seventeen straight points to take the lead, and led by nine at the halftime. As in previous games, the Lady Vols made a big run to open up the second half to put the game out of reach. UT won 91–60, with UT shooting over fifty percent yet again. The final game of the regular season came against LSU, a respectable SEC team which beat the Lady Vols the previous season in Baton Rouge, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> few seasons away from becoming a national power. Tennessee played well on Senior Night, starting with a 32–8 lead that would never be given up. Tennessee completed the season with a 90–58 win, giving them a perfect 30–0 regular season.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Allen campaign, Republicans in 1956 offered a congressional candidate in Louisiana's 2nd congressional district, which then encompassed parts of Orleans and Jefferson parishes.

Aftab Ahmed and Khaled Mashud held out for 11 overs, but Rangana Herath took the wicket of Aftab and the last two batsmen, leaving Bangladesh all out for 197 - an improvement by 27 runs in the loss margin, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> comprehensive defeat.|$|E
25|$|In 964, Brian's older brother, Mathgamain, claimed {{control over}} the entire {{province}} of Munster by capturing the Rock of Cashel, capital of the ancient Eóganachta, the hereditary overlords or High Kings of Munster, but who in dynastic strife and with multiple assassinations had weakened themselves to the point they were now impotent. Earlier attacks from both the Uí Néill and Vikings were also factors. This situation allowed the illegitimate (from the Eóganacht perspective) but militarized Dál Cais to attempt to seize the provincial kingship. Mathgamain was never fully recognized and was opposed throughout {{his career in the}} 960s and 970s by Máel Muad mac Brain, a semi-outsider from the Cashel perspective <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> legitimate Eóganacht claimant from far south Munster.|$|E

25|$|In March 1152, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine {{had their}} {{marriage}} annulled under {{the pretext of}} consanguinity at the council of Beaugency. The terms of the annulment left Eleanor as duchess of Aquitaine <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> vassal of Louis. Eight weeks later she married Henry, thus Henry became duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and count of Poitiers. Now Henry refused to give Anjou to his brother because it would mean splitting his land in two. A coalition of Henry's enemies was formed by Louis VII: Stephen of England and his son Eustace IV of Boulogne (married to Louis' sister); Henry I, Count of Champagne (betrothed to Louis' daughter), Robert of Dreux (Louis' brother) and Henry's brother, Geoffrey, who saw he wouldn't receive Anjou.|$|E
25|$|The series premiere drew an {{audience}} of 2.1 million, an exceptionally strong rating for domestic programming in the Canadian television market, and on par with Canadian ratings for popular American series. It was, in fact, the largest audience the CBC had achieved in a decade for an entertainment program. By comparison, Corner Gas, one of the highest-rated Canadian TV shows, attracts just under {{one and a half}} million viewers for a typical episode. The second episode, airing against the second night of the much-anticipated season premiere of American Idol in most markets, had 1.2 million viewers, a sharp drop <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> high rating for a Canadian sitcom, and very high for CBC Television, which has had trouble garnering large audiences for its scripted programming in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Põhja-Kõrvemaa Nature Reserve was {{established}} in the end of 1991, a few months after Estonia regained its independence. Throughout the Soviet Era {{a large part of the}} nature reserve's current territory was used by Soviet Army for military training and as such was closed to the public. The proving grounds were established in 1947 and in 1953 expanded to 33 304 ha (333km2), making it the biggest Soviet military polygon in Estonia. Still, the Soviet Army damaged only about 10% of the proving grounds' territory, leaving the rest intact. Due to unsuitability for agriculture (poor and/or badly drained soils) the whole region has always been very sparsely populated – in the beginning of the 1950s the population density was around 1 people per km2 – <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> few hundred people were displaced together with the creation of proving ground.|$|E

25|$|A {{portrait}} of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the treaty of Fort Wayne in 1809, adding much of southwestern lands around Vincinnes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory. Settlements were military outposts, Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincinnes settlement on the lower Wabash, Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis wouldn't be a populated place for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained savage wilderness. Indian presence was waning, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> threat to settlement. Only two counties, Clark and Dearborn in the extreme southeast, had been organized. Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse. Migration was chiefly by flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).|$|E
25|$|Support for {{the monarchy}} floated around 80%, unless {{members of the}} royal family engaged in dubious activities. Examples of these are when in 2000, Beatrix went on a winter sport holiday in Austria, that was boycotted by Europe at the time because Jörg Haider's Freedom Party was in government, or when Willem-Alexander and Máxima had a villa built in Mozambique in 2007, which they {{eventually}} abandoned under great pressure. Geert Wilders, leader of the new right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), was displeased by the 2007 Christmas speech by queen Beatrix, which he found biased and full of thinly veiled criticism of the PVV. Ever since, he has argued for the king/queen to be deprived of all political powers, but also to maintain a purely ceremonial kingship, although some suspect the PVV and/or Wilders to actually be republican. According to a survey by Maurice de Hond from 2014, the percentage of convinced republican is twice as high amongst PVV voters (29%) than the general public (15%), <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> minority.|$|E
