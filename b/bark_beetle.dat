5|$|In {{response}} to Gibbs' efforts to advance {{understanding of the}} ongoing <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> epidemic, Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter signed an executive order in February 2008 creating the Colorado Forest Health Advisory Council; Gibbs {{was named to the}} 24-member panel shortly after its creation. Following the legislative session, Gibbs was also named the chairman of an interim legislative committee to study wildfire issues, but was criticized by Republicans for delaying the start of the committee's work. The following day, Gibbs announced plans for the committee's first meeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae, is {{a species of}} <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> native to the forests of western North America from Mexico to central British Columbia. It has a hard black exoskeleton, and measures approximately 5mm, {{about the size of}} a grain of rice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>beetles</b> {{communicate}} with one another using semiochemicals, compounds or mixtures that carry messages.

40|$|<b>Bark</b> <b>Beetles</b> {{are tiny}} {{naturally}} occurring insects {{that contribute to}} the death of thousands of trees in the Southwest each year. Most species of conifers are utilized by <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Even freshly cut logs are an ideal host for many <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> The buildup of beetle populations, whether in infested trees or firewood, can then attack nearby live trees. Precautionary steps can reduce the likelihood of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> that have infested firewood, attacking live trees...|$|R

25|$|Colorado’s {{forests are}} densely wooded, making them much more {{susceptible}} to <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> attack. Current legislation is in place {{to help with the}} growing beetle problem. Colorado Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet announced that Colorado will receive $30 million of the $40 million being diverted by the U.S. Forest Service to fight the millions of acres of damage caused by the mountain pine beetle in the Rocky Mountain region.|$|E
25|$|Nematodes {{that survive}} below 0°C include Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Panagrolaimus davidi. Cockroach nymphs (Periplaneta japonica) survive {{short periods of}} {{freezing}} at -6 to -8°C. The red flat <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Cucujus clavipes) can survive after being frozen to -150°C. The fungus gnat Exechia nugatoria can survive after being frozen to -50°C, by a unique mechanism whereby ice crystals form in the body but not the head. Another freeze-tolerant beetle is Upis ceramboides. See insect winter ecology and antifreeze protein. Another invertebrate that is briefly tolerant to temperatures down to -273°C is the tardigrade.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of checkered beetle's feeding habits is quite evident when different species are examined. The Necrobia spp. {{are attracted to}} dry carrion and other decomposing animal matter such as bones and skin as well as various meat products. Thanasimus spp. are found in woodland areas where <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> species constitute their main source of prey. The primary source of prey for the Phyllobaenus spp. are wood borers, immature weevils, and hymenoptera larvae. One of the more diverse genera is Trichodes, the larvae feed on the pollen of flowering plants and adults prey upon grasshoppers and wasps.|$|E
50|$|The ant beetle (Thanasimus formicarius), {{also known}} as the European red-bellied clerid, is a medium size insect, rather soft-bodied, with strong mandibles that can tear between the hard sclerotized {{integument}} of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Larvae and adults are common predators of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> in Europe.|$|R

25|$|Nystatin is a polyene {{antifungal}} drug {{to which}} many molds and yeast infections are sensitive. It {{was also the}} first antifungal antibiotic to be safe and effective in treating human diseases. Not only did it cure many serious fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract, but it could also be combined with antibacterial drugs to balance their side effects. Over the years, Nystatin proved effective not only in fighting human diseases, but was also used to stop fungal growth on flood-damaged works of art in Florence, Italy. It also showed effectiveness in slowing the spread of Dutch Elm Disease, a fungal disease of elm trees spread by the elm <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} with some clerid species. Forensic research is limited {{because of their}} late arrival on carrion, but members such as Thanasimus undatulus have been researched as a possible role in integrated pest management or IPM. Thanasimus undatulus is a predator of bark beetles. Some species of bark beetles such as the southern pine beetle and the mountain pine beetle can become pests to the lumber industry because in large numbers they can cause damage and kill live trees. Thanasimus undatulus has been researched as a possible biological control agent for these pests. Researchers and forestry officials have used <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> aggreagation pheromones to attract the checkered beetle to specific trees. This causes the bark beetles to be overwhelmed, extensively preyed upon by the clerid beetles, and typically eliminated.|$|E
25|$|More than 100 insects {{have been}} {{reported}} to infest hickory trees and wood products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Scolytus quadrispinosus) is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and {{also one of the most}} important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During drought periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds.|$|E

500|$|Exotic {{species of}} flora {{that are not}} native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These {{non-native}} plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over [...] of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|E
500|$|All {{insects are}} poikilothermic, so {{the ability of}} a few beetles to live in extreme environments depends on their {{resilience}} to unusually high or low temperatures. The <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Pityogenes chalcographus can survive [...] whilst overwintering beneath tree bark; the Alaskan beetle Cucujus clavipes puniceus is able to withstand its larvae may survive [...] At these low temperatures, the formation of ice crystals in internal fluids is the biggest threat to survival to beetles, but this is prevented through the production of antifreeze proteins that stop water molecules from grouping together. The low temperatures experienced by Cucujus clavipes can be survived through their deliberate dehydration in conjunction with the antifreeze proteins. This concentrates the antifreezes several fold. The hemolymph of the mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor contains several antifreeze proteins. The Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides can survive −60°C: its cryoprotectants are xylomannan, a molecule consisting of a sugar bound to a fatty acid, and the sugar-alcohol, threitol.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the years}} 1970 and 2012, Shoshone National Forest {{averaged}} 25 fires annually, of which half {{were due to}} natural ignition from lightning, which accounted for 90percent of the total acreage burned. The remaining acreage that burned was due to campfires that got out of control or from other causes. In Shoshone National Forest, the highest fire incidence is generally in the months of August and September. An average of [...] burns annually, with the worst year {{in the past century}} being 1988, when [...] burned from fires that had spread from the conflagration that engulfed Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding region. After the Yellowstone region fires of 1988, an effort to identify areas of similar fire potential was implemented. Fire managers at Shoshone National Forest work with a number of outside agencies to incorporate fire restrictions, fuels management, and a controlled burn plans to reduce the chances of a catastrophic fire. The dead and dying trees which have been killed by various species of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> may have a great impact on future forest fires. Fire managers have stated the worst time for increased fire activity is 1–2years after the trees are killed and then again after the trees have fallen many years later.|$|E

[...] In {{some parts of}} the natural area, western junipers are sparse, covering {{less than one percent of}} the land. [...] However, much of Lost Forest is characterized by co-dominance of ponderosa pine and western juniper. [...] Some of the older junipers are very large. [...] One specimen is the largest known western juniper in Oregon, reaching a height of [...] <b>Bark</b> <b>beetle</b> attacks and drought in the 1920s and the 1930s resulted in high juniper mortality from which the population has not fully recovered.|$|E
2500|$|Herbivores {{are unable}} to digest complex {{cellulose}} and rely on mutualistic, internal symbiotic bacteria, fungi, or protozoa to break down cellulose {{so it can be}} used by the herbivore. [...] Microbial symbionts also allow herbivores to eat plants that would otherwise be inedible by detoxifying plant secondary metabolites. [...] For example, fungal symbionts of cigarette beetles (Lasioderma serricorne) use certain plant allelochemicals as their source of carbon, in addition to producing detoxification enzymes (esterases) to get rid of other toxins. Microbial symbionts also assist in the acquisition of plant material by weakening a host plant's defenses. [...] Some herbivores are more successful at feeding on damaged hosts. As an example, several species of <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> introduce blue stain fungi of the genera Ceratocystis and Ophiostoma into trees before feeding. The blue stain fungi cause lesions that reduce the trees' defensive mechanisms and allow the bark beetles to feed.|$|E
