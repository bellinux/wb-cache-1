5|$|Concepts {{for a third}} {{installment}} in the Parasite Eve {{video game}} series had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> some time. As work was being finished on , Nomura voiced his wish {{to create a new}} game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked well together on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA mobile service. In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday {{at the same time as}} fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled.|$|E

25|$|These are the {{earliest}} multicellular organisms in Earth’s history, {{despite the fact}} that unicellularity had <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a long time before that. The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{crafting}} objects out of silver, {{also known}} as silversmithing, has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> centuries. With the creation of hand-made silver objects, the issue of cleaning and caring for these items were a concern. Silversmiths would give advice to clients on how to properly care for their silver. Here are examples of instructions given by silversmiths in the 17th and 18th Century.|$|E

25|$|In the 1975s and 1977s Simpson {{discovered}} {{the fact that}} Beryllium-10 nuclei are scarce in cosmic rays, and that that scarcity indicates that they have <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> about 2 x 107 years. This led him to conclude that cosmic rays pass freely between the gaseous disk and the extended magnetic halo portion of the galaxy, where the ambient gas density is more like 10−2 atoms/cm3 or less.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of running}} a rail line down Hiawatha Avenue had already <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> {{at least a decade}} by the time the {{decision}} was made to go forward. In 1985, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had produced an Environmental Impact Statement that concluded that light rail was the best alternative for the corridor. In 1996, the document was examined again as Mn/DOT looked at the possibility of adding bus rapid transit along the road, but money for light rail became available soon after, leading to the current layout.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 Volcanologists with Natural Resources Canada {{monitored}} Mount Meager {{after discovering}} that the mountain {{shows signs of}} low-level volcanic activity. The biggest risk to the public is on Job Glacier, where large fumaroles were discovered. While there was some indication that the fumarole field has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the last 40 years, that July a helicopter pilot who was trained as a geologist noticed the fumaroles on the glacier. On top of that, throughout the summer of 2016 the NRC received reports of a sulphuric smell around the valley of Mount Meager.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of joining together {{with family and}} friends to share ownership of vacation property has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> many years. But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized that people did not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates there were over 250 fractional developments in North America in 2006 and fractional properties can now be found throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|A small {{natural gas}} {{industry}} in Central Canada had already <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> several decades, {{but the most}} significant event in the industry's early history was probably the {{drilling of a well}} near Medicine Hat in 1890, in search of coal for the railway. The well encountered a large flow of natural gas, and this prompted town officials to approach the Canadian Pacific Railway with a view to drilling deeper for gas. The resulting enterprise {{led to the development of}} the Medicine Hat gas field in 1904. The community took advantage of the natural resource and became the first town or city in western Canada with a gas utility.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of docking has <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> centuries, and {{is older than}} the Doberman as a breed. The putative reason for docking {{is to ensure that}} the tail does not {{get in the way of}} the dog's work. Docking has always been controversial. The American Kennel Club standard for Doberman Pinschers includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra. Docking is a common practice in the United States, Russia and Japan (as well as a number of other countries with Doberman populations), where it is legal. In many European countries and Australia, docking has been made illegal, and in others it is limited.|$|E
25|$|Though {{there is}} {{evidence}} that ocular implants have <b>been</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> thousands of years modern nonintegrated spherical intraconal implants came into existence around 1976 (not just glass eyes). Nonintegrated implants contain no unique apparatus for attachments to the extraocular muscles and do not allow in-growth of organic tissue into their inorganic substance. Such implants have no direct attachment to the ocular prosthesis. Usually, these implants are covered with a material that permits ﬁxation of the extraocular recti muscles, such as donor sclera or polyester gauze which improves implant motility, but does not allow for direct mechanical coupling between the implant and the artiﬁcial eye.|$|E
