5|$|Despite his return, Serevi's {{team did}} not {{do well in the}} first two legs of the 2008–09 World Sevens Series, losing their semi-finals in both to South Africa. He also clashed with the Fiji Rugby Union over <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of player {{selection}} duties. As a result, he was dismissed on 29 January 2009. Iliesa Tanivula took over the post {{for the rest of the}} series.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2012, Barton played 45 {{minutes of}} a {{friendly}} match for League Two team Fleetwood Town in the club's 4–0 win over Kilmarnock. He had been training with Fleetwood after <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of Queens Park Rangers' tour of Malaysia. Fleetwood attempted to sign Barton on a six-month loan, but the deal was turned down by QPR.|$|E
5|$|After {{originally}} <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> the squad, he {{was given}} a last-minute call-up to play at the Toulon Tournament in May 2002, after Stephen Bywater was called up for the under-21 team. Howarth did not play in the first group match against Poland on 10 May 2002 as Bywater started, but in the second match against Portugal he was chosen ahead of Evans in a 1–0 victory over Portugal on 12 May. However, he was dropped for the final group match against Brazil on 14 May 2002 to make way for Evans, who also played in England's final match in the tournament against Japan on 17 May.|$|E

60|$|Here, {{away from}} the world, the villages were quiet and obscure--left behind. They had the same {{fascinating}} atmosphere of <b>being</b> forgotten, <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the world, that old English villages have.

5|$|Pre-game media {{coverage}} of the game focused on Auburn <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the national championship game, a point of controversy for Auburn fans in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game. Much was made of that and the success of Auburn running backs Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown, each of whom was considered among the best at his position. On the Virginia Tech side, senior quarterback Bryan Randall had a record-breaking season. Both teams also had high-ranked defenses, and Tech's appearance in the 2000 Sugar Bowl also was mentioned in the run-up to the game.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{struggled}} in 2001–02, finishing {{with a team}} worst −24 plus/minus while occasionally <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the lineup as a healthy scratch. Unhappy with his season, he focused on improving his game. He overcame rib, abdominal and wrist injuries in 2002–03 to establish himself as a top defender with the team and earned a second Masterton Trophy nomination for his dedication. The Flames rewarded him with a five-year contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. They also named him an alternate captain, a position he continuously held {{for the remainder of}} his stay in Calgary.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners faced much {{adversity}} in the Newcastle region {{because of}} the Australian Rugby League's Newcastle Knights team being already well established in the region. The club played its home games at Topper Stadium and missed out on the finals of the 1997 Super League season, but made the grand final of the World Club Challenge. The team was overshadowed by the Newcastle Knights who won the ARL competition and were admitted into the 1998 re-united competition. The Mariners were disbanded after <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the new competition because {{they believed that the}} Hunter region could not support two entities.|$|E
50|$|This quick success {{should not}} be {{confused}} with enthusiastic adoption of collective idealism on the part of the peasants. Still, demoralized after two successive (and harsh) collectivization campaigns and the events of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, the peasants were less keen to resist. As membership levels increased, those who remained outside likely grew worried about <b>being</b> permanently <b>left</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R

The ODIs were followed by three T20 matches at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand.

5|$|Mills' signings for 2012–13 {{proved to}} be less {{influential}} than his signings the previous summer, {{a number of new}} players <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the team with little playing time. York were in midtable for most {{of the first half of}} the season, and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team. Having been 14th in the table on 1 January 2013, York went on a run of 11 matches without a win, and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place. Mills was dismissed by York on 2 March 2013, an hour after the last of these matches, a 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of the script was {{distributed}} to the cast, but Patrick Stewart did not receive a copy. Berman was concerned that if anyone had a problem with it, they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> because he had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E

5|$|The victory gave Auburn fans {{hope that}} if Oklahoma won the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, a split {{national}} championship would result. By contract, {{the winner of the}} BCS National Championship Game is voted number one in the USA Today Coaches' Poll. In contrast, the Associated Press poll has no such restriction. Auburn's thin margin of victory over Tech put the prospect of split national title in doubt, though not out of reach. USC's blowout 55–19 victory over Oklahoma, however, made it likely that USC would be the overwhelming choice for first place. When the final college football polls of the season were released, USC was voted number one by a large margin, though three voters in the Associated Press poll voted Auburn first. More than three years after the game, ESPN sportswriter Ted Miller rated the game second on his list of victims of the BCS system, just behind USC <b>being</b> <b>left</b> <b>out</b> of the championship game in 2003.|$|E

50|$|Oliver! was {{the first}} musical {{adaptation}} of a famous Charles Dickens work to become a stage hit. There had been two previous Dickens musicals in the 1950s, both of them television adaptations of A Christmas Carol. The plot of Dickens' original novel is considerably simplified {{for the purposes of}} the musical, with Fagin being represented more as a comic character than as a villain, and large portions of the latter part of the story <b>being</b> completely <b>left</b> <b>out.</b> Although Dickens' novel has been called antisemitic in its portrayal of the Jew Fagin as evil, the production by Bart (himself a Jew) was more sympathetic and featured many Jewish actors in leading roles: Ron Moody (Ronald Moodnik), Georgia Brown (Lilian Klot), and Martin Horsey.|$|R

40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that clear-cut exclusion (e. g., <b>being</b> completely <b>left</b> <b>out)</b> worsens mood and threatens basic needs, as assessed by explicit self-report measures. Here, we investigated the impact of subtle exclusion on implicit mood and self-esteem, as well as the effect of introspection on the same implicit processes. In five rounds of a virtual three-person ball-tossing game, all participants were initially included (round 1), but encountered increasing levels of either subtle exclusion or subtle overinclusion (rounds 2 - 5). Following each round, participants completed implicit measures; half of the participants were randomly assigned to also complete explicit measures before the implicit measures, which served to increase introspection. Replicating previous findings, progressive exclusion negatively impacted explicit moods and needs. However, neither exclusion nor introspection affected implicit mood and self-esteem. The construct validity of implicit measures is discussed...|$|R
