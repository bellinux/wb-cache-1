25|$|Vincent had a {{particular}} interest in painting families of the working class, as seen in The Potato Eaters, his The Roulin Family series. He was influenced especially by the social realism of the English illustrators, such as Hubert von Herkomer, Samuel Luke Fildes, and Frank Holl, working for The Graphic, a British weekly illustrated newspaper founded by the social reformer William Luson Thomas. Van Gogh frequently referred to them in his letters, and he had obtained {{a complete set of}} <b>back</b> <b>numbers</b> of The Graphic between 1870 and 1880, decorating his studio with his favourite prints.|$|E
500|$|A third set of {{alternate}} uniforms {{honoring the}} 1978 Sounds are worn for Thursday home games {{in conjunction with}} Throwback Thursday promotions. The jerseys, similar to those worn by the 1978 team, are white pullover v-necks with bands of red, white, and blue around the neck, with larger bands at the sleeve openings. The word [...] "Sounds" [...] is written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script, with the player's number below the team name on the player's left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red. The right sleeve bears the round [...] "Slugger" [...] patch. White pants are worn with blue belts and blue stirrups. The cap is blue with a red brim, displaying an [...] "N" [...] styled like a music note in white, bordered by red. The team wears olive drab jerseys paired with white pants and home caps for all Sunday home games {{as a part of}} Military Sundays. These jerseys have the same [...] "Sounds" [...] wordmark and <b>back</b> <b>numbers</b> as appear on home uniforms, but they are presented in two-tone gray and tan camouflage instead of red. The player's number is located on the front, an American flag appears on the left sleeve, and ribbon honoring military personnel is found on the right sleeve. The team's batting practice cap is solid red with the guitar patch on the front.|$|E

Unless he found means to prevent it, her course of reading would take her from the year 1876 to the year 1877, and under that date, she would see the fatal report, heading the top of a column, and printed in conspicuous type.|$|E

60|$|Trevor {{opened the}} {{notebook}} {{and began to}} read what he had written. He finished the paragraph which owed its insertion to Clowes, and raced hurriedly on to the next.

As a rule the headmaster preferred that quotations from <b>back</b> <b>numbers</b> of Punch should be kept out of the prefects' English Essays. And he generally said as much. But today he seemed strangely preoccupied. A split infinitive in paragraph five, which at other times would have made him sit up in his chair stiff with horror, elicited no remark. The same immunity was accorded to the insertion (inspired by Clowes, as usual) of a popular catch phrase in the last few lines. Trevor finished with the feeling that luck had favoured him nobly.|$|E
