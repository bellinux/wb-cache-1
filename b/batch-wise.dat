In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms (remaining least or non-volatile fraction) removed at the end.

50|$|In {{chemical}} engineering, {{biochemical engineering}} and protein purification, crossflow filtration (also known as tangential flow filtration) {{is a type}} of filtration (a particular unit operation). Crossflow filtration is different from dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels tangentially {{across the surface of the}} filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike <b>batch-wise</b> dead-end filtration.|$|E

40|$|As an {{application}} of the CA cool storage simulation model developed and validated earlier, the implications of different product loading strategies (<b>batch-wise</b> and step-wise) on the product quality, mechanical plants performance and design aspects were investigated by considering a hypothetical CA cool storage facility. The <b>batch-wise</b> product loading {{was found to be}} advantageous with regards to firmness loss of the produce but was marginally energy intensive over the step-wise product loading strategy. Moreover, the step-wise loading scheme required low capacity individual evaporators and higher plant capacity of the gas-handling unit (N- 2 generator and CO 2 scrubber), as compared to the <b>batch-wise</b> product loading. It was demonstrated that using the model, appraisal of the implication of practical industrial operational procedures such as product loading strategy, on product quality and plant performance/design was possible, owing to the discrete continuous modeling approach.

40|$|Anaphylactic {{histamine}} {{release and}} the inhibition by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist fenoterol {{has been investigated}} using lung and tracheal tissues from two groups of guinea-pigs, differently sensitized to respond with IgG or IgE antibodies, respectively. A superfusion method was introduced and compared with classical batch incubation. The difference between IgG- and IgE-mediated histamine release during superfusion of both tissues was {{much greater than the}} difference obtained during batch-incubations. Fenoterol inhibited IgG-mediated histamine release during superfusion at lower concentrations and to a larger extent than the release from IgE-sensitized tissues. The inhibition by fenoterol was less pronounced after <b>batch-wise</b> incubations, preincubation at 0 -degrees-C abolished the quantitative difference of IgG- and IgE-mediated histamine release from lung slices as well as the difference in beta-adrenergic inhibition. It is concluded that the new superfusion procedure for airway tissues enhances the sensitivity of antigen-induced histamine release for pharmacological modulation, compared with <b>batch-wise</b> incubation.

40|$|Concerning {{process control}} of batch cooling {{crystallization}} the present work {{focused on the}} cooling profile and seeding technique. Secondly, the influence of additives on <b>batch-wise</b> precipitation process was investigated. Moreover, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for simulation of controlled batch cooling crystallization was developed. 	 A novel cooling model to control supersaturation level during <b>batch-wise</b> cooling crystallization was introduced. The crystallization kinetics together with operating conditions, i. e. seed loading, cooling rate and batch time, were {{taken into account in}} the model. Especially, the supersaturation- and suspension density- dependent secondary nucleation was included in the model. The interaction between the operating conditions and their influence on the control target, i. e. the constant level of supersaturation, were studied {{with the aid of a}} numerical solution for the cooling model. Further, the batch cooling crystallization was simulated with the ideal mixing model and CFD model. The moment transformation of the population balance, together with the mass and heat balances, were solved numerically in the simulation. In order to clarify a relationship betweenthe operating conditions and product sizes, a system chart was developed for anideal mixing condition. The utilization of the system chart to determine the appropriate operating condition to meet a required product size was introduced. With CFD simulation, batch crystallization, operated following a specified coolingmode, was studied in the crystallizers having different geometries and scales. The introduced cooling model and simulation results were verified experimentallyfor potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) and the novelties of the proposed control policies were demonstrated using potassium sulfate by comparing with the published results in the literature. The study on the <b>batch-wise</b> precipitation showed that immiscible additives could promote the agglomeration of a derivative of benzoic acid, which facilitated the filterability of the crystal product...|$|E

40|$|<b>Batch-wise</b> {{production}} {{is found in}} many industries. A good example of production systems which process products <b>batch-wise</b> are the ovens found in aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing. These systems mostly consist of multiple machines of different types, given the range and volumes of products which have to be handled. Building on earlier research in aircraft industry, where the process of hardening synthetic aircraft parts was studied, we propose new strategies for the dynamic control of these type of systems. These socalled 'look-ahead strategies' base their decision to schedule a job on a certain machine upon the availability of information on a few near future arrivals. Moreover, a general method is presented, which shows how such strategies may be constructed. Through simulation {{the performance of the}} new control strategies was demonstrated in terms of logistical costs for several system configurations. Results of these simulations are compared with those for alternative strategies. Next to the information on relative performance of the control strategies also valuable new insights were obtained with regard to the relationship between system configuration and its performance. As an important special case the effect of machine grouping on system performance is studied. ...|$|E

40|$|Several {{worst case}} {{scenarios}} {{were carried out}} for safety evaluation of an existing nitration process. Heterogeneous nitric acid decomposition is observed {{to be the worst}} credible scenario in the toluene nitration process. Fire or explosion may subsequently develop due to temperature or pressure runaway from the undesired reaction. Gassy nitric acid decomposition can easily be triggered by process derivation from the desired reaction. In this study, a heat-flux calorimeter (C 80 –II) and an adiabatic calorimeter (VSP 2) were used to measure the thermokinetics and determine the runaway characteristics for assessing worst credible scenarios. The heat of reaction of toluene mononitration is measured to be 190. 9 ± 6 3. 6 /(kJ mol− 1). The calculated Arrhenius parameters are Ea (kJ mol− 1) = 30. 9 ± 2. 1 and A (mol− 1. 5 l 1. 5 s− 1) = (1. 38 ± 0. 07) × 10 − 2. The ‘worst case’ scenarios were chosen at the following conditions: loss of cooling, stirrer failure, <b>batch-wise</b> charging, and decomposition of reactants. The experimentally determined worst case was found to be a combination of a loss of cooling with <b>batch-wise</b> charging coupled with decomposition of nitric acid with full mixing. Adiabatic temperature rise, self-heat rate, final pressure and non-condensable gas quantity in the VSP 2 experiment were used to assess thermal explosion in a nitration reactor.
