25|$|Meripilus giganteus is a polypore fungus in {{the family}} Meripilaceae. It causes a white rot in various types of broadleaved trees, {{particularly}} beech (Fagus), but also Abies, Picea, Pinus, Quercus and Ulmus species. This <b>bracket</b> <b>fungus,</b> {{commonly known as the}} giant polypore or black-staining polypore, is often found in large clumps at the base of trees, although fruiting bodies are sometimes found some distance away from the trunk, parasitizing the roots. M. giganteus has a circumboreal distribution in the northern Hemisphere, and is widely distributed in Europe. In the field, it is recognizable by the large, multi-capped fruiting body, as well as its pore surface that quickly darkens black when bruised or injured.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fossils of}} the {{putative}} <b>bracket</b> <b>fungus</b> Phellinites digiustoi {{are also found}} in the Cerro Cuadrado Petrified Forest. The latter was initially believed to be the oldest known mushroom-forming fungus (Agaricomycetes). Later examinations now make it likely that P.

2500|$|Ganoderma lucidum, and {{its close}} {{relative}} Ganoderma tsugae, {{grow in the}} northern Eastern Hemlock forests. [...] These two species of <b>bracket</b> <b>fungus</b> have a worldwide distribution in both tropical and temperate geographical regions, growing as a parasite or saprotroph {{on a wide variety}} of trees. [...] Similar species of Ganoderma have been found growing in the Amazon.|$|E
40|$|Drosophila mycetophaga has {{previously}} been reported to form male aggregations, constituting leks, {{on the underside of}} <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi.</b> Collections of flies from <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi</b> confirm male aggregations on white areas of <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi</b> but also show female aggregations around exudates from the fungi. Immature D. mycetophaga have been identified in these exudates. Because the exudate on some fungi is used as a breeding resource by females, male aggregations on these specimens are, by definition, not leks...|$|R

The literary data show that <b>bracket</b> <b>fungi</b> can be colonized even by endangered insects species, so the support of biodiversity is well-founded.
