500|$|... "Sad" [...] is a piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{fourteen}} seconds. It is written in the key of E minor, in common time, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of G5. [...] "Sad" [...] highlights Levine's soulful tone that his voice possesses. Nick Levine of NME labeled the song as [...] "an Adele-apeing weepie". Similarly, The New York Times Nate Chinen compared [...] "Sad" [...] to Adele's 2011 single [...] "Someone Like You". Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that it [...] "echoes Elton John in terms of epic scope and shows just how vulnerable Levine can get." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Sad" [...] is a song on which Levine [...] "achingly" [...] declares {{the end of his}} relationship and his heartbreak. According to Jacqui Swift, it was inspired by the singer's break up with Victoria's Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna. The song begins with the lyrics, [...] "Man, it's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> stuck thinking 'bout it." [...] The chorus is simple and consists of Levine singing [...] "I'm so Sad".|$|E

60|$|From some cause, I cannot {{set type}} nearly so fast as when I was at home. Sunday <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> and while others set 12 and 15,000, yesterday, I only set 10,000. However, I will shake this laziness off, soon, I reckon....|$|R
2500|$|In 1899, {{service to}} Hood Canal from Seattle's Pier 3 (now Pier 54) was {{effected}} by the propeller steamer Dode. [...] A typical wooden boat of the mosquito fleet, the 99-foot Dode left Seattle every Tuesday {{on the run}} to Kingston, Port Gamble, Seabeck, Brinnon, Holly, Dewatto, Lilliwaup Falls, Hoodsport, {{and at the end}} of what must have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> Union City.

6000|$|PICKERING [stretching himself] Well, I {{feel a bit}} tired. It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day.</b> The garden party, {{a dinner}} party, and the opera!

60|$|These {{three groups}} sat round the fire eyeing each other drily, {{and waiting for}} supper. Only one among them, one of the gentlemen {{belonging}} to the party of three, made advances towards conversation. Throwing out his lines for the Chief of the important tribe, while addressing himself to his own companions, he remarked, {{in a tone of}} voice which included all the company if they chose to be included, that it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> and that he felt for the ladies. That he feared one of the young ladies was not a strong or accustomed traveller, and had been over-fatigued two or three hours ago. That he had observed, from his station in the rear, that she sat her mule as if she were exhausted. That he had, twice or thrice afterwards, done himself the honour of inquiring of one of the guides, when he fell behind, how the lady did. That he had been enchanted to learn that she had recovered her spirits, and that it had been but a passing discomfort. That he trusted (by this time he had secured the eyes of the Chief, and addressed him) he might be permitted to express his hope that she was now none the worse, and that she would not regret having made the journey.|$|E

50|$|He {{was known}} for his high speed style of driving. 28 January 1970 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> which began with a return from a {{business}} meeting on the continent.

"You see," [...] said she, [...] "old Billy Simpson {{let this}} house fur a hundred dollars--there's eighty acres with it--to Sarah Ann Hemphill and her husband; and he's gone to Richmond to git stock for a wheelwright's shop. That's his trade, you know; and they're goin' {{to have the}} shop {{over there in the}} wagon-house, that can be fixed up easy enough ef Sam Hemphill chooses to work at it, which I don't believe he will; but he can work, ef he will, and this is just the place for a wheelwright's shop, ef the right man goes into the business; and they sold their two cows--keeping only the red-and-white heifer. I guess you {{remember}} that heifer; they got her of old Joe Sanders, on the Creek. And they sold one of their horses--the sorrel--and a mule; they hadn't no use fur 'em here, fur the land's not worth much, and hasn't seen no guano nor nothin' fur three or four years; and the money they got was enough to start a mighty good cooper-shop, ef Sam don't spend it all, or most of it, in Richmond, which I think he will; and of course, he being away, Sarah Ann wanted to go to her mother's, and she got herself ready and took them four children--and I pity the old lady, fur Sam's children never had no bringin' up. I disremember how old Tommy is, but it isn't over eight, and just as noisy as ef he wasn't the oldest. And so I come here {{to take care of the}} place; but I can't stay no longer than Tuesday fortnight, as I told Sarah Ann, fur I've got to go to Betsey Cropper's then to help her with her spinnin'; and there's my own things--seven pounds of wool to spin fur Truly Mattherses people, besides two bushel baskets, easy, of carpet-rags to sew, and I want 'em done by the time Miss Jane gits her loom empty, or I'll git no weavin' done this year, and what do you think?

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of {{rest and}} regeneration. We took a bath in the clear, cold {{waters of the}} stream, washed our {{clothing}} and hung it up to dry, beat the mud out of our towels, and so made ready for the onward march. We should have stayed longer, but the ebbing away of our grub pile made us apprehensive. To return was impossible.|$|R

5000|$|In Minnesota after World War II {{and into}} the mid-century, [...] "Hamm's" [...] was a common synonym for beer, as in [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> - let's get a Hamm's", or packing for a summer picnic, [...] "Don't forget {{to put in the}} Hamm's!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't worry--we may <b>be</b> back in <b>a</b> day or two," [...] {{answered}} Dick. But it {{was destined}} to <b>be</b> many <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> ere the two parties should meet again.|$|R
60|$|AN oppressively mild temperature, and steady, soft, settled rain--dismal {{weather for}} idle {{people in the}} country. Miss Jessie, after looking longingly out of the window, {{resigned}} herself to circumstances, and gave up all hope of a ride. The gardener, the conservatory, the rabbits, the raven, the housekeeper, and, as a last resource, even the neglected piano, were all laid under contribution to help her through the time. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> but thanks to her own talent for trifling, she contrived to occupy it pleasantly enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a thing! I reckon it'll <b>be</b> many <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> before we'll {{get another}} place sich {{as we had}} down there;" [...] and then Master Carrots indulged once more in harsh words against his enemies.|$|R

50|$|He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{founding}} member of the Order of Finnegans, which takes its name from a pub in Dalkey, Ireland, although there are those who believe it also comes from James Joyce’s last novel, Finnegans Wake. The knights of the Order of Finnegans must venerate James Joyce’s novel Ulysses and, if possible, attend Bloomsday each year in Dublin on the sixteenth of June. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> that culminates, at dusk, at the Martello tower in Sandycove (where the novel begins) with participants reading sections from Ulysses and then walking to Finnegans pub in the neighbouring village of Dalkey.|$|R
6000|$|The old man {{shook his}} head. [...] "There is no further {{side to the}} plain," [...] said he. [...] "It is the earth's boundary, and {{stretches}} away to eternity. For all these years I have sat beside it, but never once have I seen anything come across it. It is manifest that if there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> further side there would certainly at some time have come some traveller from that direction. Over the great river yonder is the Roman post of Tyras; but that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> journey from here, and they have never disturbed my meditations." ...|$|R
60|$|And then Dr Fillgrave {{went on to}} Greshamsbury. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> work, {{both for}} himself and the horses; but then, the triumph of being dragged up that avenue {{compensated}} for both the expense and the labour. He always put on his sweetest smile as he came near the hall door, and rubbed {{his hands in the}} most complaisant manner of which he knew. It was seldom that he saw any of the family but Lady Arabella; but then he desired to see none other, and when he left her in <b>a</b> good humour, <b>was</b> quite content to take his glass of sherry and eat his lunch by himself.|$|R

60|$|What <b>a</b> {{morning that}} <b>was,</b> among the bright buds and flowers, {{the wonders of}} nature and art all together! It <b>was</b> to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> and no hurrying; so the party went from court to court at their leisure, sat down, and studied all that they cared for, or divided {{according}} to their tastes. Fanny and Mary wanted time for the wonderful sculptures on the noble gates in the Italian court; but the younger girls preferred roaming more freely, so Lady de la Poer sat down {{to take care of}} them, while her husband undertook to guide the wanderings of the other three.|$|R
40|$|Published in the Canberra Times on 11 April 1983.; Part of the Pryor {{collection}} of cartoons and drawings.

50|$|Saturday <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> that {{included}} <b>a</b> 90 minute delay and eventual suspension of play. Ben Crenshaw stormed to a four-shot lead at {{the suspension of}} play. Crenshaw was 3-under on the day through 13. Nick Faldo {{got off to a}} slow start with a double bogey on the first hole. On the second hole, he holed an improbable 100 ft birdie putt, but was 3 over on the day through 12 holes. Out early, clubhouse leader Greg Norman posted a 68 to reach +1 and close within five shots of the lead when play was suspended. Lee Trevino, trying to complete the career Grand Slam, faded out of contention Saturday.|$|R
