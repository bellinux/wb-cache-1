40|$|Abstract — With {{increasing}} {{populations of}} the elderly in our society, robot technology will {{play an important role}} in providing functional mobility to humans. From the perspective of human safety, it is desirable that controllers for walk-assist robots be dissipative, i. e., the energy is supplied from the human to the walker, while the controller modulates this energy. The simplest form of a dissipating controller is a brake, where resistive torques are applied to the wheels proportional to their speeds. The fundamental question that we ask in this brief is how to modulate these proportional gains over time for the two wheels so that the walker can perform point-to-point motions. The unique contribution of this brief is a novel way in which the theory of differential flatness is used to plan the trajectory of these <b>braking</b> <b>gains.</b> Since the user input forces are not known a priori, the trajectory of the <b>braking</b> <b>gain</b> is computed iteratively during the motion. Simulation and experimental results show that the walk-assist robot, along with the structure of this proposed control scheme, can guide the user to reach the goal.

50|$|With {{adjustable}} +/- trailer <b>braking</b> <b>gain</b> in {{a digital}} readout from 0.0 (no trailer brakes) to 10.0 (full trailer braking) in 0.5 increments and a manual override lever (to test trailer braking action), the Ford 'built into the dash' TBC provides smooth braking even when pulling up to a 15,000 lb 4-axle conventional (receiver mounted) or 26,000 lb 4-axle 5th Wheel (bed/frame mounted) trailer. TowCommand being different from most aftermarket TBCs, ties into the trucks' computer and hydraulics, so it senses truck brake pressure and can apply trailer brakes {{as fast as the}} truck's brakes. Master Brake Systems 'BrakeSmart' TBC is the only other TBC that taps into the trucks hydraulic lines in modern trucks.|$|R
40|$|Brake linings used in {{automotive}} disks {{are usually}} composed of various components. Expected properties from a brake lining are appropriate standart value of wear resist, friction coefficient and also economical value. Brake lining extremely warms up during braking due to friction. The braking performance of brake lining changes and braking lining {{is subject to}} mecanical deformation due to excessive temperature. In recent twenty years in consequence of fast development in automotive technology, vehicles that have more speed and acceleration capability were produced. Therefore, friction composites used in automotive <b>brake</b> <b>gained</b> popularity in material technology. In this study, the effect of cashew dust in the brake friction material on various aspects of friction characteristics was investigated. Three friction material specimens were produced based on an experimental formulation, and they contained 5...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dynamics}} of the contact between the pneumatic tyre and the ground, in particular with reference to braking manoeuvres of aircraft. The transient response of the braking force is analytically evaluated in terms of the transfer functions that link the variation of the braking force to the variation of physical inputs affecting the interaction between the tread and the ground, in the longitudinal plane. The proposed models have been formulated in order to account for the effects of different reference conditions of steady <b>braking</b> on <b>gains,</b> zeros and poles of such transfer functions...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum brakes {{are first}} used {{in place of}} the air brake in railway locomotives. This braking system uses a vacuum pump for {{creating}} vacuum in the brake pipe. The integral construction of the brake cylinder uses this vacuum reservoir for the application of brakes. Nowadays most of the light vehicles are fitted with vacuum-assisted hydraulic braking system where vacuum is created from the engine which reduces the driver effort on foot pedal. When the vacuum-powered brake booster in a passenger vehicle becomes disabled, the <b>brake</b> force <b>gain</b> of the system is reduced significantly, and the brake pedal force required locking the tires increases beyond the ability of some adults...|$|R
5000|$|Before ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) came to {{trucks in}} the 1980s, most TBCs were {{activated}} by the trucks' brake hydraulic action. In an emergency {{situation with the}} trucks ABS activated, Ford's TowCommand can automatically reduce the trailer <b>brake</b> pressure (<b>gain)</b> as it communicates with the truck's computer for faster reaction time with proportional trailer brake control, to prevent the trailer brakes from locking up even though trailers do not have ABS sensors. TowCommand will also inform the driver with an audible alarm and in the digital readout if the trailer wires and/or trailer disconnects from the truck. Next to the TowCommand is an empty storage tray or the $85 optional 4 AUX (auxiliary) toggle switches for winches, snow plow, off-road lights, etc.|$|R

The Expedition's trailer brake controller features +/- <b>gain</b> <b>brake</b> adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the Expedition's four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a control}} scheme for {{emergency}} braking maneuvers in automated highway systems (AHSs) {{and a new}} online identification scheme to determine the tire–road friction character-istics of the vehicle are presented. The proposed controller deter-mines the required pressure in the master cylinder of the braking system to achieve maximum deceleration during braking, based on the estimation of the tire–road friction characteristics and the overall <b>braking</b> system <b>gain,</b> for the given set of parameter esti-mates. With persistence of excitation, the identified static map be-tween the tire longitudinal slip and the tire–road friction coeffi-cient is guaranteed to converge to the actual map. When there is no persistence of excitation, and under a proper choice of initial conditions and adaptation gains, the proposed scheme underesti-mates the maximum coefficient of friction and its corresponding slip, and allows a conservative calculation of the safety critical in-tervehicle spacing.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possible}} benefits {{that can be}} achieved if U. S. oil companies produced and offered a grade of higher-octane gasoline to the consumer market. The octane number of a fuel represents how resistant the fuel is to auto-ignition, which causes knock. By raising the octane number of gasoline, engine knock constraints are reduced, so that new spark-ignition engines can be designed with higher compression ratios and boost levels. In turn, engine and vehicle efficiencies are improved thus reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet. The main objective of this thesis is to quantify the reduction in fuel consumption and GHG emissions {{that can be achieved}} for a given increase in octane number. Engine modeling simulations in GT-Power are used to determine the relative <b>brake</b> efficiency <b>gain</b> (part-load) that is possible for a unit increase in compression ratio. This is found to be 1. 9 % while literature data suggests a 2. 33 %- 2. 8 % efficiency gain may in fact be possible. Thus a...|$|R
50|$|Active Yaw Control uses a torque {{transfer}} {{mechanism in}} the rear differential to control rear wheel torque differential for different driving conditions and so limit the yaw moment that acts on the vehicle body and enhance cornering performance. AYC also acts like a limited slip differential by suppressing rear wheel slip to improve traction. In its latest form, AYC now features yaw rate feedback control using a yaw rate sensor and also <b>gains</b> <b>braking</b> force control. Accurately determining the cornering dynamics on a realtime basis, the system operates to control vehicle behavior through corners and realize vehicle behavior that more closely mirrors driver intent.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHydraulic brake in {{automobile}} {{engineering is}} considered {{to be one of the}} important components. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of such a component is very essential for safety of passengers, vehicles and to minimize the unexpected maintenance time.

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a unidirectional high <b>gain</b> <b>brake</b> arrangement that includes in combination a shaft mounted for rotation within a housing. The shaft is rotatable in either direction. A brake is selectively releasably coupled to the housing {{and to the}} shaft. The brake has a first member. An intermittent motion device is respectively coupled through the first member to the housing and through a one-way clutch to the shaft. The brake also has a second member that is mechanically coupled to the first brake member and to the housing. The intermittent motion device causes the brake to be activated by movement imparted to the first brake member after a preset number of revolutions of the shaft in one direction. The brake is released by rotation of the shaft in an opposite direction whereby torque transmitted through the one-way clutch to the first brake member is removed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possible}} benefits {{that can be}} achieved if U. S. oil companies produced and offered a grade of higher-octane gasoline to the consumer market. The octane number of a fuel represents how resistant the fuel is to auto-ignition, which causes knock. By raising the octane number of gasoline, engine knock constraints are reduced, so that new spark-ignition engines can be designed with higher compression ratios and boost levels. In turn, engine and vehicle efficiencies are improved thus reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet. The main objective of this thesis is to quantify the reduction in fuel consumption and GHG emissions {{that can be achieved}} for a given increase in octane number. Engine modeling simulations in GT-Power are used to determine the relative <b>brake</b> efficiency <b>gain</b> (part-load) that is possible for a unit increase in compression ratio. This is found to be 1. 9 % while literature data suggests a 2. 33 %- 2. 8 % efficiency gain may in fact be possible. Thus an average relative efficiency gain of 2. 35 % is assumed possible for a unit increase in compression ratio. Engine-in-vehicle drive-cycle simulations are then performed in Autonomie to determine an effective, on-the-road vehicle efficiency gain. For a compression ratio increase of 1. 5 : 1, this results in a 4. 7 % efficiency gain for a downsized, naturally-aspirated, spark-ignition vehicle. If the vehicle is turbocharged, a 6. 9 % efficiency gain is possible due to additional boosting and further downsizing. With the possible efficiency gain determined at an individual vehicle level, a fleet model is then used to calculate the aggregate benefit for the LDV fleet by simulating the deployment and adoption rate of vehicles redesigned for higher octane gasoline. According to results from the model, roughly 69 % of all LDVs on the road by 2040 will be of this high-octane variety that uses premium gasoline (98 RON). Meanwhile, premium gasoline is projected to account for almost 80 % of the total gasoline demand by 2040. Ultimately by redesigning vehicles to take advantage of 98 RON gasoline, fuel consumption and GHG emissions for the fleet can be reduced by about 4. 5 % over the baseline case, where no high-octane vehicles are introduced. This reduction jumps to 6. 0 % if 100 RON gasoline is considered instead. by Eric W. Chow. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2013.
