5|$|Although most residences {{were built}} {{according}} to local vernacular traditions, some manors (such as Austråt and Rosendal) exhibit the influence of Baroque architecture. Only the city of Christiania (Oslo) had a building code that prohibited wooden houses, {{and a number of}} large town houses modeled after Continental building types were constructed. Some large churches were constructed with <b>brick</b> <b>walls,</b> notably in Bergen, Christiania, Røros and Kongsberg.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and which might have been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{of technology and}} the demands on {{the speed of the}} construction project cause the material manufacturers compete to create a new material that can accelerate the process to build a building. Wall is one of the non-structural elements on a building. Both low-rise building and high-rise building are no doubts using this material. Wall works can use two different types of material, such as <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> made of red clay and light <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> made of cement, silica sand, and limestone. In the construction process wall is needed in a large amount of area, so the difference of the price should be examined in choosing the type of the material to gain efficient cost. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine which method of wall construction is more efficient in terms of cost and time, the use of red <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> or <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> light. The study was conducted using survey, comparative, literature study method. Results indicate that both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Red <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> method is cheaper in the cost of the process, while the lighter <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> method much faster in the process. </p...|$|R
30|$|In this experimental, the UWB radar module is the P 410 {{from the}} Time Domain Company. The P 410 {{equipment}} development board {{is composed of}} a FPGA, a DSP, a network port, a UWB transceiver, a fan and many other components and {{is connected to the}} computer by net mouth using the UDP protocol to set the signal pulse length, frequency, and other parameters. The center frequency of the P 410 UWB radar is 4.3 GHz. The wall material is a 23.5 -cm thick brick. The P 410 UWB radar is placed at a distance of 20 cm from the <b>brick</b> <b>wall</b> and the distance between the UWB radar and the ground is half of the <b>brick</b> <b>wall.</b> In this experimental environment, there are four statuses for through-wall human being detection.

5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of the shells to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing shells, intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> may have failed to trigger the impact fuses. Sea water may have degraded the shells, which the Japanese had stored in deck lockers for several weeks. The age of the shells may also have been a factor; some of the shells recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|E
5|$|These {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} different varieties of ceramics such as {{black and red}} ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as <b>brick</b> <b>walls,</b> ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues {{about the nature of}} the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of barbed wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 L-shaped concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E

5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it as high as it was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E
5|$|The east bay of {{the barn}} {{contains}} an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. The second-floor hayloft {{is supported by the}} two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the <b>brick</b> <b>walls.</b> The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as tie rods {{at the base of the}} roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> {{of the ticket}} hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E

5|$|The {{images of}} Uttararama follow a {{different}} style from {{the images of the}} previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of <b>brick</b> <b>walls</b> at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing the images of the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{the advent}} of steam ships meant that enemy vessels could sail up the Thames far more quickly than before, {{reducing}} the time available for forts to intercept them. Rifled guns and turret-mounted weapons and new armour-plating meant that enemy warships could fire on forts such as Tilbury from downstream more easily while being protected from their guns. Fears of an potential invasion by Napoleon III of France led to the establishment Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom in 1859. The Commission reported the following year and recommended that new, more powerful forts be built further downstream, with defences such as Tilbury Fort forming a second-line of defence. Work began on strengthening Tilbury in 1868, {{under the direction of}} the then Captain Charles Gordon, focusing on adding heavier gun positions able to fire upstream to support the new forts. The west, north-east and east bastions and the south-east curtain wall were altered to house thirteen rifled muzzle-loading guns, protected by <b>brick</b> <b>walls,</b> earthworks and iron shields. Initially 7-ton, 7-inch (7,112 kg, 17 cm) guns were deployed but these were upgraded to 9-inch ((22 cm) weapons by 1888, supported by a heavier 25-ton, 11-inch (25,401 kg, 27 cm) gun. The old Tudor block-house was destroyed to make way for the new guns.|$|E
5|$|The tall flint {{tower of}} StMichael's at Ocklynge {{is one of}} Eastbourne's landmarks. The church was consecrated in 1902 and built {{on the site of}} the mission hall where the {{nonsense}} writer Lewis Carroll (the clergyman CL Dodgson) is known to have preached during his holidays in the town. All Souls, in Italian style, is a finely proportioned building with an Evangelical church tradition. Holy Trinity also has a strong history of Evangelism, particularly during the early 20th century when Canon Stephen Warner was the vicar for 28 years. There is a Greek Orthodox Church converted from a 19th-century Calvinistic chapel. The Strict Baptist Chapel in Grove Road is an interesting building, despite its rather grim street frontage. The United Reformed Church in Upperton Road has tall rogue Gothic windows set in red <b>brick</b> <b>walls.</b> Several other denominations have similarly interesting church buildings, including some of 20th century design, such as the Baptist Church in Eldon Road.
