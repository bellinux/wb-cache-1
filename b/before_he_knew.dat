25|$|French's {{official}} despatch after Le Cateau had praised Smith-Dorrien's “rare {{and unusual}} coolness, intrepidity and determination”. In 1914 French wrote {{that this had}} been written <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the full facts, and that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). Smith-Dorrien, in a private written statement, called 1914 “mostly {{a work of fiction}} and a foolish one too”.|$|E
500|$|At {{some point}} during his illness Edward wrote a draft {{document}} headed [...] "My devise for the Succession". Due to his ardent Protestantism Edward did not want his Catholic sister Mary to succeed, {{but he was also}} preoccupied with male succession and with legitimacy, which in Mary's and Elizabeth's case was questionable as a result of Henry VIII's legislation. In the first version of his [...] "devise", written <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> he was mortally ill, Edward bypassed his half-sisters and provided for the succession of male heirs only. Around the end of May or early June Edward's condition worsened dramatically and he corrected his draft such that Lady Jane Grey herself, not just her putative sons, could inherit the Crown. To what extent Edward's document—especially this last change—was influenced by Northumberland, his confidant John Gates, or still other members of the Privy Chamber like Edward's tutor John Cheke or Secretary William Petre, is unclear.|$|E

A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Final Fantasy developer Hironobu Sakaguchi, one of the three designers for the upcoming Chrono Trigger, suggested he score the game, remarking, [...] "maybe your salary will go up." [...] Mitsuda reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing." [...] Mitsuda has said that he was unsure of how to start, saying that he [...] "must've tried to start writing the music 4 times" [...] and that it took [...] "a month and a half" [...] <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> how to compose the music for Chrono Trigger.|$|E

500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{he was going to be}} the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber. I know people will be watching The Simpsons long after I'm dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hynek {{remained}} with Project Sign after it became Project Grudge (though {{he was far}} less involved in Grudge {{than he had been}} in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with Project Blue Book in early 1952, and Hynek remained as scientific consultant. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, Blue Book's first director, held Hynek in high regard: [...] "Dr. Hynek {{was one of the most}} impressive scientists I met while working on the UFO project, and I met a good many. He didn't do two things that some of them did: give you the answer <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the question; or immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in the field of science." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Le Sage, after {{creating}} {{his first}} essay on gravitation, he was informed in 1748 by Firmin Abauzit {{about a very}} similar theory of Gabriel Cramer, who happens to have been Le Sage's teacher in Geneva. In later years Le Sage responded in two different ways to charges that his ideas on gravitation were only the result of studying Cramer's papers. First, he argued that his first essay was written <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> of the theories of his predecessors. Second, he argued {{that even if he}} knew about Cramer's theory, it makes no difference, because Cramer's theory is too vague and scientifically not valuable. Le Sage did, however, accuse Cramer of plagiarising Fatio's theory. (Fatio himself had made the same accusation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Angelica {{asks the}} Prince {{to dance with}} her. Flattered, he agrees to a waltz. They are a {{successful}} couple and dance well, with the Prince's memory flashing {{back to the days}} of his youth [...] "when, in that very same ballroom he had danced with the Princess <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> disappointment, boredom, and the rest." [...] As the dance finishes, he realizes the other dancers have stopped and are watching them, his [...] "leonine air" [...] preventing the onlookers from bursting into applause. Angelica asks him to eat with her and Tancredi, and for a flattered moment almost says yes, but then again remembers his youth, recalls how embarrassing it would have been for him to have an old relative eating with him and a lover, and politely excuses himself.|$|E

However, after a talk with her dad she thinks that Oliver will move on and so will Lilly but when Lilly announces that she {{is in love with}} Oliver, Miley ends up telling her the truth. Lilly and Miley hatch a plan to get Oliver back but only to find out that he was practicing saying [...] "I love you" [...] so he could say it to Lilly. They both say that they love each other in the end of the episode. (It is mentioned in this episode that neither Oliver nor Miley have romantic feelings for each other). However, Oliver did used to have romantic feelings towards Hannah Montana <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> she was Miley. Miley,at first, didn't want to tell him who she was, just in case he had romantic feelings for her as Miley, but when she eventually told him, he saw her as just a friend.|$|E

2500|$|... "Books {{have the}} vital roles in man's life {{just like any}} other art forms: they cure the soul, they educate us with the {{knowledge}} and the message within the lines, they improve self-knowledge, they enhance the imagination, sharpen the creativity. It is like medicine for the soul. It helps us to relief pain, to get rid of fears, lessen our depression. The significance of the right literature for the right person is downright more effective than any other form of guidance, including religion or parenting. It is therefore paramount that the child reads for his own pleasure from an early age. And the {{way to do this is}} to show him the type of books that he would likely to enjoy, which is not necessarily the book the school or society considers as valuable. To do that, of course, his family members and those who are trusted with the child's care must consider his personality and interest. My younger son, Ben was infatuated with the wildlife and the animal world. So what did I do? I lavished him with books by Gerald Durrell and David Attenborough and Jane Goodall, and any book I could find on the animal kingdom, no expense spared. And <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it, he finished two books a week and soon began reading books, by own choice, like the Jungle Book and Treasure Island and the works of Mark Twain." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} when Antiochus {{approached}} Ptolemy and meant to occupy Pelusium, Caius Popilius Laenas, the Roman commander, on Antiochus greeting him from a distance and then holding out his hand, handed to the king, as he had it by him, the copy of the senatus-consultum, {{and told him to}} read it first, not thinking it proper, as it seems to me, to make the conventional sign of friendship <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> if the intentions of him who was greeting him were friendly or hostile. But when the king, after reading it, {{said he would like to}} communicate with his friends about this intelligence, Popilius acted in a manner which was thought to be offensive and exceedingly arrogant. He was carrying a stick cut from a vine, and with this he drew a circle round Antiochus and told him he must remain inside this circle until he gave his decision about the contents of the letter. The king was astonished at this authoritative proceeding, but, after a few moments' hesitation, said he would do all that the Romans demanded. Upon this Popilius and his suite all grasped him by the hand and greeted him warmly. The letter ordered him to put an end at once to the war with Ptolemy. So, as a fixed number of days were allowed to him, he led his army back to Syria, deeply hurt and complaining indeed, but yielding to circumstances for the present. Popilius after arranging matters in Alexandria and exhorting the two kings there to act in common, ordering them also to send Polyaratus to Rome, sailed for Cyprus, wishing to lose no time in expelling the Syrian troops that were in the island. When they arrived, finding that Ptolemy's generals had been defeated and that the affairs of Cyprus were generally in a topsy-turvy state, they soon made the Syrian army retire from the country, and waited until the troops took ship for Syria. In this way the Romans saved the kingdom of Ptolemy, which had almost been crushed out of existence: Fortune having so directed the matter of Perseus and Macedonia that when the position of Alexandria and the whole of Egypt was almost desperate, all was again set right simply owing to the fact that the fate of Perseus had been decided. For had this not been so, and had not Antiochus been certain of it, he would never, I think, have obeyed the Roman behests.
