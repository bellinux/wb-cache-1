5000|$|Agapanthus praecox (common agapanthus, <b>blue</b> <b>lily,</b> <b>African</b> <b>lily,</b> [...] or lily of the Nile) is {{a popular}} garden plant around the world, {{especially}} in Mediterranean climates. It is native of Natal and Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, local names include agapant, bloulelie, isicakathi and ubani. Most of the cultivated plants of the genus Agapanthus are hybrids or cultivars of this species. The plant is reportedly naturalized in Great Britain, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Eritrea, Ethiopia, St. Helena, Victoria, Norfolk Island, New Zealand, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and Tristan da Cunha.|$|R

50|$|Agapanthus africanus (<b>African</b> <b>lily)</b> is a {{flowering}} plant from the genus Agapanthus {{native to the}} area of Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. A. africanus is more difficult to grow in gardens than A. praecox, and almost all plants sold as A. africanus are actually A. praecox.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} Agapanthus are {{commonly}} known as lily of the Nile (or <b>African</b> <b>lily</b> in the UK), although they are not lilies and all of the species are native to Southern Africa (South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique) though some have become naturalized in scattered places around the world (Australia, Great Britain, Mexico, Ethiopia, Jamaica, etc.).|$|R
40|$|The <b>African</b> <b>blue</b> <b>lily</b> (Agapanthus praecox ssp. minimus) is a {{valuable}} plant, reported to contain medicinal compounds such as saponins, sapogenins and phytoecdysteroids, besides gaining popularity as an ornamental and landscape species. This paper reports on high efficiency and rapid in vitro propagation of Agapanthus praecox ssp. minimus via somatic embryogenesis from tissues derived from sterile root, leaf and bulb explants obtained from one-month-old aseptic seedlings of this species. Detailed observations on developmental stages of somatic embryos (from globular to coleoptilar) of this monocotyledonous species were also reported in the present investigation. Friable callus which gave rise to high plant regeneration rate (95) was lucratively produced within 1 - 2 months after the explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with picloram, 2, 4 -D, TDZ and combinations of NAA and BAP (0. 5 mg/L to 2. 0 mg/L). Subsequently, the proliferated calli were transferred onto the same media compositions at 2 weeks interval to encourage extensive production of somatic embryos, followed by transferring to plant growth regulator-free MS medium for complete plant regeneration. Analysis of results showed that explant types highly influenced the degree of response to hormone treatments, whereby root explants were the most responsive. Picloram (a systemic herbicide) was the most effective in inducing somatic embryogenesis from leaf explants, while 2, 4 -D had excellent influence on root and bulb explants. Further development of somatic embryos to complete plantlets was achieved on MS basal medium. Regenerated plantlets were then hardened and acclimatized on black (peat) soil with 86. 67 Â± 6. 31 survival rate. Scanning electron microscopic studies on leaf tissues showed no morphological variations between the in vivo and in vitro grown plants, hence mass propagation through tissue culture for true-to-type production of this species is feasible...|$|R

50|$|One {{example of}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship between a plant and its animal pollinators is the <b>African</b> <b>Lily,</b> Massonia depressa, and some rodent species of the Succulent Karoo region of South Africa. At least four rodent species, including two gerbil species, {{were found to be}} visiting M. depressa during the night (Johnson 2001). Traits of the M. depressa flowers support non-flying mammal pollination. It has dull-colored and very sturdy flowers at ground level, has a strong yeasty odor, and secretes copious amounts of sucrose-dominant nectar during the night (Johnson 2001). The nectar of M. depressa was also found to be 400 times as viscous, or resistant to flow, as an equivalent sugar solution. This jelly-like consistency of the nectar may discourage insect consumption while also facilitating lapping by rodents. It is assumed that M. depressa coevolved with its pollinators (Johnson 2001).|$|R

50|$|<b>African</b> <b>Blues</b> is a {{world music}} benefit {{compilation}} album originally released in 1998, with proceeds going to Voluntary Service Overseas. Part of the World Music Network Rough Guides series, the release features <b>African</b> <b>blues</b> (a genre which is not simply an African re-interpretation of the American style, but carrying on traditions that were also exported to the Americas—see Origins of the blues). The compilation was produced and coordinated by Phil Stanton & Sandra Alayón-Stanton, co-founders of the World Music Network. Though they are named differently (the Rough Guide designation being omitted in this release and only found in the catalogue number, common practice for the label's charity releases), 2007's The Rough Guide to <b>African</b> <b>Blues</b> is sometimes considered this album's second edition.|$|R
