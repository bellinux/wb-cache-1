25|$|The {{share of}} urban borrowers kept slowly {{increasing}} to about 30% of all loans {{but those were}} riskier loans. The share of loans to merchants, who were mostly Jewish, was particularly low – just 2.2% in 1889 when the average of other banks was 13.5%. A <b>big</b> <b>jump</b> in urban loans was seen in 1892 due to the agricultural crisis (from 8 million to 13.4 million). These loans helped industrialisation, but were blamed for a construction boom which later resulted in a bust. From 1901 to 1907, the bank auctioned 659 urban properties but managed to sell only 452 and suffered 2 million rubles in losses. There were no restrictions of Catholic nobles or Jews on acquiring urban properties. In 1902, to reign in the perceived abuses, the government limited urban loans to 30% of outstanding loans. Despite the losses and regulations, the bank continued to lend to city residents and the outstanding loans amounted to 35.9 million and represented 2,891 properties in 1915.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, several groups, {{including}} the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, {{filed suit against}} the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The plaintiffs argued the EPA {{does not have the}} authority to issue a “partial waiver” that covers some cars and not others. Among other arguments, the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars, but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the E15 mixture. It was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the <b>big</b> <b>jump</b> in corn prices in recent years. In August 2012, the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA. The case was thrown out on a technical reason, as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E

500|$|Space Stories was a pulp {{magazine}} which published five {{issues from}} October 1952 to June 1953. [...] It {{was published by}} Standard Magazines, and edited by Samuel Mines. [...] Mines' editorial policy for Space Stories was to publish straightforward science fiction adventure stories. [...] Among the better-known contributors were Jack Vance, Gordon R. Dickson and Leigh Brackett, whose novel The <b>Big</b> <b>Jump</b> appeared in the February 1953 issue.|$|E
500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a <b>big</b> <b>jump</b> for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|The singles {{also had}} an effect on the {{charting}} of the original versions of three of the songs.

It was beaten there by The Wanted's [...] "Glad You Came", which was that chart's [...] "greatest gainer", and moved from number twenty-six to number two, its highest position on the Canadian chart to date. [...] "Glad You Came" [...] also made a <b>big</b> <b>jump</b> in the US, and went from number eighteen to number five. [...] "Cough Syrup" [...] by Young the Giant debuted on both charts, at number ninety-five in the US and number eighty-two in Canada, and {{was the first time the}} group had been on the Billboard Hot 100, though the song had previously [...] "bubbled under" [...] the chart at number 117.|$|E

500|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles at age 23, he composed, arranged, and {{performed}} alongside Yanni {{for more than}} six years, performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras, touring throughout the U.S. and abroad as Yanni gained worldwide fame. [...] His first show was at the Starplex in Dallas with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra filming a video project. [...] "It was a real trial by fire for me", said Joseph. [...] "First show + 10,000 people + TV cameras equals NERVOUS." [...] He told Jane Fredericksen of the St. Croix Valley Press that [...] "It was a <b>big</b> <b>jump,</b> you don't really realize it at the time, but there's no in-between — going from playing nightclubs to arenas." [...] Some of these early tours included the Reflections of Passion, Revolution in Sound, Dare to Dream, Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1993 and 1994 concert tours, as well as a performance in Germany that was broadcast throughout Europe and seen by 30 to 40 million viewers. [...] Joseph appears on the 1994 multi-platinum album and video, Live at the Acropolis. [...] He recounts, [...] "When I reflect back over the years, one of the high points that stand out include performing at the Acropolis with Yanni. [...] Imagine all these different cultures coming together with the challenges of language, equipment, travel, and weather problems. [...] I still picture the police running their dogs through the dressing rooms to sniff out any bomb possibilities right before the show. [...] People still {{come up to me and}} comment how that show has affected their lives." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} issue, Mines {{declared}} that Space Stories editorial policy would {{be focused on}} entertainment: it would be aimed at readers [...] "who want action and thrills, strange and exotic backgrounds, weird and wonderful adventure", instead of the [...] "coldly mental story, the complex parable, the tale of social significance". [...] The response in the letters column of the magazine was positive, with several fans quoting Mines' editorial approvingly. [...] Mines was able to obtain stories from well-known writers, including Gordon R. Dickson, Leigh Brackett, Jack Vance, and William Morrison, though few of the stories were memorable. The best-known story published in the magazine was Brackett's The <b>Big</b> <b>Jump,</b> {{which appeared in the}} February 1953 issue. [...] Sf historian Wendy Bousfield regards most of the lesser-known stories in the magazine as uninteresting, but praises Robert Zack's [...] "Expedition to Earth", which is set in a [...] "science fiction restaurant" [...] where the alien staff are assumed to be merely wearing costumes, as a witty variation on the stereotypical hostile alien story. [...] Bousfield also singles out Charles Foster's [...] "The Satyr Stratagem" [...] as an example of an old-fashioned sexist science fiction plot. [...] In the story, a planet inhabited only by women welcomes a team of earth miners who will provide husbands for them. [...] Bousfield comments that Joanna Russ and James Tiptree, Jr. would later [...] "expose the absurdities of this stock science fictional situation". [...] In addition to the letter column, Mines included articles and essays on science. [...] A book review column appeared in the April 1953 issue; it did not appear in the next and final issue, which instead included some science-fictional cartoons.|$|E
500|$|Legion {{was filmed}} with Arri Alexa cameras, with two Alexa XT cameras and an Alexa Mini {{used for the}} pilot and then Minis used {{for the rest of}} the season; the footage was {{captured}} in 4K Ultra-high-definition. Gonzales described the series as [...] "essentially a one-camera show", but [...] "if we can get a bonus view [...] that doesn’t compromise the look of A-camera, that’s great." [...] Lenses for the series were a mixture of spherical and anamorphic, including a 9.8 Kinoptik camera lens to film [...] "some of the more bizarre mindscapes", which Kubrick used to film A Clockwork Orange. The Kinoptik lenses caused vignetting, which Gonzales would crop out of the image in post-production, though sometimes [...] "we just left it" [...] to add character. The series changes aspect ratio to reflect Haller's state of mind, [...] "going narrower when he feels boxed in by the nefarious forces pursuing him", though Gonzales [...] "didn’t always want the anamorphics to make the audience feel this <b>big</b> <b>jump,</b> but I wanted these subtle differences like the background bokeh to be a little different." [...] The season's [...] "memory work" [...] sequences were filmed with anamorphic lenses, but were then cropped to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Gonzales and Hawley both [...] "don’t care too much for" [...] steadicams, and instead relied on jib arms, dollies, and 30-foot technocranes, both on set and location. The production also made extensive use of a Ronin camera stabilizer, allowing the camera to be moved around by camera men and transitioned between hand use and cranes without endangering the camera operators.|$|E

Companies such as Community Air Services, Central Airways, Inter-Provincial Air Services, Lome Airways, Nickel Belt Airways and Taylor Airways offered services such as aircraft rentals, air freight, charter flights, pilot training and sight-seeing flights. Civilian pilots were much in demand after the war, and the Government of Canada offered a grant of $100 ($ in [...] dollars) to anyone who passed their pilot's license, an amount to offset the $355 ($ in [...] dollars) Lome charged for pilot training in 1949.

2500|$|Dick {{sold his}} first story in 1951, {{and from then}} on wrote full-time. During 1952 his first {{speculative}} fiction publications appeared in July and September numbers of Planet Stories, edited by Jack O'Sullivan, and in If and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction that year. His debut novel was Solar Lottery, published in 1955 as half of Ace Double #D-103 alongside The <b>Big</b> <b>Jump</b> by Leigh Brackett. The 1950s were a difficult and impoverished time for Dick, who once lamented, [...] "We couldn't even pay the late fees on a library book." [...] He published almost exclusively within the science fiction genre, but dreamed of a career in mainstream fiction. During the 1950s he produced a series of non-genre, relatively conventional novels. In 1960 he wrote {{that he was willing to}} [...] "take twenty to thirty years to succeed as a literary writer". The dream of mainstream success formally died in January 1963 when the Scott Meredith Literary Agency returned all of his unsold mainstream novels. Only one of these works, Confessions of a Crap Artist, was published during Dick's lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this <b>big</b> <b>jump</b> in the 1970s has been {{attributed}} by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While [...] "the pill" [...] was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely {{as a consequence of}} the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women had the luxury of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a [...] "big bang" [...] revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871, the New Zealand Government {{decided to}} route the new railway south of Napier through a {{notional}} Karamu junction in {{the centre of}} the Heretaunga Plains. This location was on Francis Hicks's land. The decision on the railway route was based largely on two reports by Charles Weber, the provincial engineer and surveyor in charge of the railway. Karamu junction was renamed Hastings in 1873. (On 7 June 1873, the Hawke's Bay Herald reported: [...] "The name of the new town is to be Hastings. We hear it now for the first time.") Exactly who chose the name has been disputed, although Thomas Tanner claimed that it was him (see Hawke's Bay Herald report 1 February 1884) and that the choice was inspired by his reading the trial of Warren Hastings. In any event, the name fitted well with other place names in the district (Napier, Havelock and Clive), which were also named after prominent figures in the history of British India. In 1874, the first train took the twelve-mile (19km) trip from Napier to Hastings, opening up Hastings as an export centre, through Port Ahuriri. A <b>big</b> <b>jump</b> in the local economy occurred when Edward Newbigin opened a brewery in 1881. By the next year, there were 195 freeholders of land in the town and with around six hundred people, the town was incorporated as a borough on 20 October 1886.|$|E
