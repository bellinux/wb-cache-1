5000|$|William Deidrick, of Selma, California was a {{co-inventor}} of the Fresno Scraper, {{the machine}} that became the basis of most modern earth-moving equipment. On April 17, 1883, Deidrick received U.S. Patent 275,893 for his horse-drawn scraper, which was {{a variation on the}} <b>Buck</b> <b>Scraper,</b> invented by James Porteous of Fresno, California. Porteous, originally a manufacturer of wagons, purchased Deidrick's patent, and also one held jointly by Frank Dusy and Abijah McCall as he perfected the machine, an important tool in the building of the Panama Canal, among many other uses.|$|E
50|$|Frank Dusy (December 17, 1837 - November 9, 1898) was {{an early}} {{business}} leader of Selma, California and a co-inventor of the Fresno Scraper, the basis of most modern earth-moving machinery. On June, 16, 1885, Dusy and his partner Abijah McCall were issued U.S. Patent 320,055, for their improvement on the <b>Buck</b> <b>Scraper,</b> invented by James Porteous of Fresno, California. Porteous, originally a wagon builder, purchased their patent and one held by William Deidrick as he perfected his machine. Dusy was also among the original investors in the Fresno Republican newspaper, which was eventually acquired by and combined with the Fresno Bee.|$|E
5000|$|Porteous invented an {{improvement}} on the simple buckboard, a horse-drawn earth scraper, and refined his <b>Buck</b> <b>Scraper,</b> as he first called it, through several design improvements. His ideas, combined {{with those of}} fellow-inventors William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, all of Selma, California led to the Fresno Scraper (1883). Porteous purchased patents held by Deidrick and jointly by partners Dusy and McCall as he perfected his machine. The basic design forms the basis of most modern earth moving scrapers, having the ability to not only scrape and move a quantity of soil, but also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually.|$|E
50|$|Abijah McCall was a {{co-inventor}} of the Fresno Scraper, a horse-drawn (and later, tractor-drawn) earth-moving machine {{upon which}} modern road- and canal-building equipment is based. Along {{with his partner}} Frank Dusy, McCall devised an improvement on the <b>Buck</b> <b>Scraper,</b> invented by James Porteous. On June 15, 1885, McCall and Dusy received U.S. Patent 320,055 for their version of the scraper. Porteous purchased the patents held by Dusy and McCall and also a patent held by William Deidrick as he perfected the scraper, which Porteous also manufactured at his factory in Fresno, California. The scraper was widely used in the Western United States and also put into use by U.S. engineers building the Panama Canal. Deidrick, Dusy, and McCall were all early residents of Selma, California, where McCall Avenue is named for McCall. McCall reputedly used a Fresno Scraper in building the road which runs through Selma and north to Clovis, California.|$|E
