Such varieties include Chinook, Galena, Horizon, Tomahawk, and Warrior hops, and these contain alpha acid concentrations up to 16% by mass. Since the bitterness is not influenced by <b>beta</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> are not considered when selecting the variety of hop.

50|$|Bitterness scales {{attempt to}} rate the {{perceived}} relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, humulone undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- isohumulone which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of the beer. Likewise, hops contain lupulones, or <b>beta</b> <b>acids.</b> These <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> are not considered in the initial bittering of the wort as much as their alpha acid counterparts since they do not isomerize through boiling, and therefore do not dissolve in the wort. However, <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging. At the same time, isomerized alpha acids undergo degradation and reduce the bitterness of the beer.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Alpha acids {{are found}} in the lupulin glands of hops cones. These acids have no {{bitterness}} of their own, but can be isomerized and subsequently hydrogenated to form bitter iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids respectively. Current literature values for the detection thresholds of iso-α-acid and tetrahydroiso-α-acid in lager beer have been reported using American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) method 679, a method commonly used to find detection thresholds of various compounds. ASTM method 679 is currently described as a “rapid method” and was a forerunner to ASTM method 1432, the current standard method for finding human detection thresholds. It has been argued that ASTM method 679 is statistically weaker than ASTM method 1432, as a group threshold found using ASTM method 679 is based on an individual “best estimate threshold” found using only one ascending series of 3 -altrnative forced choice (3 -AFC) presentations per panelist. The group threshold found using ASTM method 1432 is based on individual thresholds that are determined using data from 6 ascending series of 3 -AFC presentations per panelist, the principle being that test repetition will help nullify moment-to-moment panelist variation. However, test repetition takes time, and the lack of repetition required for ASTM method 679 makes the method quicker and simpler to implement than ASTM method 1432. Current literature detection threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer have not been found using ASTM method 1432. The primary objective of the research presented in this paper was to use the current ASTM standard method to determine updated threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer. The secondary objective of this research was to compare threshold results from the same data set using ASTM method 679 and ASTM method 1432 to evaluate whether these methods provide statistically similar results. Findings showed that implementation of ASTM method 679 to find individual thresholds did produce results that were not statistically different from individual results found using ASTM method 1432. All group thresholds except the Day 1 tetrahydroiso-α-acid threshold found using ASTM 679 were also statistically in agreement with group thresholds obtained using ASTM method 1432. <b>Beta</b> <b>acids,</b> like alpha acids, {{are found in}} the lupulin glands of hops cones. <b>Beta</b> <b>acids</b> oxidize to form bitter compounds. <b>Beta</b> <b>acids</b> and tetrahydroiso-α-acids {{have been found to be}} miticidal against varroa mites, parasitic mites that feed off of and damage honeybees and bee larva. Though <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> and tetrahydroiso-α-acids are FDA-declared GRAS substances, and will have no ill-effects on honey consumers, bees may transfer the bitter acids to their honey. Detectable levels of these bitter substances could lead to consumer rejection of honey from hives treated with <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> or tetrahydroiso-α-acids. In a second experiment discussed in this thesis, the detection thresholds of <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> and tetrahydroiso-α-acids were found in light clover honey. A method for the extraction and quantification of <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in beer and wort was modified and verified for the extraction and quantification of hops acids in honey. This method combined with group threshold data obtained in this experiment can be used in an industrial setting to determine whether the concentrations of <b>beta</b> <b>acids</b> and/or tetrahydro-iso-α-acids that may have been transferred to honey are above or below the human detection threshold...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, "The Evaluation of the Quality of Hops from Traditional and Non-traditional Growing Areas", {{the quality}} of three {{varieties}} of hop seed cones (Saaz, Sladek and Kazbek) from a non-traditional hop-growing region was analyzed and the data used for comparison. The primary aim {{of the study was}} to determine if there is a possibility of growing quality hops in a region that is not considered a hop-growing region. The hops that were tested were harvested in 2015 from a private hopfield located in Obora near Tábor. This hopfield is owned and managed by Ing. Martin Novák. Mechanical and chemical analysis was carried out on samples from Obora. The main goal of the analysis was to determine the alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>acid</b> content of the hop seed cones harvested there. Samples were analyzed with EBC 7. 7 (HPLC). Alpha acid content of the tested samples in Saaz hops was 4. 06 % w/w, in Sladek 7. 14 % w/w and in Kazbek 4. 67 % w/w. The content of beta acids in Saaz hops was 3. 16 % w/w, in Sladek 3. 93 % w/w and in Kazbek 4. 51 % w/w.

40|$|Streptococcus mutans, a {{commonly}} studied bacterium, {{is known to}} be correlated with human dental caries. This association is seen as the organism forms an oral biofilm on the tooth to promote colonization.

40|$|One {{third of}} the world’s {{population}} {{is estimated to be}} infected with M. tuberculosis, a pathogen which causes more human death and misery than any other bacterial disease. Whilst treatment is available, resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is a growing problem. Thus there is an urgent need to identify new compounds that can kill drug resistant isolates and are able to potentiate the activity of currently available antibiotics. The plant kingdom is a rich source of antibacterial compounds and a plant which has attracted particular interest is Humulus lupulus, more commonly known as the hop, which has been used as an antibacterial in beer for hundreds of years. Its antibacterial properties are thought to be due to the combined action of alpha and beta acids and polyphenols such as xanthohumol although the precise nature of their interactions and relative importance has yet to be determined. An optimised agar antimicrobial assay was developed and employed based on Mycobacterium smegmatis, to characterize the antibacterial activity of fifty commercially available hop varieties with a view to identifying novel antibacterial compounds. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>acid</b> content and antibacterial activity. Chemical analysis of the most (Citra) and least (Galena) active hop variants using a combination of bioactivity based thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and HPLC revealed differences in the relative amounts of antimicrobial compounds such as humulone (alpha acid), lupulone (<b>beta</b> <b>acid)</b> and xanthohumol but failed to identify the presence of novel antibacterial compounds. Whilst no new antimicrobial compounds were identified, the Citra hop extract was able to potentiate the activity of the antibiotics imipenem and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of M. abscessus, a fast growing member of the mycobacterium family which infects individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis. The Citra hop extract also inhibited the growth drug resistant isolates of M. abscessus suggesting that it may have activity against other antibiotic resistant mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis With regards to the mode of action, scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct changes to the outer cell structure of the bacteria, suggesting that hops contain compounds that interact with the bacterial cell membrane and/or cell wall. These changes were more profound in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, a compound which also targets the cell wall. Overall hops were shown to contain compounds which inhibited the growth of mycobacterium and were able to potentate the activity of antibiotics currently used to treat these pathogens. These findings suggest hops may be a fruitful source from which to isolate next generation compounds with which to treat increasingly drug resistant strains of mycobacteria...|$|E

40|$|Gaucher disease (GD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the glucosidase, <b>beta,</b> <b>acid</b> (GBA) gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucosylceramidase (GCase).

To circumvent the lethal skin phenotype observed {{in several of the}} previous GCase-deficient animals, we genetically engineered a mouse model with strong reduction in GCase activity in all tissues except the skin. These mice exhibit rapid motor dysfunction associated with severe neurodegeneration and apoptotic cell death within the brain, reminiscent of neuronopathic GD. In addition, we have created a second mouse model, in which GCase deficiency is restricted to neural and glial cell progenitors and progeny. These mice develop similar pathology as the first mouse model, but with a delayed onset and slower disease progression, which indicates that GCase deficiency within microglial cells that are of hematopoietic origin is not the primary determinant of the CNS pathology. These findings also demonstrate that normal microglial cells cannot rescue this neurodegenerative disease.

Because α-synuclein-containing neuronal aggregates are a defining feature of PD and DLB, it is widely believed that mutations in GBA 1 act by enhancing α-synuclein toxicity. To explore this hypothesis, we deleted the Drosophila GBA 1 homolog, dGBA 1 b, and compared the phenotypes of dGBA 1 b mutants in the presence and absence of α-synuclein expression. Homozygous dGBA 1 b mutants exhibit shortened lifespan, locomotor and memory deficits, neurodegeneration, and dramatically increased accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates that are normally degraded through an autophagic mechanism. Ectopic expression of human α-synuclein in dGBA 1 b mutants resulted in a mild enhancement of dopaminergic neuron loss and increased α-synuclein aggregation relative to controls. However, α-synuclein expression did not substantially enhance other dGBA 1 b mutant phenotypes. Our findings indicate that dGBA 1 b {{plays an important role in}} the metabolism of protein aggregates, but that the deleterious consequences of mutations in dGBA 1 b are largely independent of α-synuclein. Future work with dGBA 1 b mutants should reveal the mechanism by which mutations in dGBA 1 b lead to accumulation of protein aggregates, and the potential influence of this protein aggregation on neuronal integrity...|$|E

Increased GBA expression {{has never been}} associated with human disease. We describe increased GBA expression and activity in placenta from preeclamptic pregnancies. 112 placenta biopsies were available for qPCR, analysis of GBA gene expression and activity. Microanalysis was performed on 20 placenta samples. Alternatively spliced placental GBA transcripts were cloned, expressed in HEK 293 cells and analyzed by Western blot and activity assay. GBA is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer of human placenta already at 5 weeks of gestation. We identified five novel GBA transcripts in placenta that enzymatically inactive when expressed in HEK 293 cells. Both GBA RNA expression and enzymatic activity are upregulated in preeclamptic placenta. Microarray analysis of 20 placenta tissues identified 158 genes co-regulating with GBA expression and gene enrichment analysis highlights lysosomal function. In our micro-array data GBA expression does not correlate with FLT 1 expression, currently the most powerful marker for preeclampsia. There are 89 transcripts that are negatively correlated with GBA expression of which BMP 4 and TFEB are interesting as they are essential to early placenta function. Although very speculative, we hypothesize that increased GBA expression might relate to placentation through decreased BMP 4 signaling or vascularization through downregulation of TFEB.

40|$|International audienceAbstractConverging {{evidence}} from genetic, pathological and experimental studies have increasingly suggested {{an important role}} for autophagy impairment in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Genetic studies have identified mutations in genes encoding for components of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP), including glucosidase <b>beta</b> <b>acid</b> 1 (GBA 1), {{that are associated with}} increased risk for developing PD. Observations in PD brain tissue suggest an aberrant regulation of autophagy associated with the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn). As autophagy {{is one of the main}} systems involved in the proteolytic degradation of α-syn, pharmacological enhancement of autophagy may be an attractive strategy to combat α-syn aggregation in PD. Here, we review the potential of autophagy enhancement as disease-modifying therapy in PD based on preclinical evidence. In particular, we provide an overview of the molecular regulation of autophagy and targets for pharmacological modulation within the ALP. In experimental models, beneficial effects on multiple pathological processes involved in PD, including α-syn aggregation, cell death, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, have been demonstrated using the autophagy enhancers rapamycin and lithium. However, selectivity of these agents is limited, while upstream ALP signaling proteins are involved in many other pathways than autophagy. Broad stimulation of autophagy may therefore cause a wide spectrum of dose-dependent side-effects, suggesting that its clinical applicability is limited. However, recently developed agents selectively targeting core ALP components, including Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), lysosomes, GCase as well as chaperone-mediated autophagy regulators, exert more specific effects on molecular pathogenetic processes causing PD. To conclude, the targeted manipulation of downstream ALP components, rather than broad autophagy stimulation, may be an attractive strategy for the development of novel pharmacological therapies in PD. Further characterization of dysfunctional autophagy in different stages and molecular subtypes of PD in combination with the clinical translation of downstream autophagy regulation offers exciting new avenues for future drug development...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the varroacidal active ingredients oxalic acid dihydrate and hop beta acids on the honeybee Apis mellifera and the pathogens causing Nosemosis, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. The conservation of the honeybee has exceptional ecological and economic importance and the treatment of honeybee colonies with veterinary medicines is essential. Colony infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor causes colony collapse within 2 - 3 years unless the colonies are treated regularly. The varroacides oxalic acid and beta acids are highly effective but the effect on the individual honeybee (e. g. pH-value of parts of the intestine and hemolymph) in low sublethal doses has not been studied sufficiently. There is also the assumption that the use of organic acids to combat Varroosis will reduce the prevailance of Nosemosis in honeybee colonies. The tolerance of oxalic acid is described for the dermal and oral application on individually treated honeybees. A dose-response was tested for the following doses: 175 µg, 212, 5 µg, 250 µg, 375 µg and 500 µg/bee after dermal application; 10 µg, 50 µg, 75 µg, 80 µg and 100 µg/bee after oral application. <b>Beta</b> <b>acid</b> were also tested in a dose-depended study: 6 µg, 12, 5 µg, 25 µg, 37, 5 µg and 50 µg/bee after dermal application; 50 µg, 75 µg and 100 µg/bee after oral application. The bee mortality was monitored in intervals of 24, 48 and 72 hours. The dermal application of oxalic acid was well tolerated in a dose up to 212, 5 µg/bee. Increased bee mortality was documented exceeding 25 % in the highest doses. The oral application was not very well tolerated. It resulted in a dose-dependent mortality with a peak at 55 % when applying 100 µg oxalic acid/bee. Beta acids showed low bee toxicity in doses up to 50 µg/bee after dermal application. The oral application of beta acids caused increased bee mortality in all tested dosages. Honeybees kept in the laboratory were treated individually (oral and dermal) with sublethal doses of oxalic acid and beta acids. The pH-value measurement of the intestinal parts (crop, ventriculus, rectum) and hemolymph was conducted in 24 hour intervals. To define the physiological pH-value (“standard”) of the organs, honeybees were analysed subsequently to the sampling of the colony. The physiological pH-values of the honeybee intestinal parts and hemolymph were derived as a standard: crop pH 5. 21, ventriculus pH 6. 55, rectum pH 5. 04, hemolymph pH 6. 72. The treatment with oxalic acid resulted in reduced pH-values of the contents of the crop, the ventriculus (significantly at 48 and 72 hours), the rectum (significantly at 48 and 72 hours) and the hemolymph (significantly at 24 and 72 hours). The treatment with beta acids resulted in increased pH-values of the contents of the crop (significantly at 48 hours), the ventriculus (significantly at 24 hours), the rectum (significantly at 24 hours) and significantly changed pH-values of the hemolymph (at 24 and 72 hours). The infection level of honeybees with Nosema spp. was observed in the laboratory for 35 days after the treatment with oxalic acid and beta acids. In a field experiment nucleus colonies were infected with Nosema spores and treated with the products Oxuvar® (active ingredient: oxalic acid) and HopGuard® (active ingredient: beta acids). The infection level was observed for 25 days by means of individual bee sampling. The application of oxalic acid and beta acids to Nosema diseased bees resulted in a reduced count 8 days post treatment in both test groups compared to the untreated control group. One colony treated with HopGuard® indicated a temporary inhibition of Nosema infection. The individual treatment of honeybees with oxalic acid and beta acids changed the pH-value of the intestinal parts and the hemolymph. The shift towards stronger acidity after oxalic acid treatment confirms that damage to the epithelial tissue and organs is caused by hyperacidity. There is evidence that the growth of the microsporidia Nosema spp. is inhibited; while not preventing the Nosema dispersal in the colony completely it would allow the beekeeper to introduce appropriate remedial measures...|$|E
