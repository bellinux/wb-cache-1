5|$|Peggy Rockman {{was one of}} {{a number}} of artists who first learned {{painting}} through a course run in 1986 at Lajamanu by an adult education officer, John Quinn, associated with the local Technical and Further Education unit. The course, initially attended only by men, eventually enrolled over a hundred community members. Others who began their painting careers through that course include Mona Rockman Napaljarri and Louisa Napaljarri. Western Desert artists such as Peggy Rockman will frequently paint particular 'dreamings', or stories, for which they have personal responsibility or rights, which in Peggy's case include Ngatijirri (<b>budgerigar),</b> Warna (snake), Laju and Ngarlu.|$|E

40|$|<b>Budgerigars</b> {{were trained}} with operant {{conditioning}} procedures to discriminate among sets {{of calls from}} several species in a Same-Different task. Response latencies from this task were analyzed in several ways including multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis. The pattern of response latencies from <b>budgerigars</b> reared in {{a large group of}} conspecifics was compared to that of <b>budgerigars</b> reared in acoustic and social isolation. Results show that <b>budgerigars</b> with previous experience with species-specific vocalizations and isolate-reared birds who had never heard such sounds can both discriminate among the categories of species-specific vocal signals. But, results from MDS and cluster analysis also show that rearing <b>budgerigars</b> in isolation has subtle effects on the perception of these categories of vocal signals. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the real role that was played by the <b>budgerigars</b> (Melopsittacus undulatus) in the {{epidemiological}} plan, under the perspective of its being an infection source of the Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). For this, the study used Specific-Pathogen-Free chicks (SPF) that were housed with <b>budgerigars</b> that were inoculated with a pathogenic strain (velogenic viscerotropic) of NDV (EID 50 = 10 8. 15 / 0. 1 mL) pathogenic to chickens, by the ocular-nasal via. Each group was composed by 10 SPF chicks and 5 <b>budgerigars.</b> After 5 days of the inoculation of the <b>budgerigars</b> with NDV, SPF chicks were put together with each group of <b>budgerigars,</b> {{so that there was}} a direct contact between both species. Cloacal swabs and blood samples were collected in both species (<b>budgerigars</b> and SPF chicks) after 13 and 19 days post-challenge, respectively, for genome viral excretion by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and antibodys search by the inhibition of hemmaglutination test (HI). <b>Budgerigars</b> did not demonstrate any clinical signs of Newcastle Disease (ND). They were refractory to the clinical disease with the NDV. However, antibody titres from inhibition of Hemagglutination (HI) test were detected 9 and 21 days after challenge. Therefore, it was demonstrated the state of carrier of NDV in this species. In SPF chicks allocated with infected <b>budgerigars,</b> NDV genome was detected 13 and 19 days after challenge. Thus, the transmission of the pathogenic virus from the <b>budgerigars</b> to SPF chicks that were housed together was evident until 19 days of the experimental infection with this pathogen. This reveals the importance of the <b>budgerigars</b> from the epidemiological point of view as a potential source of infection of the NDV to commercial chickens that could be raised near this species...|$|R

25|$|Parrots may {{not make}} good pets for most people because of their natural wild {{instincts}} such as screaming and chewing. Although parrots can be very affectionate and cute when immature, they often become aggressive when mature (partly due to mishandling and poor training) and may bite, causing serious injury. For this reason, parrot rescue groups estimate that most parrots are surrendered and rehomed through at least five homes before reaching their permanent destinations or before dying prematurely from unintentional or intentional neglect and abuse. The parrots' ability to mimic human words and their bright colours and beauty prompt impulse buying from unsuspecting consumers. The domesticated <b>budgerigar,</b> a small parrot, {{is the most popular}} of all pet bird species. In 1992, the newspaper USA Today published that 11 million pet birds were in the United States alone, many of them parrots. Europeans kept birds matching the description of the rose-ringed parakeet (or called the ring-necked parrot), documented particularly in a first-century account by Pliny the Elder. As they have been prized for thousands of years for their beauty and ability to talk, they have also often been misunderstood. For example, author Wolfgang de Grahl says in his 1987 book The Grey Parrot that some importers had parrots drink only coffee while they were shipped by boat, believing that pure water was detrimental and that their actions would increase survival rates during shipping. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted that the caffeine in coffee is toxic to birds.|$|E

40|$|<b>Budgerigars</b> (Melopsittacus undulatus) and Bourke's parrots (Neopsephotus bourkii) {{are closely}} related birds with {{different}} activity patterns. <b>Budgerigars</b> are strictly diurnal while Bourke's parrots are active in dim twilight. Earlier {{studies show that the}} intensity threshold of colour vision is similar in both species while Bourke's parrots have larger eyes with a higher density of rods than <b>budgerigars.</b> In this study, we investigate whether this could be an adaptation for better spatial vision in dim light. We used two alternative forced-choice experiments to determine the spatial acuity of both species at light intensities ranging from 0. 08 to 73 cd/m(2). We also determined the spatial contrast sensitivity function (CSF) for bright light in Bourke's parrots and compare it to existing data for <b>budgerigars.</b> The spatial acuity of Bourke's parrots was found to be similar to that of <b>budgerigars</b> at all light levels. Also the CSF of Bourke's parrots {{is similar to that of}} <b>budgerigars</b> with a sensitivity peak located between 2. 1 and 2. 6 cycles/degree. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that Bourke's parrots have superior spatial acuity in dim light compared to <b>budgerigars</b> and the adaptive value of the relatively rod-rich and large eyes of Bourke's parrots remains unclear...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to examine the {{skeleton}} of domesticated <b>budgerigars</b> of phenotypically different breeding types, to describe the expression of skeletal changes and to discuss the results with special reference to the causes and effects of breed-conditioned alterations. Complete skeletons of 39 adult <b>budgerigars</b> of both sexes were the object of our research. The examinations demonstrated that almost all metrically sized skeleton dimensions of <b>budgerigars</b> of the exhibition type were increased significantly, compared with those of the non-exhibition type. Only for the scapula significant length differences between the <b>budgerigars</b> of both breeding types could not be verified. It can be stated that the measuring parameters �occipital width�, �maxilla length�, �skull length� and �prefrontal width� are suitable for the characterization of exhibition <b>budgerigars.</b> However, sexual dimorphisms could be verified in only three parameters (width of the pars symphysialis mandibulae, height of the skull, width of the skull within the range of the occiput). It has to be clarified in future studies to what extent the changes in the skeleton of <b>budgerigars</b> of the exhibition type have already had consequences for their flying ability, metabolism, health and well-being...|$|R

40|$|The warble song of male <b>budgerigars</b> (Melopsittacus undulatus) is an {{extraordinarily}} complex, multi-syllabic, learned vocalization that is produced continuously in streams lasting {{from a few}} seconds to a few minutes without obvious repetition of particular patterns. As a follow-up of the warble analysis of Farabaugh et al. (1992), an automatic categorization program based on neural networks was developed and used to efficiently and reliably classify more than 25, 000 warble elements from 4 <b>budgerigars.</b> The relative proportion of the resultant seven basic acoustic groups and one compound group is similar across individuals. <b>Budgerigars</b> showed higher discriminability of warble elements drawn from different acoustic categories and lower discriminability of warble elements drawn from the same category psychophysically, suggesting that they form seven perceptual categories corresponding to those established acoustically. <b>Budgerigars</b> also perceive individual voice characteristics in addition to the acoustic measures delineating categories. Acoustic analyses of long sequences of natural warble revealed that the elements were not randomly arranged and that warble has at least a 5 th-order Markovian structure. Perceptual experiments provided convergent evidence that <b>budgerigars</b> are able to master a novel sequence between 4 and 7 elements in length. Through gradual training with chunking (about 5 elements), birds are able to master sequences up to 50 elements. The ability of <b>budgerigars</b> to detect inserted targets taken in a long, running background of natural warble sequences appears to be species-specific and related to the acoustic structure of warble sounds...|$|R
