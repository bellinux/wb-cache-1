40|$|Of {{the three}} {{species of the}} genus Squalus {{that occur in the}} Mediterranean Sea, <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> and <b>S.</b> megalops are very {{difficult}} to distinguish. This study assesses the variability in morphological features that have been used to differentiate between these species. Squalus were collected from stations within the 25 -nautical mile Fisheries Management Zone around the Maltese Islands; 349 specimens were dissected and categorized into male and female, mature and immature, and individuals were randomly selected from each category to make up a sample of 169 specimens. For each individual, total length and first dorsal fin parameters were measured, and morphology of denticles isolated from the laterodorsal area, of the upper and lower teeth and of the chondrocranium was analysed. The first dorsal spine was shorter that the fin base in 93 % of the specimens, which is typical of S. megalops; this character was not related to either gender or maturity. Chondrocrania with one lateral process (typical of <b>S.</b> <b>blainville)</b> and two lateral processes (typical of S. megalops) were present. Teeth from the same individuals showed morphological features that overlap between <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> and <b>S.</b> megalops. Both unicuspid (typical of S. megalops) and tricuspid denticles (typical of <b>S.</b> <b>blainville)</b> were observed on the same individuals. Twelve specimens (six having one and six having two lateral chondrocranial processes) were analysed genetically by sequencing of the mtDNA marker Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit I (COI). All resulted to be <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> showing that intraspecific variability in supposedly diagnostic morphological features is large enough to render these unreliable to tell apart these two species, especially in the field. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The small-spotted {{catshark}} (Scyliorhinus canicula) (Linnaeus, 1758) and the {{longnose spurdog}} (Squalus blainville) (Risso, 1826) are two species {{occurring in the}} European and western African continental shelves with a wide geographical distribution. In this study, the diet of <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> and <b>S.</b> canicula off the Portuguese western Atlantic coast was investigated in 2006 by collecting monthly samples of these two species from local fishing vessels. In the stomachs of both species, crustaceans and teleosts were the dominant prey items, and molluscs, polychaetes, echinoderms, and sipunculids were found in lower abundance. In S. canicula, urochordate and chondrichthyan species were also observed in stomachs and were classified as accidental prey items. Scyliorhinus canicula consumed a broader group of prey items than did <b>S.</b> <b>blainville.</b> A significant diet overlap was observed, despite both species occupying different depth ranges over the continental shelf. Scyliorhinus canicula exhibited a consistency in diet composition among seasons, sexes, and maturity stages. Nonetheless, for both adults and juveniles, an increase in relative abundance of teleosts in the diet was observed {{in the spring and}} summer. This study provides evidence of the importance of S. canicula and <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> as benthic and pelagic predators along the western Atlantic coast...|$|R
40|$|V Jornadas Ibéricas de Ictiología SIBIC, Conhecer para preservar, 24 - 27 June 2014, Lisboa. [...] 1 pageThe genus Squalus, or dogfishes, {{includes}} many coastal shark species commonly caught in commercial fisheries around the world. Despite their abundance, species diversity within Squalus is still poorly understood. In fact, recent {{studies on the}} Indo-Pacific region have described several new species, highlighting the need for revisionary taxonomic work clarifying and discriminating the different taxa. Less {{attention has been paid}} to the diversity of Squalus in the Atlantic Ocean sensu lato, where only five species have been reported out of the 27 species currently accepted for the genus, namely <b>S.</b> acanthias, <b>S.</b> <b>blainville,</b> <b>S.</b> megalops, S. mitsukurii, and S. cubensis. Notwithstanding, species identification across the region appears to be very inconsistent and there is great taxonomic uncertainty among some of the Atlantic Squalus, particularly concerning the status of S. megalops and <b>S.</b> <b>blainville.</b> This situation has contributed to the present confusion in terms of the actual species composition in the region, thus compromising the effectiveness and adequacy of any management and conservation efforts. In an initial effort to contribute to a comprehensive and clear alpha taxonomy of this highly diverse worldwidedistributed genus, we applied molecular genetic markers (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and NADHdehydrogenase 2) aiming to evaluate the number of discrete genetic lineages within Squalus in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, we compared this regional lineage diversity to that found worldwide, using publicly available data. Our results confirm the inconsistencies in species identification in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. For instance, putative <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> and <b>S.</b> megalops sampled across the Mediterranean and along the eastern Atlantic from Portugal to South Africa clustered together in a single clade, sister to the clade of the Australian S. megalops (i. e. from the type location). Our data also indicate the presence of three highly divergent genetic lineages of Squalus in the Mediterranean Sea, comprising three distinct species. Furthermore, we found evidence of the presence of the S. cubensis lineage (currently described only for the western Atlantic) in the equatorial eastern AtlanticPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The alpha {{taxonomy}} of the globally distributed shark genus Squalus {{has been under}} intense investigation recently, and many new species have been described over the last decade.

To aid in clarifying the taxonomic status of Squalus species in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, we assessed species diversity at the molecular level and evaluated the consistency in species identification in the region. Samples from all nominal Squalus species recognized in the above regions were collected in an international effort and sequenced for regions of the mitochondrial COI and ND 2 genes.

40|$|Squalus blainville {{is one of}} {{the least}} studied Mediterranean shark species. Despite being intensively fished in several locations, {{biological}} knowledge is limited and no genetic structure information is available. This is the first study to examine the genetic structure of <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> in the Mediterranean Sea. Considering the high dispersal potential inferred for other squalid sharks, the hypothesis of panmixia was tested based on a 585 bp fragment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from 107 individuals and six nuclear microsatellite loci from 577 individuals. Samples were collected across the Ionian, Aegean and Libyan Seas and off the Balearic Islands. Twenty three additional sequences of Mediterranean and South African origin were retrieved from GenBank and included in the mitochondrial DNA analysis. The overall haplotype diversity was high, in contrast to the low nucleotide diversity. Low and non-significant pairwise ΦST and FST values along with a Bayesian cluster analysis suggested high connectivity with subsequent genetic homogeneity among the populations studied, and thus a high dispersal potential for <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> similar to other squalids. The historical demography of the species was also assessed, revealing a pattern of population expansion since the middle Pleistocene. These findings could be considered in species-specific conservation plans, although sampling over a larger spatial scale and more genetic markers are required to fully elucidate the genetic structure and dispersal potential of <b>S.</b> <b>blainville...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aging chondrichthyans {{has been}} {{characterized}} as a slow and difficult process, {{but at the same}} time it is considered of fundamental importance for the holistic management and conservation of their populations. This study aims to assess the age and growth of the longnose <b>spurdog</b> <b>S.</b> <b>blainville,</b> to correlate the results to the species’ biological features and to compare them with those reported in previous studies that used different aging methods. By counting the growth bands on the enamel surface of the dorsal fin spines, age was estimated in 569 out of 810 individuals that were taken as by-catch from commercial fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea during an 8 -year period. Spine morphometrics revealed sexual dimorphism as far as spine length, spine base width and spine weight are concerned. The between-sex differences were also reflected in the length-weight relationships, in the gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indices, and in the condition factor (K). All three somatic indices differed significantly among maturity stages, seasons or age classes. The reproducibility of the age readings was considered high based on the estimated CV and APE precision indices. Age bias plots also indicated no significant intra- and small inter-reader variation. The estimated VBGF parameters were: L∞ = 1097. 3 mm, k = 0. 03 yr− 1 and t 0 = − 5. 58 yrs for females, and L∞ = 665. 5 mm, k = 0. 08 yr− 1 and t 0 = − 3. 35 yrs for males. Likelihood ratio tests showed that all growth parameters were statistically significantly different between sexes (2 = 38. 26, df = 3, P < 0. 001). Females reached higher longevity (28 yrs) than males (22 yrs) and attained maturity at higher age and larger size (T 50 = 17 yrs and L 50 = 568. 1 mm) than males did (T 50 = 11. 3 yrs and L 50 = 460. 6 mm). <b>S.</b> <b>blainville</b> seems to be a long-lived shark of slow growth and late maturity, a combination of traits indicating a species of great vulnerability to fishing pressure that can only sustain a low harvest rate...|$|R
40|$|The genus Solecurtus in British and Irish waters is {{represented}} by two species S. scopula (Turton 1822) and S. candidus (Brocchi 1814). Solecurtus candidus (Brocchi) is conspecific with S. scopula sensu auct. when applied to Mediterranean and Lusitanian shells, and the synonymy presented in current checklists is revised. Solecurtus multistriatus (Scacchi 1835), <b>S.</b> albus de <b>Blainville</b> 1827, <b>S.</b> gallicus (Chenu 1843) and Adasius loscombeus Leach 1852 are all considered junior synonyms of S. scopula (Turton).

40|$|Deep-water sharks {{have low}} {{biological}} productivity and {{are vulnerable to}} exploitation with species-specific regional life history required to enable effective management. The present study describes the life history of two squalids collected from Australia: (1) the piked spurdog (Squalus megalops) from the tropical Great Barrier Reef; and (2) the Philippine <b>spurdog</b> (<b>S.</b> montalbani) from New South Wales. Maximum observed ages {{for males and females}} were 18 and 25 years for S. megalops and 28 and 27 years for S. montalbani. Multiple growth models were all well supported and indicated very slow growth rates for both species. The tropical S. megalops population was smaller and older at maturity than previously reported temperate populations. Males were mature at 352 -mm stretched total length (LST) and 12. 6 years, whereas females were mature at 422 mm LST and 19. 1 years. Squalus montalbani males were mature at 700 mm LST and 21. 8 years, whereas females were mature at 800 mm LST and 26 years. Fecundity was lower for S. megalops than S. montalbani with two to three compared with nine to 16 embryos. Both species have a conservative life history, although in the event of overfishing the longer-lived, later-maturing and deeper-dwelling S. montalbani is likely to take longer to recover than S. megalops...|$|R
