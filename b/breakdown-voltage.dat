40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ionizing}} radiation on the breakdown voltage of p-channel power MOSFETs were examined through two-dimensional simulation. <b>Breakdown-voltage</b> performance of p-channel power MOSFETs {{was found to}} be very different from corresponding nchannel power MOSFETs. In pchannel devices, simulation showed <b>breakdown-voltage</b> enhancement for low values of positive oxide-trapped charge, Not, whereas for high values of Not, the breakdown voltage may or may not continue to increase, and may actually decrease in some topologies. For comparison, in n-channel devices, increases in Not always cause <b>breakdown-voltage</b> degradation. The uncertainties stem from the interaction of the depletion region of the device (which is a function of its termination method) with its isolation technology, making it difficult to predict breakdown voltage for large Not. However, insights gained through analysis of depletion-region spreading in p-channel devices suggest a termination/isolation scheme, the VLD-FRR, that will enhance p-channel device reliability in radiation environments.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ionizing}} radiation on the <b>breakdown-voltage</b> degradation of power-MOSFET termination structures were examined through two-dimensional simulation. A {{wide variety of}} sensitivity to surface-charge density was found for various devices employing floating field rings and/or equipotential field plates. Termination structures that were both insensitive to surface charge and possessed a high breakdown voltage were identified. The results were compared with measurements made on selected structures. The principal ionizing radiation damaging mechanisms in MOS devices are discussed. Modifications made to an existing simulation program in order to simulate these complex field ring and field plate structures are described. Background information into how these termination structures improve the breakdown voltage and their sensitivities to positive interface charge buildup is investigated...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} years a new device for photon {{detection}} has been developed by Philips Digital Photon Counting, combining Silicon-PMT techniques with integrated logic, to get a fully digital photo sensor (dSiPM). An Evaluation Kit for dSiPMs has been installed at the Central Institute for Electronics at the Forschungszentrum Jülich. First measurements show, that the chip temperature is a factor {{that has to be}} controlled by the operator, since the higher integrated electronics on the die heat up the sensor. In this work, we present our first results focusing the influence of the temperature on the digital SiPMs. A test setup with a high power Peltier element has been set up to cool down the sensor device below - 10 °C. Several measurements have been done with the dSiPM evaluation kit to show the behaviour of the <b>breakdown-voltage</b> and the dark count rate under different temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{recurrence}} {{theory for}} the breakdown probability in avalanche photodiodes (APDs) is generalized to heterostructure APDs {{that may have}} multiple multiplication layers. The generalization addresses layer-boundary effects such as the initial energy of injected carriers {{as well as the}} layer-dependent profile of the dead space in the multiplication region. Reducing the width of the multiplication layer serves to both downshift and sharpen the breakdown probability curve {{as a function of the}} applied reverse-bias voltage. In structures where the injected carriers have an initial energy that is comparable to the ionization threshold energy, the transition from linear mode to Geiger-mode is more abrupt than in structures in which such initial energy is negligible. The theory is applied to two recently fabricated Al 0 6 Ga 0 4 As [...] GaAs heterostructure APDs and to other homostructure thin GaAs APDs and the predictions of the <b>breakdown-voltage</b> thresholds are verified...|$|E
40|$|Silicon technology, {{which is}} the most {{mainstream}} semiconductor technology, poses serious limitations on fulfilling the market demands in high-frequency and high-power applications. In response to these limitations, wide bandgap III-nitride devices, including AlxGa 1 -xN/GaN heterojunction field effect transistors (HFETs), were introduced at about two decades ago to satisfy these rapidly growing market demands for high-power/high-frequency amplifiers and high-voltage/high-temperature switches. The most appealing features of III-nitride technologies, and particularly AlxGa 1 -xN/GaN HFETs, in these applications, are the polarization-induced high sheet-carrier-concentration, high <b>breakdown-voltage,</b> high electron saturation-velocity, and high maximum operating temperature. Therefore, the development of enhancement-mode AlGaN/GaN HFETs {{is one of the most}} important endeavours in the past two decades. Low-frequency noise (LFN) spectroscopy, empowered by a proper physics-based model, is received as a capable tool for reliability studies. As a result, devising a physics-based LFN model for AlGaN/GaN HFETs can be capable of not only evaluating the alternative techniques proposed for realization of enhancement-mode AlGaN/GaN HFETs, but also more importantly forecasting the reliability, and noise performance of these devices. In this dissertation, for the first time, a physics-based model for the low-frequency drain noise-current of AlGaN/GaN HFETs is proposed. The proposed model, through including the thermally-activated and quantum tunneling processes of trapping/de-trapping of electrons of channel into and out of the trap-sites located both in the barrier- and buffer-layer of these HFETs, provides a descriptive picture for the LFN behavior of these devices. This work also aims to experimentally investigate the low-frequency noise-current characteristics of both conventional and newly-proposed devices (i. e., fin-, and island-isolated AlGaN/GaN HFETs) at various temperatures (i. e., 150, 300, and 450 K) and bias points in order to address the possible difficulties in performance of these devices. Matching of the trends proposed by the physics-based model to the experimentally recorded LFN spectra of AlGaN/GaN HFETs designed according to a newly-proposed technological variant for positive-shifting the threshold-voltage, confirms the accuracy and predicting power of the proposed model. The insights gained from this model on the latter group of devices provide evidence for the challenges of the aforementioned technological variants, and as a result offer assistance in proposing remedies for those challenges. In formulating the LFN model, a massive discrepancy between the predictions of the existing analytical relationships used by others in evaluating the subband energy levels of AlGaN/GaN HFETs and the realities of the polarization-induced electron concentration of these HFETs was spotted. Careful evaluation of the polarization properties of these heterostructures unmasked the inaccuracy of the assumption of zero penetration of the electron wave into both the AlGaN barrier-layer and the GaN buffer-layer as the culprit in this discrepancy. In response to this observation, a model based on the variational-method for calculating the first and second subband energy levels of AlGaN/GaN HFETs is developed. On the basis of this model, more accurate analytical frameworks for calculating these subband energy levels in AlGaN/GaN HFETs for a variety of barrier thicknesses and Al mole-fractions in the barrier-layer are proposed. ...|$|E
