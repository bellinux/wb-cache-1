5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus tylopili {{has been}} {{isolated from the}} mycorrhizosphere of T.felleus; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect {{the activity of the}} microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes enzymes that allow it to break down the <b>biomolecule</b> chitin.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of <b>biomolecule.</b> It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E

Some examples are lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, hormones, amino acids, nucleotides, peptides, RNA and polysaccharides, but this list is far from exhaustive. Research on <b>biomolecules</b> encompasses multiple fascinating questions. How are <b>biomolecules</b> synthesized and modified? What are their structures and interactions with other <b>biomolecules?</b> How do <b>biomolecules</b> function in biological processes, {{at the level of}} organelles, cells, organs, organisms, or even ecosystems?

I developed instrumentation, protocols, and theoretical frameworks for the nanoscale electrical characterization of <b>biomolecules</b> by AFM. Two novel types of AFM electrical characterizations were developed: electron transport through the <b>biomolecules</b> and dielectric polarization of the <b>biomolecules</b> (each one requires different instrumentation, protocols and theory).

25|$|The {{cytoplasm}} of erythrocytes {{is rich in}} hemoglobin, an iron-containing <b>biomolecule</b> {{that can}} bind oxygen and {{is responsible for the}} red color of the cells. The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} <b>biomolecules</b> enabled their application to numerous fields like medicine and materials. Synthetically modified <b>biomolecules</b> can have diverse functionalities, such as tracking cellular events, revealing enzyme function, determining protein biodistribution, imaging specific biomarkers, and delivering drugs to targeted cells. Bioconjugation is a crucial strategy that links these modified <b>biomolecules</b> with different substrates.|$|R
40|$|Local {{delivery}} of therapeutic <b>biomolecules</b> to stimulate bone regeneration has matured considerably {{during the past}} decades, but control over the release of these <b>biomolecules</b> still remains a major challenge. To this end, suitable carriers that allow for tunable spatial and temporal {{delivery of}} <b>biomolecules</b> need to be developed. Gelatin {{is one of the}} most widely used natural polymers for the controlled and sustained delivery of <b>biomolecules</b> because of its biodegradability, biocompatibility, biosafety and cost-effectiveness.

25|$|Drug design, often {{referred}} to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a <b>biomolecule</b> such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies on the knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.|$|E
25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of <b>biomolecule</b> found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{data was}} simply passed one-way from a central {{processing}} unit (CPU) to a graphics processing unit (GPU), then to a display device. However, as time progressed, it became valuable for GPUs to store at first simple, then complex structures of data to be passed back to the CPU that analyzed an image, or a set of scientific-data represented as a 2D or 3D format that a video card can understand. Because the GPU has access to every draw operation, it can analyze data in these forms quickly, whereas a CPU must poll every pixel or data element much more slowly, as the speed of access between a CPU and its larger pool of random-access memory (or in an even worse case, a hard drive) is slower than GPUs and video cards, which typically contain smaller amounts of more expensive memory that is much faster to access. Transferring {{the portion of the}} data set to be actively analyzed to that GPU memory in the form of textures or other easily readable GPU forms results in speed increase. The distinguishing feature of a GPGPU design is the ability to transfer information bidirectionally back from the GPU to the CPU; generally the data throughput in both directions is ideally high, resulting in a multiplier effect on the speed of a specific high-use algorithm. GPGPU pipelines may improve efficiency on especially large data sets and/or data containing 2D or 3D imagery. It is used in complex graphics pipelines as well as scientific computing; more so in fields with large data sets like genome mapping, or where two- or three-dimensional analysis is useful especially at present <b>biomolecule</b> analysis, protein study, and other complex organic chemistry. Such pipelines can also vastly improve efficiency in image processing and computer vision, among other fields; as well as parallel processing generally. Some very heavily optimized pipelines have yielded speed increases of several hundred times the original CPU-based pipeline on one high-use task.|$|E

40|$|Via immunomagnetic {{reduction}} assay, <b>biomolecules</b> can be quantitatively detected with aid of biofunctionalized magnetic nanoparticles, {{which are}} used as labeling markers for specific <b>biomolecules.</b> To achieve ultra-high sensitivity in detecting <b>biomolecules,</b> {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) is a promising candidate to act as a sensor to the magnetic signal related to the concentration of detected <b>biomolecules.</b> In the past, we developed a single channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometry. In order to increase the detection through-put, multichannel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometry is developed. In this work, the design and working principle of four-channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometry are introduced. Using utilizing scanning technology, four samples can be simultaneously logged into the SQUID-based magnetosusceptometry. Notably, only single SQUID magnetometer is used in the magnetosusceptometry. The precision and sensitivity in detecting <b>biomolecules</b> using the four-channel SQUID-based magnetosusceptometry are investigated. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Immobilization of <b>biomolecules</b> allows exploiting characteristics of the molecule under controlled environments.

[...] The allows for the visualization of <b>biomolecule</b> elements of the cell. [...] In the study of embryogenesis immunofluorescence may be used for purposes similar to hybridization, for the tracking of proteins that are involved {{in the development of the}} embryo and their specific time and place of production and use.

2500|$|Enhanced {{chemiluminescence}} is {{a common}} technique {{for a variety of}} detection assays in biology. [...] A horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) is tethered to an antibody that specifically recognizes the molecule of interest.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) comprises the heterogeneous environment outside of cells in a biological system. The ECM is dynamically organized and regulated, and many <b>biomolecules</b> secreted from cells diffuse throughout the ECM, regulating {{a variety of}} cellular processes. Therefore, investigation of the diffusive behaviors of <b>biomolecules</b> in the extracellular environment is critical. In this study, we investigated the diffusion coefficients of <b>biomolecules</b> of various sizes, measuring from 1 to 10 nm in radius, by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in contracted collagen gel caused by fibroblasts, a traditional culture model of dynamic rearrangement of collagen fibers. The diffusion coefficients of the <b>biomolecules</b> in control collagen gel without cells decreased slightly as compared to those in solution, while the diffusion coefficients of <b>biomolecules</b> in the contracted gel at the cell vicinity decreased dramatically.
