25|$|In 1941, the Bíró {{brothers}} and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany {{and moved to}} Argentina, where they formed Bíró Pens of Argentina and filed a new patent in 1943. Their pen was sold in Argentina as the Birome (portmanteau of the names Bíró and Meyne), which is how <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> are still known in that country. This new design was licensed by the British, who produced <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> for RAF aircrew as the Biro. <b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> {{were found to be}} more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> are {{produced}} in both disposable and refillable models. Refills {{allow for the}} entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip, which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> are {{sometimes}} provided free by businesses, such as hotels, {{as a form}} of advertising—printed with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|Effects not {{generally}} associated with <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> can be achieved. Traditional pen-and-ink {{techniques such as}} stippling and cross-hatching {{can be used to}} create half-tones or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens.</b> If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear. Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.|$|E
25|$|The common {{ballpoint pen}} {{is a product}} of mass production, with {{components}} produced separately on assembly lines. Basic steps in the manufacturing process include production of ink formulas, moulding of metal and plastic components, and assembly. Marcel Bich was involved in developing the production of inexpensive <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens.</b>|$|E
25|$|A ballpoint {{tip that}} can write comfortably {{for a long}} period of time is not easy to produce as it {{requires}} high-precision machinery and thin high grade steel alloy plates. China that currently (2017) produces about 80 percent of the world's <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> relied up to 2017 on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> {{have proven}} to be a {{versatile}} art medium for professional artists as well as amateur doodlers. Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply. Some artists use them within mixed-media works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{tools for}} a calligrapher are {{the pen and}} the brush. Calligraphy pens write with nibs that may be flat, round, or pointed. For some decorative purposes, multi-nibbed pens—steel brushes—can be used. However, works have also been created with felt-tip and <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens,</b> although these works do not employ angled lines. There are some styles of calligraphy, like Gothic script, which require a stub nib pen.|$|E
25|$|Although {{designs and}} {{construction}} vary between brands, basic {{components of a}}ll <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> are universal. Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a socket holding the ball in place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ink reservoir supplying ink to the ball. In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.|$|E
25|$|A <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> is {{a writing}} {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen,</b> it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> that left paper smudge-free.|$|R

25|$|Famous 20th-century {{artists such}} as Andy Warhol, among others, have {{utilised}} <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> to some extent during their careers. Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with contemporary artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist Il Lee has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, Lennie Mace creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim. The artist coined terms such as PENtings and Media Graffiti to describe his varied output. More recently, British artist James Mylne has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color. In the mid-2000s (decade), Juan Francisco Casas generated Internet attention {{for a series of}} large-scale, photo-realistic ballpoint duplications of his own snapshots of friends, utilising only blue pens.|$|E
2500|$|Using <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> {{to create}} artwork {{is not without}} limitations. Color {{availability}} and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists. Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased. Additionally, [...] "blobbing" [...] of ink on the drawing surface and [...] "skipping" [...] of ink-flow require consideration when using <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> for artistic purposes. Although the mechanics of <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> with [...] "erasable ink" [...] were {{pioneered by}} the Paper Mate pen company. The ink {{formulas}} of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent. Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning {{they can also}} write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.|$|E
2500|$|Paper Mate pens, {{among the}} {{emerging}} ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought {{the rights to}} distribute their own <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> in Canada. Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as [...] "banker-approved". In 1954, Parker Pens released The Jotter—the company's first ballpoint—boasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens. In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars. In the 1960s, the failing Eversharp Co. sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.|$|E
2500|$|The Mission School {{is closely}} {{aligned with the}} larger lowbrow art movement, and can be {{considered}} to be a regional expression of that movement. Artists of the Mission School take their inspiration from the urban, bohemian, [...] "street" [...] culture of the Mission District and are strongly influenced by mural and graffiti art, comic and cartoon art, and folk art forms such as sign painting and hobo art. These artists are also noted for use of non-traditional artistic materials, such as house paint, spray paint, correction fluid, <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens,</b> scrapboard, and found objects. Gallery work by these artists is often displayed using the [...] "cluster method", in which a number of individual works (sometimes by different artists) are clustered closely together on a gallery wall, rather than the traditional gallery display method of widely separating individual works.|$|E
