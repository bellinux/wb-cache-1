40|$|Background: Given the {{difficult}} clinical differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), growing interest resulted {{in research on}} alpha-synuclein as a potential cerebrospinal fluid biomarker (CSF) for synucleinopathies. Methods: CSF alpha-synuclein- 140 concentrations were determined by a prototype xMAP (TM) bead-based assay (Innogenetics <b>NV,</b> <b>Belgium).</b> In addition, CSF amyloid beta(1 - 42) (A beta(1 - 42)), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau(181 P)) levels were determined. Results: CSF alpha-synuclein levels were higher in AD patients as compared with cognitively healthy controls (P =. 019) and patients with synucleinopathies (P <. 001). CSF alpha-synuclein levels were correlated with T-tau (P <. 001) and P-tau(181 P) (P <. 001) levels in autopsy-confirmed AD patients. A diagnostic algorithm using alpha-synuclein and P-tau(181 P) discriminated neuropathologically confirmed AD from DLB patients, resulting in sensitivity and specificity values of 85 % and 81 %, respectively. Conclusion: Because CSF alpha-synuclein levels were significantly higher in AD as compared with synucleinopathies, alpha-synuclein might have a value as a biomarker for differential dementia diagnosis.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare cephalometric results of three and two {{dimensional}} surgical predictions in patients that underwent orthognatic surgery. The study involved two groups of 15 to 30 years old patients with craniofacial anomalies. The first group of patients had orthognatic surgery from April 2004 to January 2005. Pre and post-surgical lateral cephalometric measurements were done using Simplant program, (version CMF 8. 2 of Materialise, <b>NV,</b> <b>Belgium).</b> The second group of patients had orthognatic surgery from January 1999 to January 2004. Pre and post-surgical lateral cephalometric measurements were done manually. The results of this study showed a more accurate surgical prediction with the Simplant program. In group I (three-dimensional cephalometric measurement) there was not a statistically significant difference between the prediction measurements done before the surgery and those compared with the post-surgically result. In group II, (two-dimensional cephalometric measurements) on the surgical predictions done previously by hand using cut and paste mobiles taken from the patient’s Hospital records, we observed that in the SNA angle and the maxillary length measurements there was a statistically difference (p <. 05). Therefore we conclude that the three-dimensional method is more accurate than the two-dimensional method in planning surgical orthognatic procedures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Engineering {{diagnostic}} tools {{have become}} increasingly more sophisticated like computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) and other imaging technology can now present patient data in many ways and with great clarity and accuracy. A strong software interface is needed to accept input from every brand of scanner to facilitate the selection of an anatomic structure visible in the medical images. Hence {{the purpose of this}} paper is to volumetrically evaluate root resorption during orthodontic treatment using MIMICS software and describe benefits of collaboration between two expertises. CBCT of 17 patients were taken pre-treatment (T 1) and post levelling and aligning (T 2) using KODAK 9000 machine. CBCT data were reconstructed with surface and volume rendering software (Mimics <b>NV</b> <b>Belgium)</b> and the volumetric images were modified to display the teeth from various orientations. Six anterior teeth were segmented and their roots isolated. Kruskal Wallis test was used to statistically evaluate root volume difference. The volume difference between two time intervals was statistically significant for all roots investigated (where significance value p < 0. 05). The distal and palatal surfaces of lateral incisor, buccal surface of central incisor and distal surface of canine were more affected. The proposed work is first of its kind to analyse technically root resorption without extraction of teeth which enables a new quality of information sharing, collaboratively solving problem and integration of two different fields...|$|R

The rotifer density in the larval tanks was maintained at 15 rotifers. ml - 1. The rotifer diet was supplemented with egg yolk until day 5. Each treatment had five replicates. Preliminary results show {{no significant difference in}} the survival rate of grouper larvae given Chl-R (4. 21 ± 2. 8 %), CS-R (2. 56 ± 0. 9 %) and CSC-R rotifers (1. 89 ± 1. 5 %).

It {{is assumed}} that the {{concentration}} of amyloid- 1 - 40 (A 1 - 40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflects {{the total amount of}} A protein in the brain and thus allows a better interpretation of inter-individual differences in A quantity than the A 1 - 42 concentration. In this study, A 1 - 40 was added to the existing CSF biomarker panel of A 1 - 42, total tau (T-tau), and phosphory-lated tau (P-tau 181 P) in order to test whether the accuracy of the differential dementia diagnosis improved. The concentration of A 1 - 40 (INNOTEST®-amyloid(1 – 40) prototype version, Innogenetics <b>NV,</b> <b>Belgium)</b> and the other biomarkers (INNOTEST®) was determined in CSF samples from 80 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, 75 non-AD dementia patients, and 30 controls. A large proportion of the study population had autopsy-confirmed neurodegeneration (AD: 73 / 80 = 91 %; non-AD: 38 / 75 = 51 %). The levels of A 1 - 40 were decreased in AD (10856 ± 4745 pg/mL) and non-AD patients (10519 ± 4491 pg/mL) when com-pared to controls (14760 ± 7846 pg/mL) (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to evaluate variation of mandibular arch forms at different heights and to determine if there is any correlation between occlusal arch and sub-gingival arch forms. METHODS: 44 subjects were selected based on the inclusion criteria and their CBCTs then were imported to Mimics software (Materialise <b>NV,</b> <b>Belgium)</b> and traced. Each tooth was sliced midsection at 4 different heights: Occlusal, CEJ, Apex and 5 mm apical to the apex. At occlusal level the midpoint of the crown was calculated mesiodistally as well as buccolingually. Subsequently, midpoints between the buccal and lingual plates were located for every tooth between and including the first molars. The points were connected forming 4 splines, which then were exported to Geomorph software (cran. r-project. org, Geomorph package, Dean Adams author, Iowa State 2015) for shape statistical analysis. RESULTS: The variation in the arch form among subjects is significantly smaller in the Occlusal and CEJ level. The variation at apical and basal bone levels are higher than the variation at CEJ and occlusal levels. However, variation between apical and basal bone levels are minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Mandibular dental arch form demonstrate more variation apically. It may be concluded that dental arch form variation should be considered when using standardized arch forms for different patients. The subgingival arch forms cannot be predicted from occlusal arch form. Occlusal arch shape and form may not be an indication of basal bone arch form. More information needed for detection of correlation between occlusal arch and sub-gingival arch forms...|$|R
