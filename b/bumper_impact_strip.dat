40|$|Understanding the {{biomechanics}} of road traffi c collision injuries {{is important}} for diagnosing and managing road traffi c injured patients. As road traffi c collisions may entail high-energy trauma, the degree of injury {{will depend on the}} mass and speed of the collided vehicles. Collisions can be front impact, back impact, side impact; the vehicle may turn over or the patient may be ejected from the vehicle. Each of these mechanisms has a specifi c pattern of injury. The injury will vary depending on whether the passenger was restrained with a seat belt or not. Seat belts tend to reduce head injuries and increase the abdominal injuries. Compression injuries of the intestines and urinary bladder tend to be more severe, causing rupture of these hollow organs if pressure within these organs was high. Pedestrian injuries consist of three phases: the <b>bumper</b> <b>impact,</b> hood and windscreen impact, and ground impact.

40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{improving}} a bumper system to meet the second phase EEVC (European Enhanced Vehicle Safety Committee) requirements for pedestrian lower leg protection. An approach is presented to optimize the front bumper system for minimizing the risk of pedestrian's lower leg injuries from the <b>bumper</b> <b>impact.</b> Firstly, a vehicle FE model was developed, a two-layer-material EA (Energy Absorber) and a lower stiffener were also developed to attach in the front bumper system. Then some structure parameters of the EA and the lower stiffener were selected and the design of experiment with orthogonal arrays was used to generate the test sample points. Finally, the multi-objective optimization of the structure parameters was conducted based on the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Algorithm). The maximum tibia acceleration, the maximum knee bending angle and the maximum shear displacement were chosen as the objective functions. The optimized results were used to redevelop the EA and the lower stiffener FE modals. The {{results of the study}} show that the performance of the vehicle for lower leg protection could be dramatically improved by the optimization of EA and lower stiffener and the second phase EEVC requirements for pedestrian lower leg protection can be satisfied...|$|R

50|$|For 1974, the Civic's {{engine size}} grew slightly, to 1237 cc and power {{went up to}} 52 hp (39 kW). In {{order to meet the}} new North American 5 mph (8 km/h) <b>bumper</b> <b>impact</b> standard, the Civic's bumpers grew 7.1 inches (18 cm), {{increasing}} overall length to 146.9 inches (373 cm).The CVCC (Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion) engine debuted in 1975 and was offered alongside the standard Civic engine. The optional 53 hp (40 kW) CVCC engine displaced 1488 cc and had a head design that promoted cleaner, more efficient combustion. The CVCC design eliminated the need for catalytic converters or unleaded fuel to meet changing emissions standards, unlike nearly every other U.S. market car. Due to California's stricter emissions standards, only the CVCC powered Civic was available in that state. This created a sales advantage in Honda's favor in that CVCC equipped Honda products afforded the buyer the ability to choose any type of fuel the buyer wanted, and due to emissions equipment not being damaged by using leaded fuel, the buyer could use any gasoline products available. This was also an advantage due to some regions of North America having to ration available gasoline supplies due to periodic shortages at the time.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{validate}} human-body mathematical models which can be used to simulate the dynamic responses of pedestrians in a car impact. The main focus has been on simulations of <b>bumper</b> <b>impact</b> to the lower extremities, since lower extremity injuries most frequently occur in car-pedestrian accidents and result in long-term consequences and high social costs. Two approaches were used: (1) modeling with the multibody system (MBS); (2) modeling with the finite element method (FEM). Different models were developed, including a human-like knee joint MBS model, a breakable leg MBS model, a complete human-body MBS model, and a lower extremity skeleton FEM model. The MBS models were implemented by the MADYMO 3 D program, and the FEM model by DYNA 3 D program. The models were validated by tests with biological subjects. The models enabled simulations of the responses of the lower extremity to a lateral <b>bumper</b> <b>impact</b> to be carried out. The injury mechanisms and the prediction of injury risk of the knee-leg complex was the focus of this study. Furthermore, simulations of full scale car-pedestrian impacts were done to predict the risk of pedestrian injuries in car accidents and to investigate influences of car-front parameters on the risk of pedestrian injuries. The human-like knee model gives insights into the injury mechanisms of the knee in a lateral impact. The knee responses were analyzed in terms of ligament strain, condyle contact force, and transverse dislocation between articular surfaces. The correlation between the outcome from simulations and injuries observed in tests with biological subjects was established. Calculated ligament strains greater than 20 % were related to ligament failure in tests, and condyle contact forces greater than 6 kN were related to condyle fracture. Predicted transverse dislocations of 8 - 9 mm between articular surfaces in simulations confirmed the findings in the high-speed film analysis of the knee responses to lateral impacts at 15 - 20 km/h. The knee-injury mechanisms can be summarized as ligament tension and condyle compression due to a combination of shearing, bending, and torsional loading applied to the knee joint. The knee injuries are dominated by bending load. The breakable leg model filled a gap in modeling leg fracture and improved the sensitivity of the pedestrian model. The simulation of the knee responses associated with leg fracture in car-pedestrian impacts indicated that the impact response and injury mechanism of the knee in a lateral <b>bumper</b> <b>impact</b> with the upper part of the leg are both dependent on whether or not the leg is fractured. For a more realistic model of the lower extremity skeleton, the FEM model was used. It contributed to a better understanding of the impact responses of the knee-leg complex by means of an analysis of stress distribution within the simulated structures. The stress analysis with the FEM model indicated that the calculated tensile stress of 160 MPa in a lateral impact at 31 km/h correlates well with the ultimate tensile strength of the leg bone determined in biological tests. The complete human-body model was used to simulate car-pedestrian impacts. The effects of the car-front on pedestrian responses were evaluated in terms of the bumper height and stiffness, the bumper-lead distance, hood-edge height and stiffness. The effects of bumper and hood edge on knee-leg responses were identified. It was found that the head responses are significantly influenced by the height of the hood-edge and less influenced by the bumper. The developed models demonstrated capabilities for predicting the risk of pedestrian injuries in an impact with a vehicle. For instance, the breakable leg model can be used to predict the risk of long bone fractures. From the knee model, the forces and moments transferred through the knee, and the strain of the knee ligaments can be calculated to evaluate the knee failures. For the head, the linear acceleration, the HIC value and the angular acceleration can be calculated to predict risk of head injuries. The models are thus valuable tools to acquire better knowledge of impact biomechanics in car-pedestrian accidents and help assess the performance of vehicle front structures and develop safety countermeasures...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), {{each year}} about 400, 000 trucks are {{involved}} in motor vehicle crashes. Eighteen percent of these accidents are in rear-end crashes of the trucks. Accordingly, fatal injury had resulted to 5 percentages of the injuries. Whiplash is the common neck injury in rear impact consuming {{billions of dollars in}} insurance. However due to relatively low number of deaths or injuries in rear impact crashes, NHTSA does not conduct any rear impact testing to test the bumpers. The main objective of this thesis is to study the effects of low speed impact on light trucks and the potential injuries on the occupants. The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) includes rear impact testing of fuel leakage, but only has a voluntary test for rear <b>bumper</b> <b>impact</b> test at low speed. In this thesis, the low speed rear impact simulation of a light truck was performed to understand the bumper deformation. A Chevy light truck is impacted to a flat barrier at 5 mph by using the finite element code LS-Dyna. This simulation is analyzed and validated for its <b>bumper</b> <b>impact</b> test. A parametric study is thus performed to quantify the effect of various parameters on the rear end impact of the truck. Four vehicles were selected from public domain National crash analysis center (NCAC). These vehicles were Geo Metro, Chevy Truck, Ford Taurus and Ford single unit truck, selected according to the weight of the vehicles. The Chevy truck was chosen as target vehicle and other three models were selected as bullet vehicles. The target vehicle was then impacted with speed of 5, 10 and 15 mph. The accelerations were extracted from the center of gravity of the target vehicle (Chevy Truck). The acceleration pulses from the LS-Dyna were used in multi body analysis Mathematical Dynamic Model (Madymo). The seat model was built with similar characteristics as the Chevy truck seat. A Hybrid ΙΙΙ dummy model was positioned with seat and the model was given the acceleration pulses from the corresponding g’s at low speed for the truck impacted at 5, 10 and 15 mph. This model was used to study the injuries on the neck. The developed model was then compared for neck response from the occupant with head restraint and without head restraint. Output of the dummy response resulted in injury values needed to be studied. The injury values were compared with standard critical values complying with injuries. The result of this study can be utilized to obtain the effect of weight of impacting vehicles in low speed rear crashes of trucks. The impact response of the occupants and potential neck loads and injuries are also by products of this stud...|$|R
