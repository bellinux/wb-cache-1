5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E

He also claimed to have witnessed the Princess's estranged husband, the Prince of Wales, lying in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> aide, Michael Fawcett, on one occasion when he brought the Prince his breakfast. Diana made a tape of the interview. The whereabouts of the tape became a matter of considerable controversy following Diana's death in August 1997.|$|E

25|$|Laughlin wrote, directed, {{and starred}} in The Young Sinner. Originally filmed in 1960, and shot in Milwaukee {{over a period of}} 14 days, {{it is the story of}} a star high school athlete who falls deeper and deeper into trouble after being caught in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend. The film was {{intended}} to be the first of a trilogy entitled We Are All Christ. It premiered in 1963 under the original title Among the Thorns, which was changed to The Young Sinner upon its 1965 re-release. In 1960, Laughlin planned to make a film, Poison in Our Land, based on the true story of a Texas couple affected by atomic radiation, but the project was never realized.|$|E

25|$|Especially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical {{laws are}} {{augmented}} by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates {{that a woman}} in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary niddah with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as zavah, and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E
500|$|In this passage, {{the speaker}} {{experiences}} {{a sense of}} wonder, having awoken in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> lover; he makes the discovery that their love makes finding [...] "new worlds" [...] pale in importance.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression, John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer's Crossing, [...] from Hattiesburg, where he worked at a turpentine factory until he was laid off in 1938. John Brown then moved the family to Lux, Mississippi, {{to be a part of}} a sharecropper farm. During this time, Jesse Brown shared a <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brothers and attended a one-room school [...] away. His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework, and Jesse Brown walked to school every day. The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse, William, and Julia Brown sang in the church choir. In his spare time, Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton.|$|E
500|$|In {{a display}} of both aspects of machismo, Trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo's machismo and {{treatment}} of women, [...] "e went to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ministers' wives, not only because he liked these ladies {{but because it was}} a way to test his ministers. He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque roleand they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death." [...] Trujillo's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In Niessa's words, [...] "The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{inspiration}} for the characters of Hector and Adeline remain unclear, but several critics have been eager to speculate. Three officers named Hulot were recognized for their valor in the Napoleonic Wars, and some suggest that Balzac borrowed the name of Comte Hector d'Aure. None of these men, however, were known {{for the sort of}} philandering or thievery exhibited by Baron Hulot in the novel. Instead, Balzac may have used himself as the model; his many affairs with women across the social spectrum lead some to suggest that the author [...] "found much of Hulot in himself". Balzac's friend Victor Hugo, meanwhile, was famously discovered in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mistress in July 1845. The similarity of his name to Hector Hulot (and that of his wife's maiden name, Adèle Foucher, to Adeline Fischer) has been posited as a possible indication of the characters' origins.|$|E

60|$|Kwaseekho the shelldrake leads {{a double}} life. In winter {{he may be}} found almost {{anywhere}} along the Massachusetts coast and southward, where he leads a dog's life of it, notwithstanding his gay appearance. An hundred guns are roaring at him wherever he goes. From daylight to dark he has never a minute to eat his bit of fish, or to take a wink of sleep in peace. He flies to the ocean, and <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> fellows on the broad open shoals for safety. But the east winds blow; and the shoals are a yeasty mass of tumbling breakers. They buffet him about; they twist his gay feathers; they dampen his pinions, spite of his skill in swimming. Then {{he goes to the}} creeks and harbors.|$|R
500|$|Born in Belfast to Norman and Aileen Whiteside, {{he grew up}} on Shankill Road, {{and because}} of his aggressive, {{physical}} playing style he was later nicknamed the [...] "Shankill Skinhead" [...] by Manchester United supporters. The family later moved to 10 Danube Street, and the family's poverty meant that Whiteside had to share a <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> two brothers. He remained relatively unscathed by The Troubles as his Protestant parents kept a firm watch on their children {{to ensure that they}} did not stray far from home and that none of them became involved with Ulster loyalism. At the age of around seven he joined the Boys' Brigade, and quickly showed his natural talent for football, scoring ten goals in a game against boys almost twice his age. He was educated at Cairnmartin High School, and became famous in the Shankill area as a footballing prodigy by the age of 11.|$|E
500|$|Wheeler {{had been}} expecting and openly hoping for war with Nazi Germany for a year prior to the {{outbreak}} of hostilities; {{he believed that the}} United Kingdom's involvement in the conflict would remedy the shame that he thought had been brought upon the country by its signing of the Munich Agreement in September 1938. Volunteering for the armed services, he was assigned to assemble the 48th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery at Enfield, where he set about recruiting volunteers, including his son. As the 48th swelled in size, it was converted into the 42nd Mobile Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment in the Royal Artillery, which consisted of four batteries and was led by Wheeler – now promoted to the rank of colonel – as Commanding Officer. Given the nickname of [...] "Flash Alf" [...] by those serving under him, he was recognised by colleagues as a ruthless disciplinarian and was blamed by many for the death of one of his soldiers from influenza during training. Having been appointed secretary of the Society of Antiquaries in 1939 and then director in 1940, he travelled to London to deal with society affairs on various occasions. In 1941 Wheeler was awarded a Fellowship of the British Academy. Cole had meanwhile entered into an affair with a man named Clive Entwistle, who lambasted Wheeler as [...] "that whiskered baboon". When Wheeler discovered Entwistle in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife, he initiated divorce proceedings that were finalised in March 1942.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Wilson had a {{different}} interaction with a musical ensemble.

Gossip had hinted at an improper relationship, though these rumours were never substantiated. Wilson won the case, and all royalties from the song (composed by Move leader Roy Wood) were assigned in perpetuity to a charity of Wilson's choosing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rivalry between}} Charles and his brother, the Dauphin Henry, was {{potentially}} dangerous. However, it solved {{itself with the}} death of Charles. In the autumn of 1545, Charles was on <b>his</b> way (<b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother, the Dauphin) to Boulogne, which was under siege. On 6 September, they came across a cluster of houses that had been emptied and sealed off [...] "from the plague"—probably a form of influenza. Stating that [...] "no son of a King of France ever died of plague", Charles entered some of the infected houses <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother. [...] Laughing, he slashed at <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sword and started a pillow fight <b>with</b> some of <b>his</b> traveling companions. Stories have also been told of him (on a dare) lying down on one of the infected beds and rolling around on the bedding. Later that evening, after dining <b>with</b> <b>his</b> father and brother, he took suddenly ill, suffering from pain, a high fever, vomiting and shaking limbs. His brother rushed to his sickroom immediately, but was barred from entering, being physically restrained on three occasions.|$|R
2500|$|His first rap album since 1999, Gangsta Rap, was {{released}} on October 31, 2006.

Some reviews of the album were unenthusiastic, as many had hoped for a return to the political raps of Ice-T's most successful albums.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the memory}} of Joselito {{led him to a}} liaison with the girlfriend of the dead matador, Encarnación López (La Argentinita). She was an intelligent, {{attractive}} woman, an exceptional performer and great dancer, as was her sister Pilar. Although Sánchez had had many tempestuous affairs, like the time in Mexico when a husband caught him in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife and he had to make a hasty getaway, it was for La Argentinita only that he would leave his wife Lola [...] from the sister to the girlfriend.|$|E
2500|$|The promotional {{campaign}} for [...] "Flowers in the Rain" [...] led to litigation that had serious repercussions for Wood {{and the group}}. Without consulting the band, Secunda produced a cartoon postcard showing the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Wilson, in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> secretary, Marcia Williams. Wilson sued the Move for libel and the group lost the court case; they had to pay all costs, and all royalties earned by the song, which otherwise would have belonged to Wood as composer, were awarded to charities of Wilson's choice. The ruling, much to Wood's chagrin, remained in force even after Wilson's death in 1995.|$|E
