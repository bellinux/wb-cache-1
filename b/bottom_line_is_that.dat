25|$|It {{unfortunately}} {{appears to}} us, and many residents of Bay County, that Dr. Siebert {{has become a}} scapegoat for those seeking a political solution to recent events, rather than a logical resolution based upon science and fact. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the good people of Bay County, including those serving on the local search committee, are apparently being ignored in their plea to keep Dr. Siebert as Medical Examiner.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{might have}} helped on the musical {{arrangements}} {{based on the fact}} that (as it has been recalled by former bassists and the band themselves) they were in a more collaborative period in the pre-studio days and he was usually the one getting his way with structural ideas. While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> even in that case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (like George Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps the {{influence}} of Fiat contributed to {{the selection of the}} CR.42 Falco over the Ca.165, although Caproni was an influential company itself at the time.

500|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{withdrawing}} the Krayoxx Case {{would cause}} Finley & Figg to be sued for both defense costs and malpractice, which would completely ruin the small firm. There is no choice for Finley & Figg {{but to give}} up their motion to withdraw the tort case and prepare to go through the motions of a [...] jury trial which they have absolutely no chance of winning. Moreover, going through the motions is quite expensive: in order to present any kind of case they must bring experts to testify against Krayoxx and even disreputable experts, the only ones who can be found charge fees {{in the tens of thousands}} of dollars.|$|E

[...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Breaking {{from the}} theme of the natural {{environment}} after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers transhumanism, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction. Weisman concludes the book considering {{a new version of the}} one-child policy. While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder." [...] He responded to criticism of this saying [...] "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".|$|E

50|$|However, the Flamingo project {{immediately}} {{ran into}} problems. Siegel appointed his girlfriend Virginia Hill {{as a project}} overseer. As a result, contractors were stealing Siegel blind; they would sell him materials one day, then steal them from the building site at night, then resell them to Siegel the next day. The Flamingo project was also impacted by {{the rising cost of}} materials and labor from the post World War II building boom. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a project projected to cost $1.5 million would eventually reach $6 million.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Bolsheviks {{received}} between 22% and 25% of the vote, albeit {{as clear}} winners in Russia's urban centers and among {{soldiers on the}} [...] "Western Front" [...] (two-thirds of those soldiers' votes). In the city of Moscow, for example, the Bolsheviks won 47.9% of the votes, the Constitutional Democrats (Kadets) 35.7% and the SRs 8.1 percent. [...] While losing the urban vote, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party received around 57-58% (62% with their social democratic allies), having won the massive support of the rural peasantry who constituted 80% of the Russian population.|$|R

[...] Romm's 2010 book, Straight Up notes: [...] "the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the economic cost of action is low, whereas the cost of inaction is incalculably greater". [...] Romm calculates that deployment of existing technologies on the massive scale that can save the climate can be accomplished at the cost of 0.12 percent of global GDP per year. He also asks in the book, [...] "will the United States be a global leader in creating jobs and exports in clean energy technologies, or will we be importing them from Europe, Japan, and the likely clean energy leader in our absence, China." [...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E

There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is {{what it took to}} get you to watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|All That Is Within Me {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{some of which}} considered it to be MercyMe's best record to that point. However, some critics considered the album as being too similar to the band's previous works. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "regardless of whether the credit goes to the change of scenery or the backs-against-the-wall pressure, {{it is impossible to}} deny that this is the group's best effort to date" [...] and praised Millard's vocals as well as the album's [...] "sparkling array of musical styles". Deborah Evans Price of Billboard noted the album's shift toward music geared towards the church, and said [...] "No matter what tag the industry puts on these guys, the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they continually make great music with broad-based appeal". Mike Parker of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, called it an [...] "exuberant,defiant, stand-up-and-shake-your-fist at-the-devil, rock & roll worship album" [...] and [...] "MercyMe’s best work to date". Cameron Conant of Charisma praised Millard's vocals as having [...] "a wonderful pop-country style that seems to get better as this album goes along" [...] and saying [...] "All 10 songs on this album prove that it's no accident MercyMe has sold millions of records... It's catchy pop music with a clear gospel message that will resonate with all of MercyMe's fans—a considerable group—and should win them a few new ones, too".|$|E

30|$|Recently, Kuhn [8] {{presented}} {{the best available}} evidence to answer questions regarding the treatment of patients with an initial anterior shoulder dislocation, reporting that, of the many methods to reduce the dislocated shoulder, little data exist to identify the best method and that premedication with intra-articular lidocaine has fewer complications and requires a shorter time {{in the emergency room}} than intravenous sedation, with no detectable differences in reduction success rates. Ashton and Hassan [9] carried out a review to establish whether Kocher’s or Milch’s technique was better at reducing shoulder dislocations. The clinical <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> individual physician preference for either Kocher’s or Milch’s method of reduction is not supported by the evidence.|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cuts, McCall made a number of changes to his squad during the summer of 2009. His team started the 2009–10 season by going four games without scoring, until they {{recorded}} a 5–4 victory against Cheltenham Town. After the game, McCall said: [...] "That was the youngest, and certainly cheapest, team Bradford have put out {{for a long time and}} I’m really proud of them." [...] City continued by going ten games unbeaten and reached the area semi-finals of the Football League Trophy where they lost to Carlisle United, managed by McCall's friend Greg Abbott, but at the start of 2010 found themselves 16th in League Two and eight points off the play-offs after a run of five defeats in seven games. McCall laid down a challenge to his team to win three of their next four games, saying: [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the players and me personally will get judged on results. And the results aren't good enough." [...] Despite the club's slide down the table, he denied he would resign, but it was reported that two late goals from summer signing Gareth Evans to give City a late 2–1 away at Torquay United saved McCall from being sacked. However, defeat to Bury in the club's following fixture was McCall's last game as manager, with McCall saying after the game: [...] "It's time for somebody else to come in and take up the reins and hopefully do well." [...] He won a little more than one-third of his 133games in charge of City. McCall left by mutual consent.|$|E
500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby {{wrote in}} his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna's singing in the song [...] "deserved a {{commendation}} for bravery and {{was a sign that}} she was going to set herself challenges." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which is rife with emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'." [...] Dorothy Holmes from Telegram & Gazette said that [...] "'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' sounds like her perfect adult contemporary staple." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E
500|$|Another common {{criticism}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the book}} <b>was</b> aimed at fans of The Simpsons {{and not a}} general audience.

[...] Bacchus concurred, saying [...] "Cartwright writes {{as if she were}} speaking to devotees of The Simpsons Fan Club, too often providing bland tidbits of background that only obsessives would ever really care about." [...] Rob Sheridan of the National Post also believes <b>that</b> the book <b>is</b> [...] "aimed squarely at rabid Simpsons fans", and criticized the writing, commenting that [...] "the chronology of her story is sometimes muddled, and a lot of sentences have that first-draft feeling [...] But none of this is anything to have a cow about." ...|$|R
40|$|About two millennia ago — in {{the days}} of “thefathers ” — a sage named Yehudah ben Temaarticulated a {{timetable}} for human development: At age five to scripture, ten to Mishnah, thirteen to religious duties, fifteen to Talmud, eighteen to wedding canopy, twenty to seek a livelihood, thirty to fullness of strength, forty to understanding, fifty to counsel, sixty to wisdom… Never mind <b>that</b> human development <b>was</b> a male-defined paradigm.

Kaunda further explained that Zuma would stop his activities in parliament the next day and would write a letter to the speaker to inform her of his decision, clarifying that [...] "the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you won't see him [...] in parliament again, at least not as a member".|$|E

[...] Osbourne vehemently disagrees in his autobiography, {{at least as far as}} the jazz experiments went, calling the instrumental [...] "Breakout" [...] "a jazz band going da-dah-da-dah, DAH, and I just went, Fuck this, I'm off ... The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> 'Breakout' <b>was</b> stretching it too far for me.
