40|$|Hypothesis: There are {{differences}} between readings of peripheral blood oxygen saturation when {{the effect on}} saturation values of methylene blue is {{compared with that of}} isosulfan blue when used in sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with breast cancer. Design Prospective randomized study. Setting University tertiary care center. Patients Thirty-two women undergoing surgery for breast cancer using sentinel lymph node biopsy. Interventions Sentinel lymph node biopsy usingmethylene blue (16 patients) and isosulfan blue (16 patients); there was also a control group of 6 surgicalpatients in whom dyes were not used. Main Outcome Measures Peripheral saturation of blood using pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation by <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis,</b> partial oxygen pressure by <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis,</b> and plasma dye levels, recorded before dye injection and 15, 30, and 60 minutes afterward. Results: The 2 dyes interfered with the peripheral saturation reading, but only isosulfan blue showed significant differences. The differences in <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> values between the 2 groups and with regard to the controls were not significant. Conclusions: Methylene blue interferes less than isosulfan blue in the peripheral saturation reading.

Setting Twenty-two European centers are participating in the BrainIT initiative. Design Retrospective analysis of monitoring data. Patients and participants One hundred and fifty-one patients with a known time of trauma {{and at least one}} recorded arterial <b>blood–gas</b> (ABG) <b>analysis.</b> Measurements and results A total number of 7, 703 ABGs, representing 2, 269 ventilation episodes (VE) were included in the analysis. Related minute-by-minute ICP data were taken from a 30 min time window around each ABG collection. Data are given as mean with standard deviation. (1) Patients without elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) (< 20 mmHg) manifested a statistically significant higher PaCO 2 (36 ± 5. 7 mmHg) in comparison to patients with elevated ICP (≥ 20 mmHg; PaCO 2 : 34 ± 5. 4 mmHg, P < 0. 001). (2) Intensified forced hyperventilation (PaCO 2 ≤ 25 mmHg) in the absence of elevated ICP was found in only 49 VE (2 %). (3) Early prophylactic hyperventilation (< 24 h after TBI; PaCO 2 ≤ 35 mmHg, ICP < 20 mmHg) was used in 1, 224 VE (54 %). (4) During forced hyperventilation (PaCO 2 ≤ 30 mmHg), simultaneous monitoring of brain tissue pO 2 or SjvO 2 was used in only 204 VE (9 %).

40|$|<b>Blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{normally}} {{concerned with the}} measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide {{in a sample of}} blood, together with the analysis of hydro-gen ion concentration and acid-base state. Other gases and vapours are likely to be present in the sample, but they may be difficult to analyse, whereas equipment for conventional <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> is widely available. Measurement of oxygen may be subdivided as follows: partial pressure (Po 2) of the gas present in the sample, usually expressed in kilopascals (kPa); oxygen saturation (So 2) of haemoglobin, expressed as a percentage or fraction of unity; and oxygen content or concentration (Co 2) in the sample, usually expressed in ml dl" 1 at STPD. Assessment of carbon dioxide is often expressed in terms of the partial pressure of the gas present, although the carbon dioxide content of the sample may be required in some cases. Hydrogen ion concentration in the physiological range is expressed either in pH notation or as hydrogen ion concentration in nmol litre" 1. The acid-base state of the patient may be considered in terms of bicarbonate ion concentration, base excess, non-respiratory pH, or some other variable associated with the metabolic component of an acid-base derangement.

Experimentally induced venous CO 2 embolism has been studied in pigs. In this paper we report a case of spontaneous CO 2 embolism. Observations: A 4 -month-old Large White pig weighing 20 kg underwent experimental laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia. Monitoring consisted of pulse oximetry, capnography, airway pressure, electrocardiography, invasive arterial and central venous blood pressures, and arterial <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis.</b> Shortly {{after the start of}} laparoscopy and onset of CO 2 insufflation, sudden decreases in end-tidal CO 2 (Pe′CO 2), haemoglobin saturation of oxygen (SpO 2), systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were observed. Airway pressure increased and pulmonary compliance decreased simultaneously. Insufflation was immediately discontinued and epinephrine (2 mg IV), atropine (0. 5 mg IV) and a 50 mL bolus of a polygeline solution were administered without effect. At this time arterial <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed a pH of 7. 29 and a PaCO 2 of 6. 8 kPa (51. 2 mmHg); PaO 2 was 26. 6 kPa (199. 5 mmHg). After 4 minutes asystole occurred.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of 1 degrees C hypo- or hyperthermia on in vivo liver ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury in 15 fasted male Wistar rats. Rats were ventilated, and rectal temperature was maintained at 36, 37 (normothermic), or 38 degrees C. In all rats, 70 % liver ischemia was induced by clamping the afferent vessels to the median and left lateral lobes for 60 min, and reperfusion was allowed for 90 min. Changes in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) levels were measured, hemodynamics and bile secretion were monitored, and arterial <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed. All ventilated rats showed a normal pH, arterial PCO(2), and arterial PO(2).

Results obtained from arterial and capillary blood were compared with duplicate values obtained with a semi-automatic analyser controlled and calibrated with tonometered blood. No analyser was fully automatic, and all three needed maintenance by expert technicians. Difficulties were encountered when inexperienced operators used the machines. One automatic blood-gas analyser gave aberrant values for oxygen pressure (PO 2) due to electrode dysfunction that was not indicated by the fault-finding system. A second analyser gave significantly lower values for blood pH than the standard machine.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{arena in}} which we must consider the role of echocardiography is characterized by 2 fundamental findings: (1) most patients with chest pain and suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI) do not present diagnostic electrocardiograms; and (2) an early and correct diagnosis is necessary to match the patient with the most adequate treatment. Echocardiography may be very useful in the coronary care unit, allowing a correct diagnosis of ischemic heart disease when electrocardiography is unclear, even before the rise of cardiac enzymes is detected.

In fact, although high-risk patients are well identified by simple clinical or instrumental variables (i. e., Killip classification, enzymatic data, <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis,</b> electrocardiogram, etc.), most patients (> 60 %) are identified as low risk, and several subjects classified into the low-risk groups have a poor prognosis and are not detected using a single variable.

40|$|Background There is {{considerable}} interest in oxygen partial pressure (Po 2) monitoring in physiology, and in tracking PO 2 changes dynamically when it varies rapidly. For example, arterial PO 2 (PaO 2) can vary within the respiratory cycle in cyclical atelectasis (CA), where PaO 2 {{is thought to}} increase and decrease during inspiration and expiration, respectively. A sensor that detects these PaO 2 oscillations could become a useful diagnostic tool of CA during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods We developed a fibreoptic PO 2 sensor (< 200 µm diameter), suitable for human use, that has a fast response time, and can measure PO 2 continuously in blood. By altering the inspired fraction of oxygen (FIO 2) from 21 to 100 % in four healthy animal models, we determined the linearity of the sensor's signal {{over a wide range}} of PaO 2 values in vivo. We also hypothesized that the sensor could measure rapid intra-breath PaO 2 oscillations in a large animal model of ARDS. Results In the healthy animal models, PaO 2 responses to changes in FIO 2 were in agreement with conventional intermittent <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> (n= 39) {{for a wide range of}} PaO 2 values, from 10 to 73 kPa.

40|$|A {{magnetic}} resonance imaging method is presented that allows for the simultaneous assessment of oxygen delivery, oxygen uptake, and parenchymal density. The technique is applied to a mouse model of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) induced lung emphysema in order to investigate how structural changes affect lung function. Nine-week-old female C 57 BL 6 mice were instilled with saline or PPE at days 0 and 7. At day 19, oxygen delivery, oxygen uptake, and lung density were quantified from T 1 and proton-density measurements obtained via oxygen-enhanced {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (OE-MRI) using an ultrashort echo-time imaging sequence. Subsequently, the lungs were sectioned for histological observation. Blood-gas analyses and pulmonary functional tests via FlexiVent were performed in separate cohorts. PPE-challenged mice had reduced density when assessed via MRI, consistent with the parenchyma loss observed in the histology sections, and an increased lung compliance was detected via FlexiVent. The oxygenation levels, as assessed via the <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis,</b> showed no difference between PPE-challenged animals and control. This finding was mirrored in the global MRI assessments of oxygen delivery and uptake, where the changes in relaxation time indices were matched between the groups. The heterogeneity of the same parameters however, were increased in PPE-challenged animals. When the oxygenation status was investigated in regions of varying density, a reduced oxygen-uptake was found in low-density regions of PPE-challenged mice. In high-density regions the uptake was {{higher than that of}} regions of corresponding density in control animals. The oxygen delivery was proportional to the oxygen uptake in both groups. The proposed method allowed for the regional assessment of the relationship between lung density and two aspects of lung function, the oxygen delivery and uptake. When compared to global indices of lung function, an increased sensitivity for detecting heterogeneous lung disorders was found. This indicated that the technique has potential for early detection of lung dysfunction-before global changes occur...|$|E

Study design Prospective randomized clinical study. Animals Sixty horses, undergoing elective surgical procedures under general anaesthesia: ASA classification I or II. Methods Horses were sedated with medetomidine and anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and diazepam. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and a constant rate infusion of medetomidine. Horses were assigned to either SV or IPPV for the duration of anaesthesia. Horses in group IPPV were maintained mildly hypercapnic (arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) 50 – 60 mmHg, 6. 7 – 8 kPa). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained above 70 mmHg by an infusion of dobutamine administered to effect. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (fR), arterial blood pressure and inspiratory and expiratory gases were monitored continuously. A bolus of ketamine was administered when horses showed nystagmus. Cardiac output was measured using lithium dilution. Arterial <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed regularly. Recovery time was noted and recovery quality scored. Results There were no differences between groups concerning age, weight, body position during anaesthesia and anaesthetic duration. Respiratory rate was significantly higher in group IPPV.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine whether buspirone alters posthypoxic ventilatory behavior in C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and A/J mouse strains. Measurements of ventilatory behavior were collected from unanesthetized adult male mice (n = 6 for each strain) using the plethysmographic method. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of vehicle or several doses of buspirone and exposed to 2 min of hypoxia (10 % O 2) followed by rapid reoxygenation (100 % O 2). Twenty minutes later, mice were tested for hypercapnic response (8 % CO 2 - 92 % O 2). On a separate day, mice were injected with the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist 4 -iodo-N-{ 2 -[4 -(methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl] ethyl}-N- 2 -pyridinylbenzamide (p-MPPI) before the injection of buspirone, and measurements were repeated. In separate studies, arterial <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed for each strain (n = 12 in B 6 and 10 in A/J) with buspirone or vehicle. In both strains, buspirone stimulated ventilation at rest. In the B 6 mice, the hypoxic response was unchanged, but the response to hypercapnia was reduced with buspirone (5 mg/kg; P < 0. 05). With reoxygenation, vehicle-treated B 6 exhibited periodic breathing and greater variation in ventilation compared with A/J (P < 0. 01). In B 6 animals, ≥ 3 mg/kg of buspirone reduced variation and prevented the occurrence of posthypoxic periodic breathing. Both effects were reversed by p-MPPI.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{cardiopulmonary}} effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine for management of isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized clinical study. ANIMALS: Fourteen isoflurane-anesthetized horses undergoing digital palmar neurectomy. METHODS: Ephedrine (EPH group; 0. 02 mg kg(- 1) minute(- 1); n = 7) or phenylephrine (PHE group; 0. 002 mg kg(- 1) minute(- 1); n = 7) {{was administered to}} all horses when mean arterial pressure (MAP) was < 60 mmHg. The infusions were ended when the target MAP was achieved, corresponding to a 50 % increase over the pre-infusion MAP (baseline). The horses were instrumented with an arterial catheter to measure blood pressure and allow the collection of blood for pH and <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> and a Swan-Ganz catheter for measurement of cardiac output using thermodilution. Cardiopulmonary parameters were recorded at baseline and at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after achieving the target MAP. RESULTS: In both groups, the MAP and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increased significantly at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0. 05). The EPH group had {{a significant increase in}} cardiac index (CI) and systemic oxygen delivery index at 5, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion compared to baseline (p < 0. 05) and compared to the PHE group (p < 0. 05). The PHE group had significantly higher SVR and no decrease in oxygen extraction compared with the EPH group at 30, 60 and 90 minutes post infusion (p < 0. 05). No significant differences in ventilatory parameters were observed between groups after the infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Ephedrine increased the MAP by increasing CI and SVR. Phenylephrine increased MAP by increasing SVR but cardiac index decreased. Ephedrine resulted in better tissue oxygenation than phenylephrine. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ephedrine would be preferable to phenylephrine to treat isoflurane-induced hypotension in horses since it increases blood flow and pressure. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and cardiopulmonary effects of propofol and fentanyl, with propofol and midazolam for total intravenous anaesthesia. Study design Prospective, randomized, crossover experimental study. Animals Six goats; three does and three wethers. Methods Goats received either fentanyl 0. 02 mg kg− 1 (treatment FP) or midazolam 0. 3 mg kg− 1 (treatment MP) intravenously. One minute later anaesthesia was induced with propofol, then maintained by constant rate infusion of propofol 12. 0 mg kg− 1 hour− 1 and fentanyl 0. 02 mg kg− 1 hour− 1 (treatment FP) or propofol 12. 0 mg kg− 1 hour− 1 and midazolam 0. 3 mg kg− 1 hour− 1 (treatment MP) for 90 minutes. Response to noxious stimulus was tested every 10 minutes and propofol dose adjusted to prevent purposeful movement. Cardiopulmonary parameters were measured continuously, and arterial <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> performed intermittently. Recovery was timed and quality scored. Results {{are presented as}} median (IQR). Results Differences in the propofol induction dose [4. 00 (3. 96 – 4. 01) and 3. 97 (3. 91 – 4. 00) mg kg− 1 for treatments FP and MP, respectively] were not significant. Quality of induction in both groups was smooth. The median propofol dose for maintenance was less (p = 0. 004) with treatment FP (12. 0 mg kg− 1 hour− 1) than MP (18. 0 mg kg− 1 hour− 1). Cardiopulmonary function was well maintained with both treatments. Recovery times in minutes {{from the end of}} anaesthetic infusion for treatments FP and MP respectively were; to extubation 3. 0 (3. 0 – 3. 0) and 4. 5 (3. 3 – 5. 0); to sternal position, 4. 5 (3. 3 – 5. 0) and 5. 0 (5. 0 – 6. 5) and to standing 13. 0 (10. 3 – 15. 0) and 15. 0 (11. 3 – 17. 3). Quality of recovery was acceptable in both groups, but abnormal behavioural signs were observed after treatment FP. Conclusions and clinical relevance Total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl or propofol and midazolam, at the doses studied, in spontaneously-breathing, oxygen-supplemented goats is practicable. Recovery from the fentanyl-propofol combination is not always smooth.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the fluctuations in carotid chemoreceptor discharge represent {{more than a simple}} proportional response to respiratory oscillations of Pa, CO 2 has been examined. Simultaneous recordings of the activity in few- or multi-fibre chemoreceptor preparations of the cut carotid sinus nerve and oscillations of carotid arterial pH have been made in four anaesthetized cats which were paralysed and artificially ventilated at constant frequency. Chemoreceptor activity was averaged over a minimum of twenty consecutive pH cycles and the amplitude of the fluctuations in discharge frequency determined. Using the mean Pa, CO 2 obtained from <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> and the slope of the relationship between log Pa, CO 2 and pH obtained in each cat, the amplitude of the pH oscillations was converted to Pa, CO 2 amplitude. This amplitude relative to the mean Pa, CO 2 has been compared with the amplitude of the corresponding fluctuation in the chemoreceptor discharge frequency recorded from the carotid sinus nerve (e. s. n. d. amplitude) relative to its mean level. Whereas the Pa, CO 2 amplitude was always less than 8 % of the mean Pa, CO 2, the c. s. n. d. amplitude ranged from 40 to 186 % of the mean discharge frequency. C. s. n. d. amplitude was divided by the corresponding Pa, CO 2 amplitude to give an index of the sensitivity of the chemoreceptors to Pa, CO 2. This sensitivity has been compared with that determined from the mean discharge frequency produced in response to changes in mean Pa, CO 2 comparable in magnitude to the Pa, CO 2 amplitude. The former sensitivity was usually at least 3 times greater than the latter. Examination of the fluctuations in chemoreceptor discharge frequency in relation to the corresponding pH oscillations revealed that whereas the minimum discharge frequency coincided with the alkaline peak of the pH oscillation (trough of the Pa, CO 2 oscillation), the maximum discharge frequency did not invariably coincide with the acid trough of the pH oscillation (peak of the Pa, CO 2 oscillation). On 30 % of occasions, the maximum discharge frequency was associated with the region of maximum rate of fall of pH (maximum rate of rise of Pa, CO 2). It was concluded that fluctuations in the discharge of carotid chemoreceptors cannot be accounted for {{on the basis of a}} simple proportional relationship to Pa, CO 2. They contain a large rate of change component...|$|E
40|$|ET- 26 HCl is a {{promising}} sedative-hypnotic anesthetic {{with virtually no}} effect on adrenocortical steroid synthesis. However, whether or not ET- 26 HCl also has a sufficiently wide safety margin and hemodynamic stability {{similar to that of}} etomidate and related compounds remains unknown. In this study, the effects of ET- 26 HCl, etomidate and propofol on therapeutic index, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), maximal rate for left ventricular pressure rise (Dmax/t), and maximal rate for left ventricular pressure decline (Dmin/t) were investigated in healthy rats and a rat model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UHS). 50 % effective dose (ED 50) and 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) were determined after single bolus doses of propofol, etomidate, or ET- 26 HCl using the Bliss method and the up and down method, respectively. All rats were divided into either the normal group and received either etomidate, ET- 26 HCl or propofol, (n = 6 per group) or the UHS group and received either etomidate, ET- 26 HCl or propofol, (n = 6 per group). In the normal group, after preparation for hemodynamic and heart-function monitoring, rats were administered a dose of one of the test agents twofold-higher than the established ED 50, followed by hemodynamic and heart-function monitoring. Rats in the UHS group underwent experimentally induced UHS with a target arterial pressure of 40 mmHg for 1 hour, followed by administration of an ED 50 dose of one of the experimental agents. <b>Blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> was conducted on samples obtained during equilibration with the experimental setup {{and at the end of}} the experiment. In the normal group, no significant differences in HR, MAP, Dmax/t and Dmin/t (all P > 0. 05) were observed at any time point between the etomidate and ET- 26 HCl groups, whereas HR, MAP and Dmax/t decreased briefly and Dmin/t increased following propofol administration. In the UHS group, no significant differences in HR, MAP, Dmax/t and Dmin/t were observed before and after administration of etomidate or ET- 26 HCl at ED 50 doses (all P > 0. 05). Administration of propofol resulted in brief, statistically significant reductions in HR and Dmax/t, with a brief increase in Dmin/t (P ˂ 0. 05), while no significant differences in MAP were observed among the three groups. The blood-lactate concentrations of rats in the ET- 26 HCl group were significantly lower than those in etomidate and propofol groups (P ˂ 0. 05). ET- 26 HCl provides a similar level of hemodynamic stability to that obtained with etomidate in both healthy rats, and rat models of UHS. ET- 26 HCl has the potential to be a novel induction anesthetic for use in critically ill patients...|$|E
40|$|Professor Sykes, Nuffield {{professor}} of anaesthetics in Oxford, knighted in 1991, first talks {{of his family}} background, his childhood in Devon and Yorkshire and his medical studies at University College, London (which had moved to Bangor during the Second World War), Magdalene College, Cambridge, and University College Hospital from 1946 - 49. Professor Sykes then outlines his early career. House physician posts were followed by two years of national service in the RAMC with the British Army of the Rhein in Germany, where he was trained as an anaesthetist in Hamburg. He discusses his time in UCH where he completed his training for the Diploma in Anaesthesia and the Fellowship, and was influenced by figures such as Massey Dawkins, Bob Cope and Bernard Lucas. He describes his year as Rickman Godlee travelling scholar, based at Harry Beecher's department in the Massachusetts General Hospital, as a turning point because it gave {{him the opportunity to}} engage in research. Next, Professor Sykes reflects on his career at the Hammersmith, where he worked from 1958 to 1980; the innovations he made there and his research. He speaks of the six months he spent studying the impact of mechanical ventilation on neonates and adults with tetanus in Durban, South Africa, and collaborating with Philip Hugh-Jones and John West on their mass spectrometry studies on gas distribution in the lungs. Discussion of his innovations at the Hammersmith covers: setting up a resuscitation service and a <b>blood-gas</b> <b>analysis</b> service, opening a recovery unit in 1960 which became the first general intensive care unit in the UK, initiating the use of mechanical ventilation for open-heart surgery, and promoting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Professor Sykes outlines his extensive research: on rebreathing during anaesthesia, on respiratory changes associated with thoracic surgery, on the extracorporeal circulation, on the physiology of mechanical ventilation and the causes of hypoxia during anaesthesia, and on the effects of drugs used in anaesthesia and intensive care on the pulmonary circulation. The interview moves on to Professor Sykes' move to Oxford, where he served as Nuffield Professor of Anaesthesia from 1980 to 1991. He talks of the difficulties of motivating and co-ordinating staff over several sites. However, he was able to establish a research base that attracted good students and grants and thrived on liaisons with other departments, and to set up a patient-controlled analgesia service for all the patients he anaesthetised. He then discusses his major publications and his visit to Finland in 1960 promoting and teaching about anaesthesia in a country where it was rare. In the final stages of the interview Professor Sykes ponders the key advances in anaesthesia and medicine over his lifetime and the personal highlights of his career...|$|E
