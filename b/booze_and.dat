In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of <b>booze</b> <b>and</b> pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson).

Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E

O'Hara, knowing Flynn's reputation as a womanizer, was on close guard during the production. Though she [...] "respected him professionally and was quite fond of him personally" [...] she found Flynn's alcoholism a problem and remarked that [...] "if the director prohibited alcohol on the set, then Errol would inject oranges with <b>booze</b> <b>and</b> eat them during breaks". According to Steve Jacques, O'Hara outdid Flynn in the combat scenes, many of {{which had to be}} cut from the final version to protect Flynn's heroic image. The film was a commercially successful venture.|$|E
500|$|Prohibition {{became the}} major {{issue of the}} campaign. Though both Stanley and Beckham were known to drink liquor, Beckham campaigned on a pro-temperance platform.

[...] " [...] would sell out the world {{to go to the}} Senate," [...] he added. [...] The support of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson and Representative Ben Johnson were not enough to carry Stanley to victory.

500|$|New Zealand Herald {{journalist}} Graham Reid similarly deems {{the track}} to be [...] "More interesting than exceptional", as {{an account of}} how Harrison [...] "soaked himself in <b>booze</b> <b>and</b> whatever" [...] {{in reaction to the}} disintegration of his marriage.

Classic Rock editor Paul Trynka highlights the song among the [...] "beautiful, small-scale moments" [...] that were overlooked {{at the time of the}} album's release, describing it as [...] "a shamefaced confessional on the banality of drunkenness".|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1920s, Yale {{was noted}} {{as one of}} the most {{powerful}} gangsters in Brooklyn. In addition to his numerous rackets, Yale made inroads into labor racketeering and dockside extortion as well. In spring of 1927, however, Yale's long friendship with Capone began to fray. As a major importer of Canadian whisky, Yale supplied much of Capone's whiskey. Yale would oversee the landing of the <b>booze</b> <b>and</b> make sure the Chicago-bound trucks made it safely through New York. Soon, many of the trucks began being hijacked before they left Brooklyn. Suspecting a double cross, Capone asked an old pal James [...] "Filesy" [...] DeAmato to keep an eye on his trucks. DeAmato reported that Yale was indeed hijacking his booze. Soon after this, Capone's spy realized that his cover had been blown and tried unsuccessfully to shoot Yale on the night of July 1, 1927. Six nights later, DeAmato was gunned down on a Brooklyn street corner.|$|E
2500|$|Savage Night, {{published}} in 1953, is generally ranked {{as one of}} his best novels. It is also one of his oddest literary offerings. Its narrator, Charlie [...] "Little" [...] Bigger (also known as Carl Bigelow), is a small, tubercular hitman whose mind is deteriorating with his body. In reviewing Savage Night, Boucher said it was [...] "written with vigor and bite, but sheering off from realism into a peculiar surrealist ending of sheer Guignol horror. Odd that a mass-consumption paperback should contain the most experimental writing I've seen in a suspense novel of late." [...] Savage Night contains an interlude—whether or not it is fantasy or dream, hallucination or flashback is unclear—when Bigger meets a poor, verbose writer who, much like Thompson himself, has a penchant for <b>booze</b> <b>and</b> makes a living writing pulp fiction to be sold alongside pornography. That writer also claims to operate a [...] "farm" [...] where he grows vaginas {{as a metaphor for the}} material he writes.|$|E
