40|$|The {{method for}} {{determining}} the laser beam intensity profile and diameter of the CO 2 laser beam has long seen the use of evaporation of clear PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate). Traditionally PMMA is used as it exhibits low conduction and reflection (Miyamoto [1]) {{as well as a}} low cut front temperature of approximately 600 &# 0176;C (Powell [2]). The result is typically described as a mode burn though more complex processes such as those shown by Ivarson [3] may also be investigated using its removal. The use of mode burns has not however been extended to Nd:YAG laser beams as clear PMMA is transparent at 1. 064 &# 0956;m, the output wavelength of this laser. Presented herein is a technique to enable similar quantitative and qualitative measurements using black PMMA for the Nd:YAG laser operating at 1. 064 &# 0956;m.

40|$|The {{photochemical}} {{formation of}} ozone {{in the lower}} 				troposphere ('ozone smog') {{is the result of}} complex 				dynamical and chemical processes in the planetary 				boundary layer (PBL). Measurements near ground deliver 				not the complete picture of the chemical and physical 				interactions involved, therefore the goal of this work 				was to develop a lidar instrument that allows the 				observation of ozone and aerosols simultaneously in the 				entire PBL with high vertical and temporal resolution. 				The detection of aerosols allows the measurement of the 				height of the PBL as well as the the observations of the 				dynamical processes that are going on. Also the 				aerosol's influence on the photochemistry via its 				disturbance of the radiation flux can be evaluated. 				 An observation site was built {{on the roof of the}} 				tower of the hospital 'Charité' in the centre of Berlin, 				where two independent lidar systems were operated. A 				DIAL system based on a flashlamp-pumped 				Titanium:Sapphire laser with frequency triplication and 				a double oscillator was used to measure profiles of the 				ozone concentration from 100 m to about 3 km altitude. 				Additionally, profiles at different zenith angles using 				a <b>bending</b> <b>mirror</b> were obtained to allow for the ozone 				measurements at lower altitudes. In order to 				measure aerosols a lidar system based on a Nd:YAG laser 				was developed that detects backscatter from 200 m to 10 				km altitude at 355 nm, 532 nm, and 1064 nm wavelengths. 				It also detects Raman scattering from Nitrogen molecules 				at 387 nm and depolarisation allowing for the 				observation of the aerosol extinction and particle 				shape. The aerosol system operated simultaneously with 				the ozone lidar. This arrangement made the correction of 				a systematic bias in the ozone measurements caused by 				the aerosol possible. An integrated retrieval 				(LASD-retrieval) was developed that calculates ozone 				concentration and aerosol properties simultaneously. 				Based on scattering theory aerosol effective particle 				size and the complex refractive index was calculated. 				The latter allows for an estimation of the soot fraction 				of the aerosol. The lidar systems were operated during 				the BERLIOZ field campaign in summer 1998 which aimed 				for analysing the chemical and dynamical processes that 				lead to the formation of ozone smog in detail. Several 				smog events were captured during this campaign, showing 				that ozone formation is limited to the planetary 				boundary layer that acts as the reaction chamber. The 				aerosol in Berlin is generally of a rural character. 				Urban aerosol dominates only during short event that are 				less rich in ozone. This demonstrates that soot 				particles may play a role in ozone chemistry, by 				providing surfaces for heterogeneous reactions.

40|$|A novel, no-contact {{approach}} to X-ray <b>mirror</b> <b>bending</b> control is presented here, proposed {{for use on}} the beamlines of the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) project. A set of <b>mirrors</b> with tunable <b>bending</b> radii are desired, that will maintain their optical properties even as the beam incidence causes local heating. Various mechanical bending mechanisms have been proposed and used on other beamlines, which can take {{up a lot of}} physical space, demanding more vacuum power, while using expensive high precision servomotors. Rather than <b>bend</b> the <b>mirror</b> by mechanical means, it is proposed to heat the mirror to produce the desired bending. This could work two ways. One scenario calls for a finely tunable heat lamp to irradiate the back surface of the mirror while the X-ray laser heats the front side. With appropriate tuning, simulations show that this approach can keep the mirror flat, and perhaps produce a circular profile. The second scenario is similar to the first, but a thin film of tungsten is added {{to the back of the}} silicon mirror. This scenario calls for the temperature of the mirror to change homogenously to affect the desired bending, and in this case the profile should be cylindrical. In both scenarios the uneven nature of the incident radiation causes distortions that may be undesirable. Both scenarios are simulated and it is shown that the stress produced by a metal film may minimize this distortion.

Since {{there are various}} applications for beamforming and beamsteering such as 3 D imaging, optical communications, and {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR), it is great interest to develop ultrafast optical phased arrays. However, the beamsteering speed of optical phased arrays using liquid crystal and electro-wetting are typically limited to tens of milliseconds. Optical phased arrays using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technologies can operate in the submegahertz range, but generally require metal coatings.

40|$|A new {{facility}} for microdiffraction strain measurements and microfluorescence mapping {{has been built}} on beamline 12. 3. 2 at the advanced light source of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This beamline benefits from the hard x-radiation generated by a 6 T superconducting bending magnet (superbend) This provides a hard x-ray spectrum from 5 to 22 keV and a flux within a 1 mu m spot of ~;; 5 x 109 photons/ s (0. 1 percent bandwidth at 8 keV). The radiation is relayed from the superbend source to a focus in the experimental hutch by a toroidal mirror. The focus spot is tailored by two pairs of adjustable slits, which serve as secondary source point. Inside the lead hutch, a pair of Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors placed in a vacuum tank refocuses the secondary slit source onto the sample position. A new KB-bending mechanism with active temperature stabilization allows for more reproducible and stable <b>mirror</b> <b>bending</b> and thus <b>mirror</b> focusing. Focus spots around 1 um are routinely achieved and allow a variety of experiments, which have in common the need of spatial resolution. The effective spatial resolution (~;; 0. 2 mu m) is limited by a convolution of beam size, scan-stage resolution, and stage stability. A four-bounce monochromator consisting of two channel-cut Si(111) crystals placed between the secondary source and KB-mirrors allows for easy changes between white-beam and monochromatic experiments while maintaining a fixed beam position. High resolution stage scans are performed while recording a fluorescence emission signal or an x-ray diffraction signal coming from either a monochromatic or a white focused beam. The former allows for elemental mapping, whereas the latter is used to produce two-dimensional maps of crystal-phases, -orientation, -texture, and -strain/stress. Typically achieved strain resolution is {{in the order of}} 5 x 10 - 5 strain units. Accurate sample positioning in the x-ray focus spot is achieved with a commercial laser-triangulation unit.

Fluorescence scans can be collected in continuous scan mode with up to 300 pixels/s scan speed. A charge coupled device area detector is utilized as diffraction detector.

40|$|An {{essential}} component of any high power transmission system is a directional coupler that provides {{a sample of the}} forward and reflected power when this power is being delivered to the intended load. In the case of millimeter power delivered through a highly oversized corrugated waveguide, there is the much more complex issue of mode purity. It is possible to design an effective mode selective branch guide directional coupler in smooth wall overmoded waveguide. In the typical highly overmoded corrugated waveguide propagating the HE{sub 11 } mode, however, obtaining an adequate coupling factor can be difficult, and branch guide attenuation and phase velocity matching over several meters become concerns. A more practical approach for large diameter corrugated waveguide is to obtain a sample of the propagating beam at a miter <b>bend</b> <b>mirror.</b> At low power, the mirror could be a thin metal screen. At the megawatt level, however, heat removal must be considered. For example, at 110 GHz at 1 MW, taking the surface resistance of copper to be 0. 10 {Omega}, the dissipation on a 45 {sup o} copper mirror would be 750 W or 1500 W for H or E plane reflection, respectively. With a peak to average power ratio of 3. 7 for the circular HE{sub 11 } mode, in 31. 75 cm diameter corrugated waveguide the peak dissipation can be as high as 500 W/cm{sup 2 } {{at the center of the}} mirror. An edge cooled thin metal screen is not therefore practical, but a thick plate containing a single narrow channel, at the bottom of which is a row of holes in the remaining thin wall, can be adequately water-cooled on its face. To maintain vacuum and focus the radiation from the holes, the narrow channel is filled by a fused quartz plate, the shape of which is a 45 {sup o} sector of a circle having a truncated apex at the coupling holes. These are being used as power monitors on the DIII-D ECH system and on other systems. Since this single row of holes samples only part of the wave field, however, interference among higher order modes, even when they are of low amplitude, can produce noticeable variations in received power, depending on the exact gyrotron frequency and temperature of the waveguides. The only certain way to avoid this problem is to use a true beam splitter that provides a sample of the fields in the entire cross section of the waveguide. Our proposed means of overcoming the heat removal problem is to make the mirror an edge cooled CVD diamond disk having a very thin copper coating on the high power side of the mirror. A two dimensional array of holes is etched through the copper. An image of the incident wave free of aliasing is launched on the opposite side of the copper film. This process is easily scaled to frequencies greater than 170 GHz. We have analyzed the thermal response of such a plate bonded to water-cooled heat sinks on the periphery of both faces. In our case, the heat sinks have 32 mm by 45 mm apertures. The gray diamond we are using is 60 mm diameter with two flats 48 mm apart. For a diamond 1. 1 mm thick having an assumed thermal conductivity of 1300 W/m-K and heated with a total of 1500 W (times a correction for the resistivity increase with temperature) on one face with the circular HE 11 distribution, the steady state temperature at the center is 210 C, starting at 35 C. The temperature reaches steady state by 1 s, while the 1 /e time is about 160 ms. This temperature is slightly higher than the steady state gyrotron window temperature. If necessary we can reduce the peak temperature, at greater cost, by using a thicker gray diamond, say 1. 5 mm, or by using a white diamond 1. 1 mm thick having 1800 W/m-K conductivity. Either would bring the final central temperature down to < 160 C. Since we are using edge cooling, this result is independent of waveguide diameter, so this device can be made for any diameter...|$|R

Based on stress polishing, this manufacturing method requires the conception of a warping harness able to generate extremely accurate bending of the optical surface of the segments during the polishing. The conception of the warping harness is based on finite element analysis and allowed a fine tuning of each geometrical parameter of the system in order to fit an error budget of 25 nm RMS over 300 μm of bending peak to valley.

40|$|Typically, light {{interacts with}} matter via the {{electric}} field and interaction with weakly bound electrons. In a magnetic mirror, a patterned nanowire is fabricated over a metallic layer with a dielectric layer in between. Oscillation of the electrons in the nanowires {{in response to}} the magnetic field of incident photons causes a re-emission of photons and operation as a "magnetic mirror. " By controlling the index of refraction in the dielectric layer using a local applied voltage, the phase of the emitted radiation can be controlled. This allows electrical modification of the reflected wavefront, resulting in a deformable mirror {{that can be used for}} wavefront control. Certain applications require wavefront quality in the few-nanometer regime, which is a major challenge for optical fabrication and alignment of mirrors or lenses. The use of a deformable magnetic mirror allows for a device with no moving parts that can modify the phase of incident light over many spatial scales, potentially with higher resolution than current approaches. Current deformable mirrors modify the incident wavefront by using nano-actuation of a substrate to physically <b>bend</b> the <b>mirror</b> to a desired shape. The purpose of the innovation is to modify the incident wavefront for the purpose of correction of fabrication and alignment-induced wavefront errors at the system level. The advanced degree of precision required for some applications such as gravity wave detection (LISA - Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) or planet finding (FKSI - Fourier-Kelvin Stellar Interferometer) requires wavefront control at the limits of the current state of the art. All the steps required to fabricate a magnetic mirror have been demonstrated. The modification is to apply a bias voltage to the dielectric layer so as to change the index of refraction and modify the phase of the reflected radiation. Light is reflected off the device and collected by a phase-sensing interferometer. The interferometer determines the initial wavefront of the device and fore optics. A wavefront correction is calculated, and voltage profile for each nanowire strip is determined.

40|$|This study {{reported}} a simulation {{approach to the}} understanding of the interactions between a buried pipe and the soil system by computing the bending stress variation of harmonically-excited buried pipes. The established principles of linear dynamics theory and simple beam theory were utilised in the analysis of the problem of buried pipe bending stress accumulation and its dynamics. With regards to the parameters that influence the bending stress variations, the most important are the isolation factor, uniform external load, and the corresponding limiting conditions. The simulated mathematical expressions, containing static and dynamic parameters of the buried pipe and earth, were coded in Fortran programming language and applied in the simulation experiment. The results obtained showed that harmonically-excited buried thick-walled pipe became stable and effective when the ratio of the natural frequency of vibration to the forced frequency is greater than 2. 0, whenever the damped factor is used as the control parameter for the maximum <b>bending</b> stress.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) (Electrical Engineering) Actuators are {{naturally}} limited in the force they can apply, and efficiency often dictates operation that {{is close to}} the limits of the permissible values. This is especially true for adaptive optics systems that compensate for the atmospheric turbulence using the mirrors deformable on-the-fly by the actuators. On the one hand, the actuator should use all the authority to <b>bend</b> the deformable <b>mirror</b> and thus compensate the turbulence. On the other hand, the actuators must not damage the mirror by pushing the surface too hard, and the controller must account for these constraints. This thesis focuses on the high-speed constrained control of deformable mirrors in astronomical adaptive optics. The main approach considered in this work is constrained Receding Horizon Control with Quadratic Programming. A thorough study of the structure and the physics of the control problem allowed exploiting the structure of the problem and an inherently fast sampling rate to hot-start the online optimisation. These features are of crucial importance, making it possible to accelerate the constrained control by orders of magnitude compared to standard algorithms. The original contribution of this thesis is a thorough feasibility analysis of the online optimisation algorithms for constrained control in adaptive optics systems. While the Convex Optimisation and the Receding Horizon Control are well studied areas, their application for astronomical adaptive optics has not been systematically studied. The thesis provides the results of numerical simulations that conclusively prove the feasibility of online constrained control of a deformable mirror. Using state-of-the-art Quadratic Optimisation algorithms of my own implementation, a control rate of 10 kHz for a relatively large deformable mirror has been achieved. The significance of the results of this thesis is a comprehensive performance analysis of various optimisation approaches for constrained optimal control of deformable mirrors in adaptive optics.

With the nearing completion of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the astrophysics community is already starting to define the requirements for follow-on observatories. The restrictions of available launch vehicles and the possibilities of planned future vehicles have fueled the competition between monolithic primaries (with better optical quality) and segmented primaries (with larger apertures, but with diffraction, costs and figure control issues). Regardless of the current shroud sizes and lift capacities, these competing architectures share the need for rapid design tools.

Starting with the Arnold Mirror Modeler (which creates Finite Element Models (FEM) for structural analysis) and now also feeds these models into thermal stability analyses. They share common file formats and interchangeable results. During the development of the program, numerous trade studies were created for 4 -meter and 8 -meter monolithic primaries, complete with support systems. Evaluation of these results has led {{to a better understanding of}} how the specification drives the results. This paper will show some of the early trade studies for typical specification requirements such as lowest <b>mirror</b> <b>bending</b> frequency and suspension system lowest frequency. The results use representative allowable stress values for each mirror substrate material and construction method and generic material properties. These studies lead to some interesting relationships between feasible designs and the realities of actually trying to build these mirrors. Much of the traditional specifications were developed for much smaller systems, where the mass and volume of the primary where a small portion of the overall satellite. JWST shows us that as the aperture grows, the primary takes up the majority of the mass and volume and the established rules need to be adjusted. For example, a small change in lowest frequency requirement can change the cost by millions of dollars. The paper uses numerous trade studies created during the software development phase of the Arnold Mirror Modeler to illustrate the influences of system specifications on the design space. The future telescopes will require better performance, stability and documented feasibility to meet the hurdles of today's budget and schedules realities.

Below about 30 MHz the ionosphere acts like a <b>mirror,</b> <b>bending</b> the path traveled by a radio wave back toward the Earth. At higher frequencies, such as those used by GPS, radio waves pass right through the ionosphere. They are, nevertheless, affected by it. Disruption of communications and navigation systems can have severe societal consequences. Even though the ionospheric observational techniques and the ionospheric models have gone through considerable development sustained over many decades, accurate monitoring and forecasting of the ionosphere conditions still presents stubborn challenges. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) -based radio occultation (RO) has been {{proven to be a}} powerful technique for remotely sensing the earth's troposphere, stratosphere, and ionosphere in the past decade [8]. Radio occultation is a relatively new technique {{that can be used to}} study the ionosphere, offering potentially global and continuous measurements. MARINER IV first applied the RO observation technique to observe the Mars atmosphere and ionosphere in 1965 [48]. MicroLab- 1 GPS/MET was launched in 1995 and applied to monitor the Earth's atmosphere and ionosphere by using GPS RO technique [37, 50]. The Global Positioning System (GPS) to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite paths essentially make long, near-horizontal measurements of the integrated content of ionospheric electron density; namely total electron content (TEC). These measurements are not simple to interpret, since the satellite transmission paths map out a complicated and continuously changing measurement geometry. Nevertheless, a strong advantage of this system is that it provides measurements over the oceans and into remote polar caps, thus enabling the ionosphere to be studied on a truly global-scale. The FORMOSAT- 3 /COSMIC (the most recent and advanced RO mission in operation) was launched in April 2006, and has six micro satellites in different orbital planes. The GPS radio occultation experiment (GOX) is one of the satellite mission objectives, and observes the ionosphere and atmosphere vertical structure by using the RO observation technique. RO observations, particularly from FORMOSAT- 3 /COSMIC, have significantly improved our capability of monitoring the global ionosphere. In the ionosphere, the important scientific RO data product is the retrieved electron density profile (Ne(h)) along the tangent points during an occultation event. The Abel inverse transform is the conventional method to analyze the tropospheric occultations and it was natural to adopt this approach for the ionospheric studies. It allows the vertical profile of electron concentration to be obtained, nominally at a single location between the GPS and LEO (onboard RO receiver). The resulting profile is therefore some average of the ionosphere traversed by the occulting ray paths between the two satellites. However, the classical approach of the Abel inversion assumes spherical symmetry of the electron density field in the vicinity of an occultation. In practice, the footprint of an occultation generally covers wide regions and averages any spatial variations connected with variable declinations of the magnetic field from the horizontal direction along the occulted ray path. Indeed, inhomogeneous electron density in the horizontal direction for a given occultation is believed to be the main source of error when using the Abel inve...|$|R
