After Keith had them {{play for the}} staff of his record label, they were offered a deal on the spot, and after signing on a Tuesday, {{they were on a}} tour bus by Thursday as part of Keith’s <b>Big</b> <b>Dog</b> Daddy tour.

500|$|In 1963, NBN won the Logie Award for Enterprising Programming (which {{was only}} for country stations), and another Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station award in 1978. NBN {{purchased}} the Romper Room franchise from Fremantle International in 1967, which broadcast for over three decades. The original hostess was Miss Anne, followed by Miss Lyn, Miss Pauline and finally, Miss Kim who hosted the program until its demise due to 'political correctness'. (For example, a favourite feature called 'bounce-the-ball' was deemed inappropriate because not all children could bounce a ball). At first the 'Miss's' were assisted by NBN's station mascot, Buttons the Cat, who underwent a number of incarnations as its costume aged and became outdated. Later, Buttons was retired, being replaced by Humphrey B. Bear (as NBN had gained {{the rights to the}} character through their purchase of Southern Television Corporation), [...] A Local suited character was then determined to be more suitable for a regional television station and the concept of <b>Big</b> <b>Dog</b> was created, the character and suit were created in Wyong on the NSW Central Coast and <b>Big</b> <b>Dog</b> came into being.|$|E
500|$|Irish Wolfhounds bred by Nagle {{were also}} {{successful}} in America; she began exporting dogs there in 1933. Best of breed awards at the Irish Wolfhound Club of America speciality shows were secured by Champion Sulhamstead Matador of Killybracken in 1960 and by Sulhamstead Mars of Riverlawn in 1963. She also judged the national speciality there twice and judged Irish Setters and Irish Wolfhounds at Westminster in 1937. Other countries she exported Wolfhounds to included Sweden, Italy and Uruguay. As late as 1960, Sulhamstead Merman, a 150-pound Irish Wolfhound bred, owned and shown by Nagle at [...] "London's <b>big</b> <b>dog</b> show", Crufts, won the Hound Group {{and went on}} to be declared Best in Show or [...] "supreme champion"; the judges were H.

500|$|Lágrimas Cálidas was {{produced}} by Jose Gaviria and Andres Munera. It was recorded at Crescent Moon Studios and <b>Big</b> <b>Dog</b> Studios in Miami, New World Studios in Bogota and Promix Estudios in Medellin. The genre of the album is defined as Tropipop, because it mixes tropical genres such as vallenato and merengue with pop and Caribbean influences. The album opens with [...] "No Te Pido Flores" [...] ("I'm Not Requesting Flowers"), [...] where the predominant instruments are the accordion, guitar and caja vallenata. Lyrically, the song begins with the absence of her man, but then, in the chorus, transitions into a warning not {{to fall in love}} with material things. The second track, [...] "Lágrimas Cálidas" [...] ("Warm Tears"), is a vallenato-stylized pop ballad, expressing her suffering due to being abandoned by her lover. [...] "Te Arrepentiras" [...] ("You'll Regret"), is about a woman who surrendered completely to a man who did not appreciate her.|$|E

2500|$|Increasing {{popularity}} has {{also led to}} increasing regulatory interest. For example, in September 2004, the city of Boston required all regularly scheduled intercity bus services to operate exclusively {{to and from the}} South Station transportation terminal. Steven Bailey of The Boston Globe suggested that the move was motivated by Peter Pan's and Greyhound's interest in maintaining their monopoly on the New York-Boston bus route, and Timothy Shevlin, executive director of the state Department of Telecommunications and Energy, said, [...] "The <b>big</b> <b>dog</b> out there, Peter Pan, is dead set against Chinatown bus lines. They don't want that kind of competition." [...] A complication with this arrangement was that the South Station bus terminal has only 25 gates (along with two departure gates), all of which were used at the time until other companies left.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 2005, Keith {{founded a}} new label, Show Dog Nashville. Its first release was his 2006 album White Trash with Money, {{followed}} by the soundtrack to Broken Bridges. He also abandoned Stroud as co-producer in favor of Cannon's wife, Lari White. The album included three singles: [...] "Get Drunk and Be Somebody", [...] "A Little Too Late", and [...] "Crash Here Tonight". <b>Big</b> <b>Dog</b> Daddy followed in 2007, with Keith serving as sole producer. Its singles were [...] "High Maintenance Woman", [...] "Love Me If You Can", and [...] "Get My Drink On". [...] "Love Me If You Can" [...] became Keith's first number 1 hit since [...] "As Good as I Once Was" [...] {{more than two years}} prior. A two-disc Christmas album, A Classic Christmas, followed later in 2007. In 2008, Keith completed his Biggest and Baddest Tour. On May 6, 2008, he released 35 Biggest Hits, a two-disc compilation featuring most of his singles to date, as well as the new song [...] "She's a Hottie", which peaked at number 13.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rights to}} the 1995 novel Blindness were closely guarded by author José Saramago. Saramago explained, [...] "I always {{resisted}} because it's a violent book about social degradation, rape, and I didn't want it {{to fall into the}} wrong hands." [...] Director Fernando Meirelles had wanted to direct a film adaptation in 1997, perceiving it as [...] "an allegory about the fragility of civilization". Saramago originally refused to sell the rights to Meirelles, Whoopi Goldberg, or Gael García Bernal. In 1999, producer Niv Fichman and Canadian screenwriter Don McKellar visited Saramago in the Canary Islands; Saramago allowed their visit on condition that they not discuss buying the rights. McKellar explained the changes he intended to make from the novel and what the focus would be, and two days later he and Fichman left Saramago's home with the rights. McKellar believed they had succeeded where others had failed because they properly researched Saramago; he was suspicious of the film industry and had therefore resisted other studios' efforts to obtain the rights through large sums of money alone. Conditions set by Saramago were for the film to be set in a country that would not be recognizable to audiences, and that the canine in the novel, the Dog of Tears, should be a <b>big</b> <b>dog.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, the Lakers won {{the title}} again; however, O'Neal and Bryant began feuding during the season. O'Neal came into {{training}} camp out of shape, which disappointed Jackson and also Bryant, who worked hard over the offseason {{to improve his}} game. Bryant was leading the league in scoring as 2001 began, and Jackson said Bryant was playing the best ball of his career. O'Neal was shooting below 50 percent during stretches, and his free throw shooting was in the 20 percent range. O'Neal said of the Lakers in January, [...] "When {{it was clear that}} everything went through me, the outcome of it was (a record of) 67–15, playing with enthusiasm, the city jumping up and down and a parade. And now we're 23–11. You figure it out ... I don't know why anybody else would want to change – other than selfish reasons." [...] Bryant responded that it was a different year and the roster had undergone some changes and [...] "things change, things evolve, {{and you just have to}} grow with that change." [...] Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka said a key factor was the team's defense after losing Fisher for most of the season. O'Neal requested a trade after a blowout win against the Phoenix Suns where Bryant scored 38 and O'Neal scored 18. Jackson commented that their actions were [...] "juvenile" [...] and they should appreciate each other and play as a team. Bryant would be criticized for forcing his offense and not involving his teammates enough. Even O'Neal's stepfather was overheard yelling at Bryant to pass the ball during a game. Bryant told Jackson that the [...] "(triangle) offense is so simple. It doesn't display my talent ... it doesn't give me what I have to have for my game." [...] According to Bryant, the team's defense was the issue and not his increased role in the offense. [...] Bryant said that [...] "scoring shouldn't affect (O'Neal's) defense", while O'Neal maintained that [...] "if the <b>big</b> <b>dog</b> ain't me, then the house won't get guarded – period." [...] Due to O'Neal's sensitivity toward criticism, Jackson overlooked O'Neal's shortcomings while maintaining his criticism of Bryant. West told O'Neal that he also had personal rivalries when he played with all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor, but O'Neal needed to [...] "stop being a baby ... put the team's success first." ...|$|E
