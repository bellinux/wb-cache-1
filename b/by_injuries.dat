5|$|During {{his later}} years, Shaw enjoyed tending the gardens at Shaw's Corner. He {{died at the}} age of ninety-four of renal failure precipitated <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> {{incurred}} when falling while pruning a tree. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 6 November 1950. His ashes, mixed with those of Charlotte, were scattered along footpaths and around the statue of Saint Joan in their garden.|$|E
5|$|He {{began playing}} {{professional}} football in 2008 {{when he made}} his debut with Atlético Madrid. Domínguez went on to play in 120 competitive games and won three major titles with the club, including two Europa League trophies. In 2012, he signed for Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he made just over 100 appearances. His time in Germany was hampered <b>by</b> <b>injuries,</b> however, which ultimately forced him to retire in 2016, at the age of 27.|$|E

5|$|In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 {{games and}} their eighth {{consecutive}} Pacific Division crown. They swept the through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In eighth {{trip to the}} NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons. Hampered <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Of the 296 {{people on}} board, 111 {{died in the}} crash. Most were killed <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> {{sustained}} in the multiple impacts, but 35 {{people in the middle}} fuselage section directly above the fuel tanks died from smoke inhalation in the post-crash fire. Of those, 24 had no traumatic blunt-force injuries. The majority of the 185 survivors were seated behind first class and ahead of the wings. Many passengers were able to walk out through the ruptures to the structure.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, People {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his addiction to painkillers, brought on <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> to his knees, legs, and feet, {{that resulted from}} years of performing. In his statement, Tyler said he is grateful for the support he is receiving, is committed to getting things taken care of, and is eager {{to get back on}} stage and in the recording studio with his bandmates.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 NFL Network program “10 Worst Teams of All Time” (produced {{prior to}} the Lions’ winless season) {{recognized}} the 1976 Buccaneers as the worst NFL team ever, although it is disputed whether their record was not deceptive, as they were decimated <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> and were a play away from victory several times. There is some opinion that the 1976 team was not even the worst in Buccaneers history, with the 2–14 1986 squad deserving of that distinction.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, the 2013–14 {{season was}} plagued <b>by</b> <b>injuries,</b> {{suspensions}} {{and a high}} turnover of players, and the Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5–2, a result that left the Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4–1 to level the tie and force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7–6 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City {{prepared}} for the final at Southport, Lancashire, at the Palace Hotel. The players kept relaxed with massages, games of bowls and salt baths. On {{the day before the}} match travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open with the press about their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Cardiff were free to choose their first choice team, unhindered <b>by</b> <b>injuries.</b> They selected the same team as had featured against Reading in the semi-final, with the exception of Harry Wake, despite his experience from playing in the FA Cup final two seasons prior.|$|E

5|$|Carruthers {{signed for}} Conference North club Brackley Town on 7 July 2014 on a one-year contract. Carruthers made 27 {{appearances}} in 2014–15 for a Brackley team that ranked 18th in the Conference North table. He re-signed for Corby Town on 9 June 2015 following their promotion to the National League North. Having made 14 appearances for Corby, {{he was allowed}} to leave to seek regular football, and joined Southern League Premier Division club Kettering on dual registration on 13 November 2015. Having been limited <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> and family and work commitments, Carruthers left Kettering on 12 September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Chairman Kelvin Thomas {{stepped down}} during the 2012 close season, to be {{replaced}} by owner Ian Lenagan. The 2012–13 season was blighted <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> and patchy form: after opening the season with three wins and briefly heading the table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013. Some Oxford fans were unhappy about the decision to renew Wilder's contract, having pressed for his sacking {{during the second half of}} the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland pursued former Steelers {{coach and}} Browns linebacker Bill Cowher and former Browns scout Scott Pioli {{for the head}} {{coaching}} job. The team, however, hired former New York Jets coach Eric Mangini in January 2009. Before {{the start of the}} season, Mangini and the front office traded Winslow to the Buccaneers after five seasons marked <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> and a motorcycle crash that threatened to end the tight end's career. The Browns showed little sign of improvement in Mangini's first year, finishing 5–11 in 2009. While Cleveland lost 11 of its first 12 games, the team won the final four games of the season, including a 13–6 victory over the rival Steelers.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 {{calendar}} he {{won gold}} at the Summer Olympics {{in the individual}} time trial event and the Milan–San Remo. The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In 2010, he won the Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> throughout. After a lackluster two-year period, Cancellara again won the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix double in 2013. In 2014, Cancellara repeated as winner of the Tour of Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Following the merger, the Jets {{fell into}} mediocrity; Namath was dogged <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> {{through much of}} his later career. In 1981, New York {{qualified}} for {{the playoffs for the}} first time in the post-Namath era. They reached the AFC Championship Game in 1982; they were defeated on a rain-soaked Orange Bowl field by the Miami Dolphins. Beginning with the 1984 season, the team played in New Jersey's Giants Stadium. The team started the 1986 season with a 10–1 record, but the injury-plagued Jets lost their last five regular season games and relinquished a ten-point fourth quarter lead to lose in double overtime to the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though {{he felt he had}} retired too early, and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.|$|E

5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred <b>by</b> <b>injuries.</b> Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season {{was cut short}} in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{she took}} time from {{competition}} {{to act as}} the dressage training adviser to the Australian national equestrian team, but resigned from that position in late 2006. In 2008, she began riding Herzruf's Erbe at major events, but the horse has been plagued <b>by</b> <b>injuries</b> that have required him to miss many competitions. Salzgeber announced a change in her training base in July 2016, moving to new stables in Ettringen, Bavaria. In 2013, after returning Herzruf's Erbe to competition, Salzgeber was again named to the German equestrian squad's A-team.|$|E
5|$|In February 1955, Saban was {{promoted}} to head coach at Northwestern, succeeding Bob Voigts and becoming the youngest coach in the Big Ten Conference at 33 years old. Saban's tenure {{as coach of the}} Northwestern Wildcats football team, however, was brief and unsuccessful. Hampered <b>by</b> <b>injuries,</b> the team lost all of its games in 1955, and calls intensified for Saban's firing as the season wore on. In December, Saban and his entire staff were fired by new athletic director Stu Holcomb. Ara Parseghian was named as his replacement.|$|E
