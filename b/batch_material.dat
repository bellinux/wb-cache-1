50|$|It {{should not}} be thought that Brill spent the entire decade ensconced in the Corning laboratory; he made various forays to the Middle East, {{including}} accompanying Wertime’s 1968 survey of the ancient technologies of Iran, alongside other great minds such as the noted ceramicist, Frederick Matson (UCL Institute for Archaeo-Metallurgical Studies 2007). In the years 1963-1964, the Corning Museum of Glass and the University of Missouri, following {{a long history of}} excavation at the necropolis of Beth She'Arim, conducted an examination of a huge slab of glass, some 2000 years old, that had been languishing in an ancient cistern (Brill and Wosinski 1965). Brill cannot recall who first suggested this slab, measuring 3.4m by 1.94m, could be made of glass, but the only way to test it was to drill a core through its 45 cm thickness and analyse it (Brill 1967, Brill and Wosinski 1965). On analysis of the core, Brill found that the glass was devitrified and stained, and not very homogenous, with a presence of wollastonite crystals throughout (1965, 219.2). Investigation of the manufacture technology required to produce the slab, suggested that in order to produce such a slab of glass, it would have been necessary to heat over eleven tons of <b>batch</b> <b>material,</b> and sustain it at around 1050˚C for between five and ten days (Brill 1967)! His initial interpretation was that the glass must have been heated either from above or from the sides using a kind of tank furnace; a hypothesis that was proven accurate when excavation underneath the slab suggested it had been melted in situ, in a tank whose floor was a bed of limestone blocks with a thin parting layer of clay (Brill and Wosinski 1965, Brill 1967). Brill’s interpretation, that the slab and its surroundings suggest ‘some early form of reverberatory furnace’ was the first suggestion of the use of tank furnaces in early glassmaking (1967, 92). The evidence at Beth She’arim encouraged further innovative thought because whilst the slab represented glass production on a grand scale, no associated evidence for glass working was found. Brill had already suspected that historical glassmaking occurred in two phases, the heavy ‘engineering’ stage when the glass is formed from the batch ingredients and the ‘crafting’ stage when the glass is formed into artefacts (Brill, pers. comm., 2009). These stages could occur in combination at one location, or at two differing locales, and the time span of production after the initial glass melt is highly flexible. For Brill, the idea of this ‘dual nature of all glassmaking’ was ‘crystallized’ at Beth She’Arim, where only the raw glass production was represented, and would be reinforced later by the contrasting evidence, where working was favoured over production, found at Jalame, as discussed below (Brill, pers. comm., 2009).|$|E

The fuzzy demand and fuzzy machine capacity are also considered in the proposed model.

From Ijero-Ekiti, fireclay samples were explored, exploited and developed into automobile brake pads. Eight samples were taken from 5 to 30 metres downward at various pits to prevent unwanted foreign materials. Specifically, these samples were examined and found to be characteristically homogeneous in physical, mechanical, mineralogical and chemical composition. 30 per cent of the unwanted foreign materials from the fireclay were technically removed with above 45 micron sieve using a wet sieving method. 70 per cent of the purified clay of less than 45 micron sieve was eventually used as beneficiated {{fireclay material}}. After the purification, sample clay obtained was finally calcined at 15000 C temperature for clay structural stability and prevention of excessive clay shrinkage.

40|$|Issue: Fiberglass {{insulation}} manufacturing {{has grown}} {{to be one of}} the largest uses for recycled glass. Because fiberglass does not have glass’s clarity, there is an assumption among some that fiberglass raw materials can tolerate higher levels of contaminants than container manufacturing. In fact, metal, organic, and ceramic contaminants can be costly to fiberglass quality and production equipment. Best Practice: During fiberglass production, raw batch materials and glass cullet are continuously added to the furnace. After melting and “fining, ” the molten glass is spun into fibers by a process called fiberizing. To ensure production of consistent fibers, cullet must meet specifications for major and minor oxide chemical composition, color consistency, and contaminant levels. Major and Minor Oxide Chemical Composition. The chemical composition of cullet as raw <b>batch</b> <b>material</b> for fiberglass should fall within the ranges listed in the table. Variations in major oxide concentration can affect both the viscosity and emissivity of the glass melt. Viscosity is a measure of flow resistance, while emissivity is the ability of a material to emit heat through radiation. Both of these properties affect the attenuation ability of the molten glass during fiber formation. In addition, a shift in a major oxide concentration can cause fluctuations in the electrical resistivity of the melt. This requires an adjustment of transformer settings controlling the power input to the furnace, as well as creating changes in heat flow patterns, current paths, and temperature distribution, all of which are undesirable during stable furnace operations. Minor and trace oxide composition of the batch cullet is also very important. Oxides such as CoO, Cr 2 O, and FeO can influence infrared heat transmission, heat transfer during melting, and rate of fiber cooling. These factors will affect fiber attenuation, leading to variability in the fiber diameters and lengths...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is on the {{experimental}} verification and computational modelling of refractive components for operation in the terahertz frequency band for future missions to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The specific components that were characterised were a set of dielectric lenses. These were made {{as part of a}} European Space Agency contract to further the refractive technology in the terahertz band of the frequency spectrum. Two different types of prototype lens were made for this project in Cardiff University and testing performed at Maynooth University (MU) and Cardiff University. An antireflection coating was applied to the prototype lenses and measured to test its effectiveness. During the manufacturing process some issues were detected, including a difference in refractive index between the finished lens and the sample <b>batch</b> <b>material.</b> In addition the lenses were found to have become warped during the application of the antireflection coating. This was due to the material not undergoing an annealing process before manufacture of the lenses. The measurements carried out helped to identify and resolve the discrepancy between the refractive index of the test batch supplied, used to measure refractive index, and the actual lens, through comparison with the model developed and the simulations carried out by the TICRA company in Denmark. The measurements also tested the coating that was applied to the lens surface and confirmed good performance at 100 GHz and fall off at a lower frequency of 75 GHz, as expected. After an initial set of measurements of the lenses, improvements were made to the alignment system and the lenses were retested. This resulted in measurements with reduced offsets of the components in the system. A computer simulation of the measurement setup was performed using an in house software package called Maynooth Optical Design and Analysis Laboratory (MODAL) to assess the accuracy of the measurements and test the model. The model showed good agreement between the feed horn measurements and simulations for all horns. The offsets in the physical system had {{to be included in the}} model in order to obtain agreement between the real and modelled systems. Computational simulations were performed for the uncoated lenses and showed good overall agreement but discrepancy in the comparison with high resolution measurements...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{crucible}} induction melters (CCIM) {{have been}} proposed as an alternative technology for waste glass melting at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at Savannah River Site (SRS) {{as well as for}} other waste vitrification facilities. Proponents of this technology cite high temperature operation, high tolerance for noble metals and aluminum, high waste loading, high throughput capacity, and low equipment cost as the advantages over existing Joule Heated Melter (JHM) technology. The CCIM uses induction heating to maintain molten glass at high temperature. A water-cooled helical induction coil is connected to an AC current supply, typically operating at frequencies from 100 KHz to 5 MHz. The oscillating magnetic field generated by the oscillating current flow through the coil induces eddy currents in conductive materials within the coil. Those oscillating eddy currents, in turn, generate heat in the material. In the CCIM, the induction coil surrounds a 'Cold Crucible' which is formed by metal tubes, typically copper or stainless steel. The tubes are constructed such that the magnetic field does not couple with the crucible. Therefore, the field generated by the induction coil couples primarily with the conductive medium (hot glass) within. The crucible tubes are water cooled to maintain their temperature between 100 C to 200 C so that a protective layer of molten glass and/or <b>batch</b> <b>material,</b> referred to as a 'skull', forms between them and the hot, corrosive melt. Because the protective skull is the only material directly in contact with the molten glass, the CCIM doesn't have the temperature limitations of traditional refractory lined JHM. It can be operated at melt temperatures in excess of 2000 C, allowing processing of high waste loading batches and difficult-to-melt compounds. The CCIM is poured through a bottom drain, typically through a water-cooled slide valve that starts and stops the pour stream. To promote uniform temperature distribution and increase heat transfer to the slurry fed High Level Waste (HLW) sludge, the CCIM may be equipped with bubblers and/or water cooled mechanical agitators. The DWPF could benefit from use of CCIM technology, especially in light of our latest projections of waste volume to be vitrified. Increased waste loading and increased throughput could result in substantial life cycle cost reduction. In order to significantly surpass the waste throughput capability of the currently installed JHM, {{it may be necessary to}} install two 950 mm CCIMs in the DWPF Melt Cell. A cursory evaluation of system design requirements and modifications to the facility that may be required to support installation and operation of two 950 mm CCIMs was performed. Based on this evaluation, it appears technically feasible to position two CCIMs in the Melt Cell of the DWPF within the existing footprint of the current melter. Interfaces with support systems and controls including Melter Feed, Power, Melter Cooling Water, Melter Off-gas, and Canister Operations must be designed to support dual CCIM operations. This paper describes the CCIM technology and identifies technical challenges that must be addressed in order to implement CCIMs in the DWPF...|$|E
40|$|Glasses systems {{based on}} TeO 2 -ZnO-Na 2 O (TZN), TeO 2 -WO 3, and TeO 2 -Na 2 O-ZnF 2 are {{reported}} here, {{with a number}} of other components added (PbO, GeO 2, Nb 2 O 5, Bi 2 O 3, Er 2 O 3, Yb 2 O 3, PbF 2, and ErF 3). Glass formation was shown for the first time, to this author's knowledge, in the ternary system (90 -x) TeO 2 - 10 Na 2 O-xZnF 2 for x = 5 to 30 mol. %. Glass stability (Tx-Tg) was found to increase with ZnF 2 addition, reaching a plateau of around 161 oC at x = 25 mol. %. This could be due to competition of various phases to crystallise (NaZnF 3 and Zn 2 Te 3 O 8) as the eutectic is approached, with fluoride addition. These glasses are the most stable ZnF 2 containing tellurite compositions reported to date, to the author's knowledge. As-received ZnF 2 <b>batch</b> <b>material</b> was shown to contain a significant proportion of Zn(OH) F, identified by XRD. The as-received ZnF 2 was fluorinated with (NH 4) HF 2, which produced a substantially more phase pure powder, with oxygen levels reduced from around 13. 2 to 3. 1 at. % from XPS spectra. By calculation from the O 1 s XPS peaks, the proportion of Zn(OH) F was reduced in the powders from 39. 7 to 9. 4 mol. %. A number of absorption bands in the infrared were identified by FTIR for the TeO 2 -ZnO-Na 2 O glasses due to intrinsic lattice vibrations (visible in a 0. 2 mm sample), and extrinsic impurity absorption, including: free OH (around 3. 0 microns, 3300 cm- 1), weakly hydrogen-bonded OH (around 3. 3 microns, 3060 cm- 1), and strongly hydrogen-bonded OH (around 4. 8 microns, 2090 cm- 1). For the series (90 -x) TeO 2 - 10 Na 2 O-xZnF 2, mol. %, x = 5 to 30 mol. % melted for 2 hours as bulk glasses, OH bands at 2900 cm- 1 were reduced in intensity with ZnF 2 addition due to self drying of the melt, from around 0. 12 cm- 1 (120 dB. m- 1) for x = 5 mol. %, to around 0. 02 cm- 1 (20 dB. m- 1) for x > 15 mol. %. Melting time also had a significant effect on drying of this series, with the loss at 2900 cm- 1 reduced by two orders of magnitude when increased from 1 hour (around 705 cm- 1, 705 dB. m- 1) to 2 hours (0. 01 cm- 1, 10 dB. m- 1). Refractive index of the series (90 -x) TeO 2 - 10 Na 2 O-xZnF 2, mol. %, x = 5 to 30 mol. % decreased linearly with ZnF 2 addition, from 2. 02 (x = 5 mol. %) to 1. 85 (x = 30 mol. %), as the fluoride and zinc are less polarisable than oxygen and tellurium. Cohen-Grest viscosity modelling was used to predict the fibre drawing temperature (around 330 oC, corresponding to a viscosity of 10 ^ 4. 5 Pa. s), and fragility of the fluorotellurite core / clad pair (20 / 25 mol. % ZnF 2), occurring at least 60 oC < Tx. Fragility of these glasses was predicted to lie between oxide tellurite glasses (stronger) and fluorozirconate glasses (more fragile). Increasing melting time and fluorination resulted in a significant decrease in OH bands in the 700 nm to 2. 5 micron region for unstructured 70 TeO 2 - 10 Na 2 O- 20 ZnF 2 mol. % fibre, from around 40 to 4 dB. m- 1 at 2. 5 microns as melting time was increased from 3 to 10 hours. Fibre optical loss for the 10 hour melt was relatively flat (around 5 dB. m- 1) over the entire 700 nm to 2. 5 micron region. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a compositional envelope that describes the retention of various impurities in lanthanide borosilicate (LaBS) glass for vitrification and immobilization of excess, defense-related plutonium. A limited amount of impurity data for the various plutonium sources is available and projections were made through analysis of the available information. These projections were used to define types and concentrations of impurities in the LaBS glass compositions to be fabricated and tested. Sixty surrogate glass compositions were developed through a statistically designed approach to cover the anticipated ranges of concentrations for several impurity species expected in the plutonium feeds. An additional four glass compositions containing actual plutonium oxide were selected based on their targeted concentrations of metals and anions. The glasses were fabricated and characterized in the laboratory and shielded cells facility to determine the degree of retention of the impurity components, the impact of the impurities on the durability of each glass, and the degree of crystallization that occurred, both upon quenching and slow cooling. Overall, the LaBS glass system appears to be very tolerant of most of the impurity types and concentrations projected in the plutonium waste stream. For the surrogate glasses, the measured CuO, Ga{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, Na{sub 2 }O, NiO, and Ta{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } concentrations fell very close to their target values across the ranges of concentrations targeted in this study for each of these components. The measured CaO and PbO concentrations were consistently higher than the targeted values. The measured Cr{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } and Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } concentrations were very close to the targets except for the one highest targeted value for each of these components. A solubility limit may have been approached in this glass system for K{sub 2 }O and MgO. The measured Cl{sup -}, F{sup -}, SeO{sub 2 } and SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 -} concentrations were well below their target values for all of the study glasses. This is likely due to volatilization of these species during melting of the glass batch. Note that the degree of volatilization that occurred in this crucible-scale study may differ from the full-scale melter. The measured HfO{sub 2 } concentrations were below their target values for all of the surrogate glasses. It is likely that for HfO{sub 2 }, the solubility limit in the glass was exceeded and some of the HfO{sub 2 } <b>batch</b> <b>material</b> remained {{in the bottom of the}} crucibles after pouring the glasses. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that some crystalline HfO 2 remained in some of the surrogate glasses with the lowest concentration of impurities. No other crystalline phases were identified. The Product Consistency Test (PCT) results showed that all 60 of the surrogate glass compositions tested were very durable, regardless of thermal history, with the highest normalized release for boron being 0. 041 g/L. The pH of the leachate solutions was generally lower than that of conventional waste glasses due to the lack of alkali in the LaBS glass, which likely impacted the PCT results. The normalized release rates for the elements measured were generally too small to attempt to correlate the results with the compositions of the test glasses. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure results showed that no hazardous metals were leached from the surrogate glasses in any measurable concentration. A plutonium-containing crystalline phase with a cross-shaped morphology was identified via SEM in the glasses fabricated with plutonium oxide. This phase was identified in a previous study of plutonium-bearing LaBS glasses and may provide an opportunity to intentionally crystallize some of the plutonium oxide into a highly insoluble form with an intrinsic neutron absorber. Additional work is necessary to better characterize the influence that this phase has on durability of the glass. The PCT results for the plutonium-containing LaBS glasses with impurities were similar to previous tests conducted on PuO{sub 2 }-containing glasses without impurities added. The highest normalized release for boron was 0. 02 g/L, which bounded the highest normalized release for plutonium of 0. 01 g/L...|$|E

Batch reactors are used in small-scale production and reactions with biological materials, such as in brewing, pulping and production of enzymes.|$|R
5000|$|Methods of {{disposal}} - Methods of {{dust removal}} and disposal vary with the material, plant process, volume, and type of collector used. Collectors can unload continuously or in <b>batches.</b> Dry <b>materials</b> can create secondary dust problems during unloading and disposal that do not occur with wet collectors. Disposal of wet slurry or sludge can be an additional material-handling problem; sewer or water pollution problems can result if wastewater is not treated properly.|$|R
50|$|Fetal {{bovine serum}} is commercially {{available}} from many manufacturers, and because cells grown in vitro are highly sensitive, customers usually test specific batches {{to check for}} suitability for their specific cell type. When changing from batch to batch it is usual to adapt the cells to the new <b>batch</b> of <b>material,</b> for example, by mixing 50% of the old serum with 50% of the new serum and allowing the cells to acclimatise to the new material.|$|R
40|$|Monosodium {{titanate}} (MST) {{for use in}} the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) must {{be qualified}} and verified in advance. A single qualification sample for each <b>batch</b> of <b>material</b> is sent to SRNL for analysis, as well as a statistical sampling of verification samples. The Harrell Industries Lot # 46000619120 qualification and the 13 verification samples met each of the selected specification requirements that were tested and, consequently, the material is acceptable {{for use in the}} ARP process...|$|R
