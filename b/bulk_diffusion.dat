40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{foundation for}} the study of local non-equilibrium solute diffusion under rapid solidifica-tion conditions is proposed. The model takes into account the relaxation to local equilibrium of the solute flux and incorporates two diffusion speeds, VDb, the <b>bulk</b> liquid <b>diffusion</b> speed, and VD~, the interface diffusive speed, as the most important parameters governing the solute concentration in the liquid phase and solute partitioning. The analysis of the model predicts complete solute trapping and the transition to a purely thermally controlled solidification, which occur abruptly when the interface velocity V equals the <b>bulk</b> liquid <b>diffusion</b> speed VDb. The abrupt change in the solidification mechan-ism is described by the velocity dependent effective diffusion coefficient D * = D(l- V 2 /V&) and the generalized partition coefficient K*. If V> VDb, then D * = 0 and K * = 1. This implies an uudis-turbed diffusion field in the liquid (diffusionless solidification) and complete solute trapping at V> VDb. The interface diffusion speed v~i governs solute redistribution at a relatively low interface velocity v- v ~ i < VDb. The influence of the local non-equilibrium solute transport on the tempera-ture field and interface stability under rapid solidification conditions is also discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{transfer}} in single porous particles is studied by measuring uptake rates in porous single particles and by modelling these rates with a non-isothermal, non-isobaric Maxwell–Stefan model.

The model describes mass transfer due to pore <b>diffusion</b> (<b>bulk</b> and Knudsen <b>diffusion),</b> viscous flow and surface diffusion. To identify the different types of mass transport in the porous particles two types of kinetic uptake measurements were performed: responses to pure component pressure steps and responses to concentration steps at constant feed pressure.
