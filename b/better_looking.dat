25|$|WR {{recruits}} {{were promised}} uniforms upon reaching boot camp, {{but that was}} not always the case. In fact, during the summer of 1943, some recruits had to train in civilian clothing until uniforms were available. When the new uniforms arrived, {{they turned out to be}} winter uniforms. The seersucker summer uniforms had yet to be designed. Disputes about fabric, cut, and production had a delaying affect upon delivery. In time, these issues were resolved, and most WR members felt their uniforms were much <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> than those of the other women's military organizations.|$|E

25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} <b>better</b> <b>looking,</b> that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
25|$|Noel {{has said}} that Liam showed little {{interest}} in music until his late teens, also that Liam was <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> than him, a better singer, had better clothes and could pull off a parka jacket better. Gallagher became confident {{in his ability to}} sing and began listening to bands like the Beatles, the Stone Roses, the Who, the Kinks, the Jam, and T.Rex. In the process he forged a lifelong obsession with former Beatles singer/songwriter John Lennon; Liam would later sarcastically claim to be Lennon re-incarnated, despite being born eight years prior to Lennon's death.|$|E
25|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. While the graphics were often {{the topic of}} scrutiny and comparison to <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> titles of the time, such as Quake, reviewers were largely unanimous in praising the game's orchestral soundtrack, composed by Clint Bajakian, and solid gameplay. The voice cast includes veteran talent such as John de Lancie, Richard Moll and Jack Angel. A free expansion, entitled Handful of Missions, was released in 1998. Community-created expansion levels are also available and have received media coverage. Although not a huge financial success, the game has a cult following.|$|E

500|$|The album's best-known single, [...] "Fire Water Burn", is a {{diatribe}} {{against a}} white boy who attempts, and fails, {{to act like}} a black thug. [...] "I Wish I Was Queer So I Could Get Chicks" [...] is satirical song about the belief that girls only like gay men, playing on the stereotype that gay men are often <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> and more sensitive than straight men. [...] "Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me?" [...] is mainly about how Jimmy Pop was constantly picked on in high school and has since developed extreme katagelophobia, an intense fear of being ridiculed.|$|E
500|$|The Sega Saturn {{edition of}} X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews {{according to the}} review aggregation website GameRankings. Reviewers praised its fast-paced gameplay, animation and sound quality, and technical performance {{in comparison to the}} original arcade version. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot commended the character sprite animations and background details, claiming that [...] "there is no <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> 2D fighter on any console system". While Gerstmann also praised the port for its fast loading times and lack of slowdown, he criticized the game for its defense-oriented gameplay and unoriginal soundtrack. Game Informer lauded the port for running and looking identical to its arcade counterpart, declaring it [...] "one of the best arcade conversions ever seen to date".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{generally}} well received, its content drew criticism from fans, who felt the overall effect diminished the significance of Harrison's solo career. In the 1977 edition of their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler summed up the implication: [...] "George's 'Best Of'. Half Beatle, half Harisongs. But {{will there be a}} Volume II?" [...] Nicholas Schaffner observed a couple of minor positives on this [...] "half-baked" [...] collection: [...] "The Best of George Harrison does confirm that George's big production numbers from All Things Must Pass more than hold their own alongside the seven featured Beatles tunes... And the album is undeniably <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> than Rock 'n' Roll Music." [...] Bob Woffinden similarly found that Harrison's solo recordings matched the standard of the Beatles' tracks while noting that [...] "Capitol's half-and-half arrangement... made it look as though {{he was the only one}} of the four [...] with insufficient clout to warrant a 'Greatest Hits' [...] entirely of his own work." ...|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the press}} {{coverage}} at the time focused {{on the fact that}} half dollars would be sold for twice face value. The Colorado Sun commented, [...] "The World's Fair people count upon making a good thing by selling their five million souvenir half dollars at premium. The Chicago propensity for speculating in futures cannot be restrained." [...] The Philadelphia Call concurred, [...] "Perhaps the proposition to sell the 50¢ souvenirs at the World's Fair for $1 is an evidence of what visitors to Chicago may expect in the general increase in prices." [...] The design was also a source of comment. The Philadelphia Ledger suggested, [...] "If it were not known in advance whose vignette adorns the Columbian souvenir half dollar, the average observer would be undecided as to whether it is intended to represent Daniel Webster or Henry Ward Beecher." [...] The Boston Globe noted, [...] "The first view of the new Columbian souvenir coin inevitably leads to expression of regret that Columbus wasn't a <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> man." [...] The Galveston Daily News opined of the new half dollars: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{company had}} no {{standardization}} of level design tools. Leighton said, [...] "Some people used 3D Studio Max, some used Lightwave, and one designer even wrote his own custom modeler from scratch". This practice {{led to an}} inconsistent quality across the game's levels. For example, one designer would create structures with great geometry but bad texturing, while another would create the opposite. Once the structures were modeled individually, they were all imported into a custom editor, called D3Edit, so that the designers could [...] "glue everything together". The D3Edit editor received constant updates because it initially did not feature an intuitive interface for designers. It {{was not until the}} last third of the development period that the editor improved significantly. As Leighton notes, [...] "Even in the shipped game you can tell which levels were made early on and which were made {{near the end of the}} production cycle. The later levels are much <b>better</b> <b>looking,</b> have better frame rates, and generally have better scripts". Developers also considered the idea of shipping the game with a level editor based on the one they used to create the game's levels. However, due to the constant changes the developers made to their own editor, it was hard for them to design a more user-friendly one from the start.|$|E
500|$|For {{almost a}} decade, the 1995 TV serial was {{considered}} [...] "so dominant, so universally adored, [...] it has {{lingered in the}} public consciousness as a cinematic standard". Comparing six Pride and Prejudice adaptations in 2005, the Daily Mirror gave 9/10 to the 1995 serial ("what may be the ultimate adaptation") and the 2005 film adaptation, leaving the other adaptations such as the 1940 film behind with six or fewer points. The 2005 film was [...] "obviously [...] daring or revisionist" [...] as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film's leads, Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast, as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been [...] "a little too 'heavy' for the role". The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was [...] "arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle" [...] and that [...] "Knightley is <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> than Lizzy should strictly be". The critical reception of MacFadyen's Darcy, whose casting had proven difficult because [...] "Colin Firth cast a very long shadow", ranged from praise to pleasant surprise and dislike. Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen's Darcy in the following years. Garth Pearce of The Sunday Times noted in 2007 that [...] "Colin Firth will forever {{be remembered as the}} perfect Mr. Darcy", and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 Newsday article that Firth was [...] "'universally acknowledged' as the definitive Mr. Darcy".|$|E

500|$|As of October 2008, Wu starred with Jessica Rose and Phillip DeFranco in Hooking Up from HBOLabs (the online arm of HBO), a scripted 10-episode web-based series. Hooking Up {{is set at}} {{a fictional}} {{university}} where the students {{spend most of their}} time emailing and twittering, but still manage to miscommunicate. It is his first work on a scripted production. Guest appearances on Hooking Up will be made by Kevin Nalty, Michael Buckley, and other internet celebrities. The entire cast of Hooking Up is composed of YouTube video bloggers in the hope of attracting a young, internet knowledgeable audience. By the show's second day on YouTube, it had received more than 450,000 views. According to NewTeeVee.com, an evolving consensus is that for an online video to be a hit, somewhere between 100,000 and one million views are needed, giving Hooking Up a strong start. Maria Russo of the Los Angeles Times felt that Wu was <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> than star DeFranco and wondered why Wu plays the [...] "tired role of the East Asian friend who helps the white guy get the chicks," [...] while Bobbie Johnson of The Guardian said that many web surfers had [...] "scoffed at what they see as a cynical attempt to cash in." [...] On October 2, 2011, Wu hosted [...] "Flicks" [...] on Cartoon Network during an airing of Around the World in 80 Days. Wu has also announced he would be starring in the independent film Rock Jocks with Justin Chon, Felicia Day, and Gerry Bedknob, which was released in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Megatokyo {{is usually}} {{hand-drawn}} in pencil by Fred Gallagher, without any digital or physical [...] "inking". Inking was originally planned, but dropped as Gallagher {{decided it was}} unfeasible. Megatokyos first strips were created by roughly sketching on large sheets of paper, followed by tracing, scanning, digital clean-up of the traced comics with Adobe Photoshop, and final touches in Adobe Illustrator to achieve a finished product. Gallagher has stated that tracing was necessary because his sketches were not neat enough to use before tracing. Because of the tracing necessary, these comics regularly took six to eight hours to complete. As the comic progressed, Gallagher became able to draw [...] "cleaner" [...] comics without rough lines and tracing lines, {{and was able to}} abandon the tracing step. Gallagher believes [...] "that this eventually led to <b>better</b> <b>looking</b> and more expressive comics".|$|E
