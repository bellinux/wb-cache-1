40|$|<b>Horn</b> <b>antennas</b> {{are very}} popular at UHF (300 MHz- 3 GHz) and higher {{frequencies}} (as high as 140 GHz). <b>Horn</b> <b>antennas</b> {{often have a}} directional radiation pattern with a high antenna gain, which can range up to 25 dB in some cases, with 10 - 20 dB being typical. <b>Horn</b> <b>antennas</b> have a wide impedance bandwidth, implying that the input impedance is slowly varying over a wide frequency range. The bandwidth for practical <b>horn</b> <b>antennas</b> can be {{of the order of}} 20 : 1 (for instance, operating from 1 GHz- 20 GHz), with a 10 : 1 bandwidth being common.

RCS characteristics of <b>horn</b> <b>antennas</b> were fabricated and measured in these antennas in decimeter wavelengths for validation of the results.

The proposed method of electrodynamic simulation and measurement method of <b>horn</b> <b>antennas</b> allows to estimate the RCS chart in broad sector of irradiation angles and reception. The potentially achievable degree of reduction can be determined from a comparison of the RCS <b>horn</b> <b>antenna</b> with a matched load and short-circuited.
