40|$|Lightning {{striking}} on {{a transmission}} tower induces high {{ground potential rise}} and high voltage at tower arms in which potential is normally at ground level, and subsequently causes overvoltage across an insulator string. If this overvoltage {{is higher than the}} withstanding voltage of the insulator string according to the v-t (voltage-time) curve, <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> phenomena will occur and this event may cause outage. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} study the factors influencing the <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> phenomena. The computer program PSCAD/EMTDC (Power System Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including DC) is used to simulate lightning striking on a transmission tower 115 kV. Lightning current, transmission towers, ground resistance, insulator strings and <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> phenomena are modeled. Main simulations are lightning striking on different towers, different soil resistivity, different lightning current magnitudes and wave shapes, different locations, and different phase angles of source voltage. Simulation results show that the higher tower encounters higher induced voltage. A <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> occurs at the top tower arm easier than at the middle and lower arms. The higher soil resistivity induces higher voltage. The larger lightning current magnitude impacts on higher induced voltage. The longer rise time of lightning current generates lower induced voltage. Lightning strikes directly on tower generate higher voltage than that of striking on overhead ground wires. ...|$|E
40|$|Lightning is a {{major problem}} in a {{transmission}} line system. Lightning which occurs around the world will give a huge effect on electrical transmission system and also on distribution system division. Lightning-strike commonly generated in two different ways. One of the ways is direct strike to a wire shield (tower top) and another way is shielding failure. A direct-strike to the wire shield generates <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> as a result of voltage on insulator string magnitude is equal or exceeds the critical flashover voltage (CFO). Therefore, the insulation of surge arrester on transmission line is the way to reducing and finally solving the <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> problem.

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of different alternative protection schemes using surge arresters for a 132 kV unshielded overhead line. The protection schemes are: a surge arrester at each conductor and tower, a surge arresters only at the central conductor and every tower (the configuration studied has the central conductor higher than lateral ones at therefore acts as a shield wire) and a surge arrester at each conductor and one out of two towers. The last two protective schemes are consid-ered due to economic reasons. Number of annual flashovers in a 100 km line with the different protec-tion schemes is computed following IEEE recommen-dations. Direct, induced and <b>back</b> <b>flashovers</b> are con-sidered.

40|$|<b>Back</b> <b>flashover</b> faults {{resulting}} from lightning strokes hitting the shield wire(s) or tower(s) {{are one of}} the major causes of power interruptions on the double-circuit 69 / 138 kV overhead transmission lines in Jamaica. Computational analysis with the aid of Alternative Transient Program-Electromagnetic Transient Program (ATP-EMTP) simulations was performed on a section of the affected lines to identify the main factors causing <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> faults with an attempt to reduce the effects and to improve both power reliability and financial losses. A model of the selected line section suitable for transient overvoltage studies was developed to investigate fast transient studies of flashover occurrences of the line insulator with respect to lightning amplitudes and wave fronts; as well as the tower footing impulse resistances and the tower surge impedance. The results show that the 69 kV transmission line was more sensitive to flashover faults, which was due mainly to its relatively lower basic lightning impulse insulation level (BIL) of the line insulators, compared to the 138 kV line. However, the results also indicate that the installation of surge arresters on the affected towers significantly reduce the transient overvoltages well below the insulators' withstand voltages and thereby providing effective protection against <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> faults. The energies absorbed by the surge arresters were also investigated and presented herein...|$|E

40|$|Lightning {{has been}} one of the {{important}} problems for insulation design of power systems and it is still the main cause of outages of transmission and distribution lines. The lightning return-stroke current and the charge delivered by the stroke are the most important parameters to assess the severity of lightning strokes to power lines and apparatus.

40|$|AbstractLightning stroke {{causes a}} current {{injection}} into transmission {{lines at the}} point of contact. The lightning performance can be difficult to understand without using simulation programs. PSCAD a powerful software was selected to develop the appropriate data required to investigate this phenomena. In this paper, two points along transmission line are selected for studying voltage–time (V–t) characteristics when any of those points is subjected to lightning strokes separately. The first assumed point is taken when lightning current is injected to the shielding wire {{at the top of the}} transmission tower, while, the other assumed point is taken when surge current is injected to the shielding wire at maximum sag location in the mid-span between two towers. The sag of transmission line has been newly developed and simulated using PSCAD. Both transmission line containing sag as well as lightning injection current are modeled. Fast transient of flashover as well as <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> occurrence is investigated. The results revealed that the sag of transmission line has considerable influence on flashover and induced voltages across line insulators and phase lines as well.

40|$|Severe {{lightning}} {{environment has}} been the major cause of overhead transmission line outages. In order to minimise the impact of lightning overvoltage, {{it is necessary to}} further evaluate lightning performance of any line before implementing specific protection methods. Therefore, in this work, a thorough study on <b>back</b> <b>flashover</b> tripping patterns of a 275 / 132 kV quadruple steel monopole towers in Malaysia is presented. Several design parameters such as lightning current magnitude, tower footing resistance and power frequency voltage were varied to investigate their influences on the line performance associated with lightning events. The results show that each parameter gives a significant effect on the flashover patterns. For each case, no flashover was recorded on the higher voltage circuits (275 kV), even though the line consists of tall structures, which might be more susceptible to lightning strikes at the upper part. Regardless of the effect of tower height, flashovers occur mainly on 132 kV circuits due to difference in the line insulation level. The results obtained were then used in designing appropriate protection scheme to further improve the transmission line lightning performance, mainly in terms of reducing the double circuit line outages...|$|E
