5|$|Tank was a {{commercial}} success and {{is credited with}} <b>buoying</b> the finances of the newly merged Atari at a critical time for the company. It sold over 10,000 units, considered a large hit at the time, though Ralph H. Baer claims that was only the 1974 sales, with a further 5,000 sold in 1975. Atari produced a second version of the game, a cocktail cabinet form {{in which the two}} players sat across a circular table from each other. A sequel, Tank II, was released in 1974 to sales of around 1,000 units; gameplay was identical, though the maze could be changed to a new format by modifying the circuitry and more sound effects were added. It was followed by three further sequels: Tank III in 1975, the first game to be third in a series; the color Tank 8 in 1976, which featured eight tanks and players simultaneously; and Ultra Tank in 1978, which reverted to a two-player black and white game with the ability to select multiple different maze types and have invisible tanks.|$|E
500|$|Tank was {{designed}} by Steve Bristow, who had previously worked with the founders of Atari on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, and was developed by Lyle Rains. It was created as part of Bristow's vision to move the company away from only producing copies of Atari's games into also developing original titles. The game's cabinet {{was designed}} by Peter Takaichi. In September 1974, Atari announced a merger with Kee, which went into effect {{a month after the}} release of the game. The game was commercially successful, selling over 10,000 units and <b>buoying</b> Atari's then-troubled finances. It led to a cocktail cabinet release of the game and to four sequels: Tank II (1974), Tank III (1975), Tank 8 (1976), and Ultra Tank (1978). [...] A dedicated console version of Tank II was announced in 1977 but cancelled later that year; the joysticks for the game, however, became the standard joystick controllers for the Atari 2600 (1977). Variations on the game were included in the Atari 2600 game Combat, {{as well as in the}} Coleco Telstar game Telstar Combat!, both in 1977.|$|E
500|$|Gillespie {{states that}} Angelou's poems [...] "reflect the {{richness}} and subtlety of Black speech and sensibilities" [...] and {{were meant to}} be read aloud. Angelou has supported Gillespie, telling an interviewer in 1983 that she wrote poetry so that it would be read aloud. Critic Harold Bloom, although he calls Angelou's poetry [...] "popular poetry" [...] and states that it [...] "makes no formal or cognitive demands upon the reader", compares her poems to musical forms such as country music and ballads. He characterizes her poems as having a social rather than aesthetic function, [...] "particularly in an era totally dominated by visual media". Sylvester, who says that Angelou [...] "has an uncanny ability to capture the sound of a voice on a page", places her poems, especially the ones in Diiie, in the [...] "background of black rhythms". Chad Walsh, reviewing Diiie in Book World, calls Angelou's poems [...] "a moving blend of lyricism and harsh social observation". [...] Jessica Letkemann, writing for Billboard, traced the musical qualities of Angelou's poems to her experience as a singer and musician, and said that they were [...] "full of rhythm, melody, cadence <b>buoying</b> her powerful words".|$|E

500|$|Pilgrim {{is often}} {{noted for its}} study of theodicy, or its defense of God's {{goodness}} {{in the face of}} evil. [...] The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its [...] "seemingly horrid mortality," [...] with the belief in a benevolent God. [...] Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: [...] "Evolution", the narrator states, [...] "loves death more than it loves you or me." [...] A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being [...] "sucked dry" [...] by a [...] "giant water bug" [...] as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. [...] The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: [...] "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." [...] While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, [...] "I had thought to live {{by the side of the}} creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. [...] But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not <b>buoying</b> me up but dragging me down." ...|$|E
500|$|Atari {{reported}} {{a loss of}} $500,000 for the 1974 fiscal year, roughly {{as much as the}} previous year's profits, with Gran Trak as one of the major causes. This led Atari into deep financial problems, leaving part of Gran Traks legacy being [...] "the game that nearly put Atari out of business". In September 1974, Atari announced plans to merge with its subsidiary Kee Games; Kee's final game Tank, released in November 1974, was a commercial success, however, and is credited with <b>buoying</b> the finances of the newly merged Atari at a critical time for the company. The Gran Trak 10 game itself, after its problems were resolved, was considered a success, and Atari released multiple versions of it: a clone version titled Formula K was released through Kee Games for different distributors around July 1974, and Atari produced a small cabinet version in late in the year titled Trak 10. According to Ralph H. Baer, Formula K sold 6,000 units. A two-player version titled Gran Trak 20 was released in August, along with its own clone version from Kee Games titled Twin Racer and its own small cabinet version, Trak 20. Baer estimates that Gran Trak 20 sold 4,500 units. Atari produced numerous other racing arcade games in the same style as Gran Trak, including Le Mans (1976), Sprint 2 (1976), Super Sprint (1986), and Badlands (1989). Gran Trak 10 was the first arcade car racing video game and the first game to use a steering wheel, and is known as the [...] "grandfather of car-based racing games", though a simple racing game, Wipeout, had been released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console and a spaceship drag racing arcade game, Space Race, had been released by Atari in 1973.|$|E

50|$|A spar <b>buoy</b> is a tall, thin <b>buoy</b> that floats {{upright in}} the water and is {{characterized}} by a small water plane area and a large mass. Because they tend to be stable ocean platforms, spar <b>buoys</b> are popular for making oceanographic measurements. Adjustment of the water plane area and the mass allows spar <b>buoys</b> to be tuned so they tend to not respond to wave forcing. This characteristic differentiates them from large water plane area <b>buoys</b> such as discus <b>buoys</b> that tend to be wave followers. Spar <b>buoys</b> are often used as stable platforms for wave measurement devices and air-sea interaction measurements. Spar <b>buoys</b> range in length from a few feet to the 354-foot (108 meter) RV FLIP. To avoid the difficulties inherent with shipboard launch and recovery, helicopter deployment of large spar <b>buoys</b> has been studied.|$|R

The high cable tension and location derivation of its anchor can greatly affected the working condition of <b>buoy.</b> Multi-body software ADAMS {{is used to}} analyze the dynamics of deployment for <b>buoy.</b> Firstly, model of mooring <b>buoy</b> is developed. The forces on components of <b>buoy</b> are given such as drag forces, inertia force and impact force between bottom and anchor. The program is developed by macro commands in ADAMS environment.

40|$|A {{wave energy}} {{converter}} (WEC) of point absorber type is tested at {{the west coast of}} Sweden. The <b>buoy</b> is a vertical cylin-der. The linear generator on the seabed has limited stroke length. Large waves cause the generator to reach its maximum stroke length. As this happen, a spring in the generator is compressed, causing the <b>buoy</b> to instantly come to rest. During this process the force between the <b>buoy</b> and the generator is measured. Also the acceleration of the <b>buoy</b> is measured. This process and the extreme forces on the generator hull is described and the study shows that the magnitude of this force is greatly influenced by the added mass of the <b>buoy</b> and thus the <b>buoy</b> geometry. The ratio between the extreme forces on the hull and the forces during nor-mal operation will affect the dimensioning and economy of the WEC. Force acting between generator and <b>buoy</b> were measured during various events as the WEC was operating. Heave added mass was derived from the measurements and found to be greater than the theoretical value.

40|$|Throughout the world's oceans a {{wide variety}} of {{floating}} plastics are found, among which <b>buoys</b> stand out for their high floatability and diversity and abundance of associated organisms. Between 2001 and 2005, we conducted 25 ship surveys in the Bay System of Coquimbo (BSC), during which we registered 34 detached <b>buoys</b> floating between 1 and 45 km from the coast. The objective {{of this study was to}} infer the possible origin of these <b>buoys,</b> identify the associated biota and characterize their biological traits. Short-term drift experiments (30 min) showed that <b>buoys</b> without rope responded primarily to the velocity and direction of the wind, while <b>buoys</b> with ropes (3 m length) followed surface currents. Using the wind velocity and direction during the 12 h before capture of the detached <b>buoys,</b> we estimated the hypothetical trajectories of these <b>buoys</b> during that time period. Results indicated that most <b>buoys</b> originated from aquaculture facilities in the BSC. A total of 134 different species from 14 phyla was found on 18 anchored (91 species) and 22 detached (116 species) <b>buoys</b> sampled. Community composition was similar among <b>buoys</b> - 54 % of all species were common for anchored and detached <b>buoys</b> - but a higher number of rare species occurred on detached <b>buoys.</b> <b>Buoys</b> do not seem to lose but rather gain organisms after detachment. The most common functional groups on these <b>buoys</b> were mobile species, suspension-feeders and species with sexual reproduction, separate sexes, internal fertilization and direct or very short larval development. Fouling communities on detached <b>buoys</b> were mostly in advanced successional stages, comprising diverse species (including several non-indigenous species) adapted to the conditions at the sea surface. These results suggest that floating <b>buoys</b> may transport associated species over extensive distances, thereby also contributing to the spread of non-indigenous species. © Inter-Research 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Matching the best Power Take-Off(PTO) damping, the diameter to draft ratio and array distance with the best energy capture width ratio are acquired, and the energy capture for the short-term forecast of the <b>buoy</b> array is accomplished. On this basis, combined with the actual sea conditions, energy capture for the long-term forecast of an individual <b>buoy</b> is accomplished. The influence of the <b>buoy</b> diameter, <b>buoy</b> draft and array distance on the energy capture width ratio is discussed. [Results] The {{results show that the}} energy capture width ratio is at its greatest when the diameter to draft ratio is between 2. 4 - 2. 6; the smaller the distance between array <b>buoys,</b> the greater the energy capture width of each <b>buoy.</b> [Conclusions] The results can provide a reference and suggestions for the optimization of the design of wave energy generation for arrays <b>buoy...</b>|$|R
