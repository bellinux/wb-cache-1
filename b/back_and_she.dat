5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 May 1941 Hood and the newly {{completed}} battleship [...] sailed from Scapa Flow to join the heavy cruisers [...] and [...] patrolling the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland on the news that Bismarck and the heavy cruiser [...] had sortied into the North Atlantic. They had not yet reached the Strait when Suffolk spotted the German ships north of Iceland {{in the early evening}} on 23 May. Hood and Prince of Wales altered course and increased their speed to intercept. The British squadron spotted the Germans at 5:37a.m., but the Germans were already aware of their presence. The British opened fire at 05:52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen, the lead ship in the German formation, and the Germans returned fire 05:55, both ships concentrating on Hood. Prinz Eugen (probably) was the first ship to score when a shell hit Hoods boat deck, between her funnels, and started a large fire among the ready-use ammunition for the anti-aircraft guns and rockets of the Unrotated Projectile mounts. Right before 06:00, while Hood was turning 20° to port to unmask her rear turrets, she was hit again on the boat deck by a shell from Bismarcks fifth salvo. The exact location and sequence of events is unknown, but her aft fifteen-inch magazines exploded. This broke her <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> sank with the loss of all but three of her crew.|$|E

500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Natasha discovers Andrew is {{cheating}} on her with Summer. Natasha is hurt and angry and she lies to Andrew about being pregnant. Of Natasha's rash decision, Novakovic explained [...] "She is hurt and the whole cheating thing has really crushed her. She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her <b>back.</b> <b>And</b> <b>she</b> feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments. Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are times when she feels guilty for what she is doing. Natasha does not have any sort of plan to admit the truth as she knows Andrew will be angry.|$|E

Her hair is tightly tied <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> sits erect and anxious. The portrait is unflinching in its verisimilitude to the lines of the sitter's face and her subtle frown, and has been seen as representative of [...] "spinsterhood" [...] for its characterization of a fastidious and prim personality. Later Susan Eakins recalled that Addie had been [...] "rather worried" [...] at the time. Eakins continued to work on the painting at least through mid-May of that year.

The angel urged Lot to hurry there, for the angel could not do {{anything}} until he arrived there, and thus the town {{came to be called}} Zoar. As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot's wife looked <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God and looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two daughters. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there was not a man on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites.

2500|$|Lip Lock was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 8 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "If Lip Lock isn't mean enough, well, neither is Eve. She's sweeter than before and musically more adventurous. It's just a shame she burned up the title Eve-Olution on that previous release." [...] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin said, [...] "Lip Lock {{may not be the}} best rap album of 2013, but it's interesting, and it's honest. After 11 years, that's a respectable way to ride out." [...] Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX said, [...] "Seeing Eve return is a welcoming sight, and while unexpected, the experimental arrangements of her new project can be written off as just that. The heart of the issue with Lip Lock is that Eve hasn’t restored the command she once had, which subsequently allows these new sounds to lead her down a road of uncertainty. Eve’s maturation as a person has been obtained through time; it may take more before her music catches up." [...] Lauren Martin of Fact stated, [...] "Eve doesn’t dwell on the past with underhand bitterness or glassy-eyed nostalgia. Considering it’s been eleven years, there’s a pointedly absent element of story-telling about her hiatus which leaves the listener wanting more, yet Eve was never held up as a great lyricist and can’t really be bashed for not being one now. That’s not where her appeal lies. For all her success in commercial rap Eve is first and foremost a singer. It’s the fluidity of her appeal that she’s most keenly aware of, and this gets a triumphant finale on the remix of first single ‘She Bad Bad’ featuring Pusha T and Juicy J. As the three fellow comeback success stories stand side by side like this over what is certainly the album’s most intense beat, even I feel smug listening to it. Eve is <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> barely broke a sweat." ...|$|E
