40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge for formulating low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials without using and releasing hazardous materials that are listed on Washington State and California State Senate Bills. Model brake material samples were manufactured and tested in the Friction Assessment and Screening Test (FAST) and the full scale automotive brake dynamometer (Dyno) using a SAE J 2430 test procedure. The SAE recommended a J 2430 test procedure which provided the necessary data for the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP) by the Brake Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 Council. The newly developed low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials were formulated by modifying a typical Non Asbestos Organic (NAO) (T-Baseline) formulation and a typical Semi-Metallic (M-Baseline) formulation. The NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials contain geopolymer and natural hemp fibers as a partial replacement of phenolic resin and synthetic Kevlar fibers, respectively. Friction performance and wear data from a series of FAST tests were used to train an artificial neural network, which was used to optimize the NAO Cu-free formulations. Then, the optimized low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials were tested on the Dyno. Dyno test results showed that all NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials have passed the Brake Effectiveness Evaluation Procedure (BEEP), did not exhibit thermal fade when temperature was increased and were slightly sensitive to speed. The NAO Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials exhibits slightly lower average friction level when compared to the baseline materials (T-Baseline). The Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials, as well as the rotors, exhibit higher wear than the detected wear on the T-Baseline material. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials have also passed the BEEP. Dyno test results indicated that the semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free friction materials did not exhibit thermal fade and were slightly sensitive to speed. The semi-metallic low-Cu and Cu-free materials exhibited lower friction level and higher wear on the pads when compared to the M-Baseline material. The semi-metallic Cu-free material outperformed the M-Baseline material in term of rotor wear. Analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) microanalysis on the tested materials show that the friction surface of the T-baseline material was covered with fully developed and stable friction layer (third body) consisting mostly of Fe-oxides, different forms of carbon and compounds of materials originally present in the bulk material. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) did not develop a sufficient friction layer. The friction layer seemed to be responsible for the detected lower wear in the T-Baseline compared to the NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16), and it acted as a solid lubricant on the interface between the rubbing pad and the cast iron rotor lowering the adhesive forces. The friction and wear of the T-Baseline material was controlled by adhesive mechanisms. The NAO Cu-free materials (T 30 - 15 and T 30 - 16) with content of geopolymer replacing phenolic resin matrix exhibited extensive abrasive wear in addition to adhesive mechanisms. The capacity to form a friction layer on the surface plays a considerable role when lowering the wear of NAO <b>brake</b> <b>friction</b> materials. The friction layer was formed by compaction and interaction of brake wear particles, and its stability and character depend on the chemistry of the bulk materials in contact as well as the temperature, pressure and sliding speed during a friction process. SEM and EDX analyses also showed that the semi-metallic pads have developed friction layer on the friction surfaces. The difference was that the M-Baseline material had well developed friction layer, but the Low-Cu (M 4) and Cu-free (M 5) materials, had many smaller patches of friction layer disturbed on the surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} on commission by New Industries, Iceland, comprised comparative tests {{with a total of}} 10 new retreaded passenger car tyres classified M+S with the same tread pattern with and without special aggregates mixed into the tread rubber compound. The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> corresponding to ideal ABS braking performance and friction with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded winter tyre can get about 30 % improved <b>braking</b> <b>friction</b> and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the tread rubber compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice. If the vehicle gets in a 20 degree broadslide, rough ice gave up to 40 per cent improvement compared to smooth ice. Repeated tests however quickly reduced this improvement to 10 per cent. The values obtained on smooth flooded ice with the best tyre aggregate tread compound allows cautious driving while the reference tyre friction is insufficient for keeping a vehicle on the road even for a skilled driver under these very severe conditions...|$|E

40|$|Modern bicycle disk-brake systems often induce {{vibration}} {{and noise}} in bike components such as brake rotors, wheels, and even bike frames.

Friction coefficient of the friction composites containing SiC increased with increasing SiC content; especially, the thermal fade of the friction material without SiC (SiC- 0) improved. The specific wear {{rate of the}} friction composites containing SiC increased with SiC added up to 9. 0 vol. % and then turned down, but the negative specific wear rate of SiC- 0 obviously improved. With elevating friction temperature, an increase in both friction coefficient and wear of all the samples was observed. The extension evaluation method represents an effective tool to rank the friction composites. The ranking of five friction materials, described in the weighted average dependent degrees, was evaluated in the order from the best to the worst: SiC- 3. 4, SiC- 14. 6, SiC- 5. 6, SiC- 0, and SiC- 9. 0.

The investigation was performed, utilizing size 49 x 17, type VII, aircraft tires with an inflation pressure of 170 lb per square inch at ground speeds up to approximately 120 knots. The results of this investigation indicate that when the runway is flooded, grooved surfaces provide better braking traction than an ungrooved surface and, in general, the level of braking traction was found to improve as the tire bearing pressure was increased because {{of an increase in}} the groove area of either the surface or the tire tread.
