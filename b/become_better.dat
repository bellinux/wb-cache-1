5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September 1. An {{area of low pressure}} {{associated with the}} wave moved slowly westward, and its convection initially appeared to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized. On September 3, as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands, organization within the system degraded, though convection increased the next day. The system gradually became better organized, and Dvorak classifications began early on September 5. Based on the development of a closed surface circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen early on September 6. Hours later, it intensified into Tropical Storm Isabel, though operationally the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until 13hours after it first developed.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17.

It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E

By May5, the circulation had <b>become</b> <b>better</b> defined, and concurrently the convection increased over the center. After further organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as Depression ARB01A on May6. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 01A, while located about 1300km (800mi) southeast of Salalah, Oman.|$|E

5|$|The {{center of}} {{circulation}} emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that morning. Passage over land disrupted the hurricane's center of circulation, {{and it had}} weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h). However, several hours over the warm waters of the western Gulf provided the energy needed for Emily to regenerate, and by midnight wind speeds were increasing. The increase in wind speed stalled, but the storm continued to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized. Emily started to show very symmetrical outflow, but the hurricane's strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center. However, the outer wind radii subsided in the end, and the inner core prevailed. The result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core {{on the evening of}} July19. The pressure dropped about 30millibars and the winds went from 90mph (145km/h) to more than 125mph (200km/h), all within a few hours.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on August 14, moved westward as a disorganized system, and passed through the Cape Verde islands on August 15. On August 17, a weak {{area of low pressure}} developed in the system about 750miles (1,200km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. Convection increased over the western portion of the wave axis, and the system began to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized on August 18 while located about 1,250miles (2,000km) east of the Lesser Antilles. However, convection around the system diminished on August 19, and later that day it began to move through the Lesser Antilles. Despite favorable upper-level winds and falling atmospheric pressures, there were initially no signs of a circulation at the surface. Convection again increased early on August 20, and it gradually became better organized. Based on a ship's wind report of the system, it is estimated the wave developed into Tropical Depression Nine on August 21 while located about 260miles (415km) south of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa between late August16 and early August17. On August 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the tropical wave as a potential area for development, associated with an area of disorganized convection about 300mi (480km) southwest of Cabo Verde. Environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for continued organization. Dry and stable air was an initial inhibiting factor in development, with deep convection waning on August20 and August21. However, the convection and circulation had <b>become</b> <b>better</b> defined by August21. By August23, the system had developed an elongated and poorly-defined circulation, as indicated by the Hurricane Hunters, though convention continued to expand. On the next day, the low pressure area crossed Guadeloupe into the Caribbean Sea while producing gale-force winds. By this point, the NHC noted that the system could develop into a tropical depression at any time, as the system was only lacking a well-defined circulation.|$|E

5|$|A weak surface trough of low {{pressure}} emerged into the northeast Gulf of Mexico on August 1. Under weak steering currents, the trough drifted westward, and slowly became better defined with {{the formation of}} a circulation in the mid- through upper-levels of the atmosphere. An upper-level low developed over Texas, providing unfavorable amounts of vertical wind shear. A surface circulation was first evident on satellite imagery on August 4 just off the coast of Mississippi, and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the Mississippi Sound. As the upper-level low over Texas drifted southwestward, an anticyclone developed over the system, with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned. On August 7, the system drifted into southeastern Louisiana. It continued to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized, and on August 8 it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of Lake Pontchartrain. This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a subtropical low, the cyclone tracked northeastward through Georgia, before turning eastward and exiting South Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean. Its track {{was influenced by}} the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, which is a large belt of high pressure. While moving over land, the cyclone had <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized, and on August 15 it transitioned into a tropical depression about 70 miles (110 kilometres) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The depression strengthened further, and based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, it intensified into Tropical Storm Charley late on August 15. With a weak ridge to its north, the storm initially tracked slowly eastward just off the coast of North Carolina, before turning to the north-northeast as a trough approached from the west. A broad cyclone, Charley gradually intensified, and a single ring of convection around the center developed into an eyewall. At 1200 UTC on August 17, it attained hurricane status about 13 mi (21 km) off the North Carolina coastline. About two hours later, Hurricane Charley made landfall near Cape Fear, and it subsequently moved across the eastern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. Early on August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), early on August19. By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating early on August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E

5|$|Barry {{then began}} a {{westerly}} course towards central Florida. However, wind shear began to increase, causing {{the system to}} weaken. The NHC downgraded the storm back to a tropical depression on August25. Barry made landfall near Melbourne, Florida the same morning with winds of 35mph (55km/h). After crossing Florida, the depression traveled towards the west-southwest due to a strong upper-level flow. On August27, Barry became sufficiently organized to be reclassified as a tropical storm while located in the central Gulf of Mexico. The re-strengthening {{was the result of}} decreased wind shear and more favorable conditions over the Gulf. The storm continued to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> organized as it traveled nearly due west towards Mexico. At 1200UTC the next day, Barry was upgraded to a hurricane while located about 75mi (120km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The hurricane continued to intensify until it made landfall about 35mi (55km) south-southeast of Brownsville at peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h). The storm quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated the next day over northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|By September 23, Jeanne {{had begun}} a slow westward motion, with its {{previously}} well-defined eye becoming ragged. It moved slowly over waters it traversed {{just four days}} prior, causing upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. As a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re-intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to dry air entrainment. However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye. Its favorable upper-level environment allowed the outflow to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> defined, with a large eye and nearby dry air being the primary restraining factors for development. At 1200UTC on September 25, Jeanne attained major hurricane status, and two hours later it made landfall on Abaco Island.|$|E
5|$|Despite the storm's {{intensification}} and well-organized satellite appearance, {{the circulation}} failed to <b>become</b> <b>better</b> defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned {{the potential for}} the system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi (37km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85mph (140km/h) early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with Iris extended only 25mi (35km) from its 16mi (22km) wide eye.|$|E
