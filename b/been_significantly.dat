Methods: ELISA was used to detect the peripheral blood PG level in patients confirmed with CAG, gastric polyps, and gastric cancer who were admitted in our hospital from January, 2015 to January, 2016. The normal individuals who came for physical examinations were served as the control group. The peripheral blood PG level in patients with various gastric diseases was observed. Results: The serum PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/PG Ⅱ in the gastritis group <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> lower {{than those in the}} gastric polyps group and control group, but <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than those in the gastric cancer group; while PG Ⅱ expression <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than that in the gastric polyps group and control group, but <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> lower than those in the gastric cancer group. PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ in the gastric polyps group <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than those in the gastritis group and gastric cancer group, while PG Ⅱ expression <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> lower than that in the gastritis group and gastric cancer group. PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ in the gastric cancer group <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> lower than those in the other three groups, while PG Ⅱ expression <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than that in the other three groups. The serum PG Ⅰ expression in patients with positive HP infection in the gastritis group and gastric cancer group <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than that in patients with negative HP infection, but the comparison of PG I/ PG Ⅱ was not statistically significant. The serum PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ in patients with negative and positive HP infection in the gastritis group <b>were</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than those in patients with negative and positive HP infection in the gastric cancer group; while PG Ⅱ expression <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> lower than that in the gastric cancer group.

40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} unilateral PIC and specific dentofacial parameters. Materials and methods A sample of 216 subjects, with 108 subjects in the retrospective and prospective samples respectively. Dental parameters: The following dental parameters were assessed: Inter-canine and intermolar width; palatal depth and palatal area; anterior Bolton tooth-size discrepancy (TSD); maxillary arch shape and ratio and maxillary central and lateral incisor shape and ratio. Facial parameters: Three-dimensional (3 D) images were taken for subjects in the prospective sample only, and {{were used to assess}} the following facial parameters: Face shape; face ratio and 3 D distances and angles.
