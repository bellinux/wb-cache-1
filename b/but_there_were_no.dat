5|$|After Betsy, {{two other}} hurricanes {{came close to}} being seeded. Hurricane Faith was {{considered}} a likely candidate, but it stayed {{out of range of}} the seeding planes. That same year, recon flights were conducted into Hurricane Inez, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E
5|$|Drifting {{near the}} northeastern Caribbean for several days, Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance brought prolonged rainfall to the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, triggering widespread flooding and numerous mudslides.

5|$|Valiant {{was paid}} off in 1885, and she was {{assigned}} to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment in 1897, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> takers so the ship was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze.|$|E

The creek's nitrate concentration ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 milligrams per liter for filtered water and the concentration of sulfates ranged from 23 to 29 milligrams per liter, again for filtered water. The concentration of chlorides in the creek's filtered waters ranged from 7 to 23 milligrams per liter. The calcium and magnesium concentrations in filtered water were 20 to 44 and 4.4 to 6 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November was the North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur. After 20 minutes, Tottenham were 2–0 {{up after}} goals from Steffen Iversen and Tim Sherwood. Vieira scored for Arsenal from a header, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> further {{goals in the}} game. In the second half Ljungberg was sent off, as was Keown in {{stoppage}} time, to reduce Arsenal to nine men.

5|$|Artillery {{may have}} been {{installed}} at Gun Hill on the coast near Burnham Overy during the Napoleonic wars, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> modern fortifications in north Norfolk {{at the start of}} World War I. Following the German naval attack on Great Yarmouth in November 1914, defences such as trenches, concrete pillboxes and gun batteries were constructed along much of the Norfolk coast. The main bases were outside the SSSI boundaries, but Thornham Marsh was used between 1914 and 1918 by the Royal Flying Corps as a bombing range. A World War I concrete building on Titchwell's west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the British Army returned in 1942; some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period.|$|E

5|$|In Kansas, a bow echo {{caused some}} {{localized}} significant damage {{in and around}} the Wichita Metropolitan Area with the most significant damage at the International Cold Storage located in the Andover area where the peak winds were measured. Overall, over 400 wind reports in the US alone, were reported on both October 17 and 18 across the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Great Lakes with several reports of damage <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> direct non-tornadic fatalities.

5|$|In North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch {{due to the}} large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend.

High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> deaths, injuries, or damage from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour reached Nîmes, near the {{home town of}} Payan, whose fans were angry because of his disqualification. They threw rocks at the riders, and barricaded the road. The cyclists had {{troubles}} passing through Nîmes, and several were injured. The most important event for the general classification was when César Garin's bicycle was broken by attackers; {{he had to find}} a new bicycle, which took him 15 minutes. Further on, nails and broken glass were spread along the road. Many riders punctured, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> serious falls. The cyclists passed this part walking. After Nîmes, a leading group of five cyclists was formed: Maurice Garin, Pothier, Aucouturier, Cornet and Beaugendre.
