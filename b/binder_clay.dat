40|$|International audienceThis work {{describes}} the electro-assisted generation of clay-mesoporous silica composite films onto glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). The method involved the deposition of clay particles by spin-coating on GCE {{and the subsequent}} growing of a surfactant-templated silica matrix around these particles by electro-assisted self-assembly (EASA). EASA typically consisted in applying a cathodic potential to the electrode immersed into a hydrolyzed sol (containing tetraethoxysilane, TEOS, as the silica source, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB, as surfactant) in order to generate the necessary hydroxyl catalysts inducing {{the formation of the}} mesoporous silica. In such conditions, alongside the silica deposition process, the inter-layer distance between the clay sheets was found to increase as a result of CTAB ion exchange. After removal of the surfactant template, the composite film became highly porous (i. e., to redox probes) and the clay recovered its pristine interlayer distance and cation exchange properties. This made it promising for application in preconcentration electroanalysis, as pointed out here using copper(II) as a model analyte, especially because it offered much better long-term operational stability than the conventional (i. e., without silica <b>binder)</b> <b>clay</b> film electrode...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} cost, efficiency and environmental pressures ferrochrome producers strive towards lower overall energy consumption. Increases in local electricity prices have placed particular pressure on South African ferrochrome producers. Pelletised chromite pre–reduction is likely the currently applied ferrochrome production process option with the lowest specific electricity consumption. In this process fine chromite, together with a carbonaceous reductant and a <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> is milled, pelletised and pre–reduced. In this dissertation it is demonstrated that {{the functioning of the}} <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> in this process is not as straightforward as in conventional metallurgical pelletisation processes, since the cured pre–reduced pellets are characterised by an oxidised outer layer and a pre–reduced core. Conventional performance characteristics of <b>clay</b> <b>binders</b> (e. g. compressive strength and abrasion resistance) therefore have to be evaluated in both oxidative sintering and reducing environments. Two clay samples, i. e. attapulgite and bentonite, were obtained from a local ferrochrome producer and investigated within the context of this study. Results indicated that the compressive and abrasion resistance strengths of oxidative sintered pellets for both clays were substantially better than that of pre–reduced pellets. Thus, although the objective of the chromite pre–reduced process is to achieve maximum pre–reduction, the strength of pre–reduced chromite pellets is significantly enhanced by the thin oxidised outer layer. The strength of the bentonite–containing pellets was found to be superior in both pre–reducing and oxidative sintering environments. This is significant, since the attapulgite clay is currently the preferred option at both South African ferrochrome smelting plants applying the pelletised chromite pre–reduction process. Although not quantitatively investigated, thermo–mechanical analysis indicated that the hot strength of the attapulgite pellets could be weaker than the bentonite–containing pellets. The possible effects of <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> selection on the level of pre–reduction were also investigated, since it could have substantial efficiency and economic implications. For both case study clays investigated, higher clay contents resulted in lower pre–reduction levels. This has relevance within the industrial process, since higher clay contents are on occasion utilised to achieve improved green strength. The average pre–reduction of the bentonite–containing pellets were also consistently higher than that of the attapulgite–containing pellets. Again, this is significant, since the attapulgite clay is currently the preferred option. In general the case study results presented in this dissertation indicated that {{it is unlikely that the}} performance of a specific <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> in this relatively complex process can be predicted; based only on the chemical, surface chemical and mineralogical characterisation of the clay.

In {{the case of}} self-hardening moulding sands with synthetic binders those requirements apply mainly to sand, which adds to more than 98 % of the whole moulding sand mixture.

As a part of this study, the effect of sand quality on bending strength Rgu and thermal deformation of self-hardening moulding sands with furfural and alkyd resin was assessed. Moulding sands with furfural resin are known [1] to be the most susceptible to the sand quality. A negative effect on its properties has, among others, high content of <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> and so-called subgrains (fraction smaller than 0, 1 mm), which can lead to neutralization of acidic hardeners (in the case of moulding sands with furfuryl resin) and also increase the specific surface, what forces greater amount of binding agents.

However, during the hydrothermal conditions of commercial FCC unit, {{about half of}} the starting zeolite is destroyed and becomes part of the matrix [13]. The overall matrix composition during use is formed by the solid-state reactions of all the non-zeolitic components. Besides the mechanical properties in fluidized state, the matrix added must to a certain extent improve bottom oil cracking, impart metals resistance or provide specialized functions such as lowering sulfur content in gasoline. Commercially, active components based on specialty aluminas are incorporated into most fluid cracking catalysts for increasing the matrix surface area and matrix acidity necessary to precrack the larger molecules into smaller ones that can then enter the pores of the zeolite. The active components also increase the pore volume of the catalyst and allow faster diffusion of resid molecules. The surface area, pore volume and thermal stability of the alumina are important for coke selectivity, bottoms cracking and metal tolerance, as well as to passivate the nickel and vanadium [14, 15]. In addition, clay may be incorporated as matrix or balance of the formulated catalysts and has certain similar functions such as precracking and mechanical strength.|$|R

Structure 180 is proposed to have been a drying oven, as evidenced by: (1) its phase associations, pointing to maximum firing temperatures of c. 950 – 1050 °C, and (2) its unusual shape. Six out of seven clays from the artisan quarter revealed Ca-rich composition, but the Ca-poor one was preferentially used by Roman potters for bricks and <b>clay</b> <b>binders</b> to build the two structures. Such “refractory” clays are obviously better suited to withstand higher firing temperatures and for a longer period than Ca-rich clays...|$|R
5000|$|Guidance {{based on}} South Dakota LTAP Special Bulletin #29 and FHWA {{guidance}} (2000) {{from the same}} source suggests that the surface gravel [...] "should be a blend of stone, sand and fines that will compact into a dense, tight mass with an almost impervious surface." [...] It emphasizes the proper gradation of gravel—100% passing the 0.75 in) sieve—to have fractured stone to [...] "interlock" [...] and 4-15% fines passing the #200 (75-μm) sieve {{to act as a}} binder and create cohesiveness in the gravel; substituting other <b>binders,</b> such as <b>clay</b> is also recommended. Alternately, one can incorporate reclaimed asphalt in a half-and-half blend with quarried gravel to improve the binding properties of the surface. For existing washboarded surfaces, the bulletin recommends using a grader to cut and blend existing material to a depth one inch or more below the bottom of the washboarded segment and then add the new material into the top layer. Useful equipment includes a blade with rotating scarifying teeth or a replaceable bit-type cutting edge attached to the moldboard blade of the earth-moving equipment.|$|R
40|$|Foundry sand is an {{industrial}} material {{generated by the}} metal-casting industry, which uses the sand to form a physical mold used {{in the production of}} metal products. Two general types of sand are used in metal casting: clay-bonded sand (green sand); and chemically-bonded sand: Green sand is composed of naturally occurring materials that are blended together: high quality silica sand; bentonite clay as a binder; a carbonaceous additive to improve the casting surface finish; and water. Due to the carbon content, green sand is actually black in color and adheres together due to the clay and water content. Green sand molds comprise about 90 percent of the casting volume in the United States. Chemically-bonded sand does not employ a <b>clay</b> <b>binder.</b> Instead, chemical binders are used to cause the sand to hold its shape during the introduction of the molten metal into the mold and the cooling of the casting. Chemically-bonded sand is generally light in color and coarser in texture than clay bonded sand, and accounts for only 10 percent of casting volume in the United States. Foundries use chemically-bonded sand in core-making, where high strengths are necessary to withstand the heat of the molten metal (FIRSTb). After multiple uses in castings, the sand becomes unsuitable for castings and is either disposed o...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the easy}} {{availability}} of wood in Ethiopia, wood charcoal {{has been the}} main source fuel for cooking. This study has been started on sesame stalk biomass briquetting which can potentially solve the health problems and shortage of energy, which consequently can solve deforestation. The result of the data collection shows that, using 30 % conversion efficiency of carbonizer, {{it was found that}} more than 150, 000 tonnes of charcoal can be produced from the available sesame stalk in Humera, a place in north Ethiopia. The <b>clay</b> <b>binders</b> that are mixed with carbonized sesame stalk were found to have 69 liquid limits; thus, the optimum amount of clay that should be added as a binder is 15 %, which results in better burning and heat holding capacity and better heating time. The developed briquetting machine has a capacity of producing 60 [*]Kg/hr but the carbonization kiln can only carbonize 3. 1 [*]Kg in 2 [*]:[*] 40 hours; hence, it is a bottle neck for the briquette production. The hydrocarbon laboratory analysis showed that the calorific value of the charcoal produced with 15 % clay content is 4647. 75 [*]Cal/gm and decreases as clay ratio increases and is found to be sufficient energy content for cooking...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines, in {{cooperation}} with three Minnesota agencies (Department of Natural Resources, Geological Survey, and the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board), investigated the potential of using glacial lake clay from Minnesota, {{as well as other}} areas, as a binder for iron ore pellets. The best clay-characterizing procedures for predicting binder effectiveness were the cation exchange capacity (CEC) using the methylene blue method and the plate water absorption test (PWAT). The best <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> was found in the Red River Valley. However, compared to a typical western bentonite at the 0. 5 -pct-addition level, addition of about 2 pct Minnesota clay was required to obtain comparable unfired (green) pellet strengths. Soda ash addition only slightly improved the binding properties of Minnesota clay, but considerable improvement was obtained by the addition of a small quantity of water absorbing organic compounds. For example, with a mixture of 0. 5 pct Minnesota clay or paint rock and 0. 1 pct pregelatinized starch, the unfired and fired physical pellet properties were about the same as with 0. 5 pct of typical western bentonite. The reduction rate at the 40 -pct reduction level and the percentage of plus 6. 3 -mm particles from the reduction disintegration index test were also about the same...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption {{offers an}} {{efficient}} technology for removing {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from air pollution sources. Often activated carbons (ACs) are employed owing to their large specific surface areas, high micropore volumes, rapid adsorption capabilities and selectivity towards organic molecules compared to water vapour or air. However, when large volumes of gas are to be treated pressure drop limitations may arise {{from the use of}} conventional powder adsorption beds. For these applications conformation of the activated carbon as open channel honeycomb monoliths {{can take advantage of the}} almost null pressure drop caused by these structures. Similarly, conformation as extrudates or tubes although increasing the pressure drop due to the turbulent gas flow can improve any diffusion limitations that the open channel monoliths can suffer. Conformation of the AC as a ceramic composite also improves the handling characteristics. By the use of a silicate <b>clay</b> <b>binder</b> a commercially available AC, was conformed in three different monolithic geometries; changing the channel width and the wall thicknesses and as solid extrudates and tubes. The textural and mechanical properties of these conformed composite structures were determined and the results analysed along with their dynamic adsorption capacities towards toluene at 30 C, used as a probe molecule to establish criteria by which the most suitable structure for industrial use could be selected.
