40|$|Experimentally {{we explore}} the {{potential}} of using pre-defined motion of a receding contact line to control the deposition of nanoparticles from suspension. Stripe-patterned wettability gradients are employed, which consist of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic stripes with increasing macroscopic surface energy. Nanoparticle suspensions containing nanorods and nanospheres are deposited onto these substrates and left to dry. After moving over the pattern and evaporation of the solvent, characteristic nanoparticle deposits are found. The liquid dynamics has a pronounced effect on the spatial distribution. Nanoparticles do not deposit on the hydrophobic regions; there is high preference to deposit on the wetting stripes. Moreover, the fact that distributed nanoparticle islands are formed suggests that the receding of the contact line occurs in a stick-slip like fashion. Furthermore, the formation of liquid <b>bridges</b> <b>covering</b> multiple stripes during motion of the droplet over the patterns is modeled. We discuss their origin and show that the residue after drying, containing both nanoparticles and the stabilizing surfactant, also resembles such dynamics.

There is a continuing argument about {{the main cause of}} the premature deterioration of structures containing reinforced concrete, these range from inadequate specification, poor design and detailing, poor workmanship and aggressive environment. By far the biggest cause of deterioration is the corrosion of the steel reinforcement, with its expansive byproducts that result in the cracking and spilling of concrete and can ultimately cause total service life failure of the structure if not checked and remedied. Maintenance engineers face an ever ending problem of when is the optimum time to intervene and rehabilitate a deteriorated structural element or whole structure.

40|$|There {{are many}} wooden bridges in the United States. Their decks are often built of timber beams nailed {{together}} {{and covered with}} asphalt. The asphalt plays a mechanical role, and it provides environmental protection for the wood deck. The asphalt layer deteriorates and requires replacement. That leads to a faster deterioration of the deck, increased maintenance, and shorter bridge life. The flexibility of the deck is a probable cause of the fast deterioration of the asphalt. Low temperatures lead to deformations of the deck and may lead to cracks, which are propagated by mechanical and environmental effects. This project investigates stiffening the bridge deck by connecting a beam perpendicularly to the deck planks with metal bolts to reduce deformations of the deck. The additional beam is called a Transverse Stiffener Beam (or TSB). It can be incorporated {{as a part of}} new bridges or be attached to existing bridges. The investigations show the TSB significantly reduces deformations of the deck in most cases. The study indicates the positive effects of the TSB's should be expected in other applications. The magnitude of the effects can be analyzed with the computer program developed during this project. An investigation of the use of Transverse Stiffener Beams (TSB) for use on new and existing wooden bridges to reduce deformations of bridge decks, thus prolonging the life of asphalt <b>bridge</b> <b>coverings,</b> was undertaken.

40|$|Stonecutters Bridge of Hong Kong is a {{cable-stayed}} bridge with two single-column pylons each 298 m high and an aerodynamic twin deck. The total {{length of the}} bridge is 1596 m with a main span of 1018 m. The top 118 m of the tower will comprise structural steel and concrete composite while the bottom part will be of reinforced concrete. The bridge deck at the central span will be of steel whilst the side spans will be of concrete. Stonecutters Bridge has adopted a twin-girder deck design with a wide clear separation of 14. 3 m between the two longitudinal girders. Although {{a number of studies}} have been conducted to investigate the aerodynamic performance of twin-girder deck, the actual real life application of this type of deck is extremely limited. This therefore triggered the need for conducting the present studies, the main objective of which is to investigate the performance of Stonecutters Bridge against flutter at its in-service stage as well as during construction. Based on the flutter derivatives obtained from the 1 : 80 scale rigid section model experiment, flutter analysis was carried out using 3 -D finite element based single parameter searching method developed by the second author of this paper. A total of 6 finite element models of the <b>bridge</b> <b>covering</b> the in-service stage as well as 5 construction stages were established. The dynamic characteristics of the bridge associated with these stages were computed and applied in the analyses.

40|$|Background The {{formation}} of a hard-tissue <b>bridge</b> <b>covering</b> the tooth extraction socket is termed corticalization. In dogs this process takes > 60 d, however, this process has hardly been investigated in humans. Recent reports have indicated increased primary implant stability and reduced bone strain after immediate implant loading {{in the presence of}} a (thick) cortical layer, thus, knowledge of the timeframe between tooth extraction and hard-tissue bridging of the extraction socket appears clinically relevant in some situations. Aim/Hypothesis To determine the timeframe between tooth extraction and radiographically detectable corticalization of the socket in humans and to evaluate the possible impact of various factors on this process, e. g., history of periodontitis, smoking status, systemic disease, medications, etc. Material and Methods Two-hundred-fifty patients with a CT scan μ 8804, 36 months after tooth extraction and without any manipulation at the extraction site were included. Three orthoradial multiplanar reconstruction slices per extraction socket were scored, by a single calibrated examiner, regarding the degree of corticalization as: (a) healed, i. e., complete/continuous corticalization of the socket entrance, or (b) non-healed. Thereafter, each extraction socket was classified as (1) non-corticalized, i. e., all 3 slices classified as non-healed, (2) partially corticalized, i. e., 1 or 2 slices classified as non-healed, or (3) corticalized, i. e., all 3 slices classified as healed (Figure 1). The possible effect of several independent parameters, i. e., age, gender, timeframe between tooth extraction and CT scan, tooth type, periodontal status, gap dimension, smoking status, presence of any systemic disease, and medication intake, on the corticalization status was statistically evaluated. Results Three to 6 months after tooth extraction, 27 % of the sockets were judged as non-corticalized, and 53 % were judged as partially corticalized. After 9 to 12 months, > 80 % of the sockets were corticalized, but some non-corticalized sockets were detected up to 15 months post-extraction (Figure 2). Each additional month after tooth extraction contributed significantly to higher likelihood of a corticalized socket (OR 1. 645, 95 % CIs 1. 471 – 1. 841, P < 0. 001). Periodontal attachment loss of μ 8805, 75 % significantly prolonged corticalization time, i. e., teeth with < 75 % attachment loss were judged more often as corticalized (OR 1. 984, 95 % CIs 1. 011 – 3. 896, P = 0. 047). No other independent variable had a significant effect on corticalization status. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Three to 6 months after tooth extraction one out of 4 sockets was still completely non corticalized, and only 9 to 12 months after tooth extraction complete corticalization was observed in about 80 % of the sockets. The results, indicating a considerably long timeframe until corticalization of extraction sockets, imply that in cases where immediate loading requiring high primary implant stability is considered, waiting μ 8805, 9 months post-extraction appears advisable...|$|E
40|$|Concrete is the {{backbone}} of any developed economy. Concrete can suffer from {{a large number of}} deleterious effects including physical, chemical and biological causes. Large owning bridge structures organizations are facing very serious questions when asking for maintenance budgets. The questions range from needing to justify the need for the work, its urgency, to also have to predict or show the consequences of delayed rehabilitation of a particular structure. There is therefore a need for a probabilistic model that can estimate the range of service lives of bridge populations and also the likelihood of level of deteriorations it can reached for every incremental time interval. A model was developed for such estimation based on statistical data from actual inspection records of a large reinforced concrete bridge portfolio. The method used both deterministic and stochastic methods to predict the service life of a bridge, using these service lives in combination with the just in time (JIT) principle of management would enable maintenance managers to justify the need for action and the budgets needed, to intervene at the optimum time {{in the life of the}} structure and that of the deterioration. The paper will report on the model which is based on a large database of deterioration records of concrete <b>bridges</b> <b>covering</b> a period of over 60 years and include data from over 400 bridge structures.
