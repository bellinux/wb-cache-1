40|$|The {{field of}} bridge {{monitoring}} {{is one of}} rapid development. Advances in sensor technologies, in data communication and processing algorithms all affect the possibilities of Structural Monitoring in Bridges. Bridges are a very critical part of a country’s infrastructure, they are expensive to build and maintain, and many uncertainties surround important factors determining their serviceability and deterioration state. As such, bridges are good candidates for monitoring. Monitoring can extend the service life and avoid or postpone replacement, repair or strengthening works. The amount of resources saved, both to the owner and the users, by {{reducing the amount of}} non-operational time can easily justify the extra investment in monitoring. This thesis consists of an extended summary and five appended papers. The thesis presents advances in sensor technology, damage identification algorithms, Bridge Weigh-In-Motion systems, and other techniques used in bridge monitoring. Four case studies are presented. In the first paper, a fully operational Bridge Weigh-In-Motion system is developed and deployed in a steel railway bridge. The gathered data was studied to obtain a characterization of the site specific traffic. In the second paper, the seasonal variability of a <b>ballasted</b> railway <b>bridge</b> is studied and characterized in its natural variability. In the third, the non-linear characteristic of a <b>ballasted</b> railway <b>bridge</b> is studied and described stochastically. In the fourth, a novel damage detection algorithm based in Bridge Weigh-In-Motion data and machine learning algorithms is presented and tested on a numerical experiment. In the fifth, a bridge and traffic monitoring system is implemented in a suspension bridge to study the cause of unexpected wear in the bridge bearings. Some of the major scientific contributions of this work are: 1) the development of a B-WIM for railway traffic capable of estimating the load on individual axles; 2) the characterization of in-situ measured railway traffic in Stockholm, with axle weights and train configuration; 3) the quantification of a hitherto unreported environmental behaviour in <b>ballasted</b> <b>bridges</b> and possible mechanisms for its explanation (this behaviour was shown to be of great importance for monitoring of bridges located in colder climate) 4) the statistical quantification of the nonlinearities of a railway bridge and its yearly variations and 5) the integration of B-WIM data into damage detection techniques.   QC 20140910 </p...|$|R
50|$|Track {{was often}} lightly laid, {{limiting}} axle-loading to 4.25 or 5 tonnes. On well-drained land, sand, gravel, cinders or {{a mix of}} the three was sometimes used instead of normal <b>ballast.</b> Rail <b>bridges</b> were simple and tracks followed the lines of roads, paths, or rivers where possible to keep civil engineering to a minimum. Specially designed branch line coaches (Lokalbahnwagen) were produced from the 1890s onwards, initially in green livery with white outlines. These lasted well into the 1960s. On {{some of the more}} robust lines, wooden or steel 'thunderboxes' were used from the 1930s onwards, and even former main line six-wheelers were cascaded to some branches.|$|R

40|$|Present {{codes are}} mostly {{written for the}} design of new structures. When {{assessing}} existing structures it is possible to ascertain actual properties and to use them instead of using very conservative estimates. Possible reinforcement fatigue damage can e. g. be assessed with partial damage methods {{in the same way as}} is done for steel structures and with similar failure stresses. - The definition of a load cycle depends on the structure and what part of it that is studied. For <b>ballasted</b> <b>bridges</b> often two bogies for adjacent wagons can be identified as one load cycle. For the highest stress ranges often a whole train can be looked upon as one load cycle. The influence of earlier traffic can be checked with a damage hypothesis. - Material properties. The concrete capacity is often underestimated, especially its capacity to carry shear forces in slabs without stirrups. For stirrups usually no reduction normally needs to be considered of the stress range capacity due to bending of the bars. This is true as long as the cracks in concrete crossing the bars are not situated in the corners of the cross sections- Dynamic factors can often be reduced from the ones obtained from standard code values after an evaluations and/or measurement on the structure in question. - The need for closed stirrups and reductions of capacity due to splicing of reinforcement bars can be reduced if the reinforcement is fully bonded as e. g. when it is situated in compressed concrete. - More research is needed to calibrate design and assessment methods to real full scale tests on bridges. Here new measurement technology makes it possible to check real strain and stress ranges, which may be considerably smaller than the ones obtained from conservative design models. - Recommendations for assessment procedures are given in Appendix A. Examples of assessments of two concrete trough bridges are presented in Appendix B (Övre Bredån) and Appendix C (Kallkällan). Godkänd; 2015; 20150215 (elfgren) </p...|$|R
50|$|The Biloxi Bay Bridge is {{a bridge}} in the U.S. state of Mississippi which carries U.S. Route 90 (US 90) over Biloxi Bay between Biloxi and Ocean Springs. Though the <b>bridge's</b> <b>ballast</b> and {{accompanying}} railroad track was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the structure remained and subsequently underwent major repairs. It reopened to traffic on November 1, 2007. The span carries 6 lanes of traffic {{as well as a}} 12 ft path for pedestrians and bicyclists on the Gulf side of the bridge.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{two aspects}} {{concerning}} {{the influence of}} the ballast on vibrations of railway bridges. The first one is the additional stiffness due to the ballast.  For that, a special finite beam element with a non-linear longitudinal stiffness associated to the slip at the interface between the <b>ballast</b> and the <b>bridge</b> is implemented and used to calculate vertical accelerations during and after the passage of a train. The second one is the load distribution of the axle loads through the ballast. To investigate this, a parametric study is carried out on a two dimensional model with plane elements. Based on this load distribution, different load shapes are created, which are used in dynamic analyses in Matlab on three different bridge models. The conclusions are that a linear and a bi-linear longitudinal stiffness at the interface give similar maximum accelerations. Moreover, the critical train velocities are increased with the additional stiffness of the ballast. The study also shows thatdistributed loads, in general, lowers the maximum accelerations, especially on short bridges...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{critical}} responses of a bridge including resonances in high-speed (HS) railway is a dominant issue {{in order to}} confirm the structural safety of bridge and the stability of <b>ballast</b> on <b>bridge</b> deck. In numerical way for critical assessment, {{it is important to}} make a sophisticated numerical model and considering the variation of actual properties of structural members. This study proposed a train-track-bridge interaction model focusing on Sesia viaduct, and calibrated the model properties as matching these modal characteristics and dynamic responses to measured ones. By the numerical and experimental comparison, calibrated model could reproduce accelerations up to 30 Hz both of on the time and frequency domains accurately. Especially, good agreements on sleeper accelerations can indicate the high reproducibility of interaction force, which is one of key factors of train-track-bridge interaction simulation. Numerical computation by calibrated model clarified that the deck acceleration up to 30 Hz increases by seventh and eighth resonances between passing vehicle length and structural modes, not only global third bending or third torsional but also high order local deck modes. In addition, high performance computing technique based on super computer in RTRI was adopted for parametric analysis in order to investigate the requirements to realize highly accurate estimation for the maximum deck acceleration by the numerical way. As the results of parametric study focusing on design assumption, calculation modal order and train/bridge interaction, it was clarified that the design model causes overestimation by twice maximum acceleration on the deck, and the amplification of excitation forces caused by passage on deflected rails, which is considered in high-order modes and train/bridge interaction, is a key factor to achieve accurate deck acceleration evaluation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} thesis, the Banafjäl Bridge {{located on the}} Bothnia line (Botniabanan) in {{northern}} Sweden was studied. The bridge is a 40 m long composite <b>ballasted</b> high-speed railway <b>bridge.</b> A 3 D FE model of the bridge was developed using a commercial FE software, Abaqus. The FE model was calibrated against the measured data of the bridge. The dynamic response of the bridge's FE model was investigated under the dynamic load of the passing HSLM-A train using modal dynamic analysis. The vertical acceleration induced by excitation of the passing train exceeded the permissible limit of 3. 5 m/s 2 for the speed range of 220 - 240 km/h. Thus, damping solutions using multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) were investigated. According {{to the results of}} this study, a 4 tonnes MTMD system consist of 5 parallel TMDs attached to the mid-span of the bridge could effectively control the undesired vibration of the bridge. The suggested solution could account for the changes in the stiffness of the bridge caused by freezing and ice forming in the ballast...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the adaptability to short-term climate variability and extreme events of existing infrastructures in Australia, especially railway track bridges. The main {{objective of this}} research was to analyse the interaction between the track and bridge under elevated temperatures. The scope of work was to evaluate the behaviour of the track and bridge interaction throughout temperature ranges experienced in summer periods whereas the expansion and contraction of materials are different in nature. This investigation was emphasised on the differential longitudinal behaviours of railway track and bridge structure. A nonlinear 3 D finite element model of a railway <b>bridge</b> (<b>ballast</b> top) was developed using a commercial software program, ABAQUS. This study also highlights the differences in mechanical properties of steel rails, concrete, high density polyethylene and ballast aggregates through the life cycles. These mechanical properties were considered within a nominated temperature range between 20 ˚C and 100 ˚C. A field measurement of longitudinal displacements has been used for FE model validation. The results of the displacements from finite element models were reasonably in good agreement with the field measurement. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to highlight the structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{constitutive}} {{behavior of}} geosynthetic-reinforced soil masses under repeated loading {{is not yet}} fully understood. Cyclic loading conditions occur due to traffic in transportation infrastructures such as reinforced unpaved (access) and paved roads, roadway and railway embankments, railway <b>ballast,</b> and <b>bridge</b> abutments. Due {{to the lack of}} knowledge on the cyclic response of geosynthetic-reinforced materials, a detailed investigation is described in this dissertation. The testing program consists of direct shear tests on the soil-geotextile interface, as well as monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests on the reinforced soil and on the geotextiles in-isolation. A silty material is used for the baseline case. Scale effects are investigated by testing 150 mm (62 ̆ 2) diameter specimens in addition to the baseline 70 mm (2. 82 ̆ 2). Test results indicate that significant improvement in strength is achieved due to the inclusion of geosynthetics. When loaded monotonically, the reinforced soil shows continuous increase in strength with increasing strain level. Under cyclic loading, the permanent deformation corresponding to a constant peak load depends on the reinforcement spacing, the load amplitude, the soil-geotextile interface properties, the specimen size, and to a much lesser extent on the reinforcement modulus. Visual observation and numerical analyses suggest that the effect of the geotextile modulus on the response is insignificant for both monotonic and cyclic cases. Close examination of the reinforced specimens after the tests indicate that more sliding occurs at the interface under cyclic conditions, which implies that {{a large portion of the}} interface strength is mobilized. Three analytical models are developed to interpret the test results. Two of them are based on strain normalization concepts, and account for scale effects. The third method relates the number of cycles to the cyclic and monotonic stresses at a given strain. Numerical modeling of the reinforced soil specimens allows for better understanding of the actual state of stress within the soil and along the interface. The analytical models, together with the numerical analysis provide a useful tool for analysis and design of geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures subjected to monotonic and repeated loading. ...|$|R
