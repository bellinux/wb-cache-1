5|$|On April 19, 1969, {{during a}} parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society {{took over the}} student union building, Willard Straight Hall. The {{takeover}} was precipitated by increasing racial tension at {{the university and the}} students' frustration with the administration's lack of support for a <b>black</b> <b>studies</b> program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of racism.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{attended}} Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) {{and then}} the City College of New York (CCNY) in the mid-1960s, where {{she was involved in}} many political activities, protests, and sit-ins. She was arrested for the first time—with 100 other BMCC students—in 1967, on charges of trespassing. The students had chained and locked the entrance to a college building to protest low numbers of black faculty and the absence of a <b>black</b> <b>studies</b> program. In April 1967 she married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY. The married life ended within a year; they divorced in December 1970. Shakur's marriage receives one paragraph in her memoir, she wrote that it ended over their differing views of gender roles.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Sanford became {{president}} of Duke University, a position he held for the next 16 years. That helped quell student unrest over the Vietnam War early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding {{the creation of a}} <b>Black</b> <b>Studies</b> program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, when school officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy police action which helped defuse racial tensions.|$|E

25|$|Students at some campuses became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} university's and Board of Higher Education's handling of university administration. At Baruch College in 1967, over a thousand students protested the plan to make the college an upper-division school limited to junior, senior, and graduate students. At Brooklyn College in 1968, students attempted a sit-in to demand the admission of more black and Puerto Rican students and additional <b>black</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum. Students at Hunter College also demanded a <b>Black</b> <b>studies</b> program. Members of the SEEK program, which provided academic support for underprepared and underprivileged students, staged a building takeover at Queens College in 1969 to protest {{the decisions of the}} program's director, who would later be replaced by a black professor. Puerto Rican students at Bronx Community College filed a report with the New York State Division of Human Rights in 1970, contending that the intellectual level of the college was inferior and discriminatory. Hunter College was crippled for several days by a protest of 2,000 students who had a list of demands focusing on more student representation in college administration. Across CUNY, students boycotted their campuses in 1970 to protest a rise in student fees and other issues, including the proposed (and later implemented) open admissions plan.|$|E

25|$|Between 1966 and 1968, Northwestern {{increased}} African American enrollments {{from less}} than 50 to 160. After the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, African American students on campus began expressing increasingly militant and separatist views demanding the administration increase recruitment activity and provide separate facilities for black students. After the university rejected their demands, on May 3, 1968 a group of 100 African American students identifying themselves as For Members Only and the Afro-American Student Union barricaded themselves the Bursar's Office and began a sit-in, demanding the university implement an admissions quota, increase financial aid, construct an all-black dorm and student center, create a <b>Black</b> <b>Studies</b> curriculum, and desegregate the university's real estate holdings in Evanston. In light of controversy surrounding the student protests at Columbia and Berkeley that spring, negotiations between Dean of Students Roland Hinz and AASU leader James Turner led to the sit-in dispersing peacefully after 38 hours. Although the administration rejected demands for racial preferences in admissions and financial aid, it made several concessions regarding desegregation, increasing student participation in policy matters, and developing a Department of African-American Studies.|$|E

500|$|Cornell had {{enrolled}} African-American {{students by}} the mid-1880s. On December 4, 1906, Alpha Phi Alpha, the first Greek letter fraternity for African-Americans was founded at Cornell. Cornell {{had a very}} low black enrollment until the 1960s, when it formed the Committee on Special Educational Projects (COSEP) to recruit and mentor minority students. [...] In 1969, Cornell established its Africana Studies and Research Center, {{one of the first}} such <b>black</b> <b>studies</b> programs in the Ivy League. On April 1, 1970, during a period of heightened racial tension, the building that housed the Africana Studies center burned down. Since 1972, Ujamaa, a special interest program dormitory located in North Campus Low Rise No. 10, provides housing for many minority students.

In their article [...] "Naughty girls and red-blooded women: Representations of female heterosexuality in music video", published in Feminist Media Studies, Diane Railton and Paul Watson made specific note of the conflicting message raised by the lyrics [...] "all my girls around the world", while [...] "blackness and whiteness are clearly inscribed on and through the bodies of Aguilera and Kim." [...] They suggested that this example detracted the message of the track by emphasizing the problem that [...] "female heterosexuality" [...] is confined to [...] "the very limited range of ways" [...] in mainstream culture, in this instance [...] "gender and race [...] sexual behaviour".|$|E
