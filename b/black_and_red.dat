5|$|The {{original}} home jersey was white with <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> stripes. The original 'away' jersey was black, with {{white and red}} trim. Shoulder patches used a winged 'S' 'established MDCCCXCIV' (1894) logo. The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey. The club would use the white jersey with the original logo {{until the end of}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

The codex was written by eight different scribes, who all had their own writing style, glyph designs, and subject matter.|$|E
5|$|The pre-release of the 2014 album 5. The Gray Chapter also {{witnessed}} {{a major change}} in the band’s logo and branding strategy. A new nonagram drew the public’s attention towards the band, announcing {{the beginning of a new}} era. The <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> color scheme and the minimalist, elegant design received public appreciation and it is still used today.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} {{utilized}} two color palettes {{prior to its}} current color scheme. The original colors, used from 1978 to 1998, consisted of red, white, and blue. From 1998 to 2014, the Sounds used a <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> palette similar to the club's current colors.

5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in both <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
5|$|These {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} different varieties of ceramics such as <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> ware, rouletted ware and Russet coated ware, both locally made and imported kinds. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions on them, which have provided additional {{evidence for the}} archaeologist to date them. Other artifacts such as brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, remains of seeds and shells provide clues {{about the nature of}} the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in the material records of Tamilakam are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E

5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Persian Armenia was {{annexed to}} the Russian Empire {{after the last}} Russo-Persian War, and became known as Russian Armenia. When the Russian Empire collapsed, Russian Armenia {{declared}} its independence and joined the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, together with Georgia and Azerbaijan. This unified state hardly lasted a year and was soon dissolved. Since the Republic was short-lived, it did not use any flags or symbols. Nevertheless, some historians consider a horizontal gold, <b>black,</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> tricolor, {{similar to that of}} the German flag but arranged differently, to have been the flag of Transcaucasia. The federation was dissolved on May 26, 1918, when Georgia declared its independence as the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared their independence two days later, on May 28, 1918, as the First Republic of Armenia and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} of the battalion's establishment overseas resulted in {{the situation of the}} battalion's personnel being issued two different Unit Colour Patches (UCP). Personnel who were in the United Kingdom at the end of 1940 were issued with a circular UCP consisting of black over red, with a border of grey. However, this UCP was issued without reference to Army Headquarters in Australia, who issued battalion reinforcements in Australia with a UCP consisting of an upright brown and yellow rectangle inside a grey circle: this was intended to link the battalion to the 31st Battalion, which had served during World War I. Upon arrival in the Middle East, though, these patches were replaced with the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> patches.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{literature}} was produced {{on a variety}} of media. Along with the chisel, necessary for making inscriptions on stone, the chief writing tool of ancient Egypt was the reed pen, a reed fashioned into a stem with a bruised, brush-like end. With pigments of carbon <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> ochre, the reed pen was used to write on scrolls of papyrus—a thin material made from beating together strips of pith from the Cyperus papyrus plant—as well as on small ceramic or limestone ostraca known as potsherds. It is thought that papyrus rolls were moderately expensive commercial items, since many are palimpsests, manuscripts that have their original contents erased to make room for new written works. This, alongside tearing off pieces of papyrus documents to make smaller letters, suggests that there were seasonal shortages caused by the limited growing season of Cyperus papyrus. It also explains the frequent use of ostraca and limestone flakes as writing media for shorter written works. In addition to stone, ceramic ostraca, and papyrus, writing media also included wood, ivory, and plaster.|$|E
5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, {{it was decided that}} the company would be considered an ad hoc, or provisional unit, which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, akin to a task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E

5000|$|In the German Revolution of 1918-19, <b>black,</b> white <b>and</b> <b>red</b> were {{abandoned}} {{in favour of}} the [...] "democratic" [...] <b>black,</b> <b>red</b> <b>and</b> gold colours of 1848. In view of Germany's unfortunate position after the lost war and {{under the terms of}} the Versailles Treaty, monarchist and German National forces advocated the retention of the imperial colours as a matter of national pride. Until then and up to today, <b>black,</b> white <b>and</b> <b>red</b> are often associated with right wing radicalism because of their use by right wing parties and later in far-right circles.|$|R
