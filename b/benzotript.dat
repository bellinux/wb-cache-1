40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} enoyl-CoA hydratase/ 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/ 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase trifunctional protein (trifunctional protein) plays a {{major role}} in mitochon-drial fatty acid oxidation. The enzyme complex consists of four molecules of a-subunit containing both hydratase and dehydrogenase domains and four molecules of /?-subunit containing the thiolase domain. The primary structure of a gastrin-binding protein (GBP) was highly homologous to that of the a-subunit of the trifunctional protein. Here, we report that gastrin inhibits the hydratase, dehydrogenase, and thiolase activities of the trifunc-tional protein. The gastrin/cholecystokinin receptor antagonist <b>benzotript,</b> which inhib-ited binding of gastrin to the GBP, also inhibited all three activities of the trifunctional protein. In addition, <b>benzotript</b> inhibits the activities of multifunctional enzymes having similar structures, such as the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydratase/ 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional protein and the Pseudomonas fragi fatty acid oxidation enzyme complex. This reagent, however, hardly inhibited various monofunctional en-zymes involved in fatty acid oxidation.

40|$|In {{dispersed}} acini from {{guinea pig}} pancreas, proglumide (DL- 4 -benzamido-N, N-dipropylglutaramic acid) and <b>benzotript</b> (N-p-chlorobenzoyl-L-tryptophan) caused a rightward {{shift in the}} dose [...] response curve for cholecystokinin-stimulated amylase secretion but did not alter the maximal increase in amylase secretion caused by cholecystokinin. At relatively low concentrations, proglumide did not alter the stimulation of enzyme secretion caused by secretagogues whose effects are mediated by adenosine 3 ' 5 '-monophosphate (e. g., vasoactive intestinal peptide or secretin) and did not alter the stimulation of enzyme secretion caused by secretagogues that have a mode of action {{similar to that of}} cholecystokinin but act through different receptors (e. g., bombesin, physalaemin, eledoisin, and ionophore A 23187). There was a close correlation between the ability of proglumide or <b>benzotript</b> to inhibit binding of 125 I-labeled cholecystokinin to its receptors on pancreatic acini and the abilities of these compounds to inhibit the action of cholecystokinin on enzyme secretion and on calcium outflux. These results indicate that proglumide and <b>benzotript</b> are members of a different class of cholecystokinin receptor antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition {{of colon}} {{carcinoma}} cell growth by the nonselective gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists proglumide and <b>benzotript</b> provided evidence that gastrin functions as an autocrine growth factor. However, the molecular {{properties of the}} receptor mediating the antagonist effects have not been identified. A 78 -kDa gastrin-binding protein (GBP), the sequence of which {{is related to the}} family of enzymes possessing enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, has been previously purified from porcine gastric mucosal membranes. I now report that covalent cross-linking of 125 I-labeled [Nle 15]gastrin 2, 17 to the 78 -kDa GBP is inhibited by crotonyl-CoA and by acetoacetyl-CoA. Gastrin, CCK, and their analogues also inhibit cross-linking, and the spectrum of analogue affinities correlates better with the values previously reported for binding to the gastrin/CCK-C receptor than with the values reported for binding to either the CCK-A or the gastrin/CCK-B receptor. Cross-linking is also inhibited by proglumide and <b>benzotript,</b> but no inhibition is seen with either the CCK-A receptor-selective antagonist L 364, 718 or the gastrin/CCK-B receptor-selective antagonist L 365, 260. The affinities of antagonists for the GBP correlate well with their affinities for the gastrin/CCK-C receptor and with their potencies for inhibition of colon carcinoma cell growth. I conclude that the 78 -kDa gastrin-binding protein is (i) a member of the hydratase/dehydrogenase family of fatty acid oxidation enzymes, (ii) the gastrin/CCK-C receptor, and (iii) the target for the antiproliferative action of two gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe non-selective gastrin/cholecystokinin {{receptor}} antagonists proglumide and <b>benzotript</b> inhibit colon carcinoma {{cell proliferation}} by binding to the 78 kDa gastrin-binding protein (GBP) (Baldwin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91 (1994) 7593 â€“ 7597). However, although most colon carcinoma cell lines synthesize progastrin, production of mature amidated gastrin 17 {{has not been}} observed. In order to define the structural requirements for the binding of gastrin to the GBP the affinities of various fragments of amidated and C-terminally extended gastrin 17 for the GBP have been measured. The {{results indicate that the}} GBP recognizes both N- and C-termini of gastrin 17. Moreover since C-terminal amidation is not a prerequisite for binding of gastrin to the GBP, the GBP is a potential target for the autocrine effects of progastrin...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{studies on}} the {{behavioral}} functions of sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK) in the gut and in the brain require potent, specific antagonists to CCK. Compounds identffied as competi-tive antagonists at the peripheral receptors for CCK were tested {{for their ability to}} block the behavioral effects of CCK adminis-tered centrally and peripherally. Behavioral effects of CCK (8. 8 x 10 - 10 mmol) administered centrally into the nucleus accum-bens, i. e., potentiation of dopamine-induced hyperlocomotion in rats, were effectively blocked by pretreatment with proglumkie (6 x 1 0 - mmol of nucleus accumbens), by <b>benzotript</b> (3 x 1 0 mmol of nucleus accumbens) and by rabbit antiserum raised against CCK (0. 2 id/nucleus accumbens), but not by CCK (1. 7 x 1 0 - mmol) or unsulfated CCK (1. 9 x 1 0 mmd). The behavioral effects of peripherally administered CCK, i. e. reduced food consumption and reduced exploratory behavior...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{control of}} cell {{proliferation}} by gastrin {{has been investigated}} in a rat pancreatic tumour cell line, AR 4 - 2 J. Exogenous gastrin, 10 - 12 to 10 - 8 M, stimulated cell growth of thymidine-synchronised AR 4 - 2 J cells cultured over 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates of AR 4 - 2 J cells contained an average of 4. 5 and 3. 5 pg gastrin per 106 cells, when grown in serum-supplemented or serum-free media, respectively, as revealed by radioimmunoassay. In serum-free medium, AR 4 - 2 J secrete 34 ngl 10 - 6 cells of gastrin over 48 h. Addition of an anti-gastrin immunoglobulin preparation, but not control immunoglobulins, caused a maximum 52 % reduction in cell growth. These data are consistent with an autocrine role for gastrin in the control of AR 4 - 2 J cell growth. These results were supported by studies with gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Six non-peptide gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists inhibited AR 4 - 2 J cell growth in a concentration-related manner. The concentration required for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) of cell growth by the amino acid-derived antagonists proglumide (3. 5 x 10 - M), <b>benzotript</b> (1. 8 x 10 - 3 M), loxiglumide (1. 1 x 10 - 4 M) and lorglumide (6. 7 x 10 - 5 M) were of the same order and significantly correlated with their IC 50 for inhibition of 1251 -gastrin binding to AR 4 - 2 J cells. Inhibition of cell growth by these antagonists was partially reversed {{by the addition of}} exogenous gastrin. In contrast, the ICm for inhibition of cell growth with two benzodiazepine-derive...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} cell {{proliferation}} by gastrin {{has been investigated}} in a rat pancreatic tumour cell line, AR 4 - 2 J. Exogenous gastrin, 10 (- 12) to 10 (- 8) M, stimulated cell growth of thymidine-synchronised AR 4 - 2 J cells cultured over 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates of AR 4 - 2 J cells contained an average of 4. 5 and 3. 5 pg gastrin per 10 (6) cells, when grown in serum-supplemented or serum-free media, respectively, as revealed by radioimmunoassay. In serum-free medium, AR 4 - 2 J secrete 34 ng 1 (- 1) 10 (- 6) cells of gastrin over 48 h. Addition of an anti-gastrin immunoglobulin preparation, but not control immunoglobulins, caused a maximum 52 % reduction in cell growth. These data are consistent with an autocrine role for gastrin in the control of AR 4 - 2 J cell growth. These results were supported by studies with gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Six non-peptide gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists inhibited AR 4 - 2 J cell growth in a concentration-related manner. The concentration required for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) of cell growth by the amino acid-derived antagonists proglumide (3. 5 x 10 (- 3) M), <b>benzotript</b> (1. 8 x 10 (- 3) M), loxiglumide (1. 1 x 10 (- 4) M) and lorglumide (6. 7 x 10 (- 5) M) were of the same order and significantly correlated with their IC 50 for inhibition of 125 I-gastrin binding to AR 4 - 2 J cells. Inhibition of cell growth by these antagonists was partially reversed {{by the addition of}} exogenous gastrin. In contrast, the IC 50 for inhibition of cell growth with two benzodiazepine-derived antagonists, the CCK-B receptor antagonist L- 365, 260 (4. 6 x 10 (- 5) M) and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (1. 7 x 10 (- 5) M) were two-three orders of magnitude greater than those required to inhibit gastrin binding (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 7) M). The growth inhibitory effects of L- 365, 260 and devazepide were not reversed by exogenous gastrin suggesting these benzodiazepine-derived antagonists do not inhibit cell growth by interaction with gastrin receptors. The results are consistent with gastrin being an autocrine growth factor in AR 4 - 2 J cells, and that stimulation of cell growth is due to stimulation of the gastrin, rather than CCK-B, receptor sub-type. This study highlights that gastrin receptor antagonists warrant further investigation as agents to control growth of tumours, such as those from the gastrointestinal tract, which express gastrin receptors...|$|E
