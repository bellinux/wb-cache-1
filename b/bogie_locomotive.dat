50|$|In {{appearance}} {{they were}} fairly typical Drummond family products with the stiffener across the cab roof. They were also inside cylindered, almost uniquely among HR <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mechanically {{they were}} the first <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives</b> to have used the American {{principle}} of the [...] "swing-link" [...] bogie where hinged links control the truck's lateral (sideways) movement.|$|R
50|$|The Be 4/6 {{utilized}} the {{maximum axle load}} of 20 t fully. The motors for the Ae 4/8 were heavier {{than those of the}} Be 4/6, therefore the Ae 4/8 was planned with two more idle axles from the beginning. In contrast to the Be 4/6 <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotive</b> the Ae 4/8 was built as a frame locomotive with a double articulated body. This articulated layout allowed good operation on curves, even with the heavy, frame mounted motors. The locomotive was nicknamed Tatzelwurm because of this layout.|$|E
50|$|A {{brief period}} {{working for the}} Board of Trade {{followed}} from 1910, arranging exhibitions in Brussels, Paris and Turin. During this time, {{he was able to}} travel widely in Europe, including a trip with Gresley, Stanier and Hawksworth, to Belgium, to see a metre-gauge <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotive.</b> In December 1912, he rejoined the GNR as Personal Assistant to Nigel Gresley, the new CME. Gresley was only six years Bulleid's senior. World War I intervened; Bulleid joined the British Army and was assigned to the rail transport arm, rising to the rank of Major. After the war, Bulleid returned to the GNR as the Manager of the Wagon and Carriage Works.|$|E
5000|$|The {{size and}} {{description}} of Johore Wooden Railway's rolling stock is uncertain. An early proposal involved {{the use of}} a Fairlie, double <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotive</b> [...] "successfully used on the Ffestiniog Railway in Wales" [...] and adapted to negotiate steep gradients and sharp curves, but a lack of evidence suggests no such locomotive was delivered to Malaya. In 1875, the Maharaja of Johor purchased a second-hand Indian steam locomotive, an Indian State Railway Class B 0-4-4T number B27 (number 89 on the Rajputana State Railway) manufactured by Dübs (742/1874), suggesting, while unverified, its use in the JWR. The locomotive would later change hands to serve for the Selangor State Railway to be named Lady Clarke and aid in the construction of a railway line between Klang and Kuala Lumpur, and was inherited by the Federated Malay States Railways {{to be used as a}} shunter before its scrapping in 1912.|$|E
50|$|The {{highest number}} of {{trailing}} wheels on a single locomotive is six as seen on 2-6-6-6 Allegheny type and the Pennsylvania Railroad's 6-8-6 steam turbine and 6-4-4-6 duplex locomotives, as well as numerous Mason <b>Bogie</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 0-6-6 wheel {{arrangement}} was usually found on Single Fairlie or Mason <b>Bogie</b> <b>locomotives.</b> The Fairlie locomotive was invented and patented in 1864 by the Scottish engineer Robert Francis Fairlie. The first Fairlie locomotives later {{became known as}} Double Fairlies.|$|R

5000|$|The Metropolitan Railway ordered {{electric}} locomotives from British Westinghouse and made by Metropolitan Amalgamated. The first ten were built with Westinghouse electrical control equipment and entered service in 1906. These 'camel-back' <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives</b> featured a central cab, weighed 50 tons, were 35 ft long over the buffers and had four [...] traction motors. Initially {{there was only}} one position for the driver which give difficulties, and a second master controller was soon added.|$|R

50|$|The Winterthur Universal Drive was {{extensively}} used by SLM in locomotive designs from 1928 to 1948. It was {{compact and}} had a relatively light unsprung weight. However, {{it was difficult to}} access for maintenance and repair work, a particular problem as the gears were prone to wear. The drive was unpopular amongst drivers due to loud noise that it made, and production was discontinued when the design was rendered obsolete with the advent of <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives</b> in the 1940s.|$|R
500|$|After electrification, {{the outer}} {{suburban}} routes were worked with carriage stock hauled from Baker Street by an electric locomotive that was exchanged for a steam locomotive en route. The Met ordered 20 electric locomotives from Metropolitan Amalgamated with {{two types of}} electrical equipment. The first ten, with Westinghouse equipment, entered service in 1906. These 'camel-back' <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives</b> had a central cab, weighed 50tons, and had four [...] traction motors The second type were built to a box car design with British Thomson-Houston equipment, replaced with the Westinghouse type in 1919.|$|R

40|$|In a {{heavy haul}} train {{operations}} the ruling grades {{that set the}} tractive power requirements for train consists are often associated with tight curvatures. Past studies of passive or active bogie steering developments have been mostly directed towards high speed rail applications or light rail and commuter rail applications and hence {{studies have focused on}} two axle bogies. Linked passive steering three axle <b>locomotive</b> <b>bogies</b> such as produced by General Motors EMD for the SD 70 class locomotive are in widespread use however, there are few publications on traction and curving, and few papers on linked passive steering bogies. This paper presents a simulation study three axle <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives</b> on various curve radii with traction and variable rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed showing body linked radial bogies to have considerable advantages over axle linked bogies that are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As traction adhesion approaches the rail friction coefficient steering performance of all bogies without forced steering deteriorates to the same levels as a rigid bogie...|$|R

50|$|Following {{the fitting}} {{of its new}} <b>bogies</b> the <b>locomotive</b> was used on express {{passenger}} trains. On a London King's Cross to Newcastle service diagrammed for British Rail Class 55 ('Deltic') operation the unit was 14mins faster than required even though the new traction motors meant reduced power at the rail.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the speedy overhaul of these locomotives in the confined spaces of Nine Elms, spare boilers were constructed. Coupled to a short wheelbase and guiding <b>bogies,</b> the <b>locomotive</b> was relatively manoeuvrable on tight curves, a feature that was to ensure the survival {{of some of the}} class later on.|$|R
50|$|The only {{locomotives}} on the Vale of Neath Railway in 1851 {{were these}} six <b>bogie</b> tank <b>locomotives.</b> Built by Robert Stephenson and Company, they were smaller-wheeled versions of Daniel Gooch's South Devon Railway Comet class locomotives that were {{built at the}} same time by various companies. They were all withdrawn shortly after the Welsh gauge conversion in 1872.|$|R
5000|$|This unusual wheel {{arrangement}} {{does not}} appear to have been used on the mainline railways in the UK. It was, however, one of the configurations used on the Mason <b>Bogie</b> articulated <b>locomotives,</b> in the US during the 1880s. Two examples were constructed at the Mason Machine Works for the narrow gauge Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad in 1892.|$|R
40|$|The {{traction}} control in modern electric and diesel electric locomotives has allowed rail operators to utilise high traction adhesion levels without undue {{risk of damage}} from uncontrolled wheel spin. At the same time, some locomotive manufacturers have developed passive steering <b>locomotive</b> <b>bogies</b> to reduce wheel rail wear and further improve locomotive adhesion performance on curves. High locomotive traction loads in curving are known to cause the loss of steering performance in passive steering bogies. At present there are few publications on the curving performance of locomotive steering with linkage bogies. The most extreme traction curving cases of low speed and high adhesion for hauling locomotives have not been fully investigated, with effects of coupler forces and cant excess being generally ignored. This paper presents a simulation study for three axle <b>bogie</b> <b>locomotives</b> in pusher and pulling train positions on tight curves. The simulation study uses moderate and high traction adhesion levels of 16. 6 % and 37 % for various rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed, showing forced steering bogies to have considerable advantages over self steering bogies. Likewise it is shown that self steering bogies are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As the required traction adhesion approaches the rail friction coefficient, steering performance of all bogies degrades and yaw of the bogie frame relative to the track increases. Operation with excess cant and tensile coupler forces are both found to be detrimental to the wear performance of all <b>locomotive</b> <b>bogies,</b> increasing the bogie frame yaw angles. Bogie frame pitching is also found to have significant effect on steering, causing increased performance differences between bogie designs...|$|R
50|$|The bogie {{suspension}} system consisted of coil primary suspension, and flexicoil secondary suspension with anti-hunting and anti-rocking dampers. Tractive forces from <b>bogie</b> to <b>locomotive</b> were transferred via traction rods {{connected to a}} low lying connection at the bogie pivot centre. Mechanical braking was by wheel mounted disc brakes. Electric braking is either up to 4.5MW rheostatic braking via roof mounted resistors, or up to 7.2MW regenerative braking.|$|R
