2500|$|When {{an armed}} police team entered the {{apartment}} in question, two officers were injured by shotgun fire. One officer {{was holding a}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>shield</b> which got hit. The other officer got hit in the head, but was wearing a ballistic helmet. This led to other officers returning fire. The gunman {{was taken to the}} hospital, where he died. National Police Commissioner Haraldur Johannessen immediately apologised to the man's family, calling the incident [...] "unprecedented" [...] The shooter's motives were not immediately clear, though some neighbours reported the gunman was making threats towards them. An investigation into this incident was launched, and the guns involved on all sides were seized. Counseling was offered to the officers involved.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{preparation}} {{phase of a}} plan to assist the CRU in clearing the compound, NZSAS trooper Corporal Douglas Grant was mortally wounded by insurgent fire. Initially it was unclear where Grant had fallen, so Smith [...] "with no concern for his personal safety", and despite receiving a significant volume of insurgent machine gun and rifle fire, moved into a position to enable him to confirm Corporal Grant’s exact location. After being ordered to wait to receive a <b>ballistic</b> <b>shield,</b> Smith leapt over a wall and moved across exposed and open ground to the position where Corporal Grant had been shot. He then commenced treating Grant using his additional advanced medical skills until he could be evacuated from the compound.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{material}} piercing {{process is}} an extremely complex phenomenon for the theoretical analysis. This is connected {{with the fact that}} the materials used mainly for <b>ballistic</b> <b>shields</b> may not be treated as isotropic media. The description of piercing of <b>ballistic</b> <b>shields</b> made of light weight composite materials, on the basis of the Hooke’s model and the Young’s module reflects the too low result effectiveness for practical applications. The purpose of this article is the mathematical description of the impact phenomenon of a bullet of the speed ca. 400 m/s, with the use of a degenerated model. Design/methodology/approach: In the study, an attempt has been made to apply an untypical model for the piercing phenomenon analysis. Basing on the model, the theoretical analysis of the piercing phenomenon in quasistatic and dynamic load conditions, in the impact load form, has been carried out. Findings: This analysis enabled derivation of significant conclusions useful in the design process of effective <b>ballistic</b> <b>shields.</b> Research limitations/implications: In the study, the concept has been assumed that a dynamic model simple as possible, that may be analyzed not only by numerical methods but also (at least approximately) with the mathematical analysis methods, may provide significant directions concerning material piercing. Practical implications: The use of so called degenerated model allows to describe the phenomenon in more detail at various piercing speeds what extends the possibilities in the sphere of designing the optimum <b>ballistic</b> <b>shields</b> and of identification of the properties of materials applied for construction of shields. Originality/value: The proposed method of identification of material properties in the piercing process, within the relation: force – deformation, is a novel one since the essence of the identification is the standard rheological model in an adequate plastic component describing the viscous attenuation with dry friction...|$|R
