40|$|High-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> (HPGA) {{technology}} has been widely employed as an effective method to produce fine spherical metal powders. The physics of <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> is dominated by rapid momentum and heat transfer between the gas and melt phases, and further complicated by break-up and solidification. A numerical model is developed to simulate the critical droplet break-up during the atomisation. By integration of the droplet break-up model with the flow field generated high-pressure gas nozzle, this numerical model is able to provide quantitative assessment for atomisation process. To verify the model performance, the melt stream is initialized to large droplets varying from 1 to 5 mm diameters and injected into the gas flow field for further fragmentation and the break-up dynamics are described in details according to the droplet input parameters...|$|R

40|$|In an {{atomisation}} {{process for}} powder production, metal droplets go through undercooling, recalescence, peritectic and segregated solidification before fully solidified. The cooling process is {{further complicated by}} droplet break-up during the atomisation. This paper describes a numerical model which combines both cooling and break-up in a single computation. The dynamic history of droplets is solved as discrete phase in an Eulerian gas flow. The coupling between droplet and gas flows are two-way, in which the heat and momentum exchanges affecting the gas flow are treated as source/sink terms in the fluid equations. The droplet models were employed a <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> process for metal powder production and good agreement is achieved with the results in open literature. The model results further confirm that thermal history of particles {{is strongly dependent on}} initial droplet size. Large droplets will not go through undercooling while small droplets have identifiable stages of undercooling, unclearation and recalescence. The predictions demonstrate that droplets have very similar profiles during <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> and the major factor influencing the atomisation and solidification process of droplets are in-flight distance...|$|R

40|$|During high {{pressure}} <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> (HPGA), the molten metal stream is disintegrated to produce spherical powders when energy {{is transferred from}} the gas to the melt. Conventional annular-slit nozzle (ASN) in close-coupled atomisation generates an under-expanded gas jet with characteristic shock waves which consume {{a great deal of}} energy through expansion. An isentropic plug nozzle (IPN) is developed in this paper to reduce the shocks and maximize kinetic energy being transferred from the gas to instablize the melt stream. The performance of the IPN is examined using a numerical model which includes gas flow dynamics, droplet break-up mechanism and particle tracking. The numerical results demonstrate a good improvement of gas dynamics and powder yield from the IPN design in comparison with the ASN, in particular when hot gas is employed...|$|R

40|$|The {{spray forming}} process {{combines}} {{the benefits of}} rapid solidification processing with the cost advantages associated with near net shape processing. High pressure gas impinges on a stream of molten metal and atomises it into an array of fine droplets.

Preforms may have billet, tube or strip geometries depending on {{the configuration of the}} substrate manipulation system.

40|$|The {{leaching}} of Al from intermetallic {{samples of}} Nickel Aluminium alloys to form Raney type nickel catalysts {{is widely used}} in the hydrogenation industry, however, little is known of the leaching process itself.

Despite the liberation of hydrogen and effervescent nature of the reaction {{the transformation of the}} dry powder phases into Raney type Ni was determined. Samples produced by <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> were found to leach faster than those produced using the cast and crushed technique. Regardless of processing route of the precursor powder, the formation of spongy Ni occurs almost immediately, while Ni 2 Al 3 and NiAl 3 continue to transform over longer periods of time. Small angle scattering and broadening of the diffraction peaks is an evidence for the formation of the smaller Ni particles. Understanding the kinetics of the leaching process will allow industry to refine production of catalysts for optimum manufacturing time while knowledge of leaching dynamics of powders produced by different manufacturing techniques will allow further tailoring of catalytic material...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> spray forming process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of overspray (droplets missing the emerging billet), splashing of material from the billet surface, and material ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the spray forming process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the overspray powder, and thus recycle material {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the overspray powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|R

However, the microstructure was shown by XRD to undergo a phase transformation which resulted in the decomposition of the icosahedral phase around ~ 500 °C into more stable intermetallic phases.

Due to the high cooling rates the alloy composition of both alloys consists of hexagonal-close-packed α- and body-centred-cubic β-phase. The α-phase is dominant in the larger powder size fractions. Considerable amounts of the β phase were only found in the powder particle size fractions smaller than 32 μm for the Ti- 45 Al- 5 Nballoy and smaller than 45 μm for the Ti- 45 Al- 10 Nb. A pronounced dendritic cauliflower-like structure was observed in bigger powder particles of the Ti- 45 Al- 10 Nb alloy. This gives proof that diffusion took place during the initial β-grain formation, even though there is no orientation relation between the final grain and the dendrite structure in the powder particles. The presence of dendritic structures showed that the cooling rate during powder atomization was still too low to reach the critical growth rate for a planar solidification. The absence of preferred misorientation angles between α-grains indicates that α-grains are not formed out of already solidified β-grains by a solid state phase transformation...|$|R

50|$|Investigations {{show that}} in all cases <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> of molten metal yields {{a broad range of}} droplet diameters, {{typically}} in the range 10-600 µm diameter, with a mean diameter of ~100 µm. Droplet diameter governs the dynamic behaviour of the droplet in flight which in turn determines the time available for in-flight cooling which is critical in controlling the resulting billet microstructure. At a flight distance of 300-400 mm, predictions show droplet velocities of 40-90 ms−1 for droplet diameters in the range 20-150 µm respectively, compared to measured velocities of ~100 ms−1, and at distances of up to 180 mm from the atomiser, droplets were still being accelerated by the gas. Droplets cool in-flight predominantly by convection and radiation, and can experience undercooling of up to 300 C prior to nucleation. Models and experimental measurements show that small droplets (<50 µm) very rapidly become fully solid prior to deposition, 50-200 µm droplets will be typically semi-solid and droplets of diameters >200 µm will be liquid at deposition. The range of droplet dynamic and thermal histories result in a billet top surface of 0.3 to 0.6 solid fraction. Not all material that impacts the surface is incorporated into the billet: some solid droplets will bounce or splash-off the billet top surface or be directed out of the deposition region by turbulent gas movement in the chamber. The proportion of droplets that impact the surface compared to the proportion that are incorporated into the billet has been termed the sticking efficiency: dependent on the geometric sticking which {{is a function of the}} spray angle relative to substrate and the thermal sticking efficiency dependent on spray and billet solid/liquid fraction.|$|R
