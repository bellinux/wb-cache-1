40|$|Two tannin sorghums, (high-tannin, {{black with}} tannin), high {{anthocyanin}} sorghum (black), and non-tannin sorghum (white) {{were used to}} investigate the effects of sorghum phenolic compounds on in vitro starch digestibility, estimated glycemic indices (EGI) and resistant starch contents (RS) of porridges. Sorghum varieties were chosen to have {{a wide range of}} total phenols (3 - 23 mg/g gallic acid) and tannin contents (0 - 34 mg catechin eq. /g). Normal corn starch, enzyme resistant high amylose corn starch, and whole sorghum grains were cooked with the aqueous fraction of sorghum <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> obtained with 70 % aqueous acetone. Endosperms of soft and hard sorghum varieties were mixed with sorghum brans and cooked into porridges with distilled water. Hi-tannin, black and black with tannin sorghum <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased starch digestibility and estimated glycemic index (EGI) while they increased resistant starch (RS) contents of normal corn starch, enzyme resistant high amylose corn starch, and whole sorghum grain porridges. The highest reduction in starch digestibility of the porridges occurred with hi-tannin sorghum <b>bran</b> <b>extracts,</b> followed by black with tannin and black sorghum <b>bran</b> <b>extracts.</b> Double cooked corn starch porridges, which were cooked with these <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> had EGI values of 49 - 67 and RS contents of 9. 1 - 57. 7 %. These RS values are higher than foods such as legumes, whole pasta and whole grain cereals which are considered health foods with low EGI (36 - 71) and high RS contents (2. 9 - 6. 8). Only brans of condensed tannin-containing sorghum varieties (tannin, black with tannin sorghums) significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased starch digestibility, and EGI, and increased RS contents of the endosperm porridges. When tannin sorghum <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> were cooked with zein added to corn starch porridges, starch digestibility of the porridges significantly (p< 0. 05) increased, while RS significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased because the zein reacted preferentially with the tannins. The cooking trials indicated that sorghums with tannins significantly reduced the activity of digestive enzymes, reduced EGI, and increased RS contents of porridges. Thus, specialty sorghum varieties have a potential to lower EGI and increase RS contents of starchy foods.

After solid-state fermentation of wheat bran by white rot fungi for 12 d, the scavenging action of the fermented wheat <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> was 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and the free radicals increased significantly, approximately 1. 5 -fold. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of 1 mg/mL fermented wheat <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> was increased from 100 to 150 mM trolox antioxidant capacity after 12 d of fermentation. Moreover, the extracts exhibited 50 % of the chelating capacity observed for ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) after fermenting for 12 d. In vitro, and under the stimulus of fermented wheat bran, the antioxidant gene expression (GST, HO- 1, Nrf 2, and GCLC genes) of PBMC was more than double that of the PBS, ascorbic acid, and unfermented wheat bran. The expression of fermented wheat bran was the lowest for the NOX 1 and ROMO 1 genes.

S. stipitis produced only ethanol, while C. guilliermondii produced xylitol as the main product and ethanol as by-product. Maximum ethanol production by S. stipitis was observed when sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate was supplemented with (NH 4) 2 SO 4, peptone and yeast extract.

Fermentation broths {{were obtained from the}} whole grain brown rice and rice bran of two Thai rice cultivars, RD 6 (glutinous) and RD 17 (nonglutinous). The rice used was not germinated and fermentations were carried out in a single step without growth supplementation. L. plantarum grew well in all tested broths, and a final biomass value of approx. 10. 4 log CFU/mL was obtained. In addition, biomass production and substrate depletion were satisfactorily modelled using an unstructured mathematical model. There were no statistical differences observed among the four rice media. The results confirm that brown rice and rice bran are suitable substrates for the culture of the probiotic L. plantarum NCIMB 8826. Rice bran, currently a by-product of the traditional cereal processing industry, has shown similar fermentability to brown rice. This indicates that rice bran or rice <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> could be used in new probiotic food developments, while probably still maintaining other functional properties of the bran.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether short-term exposure to an aqueous extract of hog barn dust increases macromolecular efflux from the intact hamster cheek pouch and, if so, to begin to determine the mechanism(s) underlying this response. By using intravital microscopy, we found that suffusion of hog barn dust extract onto the intact hamster cheek pouch for 60 min elicited a significant, concentration-dependent leaky site formation and increase in clearance of FITC-labeled dextran (mol mass, 70 kDa). This response was significantly attenuated by suffusion of catalase (60 U/ml), but not by heat-inactivated catalase, and by pretreatment with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg, i. v.) (p< 0. 05). Catalase had no significant effects on adenosine-induced increase in macromolecular efflux from the cheek pouch. Suffusion of hog <b>bran</b> dust <b>extract</b> had no significant effects on arteriolar diameter in the cheek pouch. Taken together, these data indicate that hog <b>bran</b> dust <b>extract</b> increases macromolecular efflux from the in situ hamster cheek pouch, in part, through local elaboration of reactive oxygen species that are inactivated by catalase.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} metabolic disease caused by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas {{or when the}} body loses its ability to utilise insulin effectively or both. This leads to an accumulation of glucose {{in the blood of}} diabetic people which is detrimental for their health in the long term. Due to an increase in prevalence, the disease is becoming a growing concern to health authorities worldwide, especially in developing regions where inadequate health care systems and poor socio-economic conditions exacerbates the situation. A potential way of preventing diabetes is to limit starch digestibility to control blood glucose levels. Sorghum and maize are important food cereals in many regions of the world and they contain various phenolic compounds, particularly flavonoids which can inhibit starch hydrolysing enzymes like α-amylase. Therefore these cereals could have potential anti-diabetic properties. In this study, various <b>extracts</b> prepared from <b>bran</b> samples of white maize and white and red non-tannin sorghums were analysed for inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic α-amylase using the Megazyme Ceralpha α-amylase assay kit. It was necessary to provide a basis for an understanding of the amylase enzyme inhibitory properties of the brans in relation to their phenolic content and therefore, their potential anti-diabetic properties. The total phenolic content of white maize and red and white non-tannin sorghum <b>bran</b> methanolic <b>extracts</b> was therefore determined, using the Folin Ciocalteu assay. The profile and concentration of flavonoids in <b>extracts</b> from the <b>bran</b> samples was determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Red non-tannin sorghum <b>bran</b> and its <b>extracts</b> had higher inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic α-amylase than <b>bran</b> and <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> from white maize and white non-tannin sorghum. Unextracted bran samples also inhibited the enzyme, indicating that the bran components inhibiting the enzyme did not need extraction and could exert inhibitory effects in situ. The bran of the red non-tannin sorghum varieties had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher levels of total phenolics (3. 35 – 4. 13 g CE/ 100 g) than that of the white maize (1. 07 - 1. 20 g CE/ 100 g) and white non-tannin sorghum varieties (0. 99 - 1. 15 g CE/ 100 g) as shown by results from the Folin Ciocalteu assay. Results from HPLC analysis showed that extracts from red sorghum varieties had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher levels of total flavonoids (166. 8 - 269. 8 mg/ 100 g) than extracts from white maize (18. 7 - 24. 8 mg/ 100 g) and white non-tannin sorghum (64. 9 - 69. 9 mg/ 100 g). Acidified organic <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> had higher total phenolics than non-acidified organic and water extracts. Results from LC-MS analysis showed that the acidified methanol extract from red non-tannin sorghum bran had the highest concentration of flavonoids with flavones (apigenin and luteolin) and flavanones (eriodictyol and naringenin) detected as the two main groups of flavonoids. In agreement with total phenolic and flavonoid content, this extract also had the highest α-amylase inhibitory activity. The water extract of the red non-tannin sorghum (Mr BUSTER), was the only water extract of all the grains that contained flavanones like eriodictyol, and was also the only water extract that showed inhibition against α-amylase. These observations indicate that the flavone and flavanone compounds identified in the extracts are important for inhibition of the α-amylase enzyme. Nutraceutical-type preparations from red non-tannin sorghum bran could have applications in foods as anti-diabetic agents by inhibiting α-amylase activity and thus controlling postprandial glucose levels in people suffering from diabetes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the phytochemical compositions and antioxidant capacity, cell growth inhibition, and apoptosis induction in extracts of immature wheat bran. Immature wheat bran (IWB) was obtained from immature wheat harvested 10 days earlier than mature wheat. The phytochemical compositions of <b>bran</b> <b>extract</b> samples were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. The total ferulic acid (3. 09 mg/g) and p-coumaric acid (75 µg/g) in IWB were significantly higher than in mature wheat bran (MWB, ferulic acid: 1. 79 mg/g; p-coumaric acid: 55 µg/g). The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC: 327 µM Trolox equivalents (TE) /g) and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA: 4. 59 µM Quercetin equivalents (QE) /g) of the IWB were higher than those of the MWB (ORAC: 281 µM TE/g; CAA: 0. 63 µM QE/g). When assessing cell proliferation, the IWB extracts resulted in the lowest EC 50 values against HT- 29 (18. 9 mg/mL), Caco- 2 (7. 74 mg/mL), and HeLa cells (8. 17 mg/mL) among <b>bran</b> <b>extract</b> samples.

Riceberry that had demonstrated anti-cancer activity in leukemic cell line were investigated. After saponification with potassium hydroxide, separation of the unsaponified fraction by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resulted in four sub-fractions that had {{a certain degree of}} anti-proliferation against a mouse leukemic cell line (WEHI- 3 cell), this being IC 50 at 24 h ranging between 2. 80 – 467. 11 μg/mL. Further purification of the bioactive substances contained in these four sub-fractions was performed by normal-phase HPLC. Structural characterization by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) resulted in, overall, the structures of seven phytosterols and four triterpenoids. Four phytosterols, 24 -methylene-ergosta- 5 -en- 3 β-ol, 24 -methylene-ergosta- 7 -en- 3 β-ol, fucosterol, and gramisterol, along with three triterpenoids, cycloeucalenol, lupenone, and lupeol, were found in the two sub-fractions that showed strong anti-leukemic cell proliferation (IC 50 = 2. 80 and 32. 89 μg/mL). The other sterols and triterpenoids were campesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol and 24 -methylenecycloartanol.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, rice bran, {{one of the}} most {{abundant}} agricultural by-products in Malaysia, was fermented with single and mixed cultures of Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae. The fermented rice bran extracts were tested for their functional properties and compared to the non-fermented counterparts. Antioxidant activities as well as phenolics and organic acid contents were evaluated. Skincare-related functionalities were also tested by evaluating tyrosinase and elastase inhibition activities. Tyrosinase inhibition activity, measured to determine the anti-pigmentation effect of extracts, was found to be the highest in the extract of rice bran fermented with A. oryzae (56. 18 %) compared to other extracts. In determining the anti-aging effect of fermented rice bran extracts, the same extract showed the highest elastase inhibition activity with a value of 60. 52 %. Antioxidant activities were found to be highest in the mix-cultured rice <b>bran</b> <b>extract.</b> The results of phenolic and organic acid content were varied; the major phenolic acid detected was ferulic acid with a value of 43. 19 μg/ml in the mix-cultured rice <b>bran</b> <b>extract.</b> On the other hand, citric acid was the major organic acid detected, with the highest content found in the same extract (214. 6 mg/g).

Rice flour usually used as medium to produce pigments by M. purpureus. Tofu solid waste and rice bran could be used to produce pigments although the colour intensity of M. purpureus pigment was lower than rice. The aims of these research were to study colour, pH medium and weight of miselium Monascus-nata complex from the combination of rice flour with tofu solid waste extracts and rice flour with rice <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> as the medium. In these research, 5 % (b/v) rice flour extracts, combination of rice flour extract : tofu solid waste extract in the ratio of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and rice flour : rice <b>bran</b> <b>extracts</b> in the ratio of 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3 were used as the medium. Ten nata de coco (1 x 1 x 1 cm 3) were put in to the extracts of medium (100 mL) in bottle, then inoculated with 10 % (v/v) starter of M. purpureus containing 1. 3 x 107 cfu/mL and incubated at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 16 days. Parameters which were measured, i. e. colour intensity, preferable test, pH medium, weight of miselium Monascus-nata complex. Data were analyzed using analysis of variant and followed by DMRT in 5 % significations except preferable test which were analyzed using hedonic test. Combination of rice flour extract : tofu solid waste extracts in the ratio of 1 : 1 could be used to replace rice flour extracts on the making of Monascus-nata complex. Orange colour intensity from rice flour extract : tofu solid waste extracts in the ratio of 1 : 1 was higher than from rice flour extracts. Orange colour intensity from rice flour extract : tofu solid waste extracts in the ratio of 1 : 1 and rice flour were 0. 156 and 0. 123 respectively.

The immune system {{plays a key}} role in recognizing self and non-self compounds to keep our bodies healthy. This leads to a balancing act to provide sufficient immunological response to appropriate antigenic (foreign) agents, and not over-responding which creates detrimental effects on the host. Betaglucans from bacteria, fungi, and cereal grains are immune system stimulators that work through specific cell surface receptors to enhance the host response against antigenic organisms and tumors. One of the most significant signals the peripheral immune system utilizes to respond to an antigenic agent is the secretion of TNFα cytokine. This pleiotropic cytokine leads innate immune system defense, {{plays a key role}} in appetite, inflammation, and cancer, and regulates communication to other immune cells to respond in an organized configuration. First, this study demonstrated that beta-glucan from barley and oat as well as enzymatic treatment of beta-glucans from oats enhances immune stimulation through increased TNFα. I have shown through a model cell culture system (RAW 264. 7 macrophages), a highly pure barley betaglucan (> 91 %; 10 μg/ml) and oat beta-glucan (> 97 %; 300 μg/ml) stimulate macrophages to produce 0. 57 +/- 0. 19 and 0. 49 +/- 0. 17 fg/cell TNFα, respectively quantified by ELISA). However, treatment of barley (10 μg/ml) and oat (300 μg/ml) beta-glucans with lichenase (10 u/μg; 1 hr, 40 C) significantly (p< 0. 05) increased TNFα production only in the oat beta-glucan (300 μg/ml) samples (1. 48 +/- 0. 55 fg/cell). Uncontrolled production of TNFα has been well documented in patients with chronic diseases such as CVD, obesity, and diabetes. Drugs that suppress TNFα production have relieved many deleterious symptoms and disease progression associated with these chronic diseases. Second, this study demonstrated that phenolic acids associated with cereal bran reduce TNFα production. <b>Bran</b> <b>extracts</b> from wheat and barley containing phenolic acids can almost completely diminish (~ 87 %) the TNFα production from macrophages stimulated by cereal and bacterial beta-glucans. Purified commercially available cinnamic and protocatechuic acid significantly (p< 0. 05) reduce TNFα production from bacterial and cereal beta-glucan stimulated macrophages. The combined effects of caffeic and ferulic acid significantly reduced TNFα (59 - 88 %) from cereal and bacterial beta-glucan stimulated macrophages. Through a model cell culture system, I demonstrated that beta-glucans, cereal <b>bran</b> <b>extracts,</b> and multiple phenolic acids from cereal bran have the potential to regulate an important cytokine of the immune system...|$|R
