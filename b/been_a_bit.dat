5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions {{are found in the}} northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Gaston {{talks to}} Gigi {{and she tells}} him {{that she is not}} the type of girl who wants {{publicity}} and to be dumped by him one day, then having to become someone else’s mistress. Gigi wants their relationship to remain platonic but when Gaston accidentally reveals that he loves Gigi she bursts into tears, upset that he would want to expose her to the uncertainty of being his mistress if he actually loves her. Gaston leaves angered, where he later runs into Honoré, who declares the family has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd. Gigi later calls Gaston up, admitting she would rather be miserable with him than without him and agrees to accompany him in public. Gigi dresses in finery for their date, and when Gaston arrives, he is entranced by her beauty.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{on a tour}} in the United States, Powderfinger {{played with}} Coldplay, in what Middleton {{described}} as a highlight. The band also played on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote Odyssey Number Five. After Coldplay cut short the tour, Powderfinger ended up playing numerous US shows themselves, before returning to Australia to play Splendour in the Grass. Middleton's partner {{gave birth to the}} couple's first daughter in September 2001.

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews, and was {{watched by}} 9.95 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, on the Tuesday night it aired in the United States. Critics praised the scenes which involved Bud, Joan {{as well as}} Megan and Derek; [...] "the banter" [...] and [...] "opposites attracting", calling the episode [...] "tense" [...] and {{saying that it was}} the [...] "most gripping episode of this season so far". Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic said, [...] "Having <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game".|$|E
500|$|Sheridan's {{performance}} was generally well received. Entertainment Weekly’s Ken Tucker {{wrote that the}} best acting came from Sheridan, who gave the character a [...] "grim intensity". He commented that Sheridan had [...] "leading-man looks" [...] with the hair of a [...] "dissolute heavy metal star", making him [...] "unsettling" [...] even when not wearing makeup that makes {{him look like a}} devil. Douglas E. Winter of Fangoria magazine believed that Sheridan might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> young and [...] "zany" [...] for the part, but gave a credible performance; he said that Sheridan attacked the role [...] "with the swagger of Elvis, the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires (and network TV allows)".|$|E
500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{enjoyed the}} episode, but criticized the ending {{for being too}} similar to a scene in the series finale of the {{original}} version of The Office in which David Brent, after a successful blind date, tries to jump into a conversation with traveling salesman Chris Finch at a Christmas party. Finch makes a rude comment about his date which makes David stand {{up to him and}} tell him to [...] "fuck off". Despite this, she spoke highly of Jim and Dwight's storyline, writing that [...] "I wish their final ruse had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more original, but it served the purpose of getting rid of Packer". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode.|$|E

[...] "The thing that I've regretted most is this UDI and also I've regretted more than anything the fact that later it wasn't settled," [...] Beadle said in 1972; [...] "I think {{it could have been}} settled at a much earlier stage if Wilson had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more reasonable." [...] Julian Greenfield, a close friend and colleague of Beadle, considered him [...] "one who put service to the country first and foremost and laboured unceasingly on what he believed to be its true interests." [...] According to Palley, Beadle's own view was similar—that [...] "he did his best for his country in a time of difficult choices".|$|E
500|$|Lana was {{introduced}} as Neighbours first lesbian character. Neval revealed that while Lana would fuel a storyline for established character Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), she would also go through her own journey. A representative from Grundy Television {{explained that the}} storyline would be [...] "a relationship story of a close female friendship, made compelling by {{the complexity of the}} feelings involved." [...] The representative believed the storyline would [...] "strike a chord" [...] with teenage viewers, who could relate to Sky and Lana's feelings. Scriptwriter Helen MacWhirter also stated that Lana's story is [...] "multi-faceted", saying, [...] "On one level it's about a young girl coming to terms with her sexuality, which on its own might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> boring and gratuitous, but it also brought into play other story strands which added depth and dimension." ...|$|E

Barber revealed [...] "He puts himself and his heart on the line like he's never done before. At first, Vanessa says no - and he's devastated. He's in a really vulnerable place and he doesn't take her knockback well. Rhys has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a ladies man all his life and he's never really committed to someone before Vanessa. She's a pretty special girl as far as Rhys is concerned." [...] Rhys becomes determined not to give up and he is [...] "thrilled" [...] when Vanessa changes her mind. Barber teased that it is possible viewers could see the last of Rhys and Vanessa for a while, adding [...] "There are definitely interesting times ahead!" ...|$|E

500|$|Odyssey Number Five marked Powderfinger's first {{successful}} attempt {{to enter the}} United States market. Fanning told Billboard in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, [...] "In America, we haven't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity", with the [...] "vibes" [...] on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream. Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As {{a result of these}} efforts, [...] "My Happiness" [...] was briefly placed on rotation on KROQ-FM and several other radio stations. The song ultimately peaked at #23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. This success was assisted by the band appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman, and by supporting Coldplay on tour. Guitarist Darren Middleton summarised their work in the United States by stating [...] "This year has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a blur." ...|$|E
500|$|England's next {{match was}} a one-off home Test against Sri Lanka and Agnew {{retained}} {{his place in}} the England team. At the time, Sri Lanka were regarded as the minnows of world cricket: this was only their 12th Test match and their first at Lord's, but they dominated the match, taking a 121-run lead on first innings and declaring twice. It was a disappointment for England and, in a batsman-friendly match in which the Sri Lankans racked up 785 runs for just 14 wickets, Agnew suffered. [...] Wisden described England's pacemen as ineffective; Agnew's [...] match figures were 2–177 off 43 overs. Poor performance and a muscle injury limited him to bowling a single over on the last day; later, Agnew reflected on other negative aspects of this match: [...] "I felt a complete outsider, not part of the set-up. I think the feeling in the dressing room was that the game had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a cock-up." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth Deller of {{entertainment}} website Lowculture commented on Paul stating: [...] "He's always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a ladies' man {{and has had}} an eye for a business deal and has always struggled with whether to be good Paul or bad Paul. Ramsay Street's most prolific marry-er and father-er." [...] She also criticises the fact Paul's false leg is never shown on-screen adding: [...] "Paul has a wooden leg, which sometimes causes him to limp, when he remembers about it." [...] Holy Soap have said that Paul starting the Lassiter's fire and killing Gus during his 2004 return, was one of soap opera's greatest comebacks. They also branded him a [...] "legendary figure" [...] of Neighbours. Josephine Monroe in her book Neighbours: The first 10 years, names Paul one of soap opera's most enduring characters. An Inside Soap writer opined that [...] "slimy seducer" [...] Paul remained the same [...] "eighties smooth operator", observing [...] "he's certainly not short of a slick chat-up line or two. He's as skilled a lothario now as he always was." ...|$|E

500|$|She later {{appeared}} in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000). In Cookie's Fortune, {{she was part}} of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal. Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: [...] "This {{is the first time in}} which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma [...] saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey." [...] Entertainment Weekly also noted that Tyler is [...] "sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker". In the romantic comedy, Dr. T & the Women, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted that}} there was a greater focus on Moore's {{keyboards}} than Matheos' guitar riffs. Blogcritics said that [...] "Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore", although Matheos' [...] "heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention." [...] Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free [...] "isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship." [...] Olav Björnsen of Prog4you.com stated that [...] "layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension." [...] He said that Matheos used acoustic and electric guitars [...] "to fill out the soundscapes even more, and is at the most effective when playing the acoustic guitar, giving life and warmth to songs that would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> cold sounding without that input." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Menachem from Billboard {{commented on}} the song, saying it [...] "packs another lyrical punch", while complimenting Allen's vocals. The BBC {{interpreted}} the song, in which Allen [...] " [...] apologises for her avarice, confidently blaming the system", but also complimented the [...] "exquisite" [...] production. Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph suggested that the song confirms that the singer's [...] "pithy observational skills and sweet musicality" [...] remain intact, as she has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bruised by her encounter with 21st-century fame. Clash reporter Natasha Arico concluded that [...] "The Fear" [...] is somewhat trite, though [...] "sickeningly catchy and dance friendly", while Rolling Stone magazine failed to detect the song's sarcasm and criticised the song for being a [...] "cliché" [...] delivered by Allen [...] "with sneer". James Montgomery of MTV gave a good review, saying it is a relatively scathing indictment of today's glossy, [...] "celeb-ified culture". Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork Media described the song to have a [...] "part admission, part brag, part apocalyptic vision" [...] and suggested that [...] "for almost any other artist, the lines would be barbed, sarcastic, and, ultimately, uppity and bland indictments. But not for the loudmouth [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 2.5 out of 4, saying [...] "This isn't a great heist movie {{for a lot}} of reasons, {{beginning}} with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line," [...] but appreciated that the comedy did not [...] "go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words", calling it [...] "funny in an innocent screwball kind of way." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other {{to the rest of the}} cast." [...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN called Abra [...] "unimpressive", but [...] "worth raising" [...] {{because it}} evolves into the [...] "more powerful" [...] Kadabra. GameSpy further commented that Kadabra {{makes up for}} the [...] "shortcomings" [...] of Abra. 1UP FM praised the characters' design, as the hosts noted them as some of their [...] "favorite" [...] Pokémon in the series {{and that they were}} [...] "impressed" [...] with their appearance. GamesRadar editor Henry Gilbert praised Kadabra and Alakazam's mustaches, listing them on their list of [...] "The 10 {{greatest}} mustaches in gaming history". GamesRadar editor Brett Elston labelled Abra's moveset [...] "lame", while acknowledging its potential to evolve into more powerful Pokémon. However, he claimed that Alakazam was [...] "useful" [...] only in [...] "limited" [...] circumstances. Elston also called Alakazam one of the [...] "most disturbing" [...] Pokémon of all time for the game's assertion that its brain cells [...] "continually multiply" [...] until it dies a horrible death. In a poll conducted by IGN, Kadabra was voted as the 91st best Pokémon, where it was called [...] "much cooler" [...] than Alakazam because [...] "He doesn't need to show off by bending two spoons". Alakazam was voted as the 20th best Pokémon, where the staff commented on the evolution line, stating they [...] "not only loved the clever naming system but the creatures' designs and abilities as well". They further stated that [...] "Abra has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a pain to raise and evolve, but the end result, an Alakazam, is well worth it in my book." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get the photo of the boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game.
