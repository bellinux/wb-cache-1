IN any batch of rats given a single oral dose of 9, 1 0 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) for the production of mammary carcinomas some rats will develop several tumours, others only a few and some may develop no tumours at all.

A recent study revealed a surprising positive correlation between increased anxiety and elevated neurogenesis following chronic voluntary wheel running and multiple behavioural testing in mice, suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis {{is involved in the}} genesis of anxiety. To exclude the possible confounding effect of multiple testing that may have occurred in the aforementioned study, we assessed (1) the effects of mouse voluntary wheel running (14 vs. 28 [*]days) on anxiety in just one behavioural test; the open field, and (2), using different markers, proliferation, differentiation, survival and maturation of newly born neurons in the dentate gyrus immediately afterwards. Effects of wheel running on anxiety-related behaviour were confirmed in a separate <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> tested in another test of anxiety, the light/dark box test. Results Running altered measures of locomotion and exploration, but not anxiety-related behaviour in either test. 14 [*]days running significantly increased proliferation, and differentiation and survival were increased after both running durations. 28 [*]day running mice also exhibited an increased rate of maturation. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the amount of proliferation, but not maturation, and anxiety measures in the open field of the 28 [*]day running mice. Conclusions Overall, this evidence suggests that without repeated testing, newly born mature neurons may not be involved in the genesis of anxiety per se. </p...|$|E

Moreover, preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies anesthetize animals during the scan, which limits clinical applications. We investigated the effects of (i) isoflurane anesthesia and (ii) intravenous morphine self-administration (MSA) on BGluM in rats. Jugular vein cannulated adult male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered either saline (SSA) or morphine (0. 5 mg/kg/infusion, 4 h/day for 12 days). All animals were scanned twice with [18 F]-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) -PET/CT at a baseline and at 2 -day withdrawal from self-administration. After the IV injection of FDG, one <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> (n = 14) was anesthetized with isoflurane and the other batch (n = 16) was kept awake during the FDG uptake (45 min). After FDG uptake, all animals were anesthetized in order to perform a PET/CT scan (30 min). Isoflurane anesthesia, {{as compared to the}} awake condition, reduced BGluM in the olfactory, cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia, while increasing BGluM in the midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Morphine self-administered animals exhibited withdrawal signs (piloerection and increased defecation), drug seeking, and locomotor stimulation to morphine (0. 5 mg/kg) during the 2 day withdrawal. The BGluM in the striatum was increased in the MSA group as compared to the SSA group; this effect was observed only in the isoflurane anesthesia, not the awake condition. These findings suggest that the choice of the FDG uptake condition may be important in preclinical PET studies and increased BGluM in the striatum may be associated with opiate seeking in withdrawal...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Electrical and {{pharmacological}} {{stimulation of}} the superior colliculus (SC) has been described to mediate a variety of behaviours ranging from freezing, escape and orientation. Here, we investigated the effect of prolonged optogenetic {{stimulation of the}} SC. Methods: We used the stable step-function opsin (SSFO), a modified ChR 2 channel, which stays active for 20 - 30 minutes. The right SC of C 57 Bl 6 J mice was stereotactically injected with an AAV 2 / 7 -CaMKII-SSFO vector. Stimulation consisted of a 2 s blue light pulse of 50 mW/mm 2 on day 1, 3 and 5 and a different <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> was stimulated with light powers ranging from 0, 05 mW/mm 2 to 50 mW/mm 2. Results: Upon stimulation with the highest light power, all mice displayed strong escape behaviour at first, running around in their cage. After about 30 seconds they quieted down and showed a counter-clockwise turning behaviour for up to 30 minutes. Using lower light power, there was no escape response, leaving only the long-lasting contralateral orientation turning. Conclusions: At high light powers, SSFO-mediated SC stimulation resulted in a short escape response, despite the prolonged nature of the stimulation that is indicated by the long-lasting turning behaviour. These {{findings suggest that the}} circuit for escape behaviour might respond mainly to stimulus onset and loses its responsiveness upon prolonged stimulation. Furthermore, as lower light powers only elicited turning behaviour, stimulus size appears to be an important factor in triggering escape but not orientation. In summary, our data indicate differential response properties of the collicular circuits mediating escape and orientation. status: accepte...|$|E

Now we are in a period of massive global implementation of genomic evaluation, which combines traditional BLUP with huge quantity of genetic SNP markers. Multi-step procedures are now usual in practice, which work with deregressed proofs. Development of methods attained to the single-step procedure (ssGBLUP) which overcomes some difficulties of previous methods, improves reliabilities of evaluation and compares all animals, genotyped and ungenotyped, in entire nation-wide population. Genomic evaluation influence above all young genotyped animals.

40|$|There is high {{incidence}} of hippocampal abnormalities in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), including decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, astrogliosis, low expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and decreased neuronal density in the hilar region, respect of normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Estradiol treatment given for 2 weeks normalized the faulty hippocampal parameters of SHR, without having effects on WKY rats. The present work studied the potential role of local estrogen biosynthesis in the hippocampus of SHR and WKY, by measuring the expression of aromatase, the key enzyme responsible for estrogen biosynthesis and involved in neuroprotection. We used 4 month old male SHR and WKY, half of which received a single sc pellet of 12 mg estradiol benzoate and the remaining half a cholesterol implant. Hippocampi were dissected and processed for aromatase mRNA expression using real time PCR. A second <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> was processed for aromatase and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunocytochemistry. Basal level of aromatase mRNA was higher in SHR respect of WKY. Following estradiol treatment, aromatase mRNA was further increased in the SHR group only. In the hilus of the dentate gyrus of cholesterol-implanted SHR, we found aromatase immunoreactive cell processes and fibers more strongly stained respect of WKY rats. Estradiol treatment of SHR further increased the length of immunoreactive processes and fibers in the hilar region and also increased aromatase immunoreactivity in the CA 1 but not the CA 3 pyramidal cell region. WKY rats were spared from the estradiol effect. Double-labelling experiments showed that aromatase+ processes and fibers of the hilus of SHR-treated rats did no colocalize with GFAP+ astrocyte cell bodies or processes. In conclusion, basal and estradiol-stimulated aromatase expression was enhanced in hypertensive rat hippocampus.

50|$|In 1831, while {{travelling}} in modern-day Botswana, Verreaux {{witnessed the}} burial of a Tswana warrior. Verreaux {{returned to the}} burial site under cover of night to dig up the African's body where he retrieved the skin, the skull and a few bones. Verreaux intended to ship the body back to France and so prepared and preserved the African warrior’s corpse by using metal wire as a spine, wooden boards as shoulder blades and newspaper as a stuffing material. Then he shipped the body to Paris along with a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> stuffed <b>animals</b> in crates. In 1831, the African’s body appeared in a showroom at No. 3, Rue Saint Fiacre. He was later known as Negro of Banyoles, and was returned and buried in Botswana. Verreaux travelled to Australia in 1842 to collect plants. He returned to France in 1851 with a natural history collection reported to contain 15,000 items. In 1864 he took over from Florent Prévost as assistant naturalist at the Paris Museum.|$|R
40|$|Salmonella is a {{major cause}} of food borne disease in Portugal, and animal {{products}} are generally considered as the most important vehicle for the transmission of that Enterobacteriaceae. We studied the role of bovines, swine's, ovine, and poultry products approved for human consumption, eggs and animals feeds, on that transmission, during 1986 - 1989. The results of the incidence study revealed a positivity level of 20, 3 % in bovines, 25, 4 % in swine's, 7, 3 % in ovine, 55 %, 62 % and 7, 2 % in surface, skin and muscle of poultry carcasses respectively, but with significant variations on each <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> About 29 % of shell eggs were contaminated, like 8, 3 % of animals feeds. A considerable variation on the results of the epidemiological markers study was registered. Most prevalent serotypes were Salm. enteritidis (44, 1 %), Salm. anatum (8, 3 %), Salm. newport (6. 6 %), Salm. derby (6, 3 %), Salm. ohio (5, 7 %) and Salm. agona (4, 2 %), in a total of 38 different serotypes, irregularly distributed by the different nature of samples. About 8, 8 % of the 623 studied strains had resistance to one antibiotic, and 3, 3 % were multiple antibioresistance. Most resistant strains were from bovine origin, being Sm"R, Am"R, and Km"R. Three strains were Cm"R. Most of resistant strains of poultry origin were Tc"R. About 73 % of Salm. enteritidis isolated were PT 4, 59, 4 % were fim"+ and 87, 1 % were invasive to guinea pig conjunctival sac.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{involved}} the microscopic {{examination of the}} bovine rectoanal junction (RAJ) collected from a total of 62 slaughter cattle at an abattoir in South East Queensland, Australia. These tissues were examined via an immunohistochemical technique, initially developed {{as part of this}} study, for visual confirmation and evaluation of E. coli O 157 colonisation and specific histopathological criteria were also evaluated to determine if microscopic changes were present within the RAJ mucosa as a result of E. coli O 157 colonisation. Microbial culture results (performed by Dr. Narelle Fegan, Food Science Australia, Cannon Hill) were also obtained from these and other animals with culture results then compared with those obtained via microscopy. In the first instance, this was performed as a double-blinded study whereby bacterial culture and microscopic examination were performed independently without knowledge of the results obtained by other detection methods. Attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions were not observed along the RAJ mucosa of any of the cattle sampled, regardless of colonisation status and level of faecal E. coli O 157 excretion. There {{was no significant difference in}} the numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils, plasma cells or eosinophils within the RAJ mucosa between colonised and non colonised cattle indicating that E. coli O 157 colonisation of the bovine RAJ does not induce a host inflammatory response. Random sampling of a group of cattle presenting for slaughter revealed an overall prevalence of E. coli O 157 culture positive animals of 10 %. In this group of cattle, and in another group of cattle with a known positive shedding status, a single high shedding animal was present with this animal being responsible for over 99 % of the E. coli O 157 shedding within each group. The presence of one of these animals was associated with a prevalence of 30 % culture-positive cattle within the <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> sampled on that particular visit. The immunohistochemical technique developed and utilised in this study was highly specific for E. coli O 157 with no cross-reaction with either of E. coli O 26 :H 11 (EC 473), E. coli O 111 :H- (EC 26) and E. coli O 91 :H 21 (EC 21) serotypes. Utilising an E. coli O 157 -spiked agar gel, it was estimated that this technique allowed for the visual detection of E. coli O 157 bacteria at a minimum concentration of approximately 3. 85 x 103 bacteria/ml. Mucosal-associated bacterial colonies were only observed in one animal, with this animal also shedding the largest faecal concentration of E. coli O 157 (4. 6 x 105 CFU/g faeces) of all cattle within the study. Colonisation of this animal was multifocal rather than diffuse, a total of only 14 bacterial colonies were observed and no colonies were observed in regions immediately overlying mucosal-associated lymphoid follicles. All bacterial colonies were adherent to enterocytes in regions heavily concentrated with submucosal lymphoid follicles, and the number of bacteria per colony varied between 1 and 40...|$|E

40|$|Nine {{dominant}} bacterial isolates {{were obtained}} from different <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> Crassostrea gigas spat experiencing high mortality rates in a French experimental hatchery/nursery in 2007. Using phenotypic analysis combined with multilocus sequence analysis, the isolates were shown to be genetically close to the Vibrio tubiashii type strain. Based on (1) analyses of the recA gene sequences; (2) the results of DNA–DNA hybridization assays between 07 / 118 T 2 (LMG 27884 = CECT 8426), which is a representative strain, and the V. tubiashii type strain (69 %); and (3) phenotypic traits, the bacteria were classified in a group close to American V. tubiashii strain. Its virulence (70 % of mortalities) and the toxicity of the extracellular products of 07 / 118 T 2 was demonstrated (41 % of mortalities). Moreover, a QPCR diagnostic tool targeting the gyrB gene was developed to investigate the epidemiological significance of V. tubiashii in French oyster mortality outbreaks recorded by the national surveillance network. <b>Of</b> the 21 <b>batches</b> originating from hatcheries, only two were positive, whereas V. tubiashii DNA could not be detected in any <b>of</b> the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> moribund <b>animals</b> collected in field/outdoor facilities.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the prevalence of slaughter pigs carrying Salmonella Typhimurium after a entericolitis outbreak in a commercial pig farm. A cross-sectional study was done during the slaughter <b>of</b> a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> 86 <b>animals.</b> Mesenteric lymph nodes from 43 pigs were collected and pre-enriched in buffered peptone water (1 : 10) overnight at 37 ∞C Afterwards, aliquots of 1 mL and 0. 1 mL were transferred to selenite-cystine and Rappaport-Vassiliadis broth, respectively. A loopful of each sample was streaked onto XLT 4 and brilliant green agar plates, which were incubated at 37 ∞C for 24 hours. Salmonella was cultured in 23 out of 43 collected samples (53. 48 %). Salmonella Typhimurim (13 strains) and Salmonella enterica subs. enterica 1, 4, 5, 12 :i:- (10 strains) were isolated. These results indicated that the slaughter <b>of</b> pigs from <b>batches</b> previously affected by enteric salmonellosis may represent a high risk for pork contamination, since there is an positive association between infected pigs before slaughter and carcass contamination...|$|R
40|$|In pig production, within-batch {{variation}} in body weight (BW) gain of piglets during the nursery period (up to 10 weeks of age) can be high and is of high economic importance. Homogeneity <b>of</b> BW within <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is important as it influences {{the efficiency of}} use of the grower and finisher facilities, and provides an extra value for the fattening farms. In the current study, factors for a low BW {{at the end of}} the nursery period of pigs were determined by analysing datasets from three different Swine Research Centres in the Netherlands and France. The entire dataset contained information on 77, 868 individual piglets born in the period between 2005 and 2010. BW was determined at different time points over the pre- and post-weaning phase, and sex, season of birth; litter information (litter size at day of birth and after cross-fostering, number of piglets born alive per litter, number of total born littermates, sow parity number); cross-fostered animals (yes or no), and pen group size over the post-weaning period were recorded. A risk factor analysis approach was used to analyze the datasets to determine factors that predict piglet BW {{at the end of the}} nursery period. BW at the end of the nursery period corrected for age was mainly determined by season (P 0. 05) contribute to explaining the BW at the end of the nursery period. To discard the possibility of intrauterine growth retarded piglets (IUGR) being the reason for the influence of birth weight (BiW) as an explanatory factor in the regression model, a further analysis was performed on the effect of this category of piglets on the results of the regression analysis. Overall, it was concluded that piglet's BW at the end of the nursery phase is mainly determined by season, sex, birth and weaning weight and BW at 6 weeks of age. Piglets with a BiW higher than the mean BiW minus 2. 5 times the SD have the potential to compensate during the subsequent phases of growth...|$|R
