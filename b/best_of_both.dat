5|$|The <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Both</b> Worlds Tour was created, by Kenny Ortega and Michael Cotten, to be video {{intensive}} and {{was meant to}} differentiate Cyrus from Hannah Montana as a performer.

5|$|The {{tour was}} titled <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>Both</b> Worlds Tour after {{the song of}} the same name, which was the theme to Hannah Montana and was {{released}} on the series' first soundtrack.
