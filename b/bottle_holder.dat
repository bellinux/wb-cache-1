25|$|Specializing in climbing, Rasmussen {{showed a}} {{propensity}} for attempting spectacular wins in mountain stages {{in which he}} {{broke away from the}} peloton early and rode alone for most of the stage. Michael Rasmussen was known for his care for detail when considering weight. With a low weight (60kg) he was usually one of the lightest riders in his class. He was known for peeling off unnecessary stickers from his bike, not wearing the Livestrong wristband which was common among many Tour de France riders, due to the additional grams. He used to count each grain of rice before eating and had water with his breakfast cereal, instead of milk. He only carried one water <b>bottle</b> <b>holder</b> and his Colnago Extreme-C bike weighed 6.81kg, only 10g more than the minimum limit.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was a clear}} {{favourite}} to win the match, {{which took}} place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight. He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his <b>bottle</b> <b>holder,</b> with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries. The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men. Johnson's nerve failed him, as did his command of the techniques that had served him well. O'Hara describes that he fought [...] "like a wild man" [...] and, throwing caution to the wind, broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail {{and then to the}} floor. This was the turning point, and O'Hara describes the situation as, [...] "Frightfully beaten, his fists useless, his eyes closed, bathed in blood, and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch, he refuses to surrender." [...] He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan, which generated much disapprobation among the crowd. Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious. Johnson had lost the fight, and his status as champion, in 21minutes. Egan speculated that Johnson's change in style, evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan's abilities or from his gambling problems; either way, [...] "there was a miserable falling off in him altogether!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Most tack used in {{ride and}} ties {{is similar to}} that used in {{endurance}} riding, with light-weight saddles and synthetic bridles and breastplates being popular. Additionally, all horses in ride and tie need to be ridden with a halter or halter-bridle combination to which a tie rope can be attached. [...] The tie rope is approx. 8 ft. (2.4 m) long and is often made of a light-weight climbing rope with a carabiner on one end to make tying and untying easier. The carabiner must be a proper climbing carabiner so it can hold against the force of a horse pulling on it. Ride and tiers also usually ride with sheepskin covers over their saddles to prevent chafing, as competitors generally ride in running clothes (i.e., shorts and T-shirts). Almost all ride and tiers have water <b>bottle</b> <b>holders</b> on their saddles and some wear hydration systems on their own bodies in case they get separated from the horse for longer than intended.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this poster is to develop an {{automated}} production layout along with its design for above mentioned subject. The research work includes designing the fixture for holding the bottle while capping and three-finger self-centering gripper for placing and moving the bottle to and fro from guideways to the <b>bottle</b> bottom <b>holder</b> and vice versa. Suggesting an automated system and technology for checking the water level in bottle and effectively removing such bottles from assembly line would also {{be one of the}} objectives of this poster. Tools like automated torque wrench, precision indexing conveyor belts, three-finger self-centering grippers, three-jaw chuck (bottle holding fixture), infrared level detection sensors have been used in this system. FEA analysis of three-finger gripper and three-jaw chuck is done to verify their design. The components of this system are designed using Creo Parametric 2. 0.

50|$|Starting in 2005, BBGs work {{in teams}} of six, {{two at the}} net, four at the corners, and teams rotate one hour on court, one hour off, (two hours {{depending}} on the court) for the day's play. Teams are not told which court they will be working on the day, to ensure the same standards across all courts. With {{the expansion of the}} number of courts, and lengthening the tennis day, as of 2008, the number of BBGs required is around 250. From the second Wednesday, BBGs are told to leave the Championships, leaving around 80 on the final Sunday. Each BBG receives a certificate, a can of used balls, a group photograph and a programme when leaving. BBG service is paid, with a total of £120-£180 being paid to each ball boyor girl after the 13-day period depending on the number of days served. Every BBG keeps all of their kit, typically consisting of three or four shirts, two or three shorts or skorts, track suit bottoms and top, twelve pairs of socks, three pairs of wristbands, a hat, water <b>bottle</b> <b>holder,</b> bag and trainers.

50|$|The Encanto Gas Holder was {{a natural}} gas holding station {{composed}} of over 9 mi of underground 30 in pipe on about 16 acre of land in Lemon Grove, adjacent {{to the city of}} San Diego. First brought on line in the mid-1950s, the Encanto Gas Holder was decommissioned in 2000-2001 by San Diego Gas and Electric, Sempra Energy as the agent of SDG&E, and the IT Corporation as the main contractor for the decommissioning. TriState was brought on board to abate strips of asbestos-containing pipe coating for another contractor to cut the <b>holder</b> <b>bottle</b> into 40 ft long sections. TriState was later tasked with stripping the coating at the gas holder site despite employee and neighboring residents' concerns of friable asbestos generated as a byproduct of the gross stripping processes employed by SDG&E contractors.|$|R
50|$|Hydration is a {{major part}} of an athlete's daily life. It is {{essential}} for their success both during practice and while competing. As bike technology has evolved, so has the technology for re-fueling the athlete. On a traditional road bike, which has a standard triangular frame, there is more than enough room for two large water-bottles. At most, modern time-trial bikes will hold one water bottle within the frame. High-end time-trial bikes do not have attachments for water bottles within the frame. This lack of water bottle attachments and the need to keep the aero-position throughout a race has not surprisingly {{led to the development of}} aero-hydration systems. Due to this lack of water-bottle storage, there are two main types of aero-hydration systems; behind the saddle (seat) and between the aero-bars. Rear-mounted hydration systems attach to the rail on the saddle and are positioned to smooth the air flow over the rider. These types of systems can either consist of a simple seat-mounted water <b>bottle</b> <b>holder</b> that typically holds two water bottles, or a seat-mounted bladder with a drinking tube running along the frame up to the rider. Front-mounted hydration systems have aero properties similar to those of a rear-mounted system, to create as little wind resistance as possible. A front-mounted system is almost always tucked between the aerobars. The most commonly used type of front-mounted hydration system is a water bottle that tucks between the aerobars with a straw that extends up to the rider but can be folded out of the way when not in use.|$|E

40|$|Water {{sampling}} is {{an important}} item of observation in Oceanography. In general, as in Nansen system, sampling bottle is inverted by sending a messenger weight to strike <b>bottle</b> <b>holder,</b> {{and the depth of}} water sampling is determined from the pay-out length and the inclination angle of wire rope while the calculation is troublesome and unreliable. A new sampling system proposed in this report is composed of a sensor tube and a sampling bottle. The sensor tube reads the water pressure corresponding to the water depth, and at the appointed depth, the sensor release the bottle suspension to be inverted. Therefore, it needs neither sending messenger nor correcting water depth. Many kind of improvement in devices were repeated by the trial and error method, and finally the deviation was settled within five percent in water depth. 潮流や風に左右されずに設定水深で自動的に転倒する採水器を,操作の簡易性に重点を置いて試作した。試行錯誤と改良作業の連続の結果,Acryl No. 2 に至ってほぼ満足すべき性能を得た。以下にその特徴について述べる。(1) 原理的にケーブルの傾斜補正とメッセンジャーの投下が不要になる。(2) 透明プラスチックの採用によって,軽量で断熱性にすぐれ内部の観察に便利である。(3) 総べて市販材料を用いるので手軽に作れる。(4) 特別に動力を必要としないが,バッテリ駆動の魚釣り用線長計付き電動リールを使用すれば,スピードアップと労力節約がはかれる。なお,釣竿を使用すれば転倒時の手応えを増巾することができる。前述のように,採水深度を増すに従って種々の問題点の表面化が予想されるが, 200 m以浅では非常に良好な作動を示した。従って例えば赤潮の鉛直分布のような沿岸域の環境調査に利用すれば,有力な武器となり得るであろう...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} thesis was to prove that mushrooms may have technical applications. It was founded several attempts. Attempts have been founded on a substrate of straw pellets. The pellets had to be thoroughly pulverize the presence of water, at the most granular, in order to equalize the penetration of mushroom mycelia. Were observed following factors: growth rate, mycelium strength and thermal conductivity. The first two experiments were focused on the penetration rate, where {{it was found that}} mycelium grows fastest Lingzhi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), and Trametes versicolor (Trametes versicolor). One attempt was aimed at creating a <b>bottle</b> <b>holder</b> and lamp shades. At this experiment was used oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus). It was found that oyster with sufficient ingrowth without contamination creates strong mycelium can be used as packaging material. The theoretical part will learn about growing mushrooms selected, their appearance, and their medicinal effects of other cultivated species. Researched mushrooms were oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), Lingzhi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), Ohňovec pine (Phellinus pini), Trametes versicolor (Trametes versicolor) and Lentinula edodes...|$|E
