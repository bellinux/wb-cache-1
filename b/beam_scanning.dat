25|$|Soviet rocket {{tests to}} Kamchatka {{during the late}} 1950s {{increased}} interest in Shemya Island, Alaska at the western Aleutians {{as a location for}} monitoring missile tests from the far northeastern Soviet Union. Old site facilities were rehabilitated and new ones constructed on the island, including a large detection radar (AN/FPS-17), which went into operation in 1960. Each of three antenna reflectors were similar to the initial FPS-17 at Diyarbakir but employed a different feed horn array and <b>beam</b> <b>scanning</b> method. In 1961, the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar was constructed nearby. Blue Fox refers to a modification of the AN/FPS-80 tracking radar to the AN/FPS-80(M) configuration in 1964. These radars were closed in the 1970s when the Cobra Dane phased array radar was built to monitor missile tests. Shemya was redesignated from an Air Force station to an Air Force base in 1968.|$|E

The latter can be subdivided in laser Doppler methods systems based on high speed CMOS cameras, and laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) technologies using slow imaging arrays, mostly CCD-based. In <b>scanning</b> <b>beam</b> systems, a collimated laser <b>beam</b> <b>scans</b> the tissue with diffusely back reflected light being captured with a single detector.

40|$|Here we {{summarize}} the initial {{results from a}} complex field radiation pattern measurement of a kinetic inductance detector instrument. These detectors are phase insensitive and have thus been limited to scalar, or amplitude-only, beam measurements. Vector <b>beam</b> <b>scans,</b> of both amplitude and phase, double the information received in comparison to scalar <b>beam</b> <b>scans.</b> Scalar <b>beam</b> measurements require multiple scans at varying distances along the optical path of the receiver to fully constrain the divergence angle of the optical system and locate the primary focus. Vector scans provide this information with a single scan, reducing the total measurement time required for new systems and also limiting the influence of system instabilities. The vector scan can be taken at any point along the optical axis of the system including the near-field, which makes beam measurements possible for large systems at high frequencies where these measurements may be inconceivable to be tested in-situ. Therefore, the methodology presented here should enable common heterodyne analysis for direct detector instruments. In principle, this coherent measurement strategy allows phase dependent analysis to be performed on any direct-detect receiver instrument...|$|R
