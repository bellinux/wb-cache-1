5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceros.</b> Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} been carried out to improve the {{knowledge}} on the feeding ecology and impacts of fire on <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> browse abundance in southern Serengeti National Park. It attempts to enlighten on forage preferences of the megaherbivore and investigate the effects of fire on abundance of their preferred vegetation species. Plant species were sampled in 64 rhino foraging plots, 300 random plots, and 198 plots with known occurrence of fire history to estimate abundances and extent of plant species browsed and the preferred species response to fire history. Additionally, a total of 15 fresh <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> dungs were collected for DNA metabarcoding analysis to ascertain relative plant species composition of the animals diet. Across all 64 rhino foraging plots, rhinoceroses preferred 9 plant species: 5 forbs (Crotalaria barkae, Justicia betonica, Indigofera basiflora, Achyranthes aspera, Indogofera volkensii), 3 shrubs (Ziziphus abyssinica, Hibiscus species, Abutilon species), and 1 tree (Acacia sieberiana). A total of 72 taxa were identified in the rhinoceros s dung by DNA analysis, and the most important genera found are Crotalaria, Indigofera, Solanum, Euphorbia and Vachellia. The study concludes that; <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> mainly prefer forbs; DNA metabarcoding is an efficient method to study rhino forage preference, and frequent fires may decrease preferred rhino forage. To understand the response of preferred species to fire, it is important to make manipulative studies with fire to comprehend how species grow and reproduce with and without fire...|$|R

500|$|Zoologist Robert M. Alexander has {{suggested}} that overheating {{may have been a}} serious problem in Paraceratherium due to its size. According to Prothero, the best living analogues for Paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses. To aid in thermoregulation, these animals cool down during the day by resting in the shade or by wallowing in water and mud. They also forage and move mainly at night. Because of its large size, Paraceratherium {{would not have been able}} to run and move quickly, but they would have been able to cross large distances, which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food. They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory. Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least [...] and that, because of a scarcity of resources, there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera. This principle is called competitive exclusion; it is used to explain how the <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> (a browser) and white rhinoceros (a grazer) exploit different niches in the same areas of Africa.|$|E

In the present study, faecal samples from three <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (Diceros bicornis michaeli) were collected at about weekly intervals during oestrous cycles and pregnancy. Daily samples were taken during the week after parturition. Total immunoreactive progestagens in faecal extracts were analysed with three different enzymeimmunoassays (EIA) that had considerable specificity for progestagens containing either a 20 =ahydroxylor a 20 -keto group. With each EIA {{it was possible to}} distinguish between the follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. Mating corresponded with low concentrations of faecal progestagens. Samples from five and six consecutive cycles were available from two rhinoceroses and cycle lengths of 24 and 26. 5 days were calculated. All three animals became pregnant and the duration of gestation ranged from 440 to 470 days. After fertilization, the concentration of progestagens increased continuously, as in the luteal phase, reaching values 5 =n- 0 times higher between days 60 and 250. During the two weeks before parturition faecal progestagens declined and within 3 =n- days post partum had reached follicular phase values.

500|$|The largest skulls of Paraceratherium {{are around}} [...] long, [...] {{at the back}} of the skull, and [...] wide across by the {{zygomatic}} arches. Paraceratherium had a long forehead, which was smooth and lacked the roughened area that serves as attachment point for the horns of other rhinoceroses. The bones above the nasal region are long and the nasal incision goes far into the skull. This indicates that Paraceratherium had a prehensile upper lip similar to that of the <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceros</b> and the Indian rhinoceros, or a short proboscis or trunk as in tapirs. The back of the skull was low and narrow, without the large lambdoid crests at the top and along the sagittal crest, which are otherwise found in horned and tusked animals that need strong muscles to push and fight. It also had a deep pit for the attachment of nuchal ligaments, which hold up the skull automatically. The occipital condyle was very wide and Paraceratherium appears to have had large, strong neck muscles, which allowed it to sweep its head strongly downwards while foraging from branches. One skull of P. transouralicum has a domed forehead, whereas others have flat foreheads, possibly because of sexual dimorphism. A brain endocast of P. transouralicum shows it was only 8 percent of the skull length, while the brain of the Indian rhinoceros is 17.7 percent of its skull length.|$|E

40|$|To {{test whether}} mineral {{recommendations}} for horses {{are likely to}} guarantee adequate mineral provision for <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (Diceros bicornis), we investigated the apparent absorption (aA) of macro- and microminerals in eight <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> from three zoological institutions {{in a total of}} 32 feeding trials with total faecal collection, with additional data from three unpublished studies (18 feeding trials). Feeds and faeces were analysed for Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Co. The resulting aA coefficients, and the linear relationships of apparently absorbable dietary mineral content to total dietary mineral content [per 100 g dry matter (DM) ], were compared with data for domestic horses. Rhinoceroses had significantly higher aA coefficients for Ca and Mg (because of a higher calculated 'true' absorption), and lower ones for Na and K (because of calculated higher endogenous faecal losses). High absorption efficiency for divalent cations is hypothesized to be an adaptation to a natural diet of particularly high Ca:P ratio (approximately 14 : 1); an effective removal of Ca from the ingesta guarantees sufficient P availability at the fermentation site in the hindgut. Higher faecal losses of Na and K are hypothesized to be linked to a higher faecal bulk per DM intake in <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> as compared with horses because of a generally lower digestive efficiency. There were no relevant differences in the absorption patterns of microminerals. In particular, there were no discernable differences in Fe absorption within the rhinoceroses for diets with and without tannin supplementation. Several of the zoo diets assessed in this study were deficient in Cu, Mn or Zn, and most contained excessive levels of Fe when compared with horse requirements. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} differences in mineral absorption between occur even between species of similar digestive anatomy; that in particular, Ca absorption might vary between hindgut fermenters with Ca:P ratio in their natural diet; that Na might be a particularly limiting factor in the ecology of free-ranging rhinoceroses; that moderate doses of tannins do not seem to markedly influence mineral absorption; and that diets for captive animals should contain adequate, but not excessive mineral levels...|$|R

40|$|African {{elephants}} (Loxodonta africana) and <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> (Diceros bicornis) are charismatic mammals {{that help}} draw visitors into zoological institutions.

Limitations of the zoo environment, such as constraints on exhibit size, social complexity, and behavior, {{may be associated with}} health and behavioral problems seen in both species and thought to be exacerbated in northern, temperate climates. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how the behavioral patterns of two large-bodied African ungulate species were affected by seasonal changes in a northern climate zoo. The behavior of three African elephants and three <b>black</b> <b>rhinoceroses</b> was observed for one year at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. We found average resting levels of African elephants and black rhinos were similar to expected values based on data from wild and captive studies. Both species adapted their behavior to cope with high temperatures and increased sun exposure. Increased time spent inside during winter months was associated with decreased investigatory behaviors in elephants and decreased locomotion in rhinos. To increase species-typical behaviors, exhibits should include substrates for dusting, mud wallows, shade structures, and resting sites for all individuals. Time spent feeding may be increased through natural food items such as browse. Indoor exhibits should include environmental variation, enrichment, and adequate space so as to encourage these behaviors. Physiological and health measurements might be measured to determine sufficient levels of exercise for zoo-housed elephants and rhinos. // // </script...|$|R
