5|$|Atlético did {{not take}} part in any {{continental}} competitions in 1999, but as Série A runner-up in that year the club qualified for the 2000 Copa Libertadores and the 2000 Copa Mercosur. The latter was a new continental competition introduced in 1998, which eventually replaced both the Copa CONMEBOL and the Supercopa Libertadores for clubs in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. In its return to the Copa Libertadores after nineteen years, Atlético was drawn in Group 8, with Bolivian Club Bolívar, Uruguayan side Bella Vista, and Chile's Cobreloa. Atlético's form in the group stage was erratic, <b>but</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ensure qualification for the next stage in second place. The team won its three home matches, which included a joint-record 60 victory against Cobreloa, and lost the three away ones, also with a joint-record, a 40 defeat against Bolívar. In the round of 16, the team faced Brazilian side Atlético Paranaense, which it eliminated by a score of 53 in a penalty shootout, after winning 10 at home and losing 21 away. The team's opponent in the quarter-finals was Corinthians, winner of the previous year's Série A finals over Atlético. After drawing 11 at the Mineirão, Atlético was defeated 21 in São Paulo and eliminated.|$|E

25|$|Juddering, shuddering and moaning: This {{is caused}} by an {{irregular}} and unstable flow from the second stage, It {{may be caused by}} a slight positive feedback between flow rate in the second stage body and diaphragm deflection opening the valve, which is not sufficient to cause free-flow, <b>but</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause the system to hunt. It is more common on high-performance regulators which are tuned for maximum flow and minimum work of breathing, particularly out of the water, and often reduces or resolves when the regulator is immersed and the ambient water damps the movement of the diaphragm and other moving parts. Desensitising the second stage by closing venturi assists or increasing the valve spring pressure often stops this problem. Juddering may also be caused by excessive but irregular friction of valve moving parts.|$|E

500|$|Woods, Bagot, Jory & Laybourne-Smith {{had entered}} the 1924 {{competition}} with an arch designed by Walter Bagot, but in 1926 Bagot was away in Europe. Thus Laybourne-Smith was responsible for drawing and submitting the final design, although he was clear to highlight the role Bagot played in the [...] "architectural conception" [...] of the monument. While the firm was to be awarded 6% {{of the cost of}} the memorial, they refused all <b>but</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cover their own expenses, asking instead that residues (approximately £1000) be placed in a trust fund to pay for the upkeep of the work. While this is seen as an altruistic act, Richardson noted that Laybourne-Smith was both a member of the National War Committee and sat on the sub-committee which drafted the rules of the competition, and thus it may have been considered [...] "improper" [...] to accept the money.|$|E
500|$|TNM02067 (Tanzanian National Museums {{specimen}} 02067) is a fragmentary fossil dentary (lower jaw) {{from the}} Cretaceous (between 146 and 66 million years ago) of Tanzania. The short, deep bone is about [...] long, but the back part is broken off. It contains a large, forward-inclined incisor with a root that extends {{deep into the}} jaw, separated by a diastema (gap) from five cheekteeth. Very little remains of the teeth, <b>but</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> determine that they are hypsodont (high-crowned). The third cheektooth is the largest and {{the roots of the}} teeth are curved. First described in 2003, TNM 02067 has been tentatively identified as a sudamericidan extinct family of high-crowned gondwanathere mammals otherwise known from South America, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica. If truly a gondwanathere, it would be the only African member of the group and may be the oldest. The describers could not exclude other possibilities, such as that the jaw represents some mammalian group known only from younger, Cenozoic times (less than 66 million years ago).|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, the Astros started poorly {{and found}} {{themselves}} with a 15-30 record in late May. The Houston Chronicle had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with [...] "RIP 2005 Astros". However, from that low point {{until the end of}} July, Houston went 42–17 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single month record in the club's history at 22-7. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months. [...] The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt (20–12, 2.94), Andy Pettitte (17–9, 2.39), and Roger Clemens (13–8 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87). The contributions of the other starters—Brandon Backe (10–8, 4.76) and rookie starters Ezequiel Astacio (3–6, 5.67) and Wandy Rodríguez (10–10, 5.53)—were less remarkable, <b>but</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> push the Astros into position for a playoff run.

2500|$|However, {{some critics}} viewed the album's sound as unoriginal and dated. Johnny Dee of Virgin Media said [...] "Flesh Tone marks a thrilling {{comeback}} ... The only complaint {{is that at}} 9 tracks it feels a little light." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquenmani was more critical of Kelis' direction towards dance music, stating that the album [...] "sounds dated in {{the worst kind of}} way—that is, not enough to sound retro-cool, <b>but</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sound totally uncool. It helps that the album ... segued together with interludes that are more interesting than the actual songs. Flesh Tone should sound desperate, but it often sounds inspired instead. Kelis seems electrified by her new genre shift, and the result is an album that's one of her most consistent to date." [...] Kaya Burgess of The Times pointed out that 'Acapella' and 'Home' are the only tracks which [...] "stand out from an otherwise rather copy-and-paste collection of electronic numbers". Magaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times expressed that Kelis has managed to [...] "make a spirited but disciplined set of classic Euro-club bangers. Sometimes they're darkly contemplative, slipping into trance; other times they nearly rip at the seams ... it's clear that Kelis has carved out a new niche for herself, dancing in front of the turntables till the lights come on, if they dare." [...] Sam Richards of Uncut complimented its fusion of [...] "R sass to thumping club beats" [...] and stated [...] "most everything Kelis touches drips with class". Gavin Haynes of the NME felt that [...] "Flesh Tone has already filled out an application form for pop record of the year" [...] and stated, [...] "Her ability to appear unimpeachably cool hasn't wavered either. But these are as nothing. What's important here is simply her direction: a genuinely innovative bearing that breaks new ground for pop without sounding any less pop for it. Kelis. Genius.
