From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a <b>Black-necked</b> <b>cobra</b> raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E

25|$|Most bites {{occur in}} {{industrial}} plantations, which attract {{many types of}} snake prey. Banana plantations are associated with vipers such as night adders, while rubber and palm tree plantations attract elapids, including cobras and black mambas. Important cobra species include the forest <b>cobra</b> and the <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra.</b> In forested areas of Guinea, cobras may inflict more than 30% of all venomous bites.|$|R
25|$|Snake toxins {{vary greatly}} in their functions. Two broad classes of toxins found in snake venoms are {{neurotoxins}} (mostly found in elapids) and hemotoxins (mostly found in viperids). However, {{there are exceptions}} — the venom of the <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra</b> (Naja nigricollis), an elapid, consists mainly of cytotoxins, while that of the Mojave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus), a viperid, is primarily neurotoxic. There are numerous other types of toxin which both elapids and viperids may carry.|$|R

50|$|Venom {{from this}} species {{is very similar}} in {{composition}} {{to that of other}} spitting <b>cobras,</b> including the <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra</b> (N. nigricollis) and the red spitting cobra (N. pallida), which are both found in the same areas. It consists of postsynaptic neurotoxins and cytotoxins. However, this species is capable of injecting a much larger volume of venom in a single bite compared to the others. A single specimen milked at Bio-Ken Snake Farm in 2004 produced a wet venom yield of 6.2 ml, weighed 7.1 g and contained nearly 3 g of toxins.|$|R

50|$|Its {{differences}} to other spitting ketan cobras were {{realized in the}} 1960s, but the species was initially regarded by most merely as a brown-coloured form of the <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra</b> (N. nigricollis). Thus, N. ashei was only classified as a distinct species in 2007, by Wolfgang Wüster (Bangor University Wales) and Donald Broadley (Biodiversity Foundation for Africa). Royjan Taylor (Director of the Bio-Ken Snake Farm in Watamu, Kenya) was instrumental in providing specimens, among them the holotype. The specific epithet honors the late James Ashe, who founded the Bio-Ken Snake Farm {{and was one of}} the first experts to suggest N. ashei was a new species.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new species}} of giant spitting cobra, Naja ashei sp. nov., from eastern and north-eastern Africa. The species was previously regarded as a colour phase of the <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra,</b> N. nigricollis. However, mtDNA sequence data show it to be {{more closely related to}} N. mossambica than N. nigricollis. The new species is diagnosable from all other African spitting cobras by the possession of a unique clade of mtDNA haplotypes and a combination of colour pattern and scalation characteristics. Its distribution includes the dry lowlands of northern and eastern Kenya, north-eastern Uganda, southern Ethiopia and southern Somalia.

40|$|Abstract- In {{the current}} study, the {{lethality}} {{as well as}} the immunological, biochemical and histological effects of Naja nigricollis (<b>Black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra)</b> venom at a sublethal dose has been investigated before and after exposure to gamma radiation (1. 5 KGy and 3 KGy). Data revealed that the toxicity of irradiated venom (1. 5 KGy & 3 KGy) decreased as compared to that of the native one. The LD 50 for native and gamma-irradiated (1. 5 KGy & 3 KGy) Naja nigricollis venom was 0. 440 mg/kg, 4. 79 mg/kg and 5. 38 mg/kg, respectively. Irradiation of the whole venom with (1. 5 kGy & 3 kGy) reduced its lethality 10. 8 and 12. 22 times as compared to its native venom, respectively. The immunodiffusion technique showed same number of precipitin bands against polyvalent antivenin with the native and the two dose levels gamma-irradiated venoms. There was no change in the antigenic reactivity between both native an...|$|R
50|$|Marven was {{bitten by}} a venomous green pit viper in East Malaysian state Sabah in the summer 2014 during filming the first episode of the show called Eating Wild. The snake bit him on the thumb but did not inject too much venom, so Marven spent 6 hours in the hospital, until he had recovered. He has also had a few other very {{dangerous}} encounters with venomous snakes. While he was producing the BBC film The Serpent's Embrace in 1980s, a spitting cobra sprayed its venom into his eyes. He spent 2-3 days in hospital, though luckily the venom did not enter his blood. A similar encounter happened in December 2008 while Marven was making a short film about <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobras</b> for Webosaurs. Though he wore a mask, the cobra venom landed in Marven's hair, then mixed with sweat and ran into his eyes, so he stopped the filming until next morning. In his 2008 series Jaguar Adventure he was {{bitten by a}} mildly toxic venomous false water cobra. His hand swelled up within ten minutes, {{but there were no}} other harmful effects.|$|R
40|$|Cases of snakebite {{envenomation}} {{are frequently}} presented to veterinary practitioners in southernAfrica. Despite this, no published guidelines exist onhowthis medical emergency should be managed. Southern African snake venoms {{can be classified}} into 3 main types based on the main mechanism of venom action and clinical presentation. A polyvalent antivenom is manufactured in South Africa and contains antibodies against the most important southern African snake venoms. The cytotoxic venoms are represented mainly by the puff-adder (Bitis arietans), Mozambique spitting <b>cobra</b> (Naja mossabica), <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobra</b> (Naja nigricollis) (in the Western Cape and Namibia) and the stiletto snake (Atractaspis bibronii). These venoms may cause dramatic local swelling, high morbidity and low mortality and infrequently {{require the use of}} antivenom for survival (the only cytotoxic venoms used to prepare the antivenom are the puff-adder and Mozambique spitting cobra). The neurotoxic venoms (represented chiefly by the non-spitting cobras and mambas) cause high mortality due to rapid onset of paresis and require antivenom and mechanical ventilatory support which is life-saving. The boomslang (Dispholidus typus) and the vine snake (coagulopathic venom) rarely bite humans but dogs may be bitten more frequently. These venoms cause a consumption coagulopathy and successful treatment of boomslang bites requires the use of snake species-specific monovalent antivenom. There is no antivenom available for treating vine snake (Thelotornis capensis), berg adder (Bitis atropos), night adder (Causus spp.), stiletto snake and other lesser adder bites. There are some important differences between the way snakebites are managed in humans and dogs...|$|R
40|$|Snakebites cause {{considerable}} {{human and}} livestock injuries {{as well as}} deaths worldwide, and particularly have a high impact in sub-Saharan Africa. Generating a basic platform {{of information on the}} characteristics of snakes and snakebites in various countries is relevant for designing and implementing public health interventions. This study was performed to identify types of snakes and some of the characteristics of snakebite cases in two communities, an agricultural and a pastoralist, in Arusha region, northern Tanzania. A total of 30 field visits were carried out in areas considered by local inhabitants to be potential microhabitats for snakes. Direct observation of snake types based on morphological features and a structured questionnaire were employed for data collection. A total of 25 live and 14 dead snakes were encountered. Among the dead ones, the following species were identified: two <b>black-necked</b> spitting <b>cobras</b> (Naja nigricollis); five puff adders (Bitis arietans), one common egg-eater (Dasypeltis scabra); two rufous-beaked snakes (Ramphiophis rostratus); two brown house snakes (Lamprophis fuliginosus); one Kenyan sand boa (Eryx colubrinus), and one black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis). The frequency of snake encounters was significantly higher (χ (2) [*]=[*] 4. 6; p[*]=[*] 0. 03) in the pastoral than in the agricultural area; there were more snakebite cases in the former, but the differences were not statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 7). A total of 242 snakebite victims attended at the Meserani Clinic, located in the study area, between the years 2007 to 2012. Of all cases, 146 (61. 6 %) and 96 (38. 4 %) were male and female patients, respectively. As for age distribution, 59. 1 % of snakebite victims were from the economically active age groups between 15 and 55 years. Snakebites are a threat to rural communities and public health in general. The burden of snakebites in Tanzania presents an epidemiologically similar picture to other tropical countries. Livestock keeping and agriculture are the major economic activities associated with snakebites. Community-based public education is required to create awareness on venomous snakes and predisposing factors to snakebites. These tasks demand integration of diverse stakeholders to achieve a common goal of reducing the impact of human suffering from these envenomings in Tanzania...|$|R
