His father, David <b>Bossin</b> (1905-1963), was a booking agent for nightclubs. Two of Bob's uncles were writers. Hye <b>Bossin</b> was a columnist and editor, and Art Arthur (né <b>Bossin)</b> was a screen writer. Arthur wrote the 1946 Academy-Award-winning documentary, Seeds of Destiny.|$|E
50|$|After {{a series}} of gigs at Vancouver's Expo '86 Stringband {{effectively}} dissolved, with Hammond and <b>Bossin</b> electing to concentrate on their solo careers. <b>Bossin</b> has continued to record on Nick Records, Hammond on her own label.|$|E

5000|$|As a boy, <b>Bossin</b> fell in {{love with}} the early rock 'n rollers - Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent - but by 1958 he had turned his ear to folk music. [...] The variety, earthiness and {{politics}} of folk songs so captivated <b>Bossin</b> that the genre became his musical home for the next half century.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bossin</b> {{graduated}} from the University of Toronto in 1968. His university years coincided with the zenith of student and youth activism in Canada: the civil rights movement, {{opposition to the war}} in Vietnam, anti-nuclear and disarmament campaigns, and the nascent environment and feminist movements all engaged young people, <b>Bossin</b> among them. He became, and remained, a lifelong activist and social critic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bossin</b> {{lives on}} Gabriola Island, British Columbia with his wife, fabric artist and illustrator, Sima Elizabeth Shefrin. Shefrin's graphic novella, Embroidered Cancer Comic (Singing Dragon, London, 2016) {{is based on}} their life {{together}} after Bossin's 2011 diagnosis with prostate cancer. Shefrin also illustrated Bossin's chap book, Latkes (Nick Books, 2005). <b>Bossin</b> has two children, Madelyn ("Gee"), born in 1993 and Davy, born in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Those same years saw a {{revamping}} of CBC Radio by young, engaged journalists {{recruited from}} the student press, among them Doug Ward, Volkmar Richter, Mark Starowitz, and Peter Gzowski. When Gzowski became editor of Maclean's Magazine in 1971, he assigned 25-year-old <b>Bossin</b> a regular column. <b>Bossin</b> would continue to write essays and articles, and produce radio documentaries, for many years. But his main focus was music.|$|E

5000|$|Stringband's second album, National Melodies (1975), {{contained}} two {{of their}} best-known songs, [...] "Dief Will Be The Chief Again", and the risque [...] "Show Us The Length". <b>Bossin</b> attempted to shop the album to several Canadian labels, but they all passed, as they felt that the record had little commercial potential (and no commercial potential outside Canada). However, Al Mair of Attic Records {{took the time to}} explain to <b>Bossin</b> and Hammond that they could actually make more money selling a few thousand copies of the album on their own label than they could selling 10,000 albums on someone else's. <b>Bossin</b> took the advice to heart, and Stringband remained a totally independent band, with all their original releases being issued on Bossin's Nick Records imprint.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, <b>Bossin</b> {{recruited}} singer-songwriter Nancy Ahern as {{a replacement}} for Hammond—but at Hammond's insistence, this trio was not initially allowed to bill themselves as Stringband.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Stringband {{songwriter}} Bob <b>Bossin</b> {{was watching}} the Muhammad Ali - Joe Frazier title fight with Bob Rae, who would later become premier of Ontario. After Ali regained his title after a gap of many years by winning the bout, Rae commented that with Ali's victory, other events from the late Fifties and early Sixties could now recur: Floyd Patterson could now defeat Ali, Marilyn Bell could swim Lake Ontario again, and Diefenbaker could again be Prime Minister. <b>Bossin</b> was inspired to write the song.|$|E
50|$|She {{appeared}} in the 2002 documentary CKUA: Radio Worth Fighting For. Many artists have used her songs such as Niamh Parsons (The Peddler), Bob <b>Bossin</b> (We Were Good People), Aengus Finnan (Orphan Hand), The Outside Track (Poor Lonesome Hen) and others.|$|E
50|$|After the departures of Ahern and King, <b>Bossin</b> quickly invited Hammond to re-join the group. She agreed, on the proviso that Stringband {{would become}} a {{part-time}} enterprise that would allow her time to pursue her solo career, {{as well as her}} playwriting and other interests. <b>Bossin,</b> looking to pursue some solo endeavours of his own, agreed. Adding new violinist Zeke Mazurek and the group's first permanent bassist, Dennis Nichol, beginning in January 1980 Stringband resumed touring and playing folk festivals a few months each year. A live recording from the new line-up (Stringband Live!) was issued later in 1980; it also included guest contributions from former Stringband members King, Ahern and Mink.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1930s Dave <b>Bossin,</b> Bob's father, was {{a notable}} figure in Toronto's {{gambling}} underworld. Intrigued by his father's history, Bob collected stories about [...] "Davy the Punk" [...] (Dave Bossin's underworld nickname) and the race-track milieu he inhabited. In 2014, The Porcupine's Quill published Davy the Punk: A Story of Bookies, Toronto the Good, the Mob and my Dad to glowing reviews. Subsequently the book won the Pinsky-Givon prize for non-fiction and was short-listed for the Vine Prize. It {{also received a}} citation from Heritage Toronto. <b>Bossin</b> then based a one-person musical, also called Davy the Punk, on the book. The show toured Canada for several years. A film version is planned.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the late}} 1970s {{to the late}} 1990s, {{the fate of the}} {{wilderness}} of Vancouver Island's Clayoquot Sound was one of Canada's most hard-fought environmental causes. <b>Bossin</b> was involved from the beginning. He wrote songs and articles and produced radio documentaries, including [...] "What Happened at Clayoquot" [...] for CBC Radio's flagship Ideas program. One song, Sulphur Passage (No pasaran) was made into a music video by documentary director, Nettie Wild. Sung by a Who's Who of British Columbia folk artists - <b>Bossin,</b> Stephen Fearing, Roy Forbes, Veda Hille, Ann Mortifee, Raffi, Rick Scott, Valdy and Jennifer West - Sulphur Passage won a half-dozen awards. The video can be seen through the links section below. Sulphur Passage became the anthem of the Clayoquot protesters and {{played a significant role in}} the preservation of the Clayoquot forest.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, {{the advent}} of a new {{generation}} of nuclear weapons - Pershing, Trident and Cruise missiles - re-aroused the nuclear disarmament movement that had begun in the late 1940s. In Vancouver BC, tens of thousands marched in an annual Walk for Peace. The Vancouver East Cultural Centre commissioned <b>Bossin</b> to write a peace-themed show to coincide with the 1986 march. <b>Bossin</b> believed that the arms race would only be stopped by the activism of ordinary citizens, a [...] "home remedy", so he created a musical medicine show, Bossin's Home Remedy for Nuclear War. The show was first directed by Jackie Crosland, and then, in subsequent stagings, by Colin Thomas, Peter Froehlich and Simon Webb. Home Remedy toured Canada, the U.S., New Zealand and Australia, selling over 9000 bottles of [...] "Dr. Bossin's" [...] potion.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 <b>Bossin</b> met Marie-Lynn Hammond, a young, bilingual {{singer and}} song-writer. He {{recruited}} Jerry Lewycky, a violin student at University of Toronto's Faculty of Music, to accompany them on fiddle. The configuration - guitar, banjo, fiddle and voices - {{was that of}} a string band, one of the traditional North American folk music forms.|$|E
5000|$|Stringband {{recorded}} many <b>Bossin</b> songs. Among {{the most}} popular were [...] "Daddy Was a Ballplayer" [...] (1972), [...] "Dief Will Be the Chief Again" [...] (1974), [...] "Lunenberg Concerto" [...] (1974), [...] "Show Us the Length" [...] (1974), [...] "Tugboats" [...] (1977), [...] "The Casca and the Whitehorse Burned Down" [...] (1978), and [...] "Newfoundlanders" [...] (1978).|$|E
5000|$|Diefenbaker {{eventually}} cooled to the song. When Bossin's mother {{learned of}} Diefenbaker's changed attitude, {{she called her}} son, [...] "Honey, I think he's on to us." [...] In a final interview before his 1979 death, Diefenbaker stated {{that he had no}} comment about it. <b>Bossin</b> indicated that he had no idea why The Chief had come to have reservations about the song.|$|E
5000|$|The {{carillon}} {{was given}} to the city by Daimler-Benz AG under CEO Edzard Reuter in 1987 on the occasion of Berlin's 750th birthday.

Billy Rautenbach would be excluded from ownership in the new company due to the hostile relations that had developed {{between him and the}} DRC government.|$|E
5000|$|After Stringband disbanded in 1986, <b>Bossin</b> {{released}} several solo albums including Gabriola V0R1X0 (1994) and The Roses on Annie's Table (2005), {{the latter}} produced by Vancouver art-rock diva, Veda Hille.

50|$|The {{award was}} first {{established}} in 1949 by the Canadian Association for Adult Education, under a steering committee {{that included the}} National Film Board's James Beveridge, the Canadian Foundation's Walter Herbert, filmmaker F. R. Crawley, the National Gallery of Canada's Donald Buchanan and diplomat Graham McInnes. The initial jury consisted of Hye <b>Bossin,</b> managing editor of Canadian Film Weekly; M.

50|$|On August 26, 2006, Hammond {{was thrown}} from her horse while horseback riding, and {{sustained}} serious injuries.

The accident has left her with a visual impairment, but she has otherwise recovered and working (and riding) again.|$|E
5000|$|According to <b>Bossin</b> in a CBC interview, the song, {{which he}} {{described}} as [...] "very Canadian", is written {{from the viewpoint of}} someone with a complex character, and who mixes hope and nostalgia. [...] The song's lyrics look nostalgically back at 1957, when Diefenbaker became Prime Minister, but in the chorus states that when Diefenbaker is Chief again, a dollar will be [...] "worth a dollar again", an apparent reference to the devaluation of the Canadian dollar which cost Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives dearly in the 1962 election.|$|E
5000|$|With only {{a handful}} of Canadian films {{released}} each year, they were generally a small affair. In 1957, The Globe and Mail columnist Ronald Johnson criticized the awards' publicity efforts, noting that even <b>Bossin</b> was not actually receiving the press releases and that many of the releases which were going out were being sent to journalists not involved in covering or reporting on film. The paper's film critic Jay Scott later described them as [...] "honours given by presenters no one knew, to recipients no one recognized, to films no one had seen." ...|$|E
