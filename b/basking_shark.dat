5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel sharks. They include the goblin shark, <b>basking</b> <b>shark,</b> megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{permanent}} display encompasses mineralogical and petrographical collections, {{as well as}} {{a collection}} of animals, the bulk of which dates back to the 19th century. The zoological collection is {{on the second floor of}} the museum. It includes the skeleton of a Mediterranean monk seal, a <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> native to the Adriatic Sea and an Atlantic puffin, a bird today native to the Arctic area, which is believed to have nested in the Adriatic in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Basking</b> <b>sharks</b> do not hibernate, and {{are active}} year-round. In winter, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> often move to deeper depths, even down to [...] {{and have been}} tracked making {{vertical}} movements consistent with feeding on overwintering zooplankton.|$|R
5000|$|Gavin Maxwell, who fished for <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> {{nearby in}} 1947, {{recorded}} a mass sighting of <b>basking</b> <b>sharks.</b> “It was a gigantic shoal ... at one moment we counted 54 dorsal fins in sight {{at the same}} time.” ...|$|R
25|$|Argos system {{satellite}} tagging of 20 <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> in 2003 confirmed <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> move {{thousands of}} kilometres {{during the summer}} and winter, seeking the richest zooplankton patches, often along ocean fronts. They shed and renew their gill rakers in an ongoing process, rather than over one short period.|$|R
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, dunlin, lapwing and ringed plover. The islands also provide a habitat for other important species such as corncrake, hen harrier, golden eagle and otter. Offshore, <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> and various species of whale and dolphin can often be seen, and the remoter islands' seabird populations are of international significance. St Kilda has 60,000northern gannets, amounting to 24% of the world population; 49,000breeding pairs of Leach's petrel, up to 90% of the European population; and 136,000pairs of puffin and 67,000northern fulmar pairs, about 30% and 13% of the respective UK totals. Mingulay is an important breeding ground for razorbills, with 9,514pairs, 6.3% of the European population.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from direct}} catches, {{by-catches}} in trawl nets {{have been one}} of several threats to <b>basking</b> <b>sharks.</b> In New Zealand, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> had been abundant historically, however, after the mass by-catches recorded in 1990s and 2000s, confirmations of the species became very scarce.

25|$|As {{a result}} of rapidly declining numbers, the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> has been {{protected}} in some territorial waters and trade in its products is restricted in many countries under CITES. Among others, it is fully protected in the United Kingdom and the Atlantic and Mexican Gulf regions of the United States. Since 2008, it has been illegal to fish for, or retain if accidentally caught, basking sharks in waters of the European Union. It is partially protected in Norway and New Zealand, as targeted commercial fishing is illegal, but accidental bycatch can be used (in Norway any <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> caught as bycatch and still alive must be released). As of March 2010, it was also listed under Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks Memorandum of Understanding.|$|E
25|$|Cetaceans {{that can}} be seen in the {{surrounding}} waters include minke whales, porpoises, dolphins, and pilot whales. Whales occasionally get beached on the island, more recent examples including 1966 (pilot), 1987 (pilot) and 1991 (two sperm whales). Grey seals and <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> also frequent the area.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{a previously}} unreported feeding association between Grey Phalaropes Phalaropus fulicarius and <b>Basking</b> <b>Sharks</b> Cetorhinus maximus. The observations were made during effort-based visual monitoring from Gwennap Head in southwest Cornwall, in October 2008. Flocks {{of up to}} 50 Grey Phalaropes were seen to follow and aggregate around surface-feeding <b>Basking</b> <b>Sharks,</b> mostly in an area characterised by a prominent tidal-topographic front. It is proposed that Grey Phalaropes were initially attracted to visual manifestations of upwellings and convergence zones over and adjacent to this front (with enhanced surficial prey availability), and then opportunistically used the tall dorsal fins of foraging <b>Basking</b> <b>Sharks</b> as a visual cue to home in on particularly dense prey patches...|$|R
40|$|The minimum {{threshold}} foraging {{response of}} <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> {{has not been}} determined despite the widely held view that has been perpetuated in the literature for the past 45 years that this species cannot use low prey densities for net energy gain and so lives on an energetic 'knife-edge'. An early theoretical estimate suggested <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> would expend more energy collecting zooplankton at concentrations less than 1. 36 g m- 3 than could be obtained from it. This led to the claim that <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> will feed at an energetic loss {{for much of the}} annual cycle as zooplankton abundance outside summer months is too low for net energy gain to occur. Here I show from theoretical calculations and behavioural studies on individual and group-feeding sharks in the English Channel that <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> have a theoretical threshold prey density of between 0. 55 and 0. 74 g m- 3 and an observed foraging threshold of between 0. 48 and 0. 70 g m- 3 (mean = 0. 62 g m- 3). The close agreement between theoretical and empirical threshold values suggests <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> can achieve net energy gain in much lower zooplankton densities than previously thought. The findings imply that this species may not be reliant upon the 'migration–hibernation' energy conservation strategy it is purported to exhibit when seasonal zooplankton abundance decreases below 1. 36 g m- 3...|$|R

25|$|Though the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> {{is large}} and slow, it can breach, jumping entirely out of the water. This {{behaviour}} could {{be an attempt to}} dislodge parasites or commensals. Such interpretations are speculative, however, and difficult to verify; breaching in large marine animals such as whales and sharks might equally well be intraspecific threat displays of size and strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{megamouth shark}} (Megachasma pelagios) is {{a species of}} {{deepwater}} shark. It is rarely seen by humans and is {{the smallest of the}} three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the whale shark and <b>basking</b> <b>shark.</b> Since its discovery in 1976, few megamouth sharks have been seen, with 63 specimens known to have been caught or sighted as of May 2017, including four recordings on film. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its enormous mouth wide open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish. It is distinctive for its large head with rubbery lips. It is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the distinct family Megachasmidae, though suggestion has been made that it may belong in the family Cetorhinidae, of which the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> is currently the sole extant member. In addition to the living M.pelagios, however, two extinct megamouth species – the Priabonian M.alisonae and the Oligocene–Miocene M.applegatei – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. However, the Cretaceous-aged M. comanchensis has been recently reclassified as an odontaspid shark in the genus Pseudomegachasma, and is in fact unrelated to the megamouth shark despite similar teeth morphology.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> {{has been}} a staple of {{fisheries}} because of its slow swimming speed, placid nature, and previously abundant numbers. Commercially, it was put to many uses: the flesh for food and fishmeal, the hide for leather, and its large liver (which has a high squalene content) for oil. It is currently fished mainly for its fins (for shark fin soup). Parts (such as cartilage) are also used in traditional Chinese medicine and as an aphrodisiac in Japan, further adding to demand.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{being the}} second largest fish, <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> (Cetorhinus maximus) have been assumed to remain in {{discrete}} populations. Their known distribution encompasses temperate continental shelf areas, yet until now {{there has been no}} evidence for migration across oceans or between hemispheres. Here we present results on the tracks and behaviour of two <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> tagged off the British Isles, one of which released its tag off Newfoundland, Canada. During the shark's transit of the North Atlantic, she travelled a horizontal distance of 9589  km and reached a record depth of 1264  m. This result provides the first evidence for a link between European and American populations and indicates that <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> make use of deep-water habitats beyond the shelf edge...|$|R

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{suggest that}} megalodon {{looked like a}} stockier version of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), though it may have looked similar to the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> (Cetorhinus maximus) or the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).

500|$|Among {{the largest}} extant sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> (Cetorhinus maximus), {{and the great}} white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Some other species such as megamouth sharks (Megachasma pelagios), Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus), Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus), and bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus) broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark, but as these species are {{comparatively}} poorly studied, {{it is unclear whether}} their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark.

Among living cartilaginous fish, only the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the <b>basking</b> <b>shark</b> (Cetorhinus maximus) and the giant manta ray (Manta birostris), in that order, average larger and heavier.

500|$|A {{number of}} very large {{unconfirmed}} great white shark specimens have been recorded. For decades, many ichthyological works, {{as well as the}} Guinness Book of World Records, listed two great white sharks as the largest individuals: In the 1870s, a [...] great white captured in southern Australian waters, near Port Fairy, and an [...] shark trapped in a herring weir in New Brunswick, Canada, in the 1930s. However these measurements are not scientific and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these theories correct. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified <b>basking</b> <b>shark,</b> as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.E. Randall examined the shark's jaws and [...] "found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of 5m (17ft) in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record, in 1870, of the shark's length". These wrong measurements would make the alleged shark more than five times heavier than it really was.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>sharks</b> are carnivorous. <b>Basking</b> <b>sharks,</b> whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved {{different strategies}} for filter feeding plankton: <b>basking</b> <b>sharks</b> practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows {{from time to time}} in huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.|$|R
