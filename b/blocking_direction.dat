A rear facet (RF) regenerating light has an inclination angle that {{is larger than}} 0 degree and smaller than 90 degrees based on an active laser layer (LS) at an angle that is equal to 0 degree. The active monitor diode layer is arranged {{in an area of}} the rear facet below the active laser layer between two n-p- or p-n-semiconductor layers, where the laser diode is switched in a conducting direction and a monitor diode (MD) is switched in a <b>blocking</b> <b>direction</b> for the current. USE - Used as a transmitter for laser light in diplexer-chip for a passive optical network, in a laser structure e. g. buried hetero-structure-distributed feed back (BH-DFB) -laser structure and p-n-p laser structure, and in an optical transmitting module. ADVANTAGE - The laser diode is switched in the conducting direction and the monitor diode is switched in the <b>blocking</b> <b>direction</b> for the current, thus switching the laser and monitor diodes over a common branch, without mutually influencing the laser and monitor diodes. The diode facilitates marginal additional costs during manufacture of the laser diode by the parallel monolithic integration of the monitor diode and large module compactness to achieve space saving opposite to an optical series connection of the laser and monitor diodes. The laser diode is designed in such a manner that the monitor diode works temperature-independently in each laser design, thus generating reliable measuring signal in the area of optimal absorption. The diode can be implemented in different design types in a cost-effective manner. The inclination angle of the rear facet is larger than 0 degree and smaller than 90 degrees based on the active laser layer in the angle that is equal to 0 degree, thus directing the laser light occurring in the rear facet and reflecting the light {{in the direction of the}} substrate layer, and hence avoiding regenerations in the active laser layer...|$|E

40|$|Image {{interpolation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} elementary imaging research topics. A number of image interpolation methods have been developed for uncompressed images in the literature. However, a lot of videos have already been stored in MPEG- 2 format or have to be transmitted in MPEG- 2 format due to bandwidth limitation. The image interpolation methods developed for uncompressed images may not be effective when directly applied to compressed videos, because on the one hand, they do not utilize the information existed in the coded bitstreams; on the other hand, they do not consider quantization error, which may be dominant in some cases. Inspired by the success of the intra prediction in H. 264 /AVC and the edge-directed image interpolation methods (such as LAZA and NEDI), we propose a directional frame interpolation for MPEG compressed video. In the proposed method, 8 × 8 intra blocks in I frames are first classified to the nine <b>block</b> <b>directions</b> in transform domain. Then the interpolation on each block is performed along its <b>block</b> <b>direction.</b> For each <b>block</b> <b>direction,</b> an optimal Wiener filter is trained based on the representative video sequences and then used for its interpolation. In the similar way, for each pixel in an inter block in P or B frames, the interpolation is performed along the direction of its corresponding reference block. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional linear methods such as Bicubic and Bilinear and the edge-directed methods such as LAZA and NEDI, while keeping low computational complexity which meets the requirement of practical applications. © 2012 SPIE-IS&T...|$|R

40|$|Image {{interpolation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} elementary imaging research topics. A number of image interpolation methods have been developed and tested on uncompressed images in the literature. However, a lot of videos have already been stored or have to be transmitted in compressed format due to the storage limitation or the bandwidth limitation. The existed image interpolation methods may not be efficient when directly applied to compressed images or videos. Inspired by the success of the intra prediction in HEVC and the edge-directed image interpolation methods, a directional intra frame interpolation for HEVC compressed video is proposed. The main idea is to use the directional prediction information in compressed low-resolution video bitstreams to estimate the associated high-resolution video. For intra frames, the prediction direction information is taken into account as context in the directional interpolation. When a pixel is decompressed with a small prediction residual, the interpolation is performed along its <b>block</b> <b>direction.</b> The interpolation weight for each <b>block</b> <b>direction</b> is off-line trained by the Wiener filter based on the representative video sequences. For each pixel with a large prediction residual, a piecewise autoregressive model is used as a regularization term into the interpolation function.

40|$|An {{accurate}} estimated fingerprint orientation fields is {{a significant}} step for detection of singular points. Gradient-based methods are frequently used for estimating orientation fields but those methods are sensitive to noise. Fingerprints that perfect quality are seldom. They may be corrupted and degraded due to impression conditions or variations on skin. Enhancement of ridge flows improved the structure of orientation fields and hence {{increased the number of}} true singular points thereby conducting the overall performance of the classification process. In this paper, we provided discussion on the technique and implementation to improve local ridge flows of fingerprint orientation fields. That main technique have four steps; firstly, fingerprint segmentation; secondly, identification of noise areas and marking; thirdly, estimation of fingerprint orientation fields, and finally, enhancement of ridge flows using minimum variance of the cross centre <b>block</b> <b>direction</b> in squared gradients. A standard fingerprint database is used for testing of proposed technique to verify the tier of effectivity of algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—DCT-based {{transforms}} {{are widely}} adopted for video compression. Recently, many authors have highlighted that prediction residuals usually have directional structures that cannot be efficiently represented by conventional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Although directional transforms have superior performance over the conventional DCT, for application in video compression {{it is necessary}} to evaluate increase in coding time and complexity for its implementation. This paper proposes a fast algorithm for estimating <b>blocks</b> <b>directions</b> before applying directional transforms. The encoder identifies predominant <b>directions</b> in each <b>block,</b> and only applies the transform referent to that direction. The algorithm can be used in conjunction with any proposed algorithm for directional transforms that uses the RDO process for selection of the direction to be explored, reducing implementation complexity to similar levels when only conventional DCT is used. For the tested proposal, estimated reduction in total coding time would be 37. 5 % (4 × 4 blocks with 8 possible directions) and 47. 4 % (8 × 8 blocks with 16 possible directions).

40|$|Blocked In is {{a sliding}} block puzzle game which has some {{similarities}} with the ice cave block puzzles in Zelda games. The player gives blocks a push and they slide until they collide {{with some other}} object. There are both movable and immovable blocks, both with numeric values that determine how they will interact with other blocks. If a block with a higher number value crashes into a block with a lower value, the lower value block will be destroyed and the high value block will continue on its path. Blocks that are of the same level will stop each other. These types of varied interactions allow us to create more interesting puzzles that require the player to consider the importance of every movable block.    There are also special function blocks that alter the gameplay experience. For example, there is a teleporter block that instantly sends other blocks that collide with it to a corresponding teleporter tile. There are also phase blocks which only allow low number blocks through. There are also special floor tiles such as directional boosters, which alter a <b>blocks</b> <b>direction</b> of travel.

Comparison between the calculated and the observed results leads to the following conclusion: (1) In the 1938 Asama eruption, the {{distribution of}} volcanic blocks shows that the direction of the explosion principal axis is due east (N 90 °E) and its inclination angle is 30 °. The angle dependence of the initial velocity (M = 1. 5) is almost the same as that in the Sakurajima volcano.
