40|$|International audienceRemoval of Cr (III) was {{investigated}} using Phanerochaete chrysosporium-isolated living microorganism; pH, contact time, temperature and nutrients addition were examined. It {{was found that}} P. chrysosporium can tolerate up to 600 [*]mg/L chromium solution. The optimal growth conditions of the biosorbent {{were found to be}} 35 °C, 26 [*]h contact time and pH[*]=[*] 5. In addition, a complex nitrogen substrate, yeast powder, was shown to be most efficient than a synthetic one, like di-hydrogen ammonium phosphate. High chromium removal (98 %) was observed in these optimal growth conditions. Experimental data were found to follow a Langmuir isotherm model (r 2 [*]>[*] 0. 99). Maximum sorption capacity for the present biosorbent was 213 [*]mg/g according to the Langmuir isotherm model, namely significantly higher than the values reported in the literature, even for activated carbon. The fitting of experimental data onto kinetic models showed the relevance of the pseudo-second-order model (r 2 [*]>[*] 0. 99) for Cr (III) sorption by P. chrysosporium. In addition, a real effluent <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>tanning</b> factory and <b>was</b> treated to examine process feasibility on real effluents...|$|R
40|$|White sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) grain <b>from</b> <b>tan</b> {{plants is}} more {{desirable}} for human or animal consumption. Colonization by Fusarium and Alternaria spp. was assessed for near-isogenic lines differing in wound response (purple or tan) and pericarp color (red or white) in field-grown grain and in greenhouse-grown plants. Seeds were {{screened on a}} semi-selective medium for Alternaria and Fusarium. Significantly fewer fungal colonies <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>tan</b> plants with white seed, and fewer numbers of Alternaria colonies <b>were</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> white seed, regardless of plant color, from an irrigated field, while {{there were no differences}} in fungal composition of seeds grown at a nonirrigated field. Screening of seed from the nonirrigated field on Fusarium semi-selective medium yielded fewer Fu. surium isolations from seed grown on purple plants compared with seed <b>from</b> <b>tan</b> plants. When inoculated with Alternaria sp. and Fusarium, there can be no differences in lesion lengths on tan/ white plants when compared with purple/red plants in most assays; in one assay, tan/white plants had smaller lesion lengths following inoculation with F: moniliforme. These results suggest that plants with white seeds were as resistant as plants with the red pericarp trait to colonization by Alternaria and Fusarium spp. However, the results also suggest that under appropriate environmental conditions seed <b>from</b> <b>tan</b> plants may be more susceptible to Fusarium spp. than seed from purple plants...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{clinical}} observations have assigned increased {{significance to the}} anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies found in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) t and certain other related disorders. The anti-Sm antibodies are highly specific for SLE, whereas the anti-RNP antibodies show a wider distribution and help define a new syndrome termed "mixed connective tissue disease " (1, 2). Considerable interest has centered {{on the character of}} the antigens recognized by these autoantibodies because of their probable involvement in the processing of transcribed RNA. It has been known for some years that they are present in the nuclei {{of a wide variety of}} cells (1) and that RNP antigen is sensitive to RNase (3). Some work has been carried out on the isolation of these antigens with emphasis on their size, charge, and antigenicity (1, 3, 4). Very recently, considerably more insight has been gained from the work of Lerner and co-workers (5 - 8). Their work has identified the RNA precipitated by these two types of autoimmune sera, and differences in RNA composition were noted, although the same protein bands were precipitated by both types of sera (5). These results are difficult to relate to earlier studies that suggested a role for specific proteins in the differential reactivity of these sera. The present studies indicate that both Sm and RNP coexist in a single complex that can be dissociated to give clearly distinct antigenic proteins. The Sm determinants reside primarily on proteins of 25, 000 and 16, 000 daltons, whereas the RNP determinants reside at least in part on a protein of 19, 000 daltons.
