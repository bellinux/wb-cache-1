50|$|General {{arrives in}} the nick of time to save Amanda and again battles the troll, causing a great deal of noise. Knowing that he is no match for the cat, the small {{creature}} tries to flee. But General cuts off the troll's escape route by knocking down a thick hardcover storybook, covering the wall hole. Grabbing on to a bunch of foil balloons, the troll tries to float out of the furious cat's reach, landing on Amanda's record player. The quick-witted tomcat then uses the record player to hurl the troll into a <b>box</b> <b>fan,</b> slicing it to bits. The ruckus awakens Amanda's parents, who are initially prevented by the blocked door from reaching her. Once they break into her room, the girl explains to them that General saved her from the troll. The parents are at first unwilling to believe the story until parts of the troll's dismembered corpse are discovered, as well as the tiny dagger that had caused General's wound. Amanda uses the justification that General will keep her safe in case others like her first assailant appear, and General is allowed to stay inside at night to act as a protector for Amanda.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates feature level fusion for enhanc-ing fault {{detection}} from vibration signals in an ocean turbine. Changes in vibration signatures from such ro-tating machinery typically {{indicate the presence}} of a problem such as a shift in its orientation or mechani-cal impact from its environment. We applied feature level fusion to vibration data acquired from two ac-celerometers attached to a <b>box</b> <b>fan,</b> and then assessed the abilities of twelve well known machine learners to detect changes in state from the raw accelerometer data and from the fused data. Analysis of the performance of these classifiers showed an overall performance im-provement in all twelve classifiers in detecting the state of the fan from the fused data versus from the data from the two individual sensor channels...|$|E

40|$|A Light Microscopy Module (LMM) {{is being}} engineered, designed, and {{developed}} at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The LMM is planned as a remotely controllable on-orbit microscope subrack facility, allowing flexible scheduling and control of physical science and biological science experiments within Glenn s Fluids Integrated Rack on the International Space Station. The LMM concept is a modified commercial research imaging light microscope with powerful laser-diagnostic hardware and interfaces, creating a one-of-a-kind, state-of-the-art microscopic research facility. The microscope will house several different objectives, corresponding to magnifications of 10, 40, 50, 63, and 100. Features of the LMM include high-resolution color video microscopy, brightfield, darkfield, phase contrast, differential interference contrast, spectrophotometry, and confocal microscopy combined in a single configuration. Also, laser tweezers are integrated with the diagnostics as a sample manipulation technique. As part of the development phase of the LMM, {{it was necessary to}} quantify the microgravity disturbances generated by the control <b>box</b> <b>fan.</b> Isolating the fan was deemed necessary to reduce the fan speed harmonic amplitudes and to eliminate any broadband disturbances across the 60 - to 70 -Hz and 160 - to 170 -Hz frequency ranges. The accelerations generated by a control <b>box</b> <b>fan</b> component of the LMM were measured in the Microgravity Emissions Laboratory (MEL). The MEL is a low-frequency measurement system developed to simulate and verify the on-orbit International Space Station (ISS) microgravity environment. The accelerations generated by various operating components of the ISS, if too large, could hinder the science performed onboard by disturbing the microgravity environment. The MEL facility gives customers a test-verified way of measuring their compliance with ISS limitations on vibratory disturbance levels. The facility is unique in that inertial forces in 6 degrees of freedom can be characterized simultaneously for an operating test article. Vibratory disturbance levels are measured for engineering or flight-level hardware following development from component to subassembly through the rack-level configuration. The MEL can measure accelerations as small as 10 - 7 g, the accuracy needed to confirm compliance with ISS requirements...|$|E
40|$|Non-uniform {{flow from}} a <b>box</b> <b>fan</b> {{was used to}} test the power {{produced}} by four miniature wind turbines equipped with rectangular blades of different lengths. Flow from the fan was modelled using the solution proposed by Schlichting for a laminar free jet in the plane. Derived analytical results suggested that power produced by turbines immersed in such a flow would increase with the radius of the turbine blades up to a maximum value and, then, decrease with further increases {{in the size of the}} radius. Experimental and analytical results were in excellent qualitative agreement: turbines with shorter blades produced more power than those with longer blades consistently, which is the reverse of what might be expected when turbines are subjected to uniform wind speeds. Results indicate that the zone in which power output increases with increasing radii necessitated speeds that were not reached in the tests that were conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to modify an outdoor farrowing hut for winter and summer farrowing indoors to meet niche pork market requirements. Typical modified A-frame plywood outdoor farrowing huts were used to farrow sows indoors in summer and winter. The farrowing occurred in an insulated lean-to shed of a larger machine shed. During summer, the huts were fitted with a common 20 -inch <b>box</b> <b>fan</b> positioned in the hut roof blowing down on the sow (Figures 2 and 3). This helped keep air moving over the sow during hot weather. At night when the temperature dropped, a thermostat in the fan would switch the fan off. A hover was built for the back of each hut and fitted with two heat lamps (Figure 4). This attachment provided a warm draft-free area for the piglets away from the sow. Also, the heat lamps were inaccessible to the sow to minimize risk of fire. These simple modifications helped keep the sows comfortable and piglets warm in a bedded alternative farrowing arrangement...|$|E

40|$|In many {{different}} applications and buildings fans {{are used to}} remove unwanted and used air. These fans often generate broadband and tonal noise. Commonly, passive resistive silencers are used to attenuate noise generated by different types of fans installed in ventilation systems. Passive silencers tend to become bulky and impractical when designed for low frequency at-tenuation. However, active noise control (ANC) is a technique known {{for its ability to}} produce high levels of attenuation in the low frequency range, even with a relatively moderate sized ANC system. This paper presents an initial study performed to investigate the possibilities of applying ANC to a radial fan installed inside a box, an insulated <b>box</b> <b>fan.</b> The box is connected to a duct system and can for example be used as a waste air fan. The primary interest in this application, when the fan is used as a waste air fan, is to attenuate the noise generated on the suction side, since that side generates noise into a particular room. Investigations were carried out to determine where the ANC system should be installed, e. g. inside the box, in the duct connected to the box etc. Factors considered were for example, turbulence, standing waves, the type of noise generated by the fan (tonal, broadband, or a combination), and space limita-tions. The noise generated by the fan was found to be dominated by a tonal component, but also to have broadband energy in the low frequency range. Further, a feedforward ANC sys-tem was applied on the suction side, producing approximately 28 dB attenuation of the tonal component, and 5 - 10 dB attenuation of the broadband noise between 50 and 200 Hz. 1...|$|E
