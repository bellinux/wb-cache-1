FtsZ (filamentation temperature-sensitive Z) is the bacterial homolog of tubulin that polymerizes into rings localized to cell-division sites, and the constriction of these rings drives cytokinesis. Here we investigate the mechanism by which the Bacillus subtilis cell-division inhibitor, MciZ (mother cell inhibitor of FtsZ), <b>blocks</b> <b>assembly</b> of FtsZ. The X-ray crystal structure reveals that MciZ binds to the C-terminal polymerization interface of FtsZ, the equivalent of the minus end of tubulin. Using in vivo and in vitro assays and microscopy, we show that MciZ, at substoichiometric levels to FtsZ, causes shortening of protofilaments and <b>blocks</b> the <b>assembly</b> of higher-order FtsZ structures.

5000|$|Crosley, an American {{manufacturer}} of small, low-priced cars, used a [...] 4-cylinder SOHC engine following World War II. The original {{version of the}} engine was developed during the war by Lloyd Taylor and built under license by Crosley for military applications, including as a powerplant for generators. This design was made of steel stampings, copper-brazed {{together to form a}} strong and light <b>block</b> <b>assembly.</b> It was known as the CoBra engine ("COpper BRAzed") and generated [...] in automotive form. The overhead camshaft was driven by a tower shaft and gears. [...] The bi-metallic construction of the CoBra engine and the salt-based antifreeze then in common use led to electrolysis and corrosion problems. A more traditional design with a cast iron <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> (CIBA) was introduced in 1949; the components and dimensions were otherwise the same as the CoBra. Used in Crosley's Hot Shot sports car, this small OHC engine won the first race at Sebring in 1950. The Crosley OHC was popular in H-modified racing for its high-RPM performance. After Crosley ceased automotive production, the engine was produced by several other companies for many years, its last application being the Bearcat 55 outboard motor manufactured by Fisher Pierce, builders of the Boston Whaler boats.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} survive and persist in an immunocompetent human host, Borrelia burgdorferi {{controls}} the human im-mune attack and blocks the damaging effects of the activated complement system. These Gram-negative spirochetes use CspA (CRASP- 1) and four additional immune evasion proteins to bind combinations of human plasma regulators, including factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL- 1), complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR 1), CFHR 2, CFHR 5, and plasminogen. As many microbial immune evasion proteins have multiple functions, we hypothesized that CspA has additional roles in complement or immune control. Here, we identify CspA as a terminal complement inhibitor. Borrelial CspA binds the human terminal comple-ment components C 7 and C 9 and <b>blocks</b> <b>assembly</b> andmembrane insertion of the terminal complement complex (TCC). CspA inhibits TCC assembly {{at the level of}} C 7, as revealed by hemolytic assays, and inhibits polymerization of C 9. CspA, when ectopi-cally expressed on the surface of serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii, <b>blocks</b> TCC <b>assembly</b> on the level of C 7 and induces serum resistance in the transformed bacteria. This CspA-mediated serum resistance and terminal complement pathway inhibition al-low B. burgdorferi to survive in the hostile environment of human plasma. IMPORTANCE The present study defines a newmechanism by which the pathogenic bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi controls the terminal complement pathway of the human host to survive in human serum. The borrelial CspA binds to terminal pathway proteins C 7 and C 9 and inhibits the terminal complement pathway at the step of C 7 and thereby inhibits terminal complement complex (TCC) assembly andmembrane insertion.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis paper proposes the {{application}} of sensor technology to assemble ship blocks efficiently. A sensor-based monitoring system is designed and implemented to improve shipbuilding productivity by reducing the labor cost for the adjustment of adequate positioning between ship blocks during pre-erection or erection stage. For the real-time remote monitoring of relative distances between two ship blocks, sensor nodes are applied to measure the distances between corresponding target points on the blocks. Highly precise positioning data can be transferred to a monitoring server via wireless network, and analyzed to support the decision making which needs to determine the next construction process; further adjustment or seam welding between the ship blocks. The developed system is expected to put to practical use, and increase the productivity during ship <b>blocks</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|R

50|$|Human uses of {{serration}} have copied, {{and gone}} beyond, {{those found in}} nature. For example, the teeth on a saw or other serrated blade serves a similar cutting or scraping purpose as the serration of an animal tooth. Tailors use pinking shears to cut cloth with a serrated edge, which, somewhat counterintuitively, reduces fraying by reducing {{the average length of}} a thread that may be pulled from the edge. A type of serration is also found in airframe shapes used in certain stealth aircraft, which use the jaggedness of the serrated edge to deflect radar signals from seams and edges where a straight, non-serrated edge would reflect radar signals back to the source. Screw threads show serration in profile, although they are usually shown in abbreviated or symbolic fashion on mechanical drawings to save time and ink. Brogue shoes are made with serrated edges on the leather pieces, for no known purpose at all other than style. The step clamp and step <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> in metalworking adopt serration for the purpose of applying clamping pressure from an adjustable position.|$|E
50|$|Discovery of {{the first}} {{eukaryotic}} ABC transporter protein came from studies on tumor cells and cultured cells that exhibited resistance to several drugs with unrelated chemical structures. These cells were shown to express elevated levels of multidrug-resistance (MDR) transport protein which was originally called P-glycoprotein (P-gp), {{but it is also}} referred to as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or ABCB1. This protein uses ATP hydrolysis, just like the other ABC transporters, to export a large variety of drugs from the cytosol to the extracellular medium. In multidrug-resistant cells, the MDR1 gene is frequently amplified in multidrug-resistant cells. This results in a large overproduction of the MDR1 protein. The substrates of mammalian ABCB1 are primarily planar, lipid-soluble molecules with one or more positive charges. All of these substrates compete with one another for transport, suggesting that they bind to the same or overlapping sites on the protein. Many of the drugs that are transported out by ABCB1 are small, nonpolar drugs that diffuse across the extracellular medium into the cytosol, where they block various cellular functions.
