500|$|The {{size and}} {{structure}} of the prickly shark's mouth and pharynx suggests that it uses suction to capture prey. This species feeds on a variety of benthic and pelagic bony fishes, including hake, flounders, rockfishes, lingcod, topsmelt, mackerel, and herring, and on cartilaginous fishes, including elephantfishes (Callorhinchus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), young bluntnose sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus), and ghost catshark (Apristurus) egg cases. Octopuses and squid, including the Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) are also consumed. Young prickly sharks may themselves fall prey to the <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark,</b> while adults likely face few threats. Reproduction in this species is aplacental viviparous, with the unborn young sustained by yolk. There is only one known record of a pregnant female, which was gestating 114 embryos; this ranks among the largest known litters from any shark. The young are probably under [...] long at birth.

50|$|Reproduction is {{ovoviviparous}} with embryos receiving nourishment from a {{yolk sac}} while remaining inside the mother. Litters {{are large and}} typically have 22-108 pups measuring 60 - 75 cm at birth. New pups are also born with a lighter belly color than adults. This form of cryptic coloration or camouflage is used to disguise the pup's appearance. A high mortality rate of the young pups is presumed, owing to the large litter size. The gestation period is unknown, but is probably more than two years. Females reach sexual maturity at 4.5 m in length and 18-35 years in age, while males reach sexual maturity much earlier at 3.15 m in size and 11-14 years in age. Many biologists believe that the male <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark's</b> teeth are specially adapted for courtship. The male nips at the female's gill slits using its longer-cusped teeth. This action is thought to entice the female into mating. Evidence of this hypothesis is that female <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>sharks</b> show up with seasonal scars around their gill slits, which apparently is from breeding with males. Males and females are thought to meet seasonally between May and November.|$|R

Cameras and lights were placed around the bait box to record <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark</b> presence and behavior while feeding. Analysis of feeding behavior revealed that sixgills utilize a bite comparable to many other elasmobranchs and aquatic vertebrates, {{have the ability to}} protrude their upper jaw, change their feeding behavior based on the situation, and employ sawing and lateral tearing during manipulation.

50|$|The <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark</b> has a {{large body}} and long tail. The snout is blunt and wide, and its eyes are small. There are 6 rows of saw-like teeth on its lower jaw and smaller teeth on its upper jaw. Skin color ranges from tan, through brown, to black. It has a light-colored lateral line down the sides and on the fins' edges, and darker colored spots on the sides. Its pupils are black and its eye color is a {{fluorescent}} blue-green. The <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark</b> can grow to 8 m. Adult males generally average between 3.1 and 3.3 m, while adult females average between 3.5 and 4.2 m.|$|E
40|$|We do {{not expect}} non {{air-breathing}} aquatic animals to exhibit positive buoyancy. Sharks, for example, rely on oil-filled livers instead of gas-filled swim bladders to increase their buoyancy, but are nonetheless ubiquitously regarded as either negatively or neutrally buoyant. Deep-sea sharks have particularly large, oil-filled livers, and {{are believed to be}} neutrally buoyant in their natural habitat, but this has never been confirmed. To empirically determine the buoyancy status of two species of deep-sea <b>sharks</b> (<b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>sharks,</b> Hexanchus griseus, and a prickly shark, Echinorhinus cookei) in their natural habitat, we used accelerometer-magnetometer data loggers to measure their swimming performance. Both species of deep-sea sharks showed similar diel vertical migrations: they swam at depths of 200 - 300 m at night and deeper than 500 m during the day. Ambient water temperature was around 15 °C at 200 - 300 m but below 7 °C at depths greater than 500 m. During vertical movements, all deep-sea sharks showed higher swimming efforts during descent than ascent to maintain a given swimming speed, and were able to glide uphill for extended periods (several minutes), indicating that these deep-sea sharks are in fact positively buoyant in their natural habitats. This positive buoyancy may adaptive for stealthy hunting (i. e. upward gliding to surprise prey from underneath) or may facilitate evening upward migrations when muscle temperatures are coolest, and swimming most sluggish, after spending the day in deep, cold water. Positive buoyancy could potentially be widespread in fish conducting daily vertical migration in deep-sea habitats...|$|R
40|$|Pig carcasses, {{as human}} proxies, {{were placed on}} the seabed at a depth of 300 m, in the Strait of Georgia and {{observed}} continuously by a remotely operated camera and instruments. Two carcasses were deployed in spring and two in fall utilizing Ocean Network Canada's Victoria Experimental Network under the Sea (formerly VENUS) observatory. A trial experiment showed that <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>sharks</b> could rapidly devour a carcass so a platform was designed which held two matched carcasses, one fully exposed, the other covered in a barred cage to protect it from sharks, while still allowing invertebrates and smaller vertebrates access. The carcasses were deployed under a frame which supported a video camera, and instruments which recorded oxygen, temperature, salinity, density, pressure, conductivity, sound speed and turbidity at per minute intervals. The spring exposed carcass was briefly fed upon by sharks, but they were inefficient feeders and lost interest after a few bites. Immediately after deployment, all carcasses, in both spring and fall, were very rapidly covered in vast numbers of lyssianassid amphipods. These skeletonized the carcasses by Day 3 in fall and Day 4 in spring. A dramatic, very localized drop in dissolved oxygen levels occurred in fall, exactly coinciding with the presence of the amphipods. Oxygen levels returned to normal once the amphipods dispersed. Either the physical presence of the amphipods or the sudden draw down of oxygen during their tenure, excluded other fauna. The amphipods fed from the inside out, removing the skin last. After the amphipods had receded, other fauna colonized such as spot shrimp and a few Dungeness crabs but by this time, all soft tissue had been removed. The amphipod activity caused major bioturbation in the local area and possible oxygen depletion. The spring deployment carcasses became covered in silt and a black film formed on them and on the silt above them whereas the fall bones remained uncovered and hence continued to be attractive to large numbers of spot shrimp. The carcass remains were recovered after 166 and 134 days respectively for further study...|$|R

50|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark</b> was authored in 1788 by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre. As {{a member of the}} Hexanchidae family, it has more close relatives in the fossil record than living relatives. The related living species include the dogfish, the Greenland shark, and other six- and sevengilled sharks. Some of the shark's relatives date back 200 million years. This shark is a notable species due to both its primitive and current physical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark</b> {{is listed}} as Near Threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) because, despite its {{extensive}} range, its longevity and popularity as a sport fish makes it vulnerable to exploitation and unable to sustain targeted fishing for very long. Although population data is lacking in many areas for this species, certain regional populations have been classified as severely depleted. Although it is usually caught as bycatch, it is also caught for food and sport.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{sluggish}} in nature, the <b>bluntnose</b> <b>sixgill</b> <b>shark</b> {{is capable}} of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey using its powerful tail. Because of its broad range, it has {{a wide variety of}} prey, including fish, rays, chimaeras, squids, crabs, shrimps, seals, and even other sharks. Despite its massive size, it is harmless to humans unless provoked. In 2013, during filming for the Shark Week episode [...] "Alien Sharks", bluntnose sixgill sharks were found to be territorial as one was filmed laying claim to the carcass of a sperm whale calf that was being used to lure deep-sea shark species within range of submarine cameras. The shark was recognized as being the same individual by the scars on its back and sides, and the bites it removed from the carcass allowed other animals, such as hagfish, to feed and further break down the dead whale.|$|E

In the eastern Atlantic, it has been caught from Iceland to Namibia and in the Indo-Pacific it has been caught from Madagascar north to Japan and east to Hawaii. It typically swims near the ocean floor or {{in the water column}} over the continental shelf in poorly lit waters. It is usually found 180 - 1100 m from the surface, but its depth range can extend from 0 - 2500 m. Juveniles will swim near the shoreline in search of food, sometimes in water as shallow as 12 m, but adults typically stay at depths greater than 100 m.

50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the Albacore (Thunnus alalunga), the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), the Mediterranean Spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands. Sharks also migrate through the Strait of Messina, including the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the <b>Bluntnose</b> <b>Sixgill</b> <b>Shark</b> (Hexanchus griseus).|$|E

40|$|Background: Understanding {{movement}} patterns {{is fundamental to}} population and conservation biology. The way an animal moves through its environment influences the dynamics of local populations and will determine how susceptible it is to natural or anthropogenic perturbations. It {{is of particular interest}} to understand the patterns of movement for species which are susceptible to human activities (e. g. fishing), or that exert a large influence on community structure, such as sharks. Methodology/Principal Findings: We monitored the patterns of movement of 34 <b>sixgill</b> <b>sharks</b> Hexanchus griseus using two large-scale acoustic arrays inside and outside Puget Sound, Washington, USA. <b>Sixgill</b> <b>sharks</b> were residents in Puget Sound for up to at least four years before making large movements out of the estuary. Within Puget Sound, sixgills inhabited sites for several weeks at a time and returned to the same sites annually. Across four years, sixgills had consistent seasonal movements in which they moved to the north from winter to spring and moved to the south from summer to fall. Just prior to leaving Puget Sound, sixgills altered their behavior and moved twice as fast among sites. Nineteen of the thirty-four sixgills were detected leaving Puget Sound for the outer coast. Three of these sharks returned to Puget Sound. Conclusions/Significance: For most large marine predators, we have a limited understanding of how they move through their environment, and this clouds our ability to successfully manage their populations and their communities.

40|$|Understanding the {{movement}} of animals is fundamental to population and community ecology. Historically, it {{has been difficult to}} quantify movement patterns of most fishes, but technological advances in acoustic telemetry have increased our abilities to monitor their movement. In this study, we combined small-scale active acoustic tracking with large-scale passive acoustic monitoring to develop an empirical movement model for <b>sixgill</b> <b>sharks</b> in Puget Sound, WA, USA. We began by testing whether a correlated random walk model described the daily movement of sixgills; however, the model failed to capture home-ranging behavior. We added this behavior and used the resultant model (a biased random walk model) to determine whether daily movement patterns are able to explain large-scale seasonal movement. The daily model did not explain the larger-scale patterns of movement observed in the passive monitoring data. In order to create the large-scale patterns, sixgills must have performed behaviors (large, fast directed movements) that were unobserved during small-scale active tracking. In addition, seasonal shifts in location were not captured by the daily model. We added these ‘unobserved’ behaviors to the model and were able to capture large-scale seasonal movement of <b>sixgill</b> <b>sharks</b> over 150 days. The development of empirical models of movement allows researchers to develop hypotheses and test mechanisms responsible for a species movement behavior and spatial distribution.
