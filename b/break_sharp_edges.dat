This thesis presents research carried out {{as part of a}} project undertaken in fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of Loughborough University for the award of Philosophical Doctorate. The main focus of this research is to investigate and develop an appropriate level of automation to the existing manual finishing operations of small metallic components to achieve required surface quality and to remove superficial defects. In the manufacturing industries, polishing processes {{play a vital role in}} the development of high precision products, to give a desired surface finish, remove defects, <b>break</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> extend the working life cycle, and meet mechanical specification. The polishing operation is generally done at the final stage of the manufacturing process and can represent up to a third of the production time. Despite the growth automated technology in industry, polishing processes are still mainly carried out manually, due to the complexity and constraints of the process. Manual polishing involves a highly qualified worker polishing the workpiece by hand. These processes are very labour intensive, highly skill dependent, costly, error-prone, environmentally hazardous due to abrasive dust, and - in some cases - inefficient with long process times. In addition, the quality of the finishing is dependent on the training, experience, fatigue, physical ability, and expertise of the operator. Therefore, industries are seeking alternative solutions to be implemented within their current processes. These solutions are mainly aimed at replacing the human operator to improve the health and safety of their workforce and improve their competitiveness. Some automated solutions have already been proposed to assist or replace manual polishing processes. These solutions provide limited capabilities for specific processes or components, and a lack of flexibility and dexterity. One of the reasons for their lack of success is identified as neglecting the study and implementing the manual operations. This research initially hypothesised that for an effective development, an automated polishing system should be designed based on the manual polishing operations. Therefore, a successful implementation of an automated polishing system requires a thorough understanding of the polishing process and their operational parameters. This study began by collaborating with an industrial polishing company. The research was focused on polishing complex small components, similar to the parts typically used in the aerospace industry. The high level business processes of the polishing company were capture through several visits to the site. The low level operational parameters and the understanding of the manual operations were also captured through development of a devices that was used by the expert operators. A number of sensors were embedded to the device to facilitate recording the manual operations. For instance, the device captured the force applied by the operator (avg. 10 N) and the cycle time (e. g. 1 pass every 5 sec.). The capture data was then interpreted to manual techniques and polishing approaches that were used in developing a proof-of-concept Integrated Robotic Polishing System (IRPS). The IRPS was tested successfully through several laboratory based experiments by expert operators. The experiment results proved the capability of the proposed system in polishing a variety of part profiles, without pre-existing geometrical information about the parts. One of the main contributions made by this research is to propose a novel approach for automated polishing operations. The development of an integrated robotic polishing system, based on the research findings, uses a set of smart sensors and a force-position-by-increment control algorithm, and transpose the way that skilled workers carry out polishing processes...|$|E

Between June 10 - 12, a few days to two weeks before the radio disappearance of the pulsar, the 3 - 79 keV X-ray spectrum was well fit by a simple power law with a photon index of Gamma= 1. 17 +/- 0. 08 (at 90 % confidence) with a 3 - 79 keV luminosity of 7. 4 +/- 0. 4 x 10 ^ 32 erg/s. Significant orbital modulation was observed with a modulation fraction of 36 +/- 10 %. During the October 19 - 21 observation, the spectrum is described by a softer power law (Gamma= 1. 66 +/- 0. 06) with an average luminosity of 5. 8 +/- 0. 2 x 10 ^ 33 erg/s and a peak luminosity of ~ 1. 2 x 10 ^ 34 erg/s observed during a flare. No significant orbital modulation was detected. The spectral observations are consistent with previous and current multi-wavelength observations and show the hard X-ray power law extending to 79 keV without a spectral <b>break.</b> <b>Sharp</b> <b>edged,</b> flat bottomed `dips' are observed with widths between 30 - 1000 s and ingress and egress time-scales of 30 - 60 s. No change in hardness ratio was observed during the dips. Consecutive dip separations are log-normal in distribution with a typical separation of approximately 400 s. These dips are distinct from dipping activity observed in LMXBs. We compare and contrast these dips to {{observations of}} dips and state changes in the similar transition systems PSR J 1824 - 2452 I and XSS J 1227. 0 - 4859 and discuss possible interpretations based on the transitions in the inner disk.

5000|$|To {{make the}} {{preceding}} reasoning rigorous, {{one has to}} explain {{what is meant by}} the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value k. The precise mathematical formulation was given by Cauchy in the 19th century and is based on the notion of limit. Suppose that the graph does not have a <b>break</b> or a <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> at p and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near p. Then there is a unique value of k such that, as h approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to k, and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of h, if h is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function f. This limit is the derivative of the function f at x = a, denoted f ′(a). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows: ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Boundary element {{method in}} {{acoustics}} for Neumann boundary condition problems including <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is investigated. In previous acoustic boundary element method, acoustic pressure and normal velocity {{are the two}} variables at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. However, the normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners is discontinuous due to the indefinite normal vector. To avoid the indefinite normal vector and the discontinuous normal velocity at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners, normal vector of elemental node is defined and applied in the numerical implementation. Then the normal velocity is transformed to velocity which is unique even at <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> & corners. Such treatments {{make sure that all}} variables in the acoustic boundary element method are definite. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the new model are demonstrated by three cases of interior acoustic problems for which analytical solutions can be found and one classical exterior acoustic radiation problem. Curvilinear quadrilateral isoparametric elements are applied in the computation. It is found that the numerical results agree with corresponding analytical solutions quite well...|$|R

40|$|We study {{luminescence}} spectra observed from InAs {{quantum dots}} (QDs) embedded in an n-type InGaAs-based heterostructure, where electron Cooper pairs penetrate from an adjacent niobium (Nb) superconductor with the proximity effect.

We explain the observed <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> in the luminescence spectra with the proximity effect, that is, with {{the consideration of}} opening of SC gap and modification of density of states (DOS) near the electron Fermi level in the n-type semiconductor heterostructure. We demonstrate that the <b>sharp</b> <b>edge</b> luminescence spectra are well reproduced by the SC DOS, with quasiparticle lifetime broadening and a Gaussian distribution of lowest QD state emission lines.

40|$|AbstractAnisotropic {{diffusion}} is {{used for}} both image enhancement and denoising. The Perona-Malik model makes use of anisotropic diffusion to filter out the noise. In Perona-Malik model the rate of diffusion is controlled by edge stopping function. The drawback of Perona-Malik model is that the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details are not preserved well in the denoised image. But the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details can be preserved well using appropriate edge stopping function. We have analysed the effect of different edge stopping functions in anisotropic diffusion {{in terms of how}} efficient they are in preserving edges. We have found that an edge stopping function which stops diffusion from low image gradient onwards well preserves the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details. This property of an edge stopping function will also result in lower evolution in case of level set methods. But an edge stopping function which stops diffusion from high image gradient onwards will not preserve <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details, since they are blurred due to diffusion. We have also found that low values of gradient threshold parameter used in edge stopping function well preserves the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details than high values of threshold parameter. By utilizing an edge stopping function which stops diffusion from low image gradient onwards or which has zero or insignificant value at low image gradient, we can well preserve the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> and fine details in the denoised image...|$|R
