5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults who had used AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with <b>better</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a <b>better</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life than EBRT.|$|E

5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of a <b>better</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot to produce silver plating, which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, {{and a number of}} new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E

5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process for making a <b>better</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> steel than had previously been available. At {{around the same time}} Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{the only}} clinical/pharmacological {{treatment}} available for ADPKD consists {{in reducing the}} speed in gain of total kidney volume (TKV) with aquaretics (i.e. tolvaptan), which can alleviate pain while giving the patients a <b>better</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life for over a mean of 3 years. After this period, patients can restart gaining TKV at pre-treatment rates and may eventually {{have to go through}} dialysis and kidney transplant. Paliative treatment modalities involve symptomatic medications (non-opioid and opioid analgesics) for abdominal/retroperitoneal pain. Before the advent of aquaretic medication, the only option for analgesic-resistant pain were simple or complex surgical procedures (i.e. renal cyst aspiration, cyst decortication, renal denervation and nephrectomy), which can result in complications inherent to surgery.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, California {{became the}} first state to legally mandate minimum nurse-to-patient {{staffing}} ratios in acute care hospitals. A subsequent study evaluated the effect on outcomes for nurses and patients by comparing outcomes in California in the subsequent two years with those of New Jersey and Pennsylvania — two similar states without such mandates. There was substantial compliance with the mandate in California, with over 80% compliance rates reported across several different units of surveyed hospitals; equivalent levels of non-mandated compliance in the comparator states were considerably lower, at 19%, 52%, and 63% compliance in medical/surgical, pediatric, and intensive care units (ICUs) in New Jersey and 33%, 66%, and 71% in Pennsylvania. After extensive adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the study revealed statistically significant relationships between the nurse-to-patient ratio and 30-day mortality and failure to rescue (FTR — that is, failure to prevent a clinically-important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from a complication of an underlying illness or of medical care) in all three states. Across all three states, facilities with nurse-to-patient ratios consistent with those mandated in California were associated with lower rates of nursing burnout, and nurses reported consistently <b>better</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> care.|$|E
