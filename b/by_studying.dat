5|$|It {{is likely}} that Hoffmann did as most chemists have always done, {{starting}} <b>by</b> <b>studying</b> the literature and recreating the published methods.

5|$|Bell {{was the son}} of Thomas Bell, one of {{the founders}} of the iron and alkali company Losh, Wilson and Bell, and his wife Katherine Lowthian.

He gained experience in manufacturing alkalis at Marseilles before returning to Newcastle in 1836 to work in his father's Walker iron and chemical works.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent <b>by</b> <b>studying</b> episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E
5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained <b>by</b> <b>studying</b> North Korean defectors who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more common than anticipated, but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter trojans {{are dark}} bodies with reddish, featureless spectra. No firm {{evidence}} {{of the presence of}} water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured <b>by</b> <b>studying</b> binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during {{the early stages of the}} Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. <b>By</b> <b>studying</b> the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E

National organizations provide standards of good practice for study abroad offices, but currently there is not a standard to govern the use of social media (e. g. Facebook and Twitter). While proper Facebook and Twitter use is not a magic bullet to increase study abroad participation, it is important to examine the salient topics in media used <b>by</b> <b>study</b> abroad offices to determine if the offices are addressing perceived barriers to and career benefits of study abroad through their communication.

5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. <b>By</b> <b>studying</b> the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong in this process. These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E
5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several significant ways. The English edition was somewhat shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired <b>by</b> <b>studying</b> the actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as}} from foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less harsh language towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E

5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. <b>By</b> <b>studying</b> samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.|$|E
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag <b>by</b> <b>studying</b> their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E
