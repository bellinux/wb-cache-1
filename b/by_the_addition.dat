5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, and allowing the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|Borley Rectory was {{constructed}} on Hall Road near Borley Church by the Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull in 1862; {{he moved in}} a year after being named rector of the parish. The house replaced an earlier rectory on the site that had been destroyed by fire in 1841. It was eventually enlarged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of a wing to house Bull's family of fourteen children.|$|E

5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate {{can be converted to}} platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E

50|$|In 1680 and 1805 the {{graveyard}} was expanded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>additions</b> of sections {{three and four}} respectively. When this additional space was also full, the final extension, {{in the form of}} the fifth section, took place between 1827 and 1863. By 1846, however, it was clear that further extension was impossible, and a new cemetery, the Neuer Johannisfriedhof, was opened on a different site.|$|R
5|$|The {{division}} was also substantially reinforced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of 1,200 {{men of the}} Glider Pilot Regiment, providing Urquhart with the equivalent of two battalions of infantry for the operation.

Urquhart also had the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade under his command, who would also be joining the British in the operation to seize the bridges.|$|E
5|$|The first {{traces of}} human {{activity}} at the site date to approximately 800 BC, with the first structures being built about 350 BC. Around 250 AD the complex underwent a major redevelopment {{with the construction of}} a massive basal platform that supported a cluster of temples; this was followed around AD 450 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of a row of four pyramids on a terrace to the south of the main platform.|$|E
5|$|The light {{infantry}} of 1,200 velites {{consisted of}} unarmoured skirmishing troops {{drawn from the}} youngest and lower social classes.

5|$|Vinokourov led the Astana squad at the Tour de France. Entering 2011, he {{had thought}} it to be his final season as an active competitor, and his main goal for the year was to wear the yellow jersey at some time during the Tour. His pursuit of yellow was {{strengthened}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of Kreuziger to the squad, riding solely {{in support of the}} veteran Kazakh. Paris–Nice stage winner Di Gregorio and Tiralongo were also named to the squad.|$|E
5|$|West Alsek was {{selected}} for a test program <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of coal pulverizers—units that crushed coal and mixed it with air for injection into the boilers.

25|$|His nephew, wealthy {{lawyer and}} banker, William Woodward, Sr. {{inherited}} the estate in 1910 and expanded {{the building in}} 1914 to a five-part house <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>additions</b> of two wings and hyphens. The expansion became a noted work of the architects Delano & Aldrich. During this period, William opportunistically bought up adjacent tracts of land including purchases from the Magruder family and the nearby Fairview Plantation of Oden Bowie and began developing the Belair Stud.|$|R
5|$|A {{bank and}} ditch {{enclosure}} {{was a simple}} form of defence, and when found without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enhanced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of a stone curtain wall. Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door. This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor– {{to make it harder}} to throw objects in– and to change the entrance from ground floor to first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls. Castles were not just defensive sites but also enhanced a lord's control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area, and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south of Broadway into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be a}} weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further potential threat to the city. Time being short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were heightened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.|$|E
