5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling,</b> which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
5|$|Feeding on fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans, the Japanese {{angelshark}} is a nocturnal ambush predator that {{spends most}} of the day lying still on the sea floor. This species gives birth to live young, which are sustained during gestation by yolk. The litter size varies from two to 10. The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked. It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen, a type of leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable, citing the intense <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. <b>Bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E

5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the FAO’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> below 1000 metres and, in January 2006, {{completely}} closed ecologically {{sensitive areas}} off Italy, Cyprus, and Egypt to all <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abundance {{estimates}} of North-east Arctic {{cod and haddock}} are given annually {{on the basis of}} combined <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> and acoustic surveys. Both survey methods use data from <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> catches in the calculations. The surveys are conducted in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard area with the same <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl,</b> but with different sweep wire length. The <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> indices are calculated for both areas assuming an effective path width of 25 m. In this paper results from parallel trawling experiments with the standard sampling trawl equipped with different sweep lengths are analyzed. These show that the total catch increases with increasing sweep length. Small fish are relatively underestimated by the trawl with the longer sweeps, but no species selection was observed. It is concluded that combining survey results without compensating for the effect of using different sweep length will bias the estimates. The variability in the presented results demonstrates the complexity of combining data from trawl surveys conducted with different sweep lengths on the <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl...</b>|$|R
