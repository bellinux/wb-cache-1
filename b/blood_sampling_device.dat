40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} the {{activity}} and responsiveness of the adrenal gland in red deer (Cervus elaphus) stags were quantified by measuring 24 h endogenous cortisol secretory profiles and plasma cortisol responses to either administration of exogenous ACTH or a standardised stressor during November (period of velvet growth), February (pre-rut), April (mid-rut) and July (post-rut) (southern hemisphere) using a remote <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>device</b> (DracPac). Ultradian rhythms in the concentration of plasma cortisol were observed resulting from the episodic secretion of cortisol from the adrenal cortex at a mean rate of 0. 8 pulses/h. Circadian rhythms in plasma cortisol concentrations were also found in 11 out of the 20 complete 24 h profiles (mean amplitude, 3. 8 +/- 1. 4 ng/ml). Seasonal rhythms in mean 24 h plasma cortisol concentrations and cortisol pulse parameters were also observed. Mean 24 h plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in November (12. 5 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml) than in February (6. 3 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml), April (4. 0 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml) or July (4. 2 +/- 1. 0 ng/ml). Cortisol pulse height, nadir and amplitude were all significantly higher in November than at other {{times of the year}} (P< 0. 01). Peak cortisol concentrations following infusion of ACTH(1 - 24) (0. 04 IU kg(- 1)) were higher (P< 0. 05) in November (55. 8 +/- 2. 7 ng/ml) and lower (P< 0. 001) in April (33. 7 +/- 1. 8 ng/ml) than those in February and July (48. 7 +/- 2. 0 ng/ml and 45. 4 +/- 2. 0 ng/ml respectively). The area under the cortisol response curve was significantly smaller (P< 0. 05) in April (266. 6 +/- 15. 3 ng/ml/ 190 min) than at other times of the year (February, 366. 1 +/- 15. 3 ng/ml/ 190 min; July, 340. 7 +/- 15. 3 ng/ml/ 190 min and November, 387. 8 +/- 21. 2 ng/ml/ 190 min). These data demonstrate that the adrenal gland of the red deer stag exhibits ultradian, circadian and seasonal rhythms in activity, and that its responsiveness to ACTH varies with season. November, a period of reproductive quiescence in the southern hemisphere, with new antler growth and rapid weight gain, is associated with higher mean plasma cortisol concentrations and a greater responsiveness to exogenous ACTH. In contrast, the breeding season is associated with lower adrenal activity and responsiveness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis B {{outbreaks}} {{in healthcare}} settings {{are still a}} serious public health concern in high-income countries. To elucidate the most frequent infection pathways and clinical settings involved, we performed a systematic review of hepatitis B virus outbreaks published between 1992 and 2007 within the EU and USA. Methods The research was performed using two different databases: the PubMed Database and the Outbreak Database, the worldwide database for nosocomial outbreaks. Selection of papers was carried out using the Quorom algorithm, and to avoid selection biases, the inclusion criteria were established before the articles were identified. Results Overall, 30 papers were analyzed, reporting on 33 hepatitis B virus outbreaks that involved 471 patients, with 16 fatal cases. Dialysis units accounted for 30. 3 % of outbreaks followed by medical wards (21. 2 %), nursing homes (21. 2 %), surgery wards (15. 2), and outpatient clinics (12. 1 %). The transmission pathways were: multi-vial drugs (30. 3 %), non-disposable multi-patient capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>devices</b> (27. 2 %), transvenous endomyocardial biopsy procedures (9. 1 %), and multiple deficiencies in applying standard precautions (9. 1 %). Conclusion The analysis of transmission pathways showed that some breaches in infection control measures, such as administration of drugs using multi-vial compounds and capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling,</b> are the most frequent routes for patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis B virus. Moreover some outbreak reports underlined that heart-transplant recipients {{are at risk of}} contracting hepatitis B virus infection during the transvenous endomyocardial biopsy procedure through indirect contact with infected blood as a result of environmental contamination. To prevent transmission, healthcare workers must adhere to standard precautions and follow fundamental infection control principles, {{such as the use of}} sterile, single-use, disposable needles and avoiding the use of multi-vial compounds in all healthcare settings including outpatient settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrated}} leukocyte labeling, sensing and differentiation from undiluted human whole <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> with microfabricated <b>devices.</b> A challenging {{issue in}} leukocyte sensing from <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> is the required high dilution level, {{which is used}} mainly to prevent interference from the overwhelmingly outnumbered erythrocytes. Dilution is undesirable for micro hemacytometers. It not only increases sample volume and processing time, but also requires mixing and buffer storage for on- chip implementation. Unlike commercial bulk instruments and previous efforts by other groups, we completely eliminated the requirement for dilution by staining leukocytes specifically with fluorescent dye acridine orange (AO) in undiluted human whole blood and then sensing them in microfluidic devices.

40|$|The {{necessity}} for bone marrow aspiration {{and the lack}} of highly sensitive assays to detect residual disease present challenges for effective management of multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell cancer. We show that a microfluidic cell capture based on CD 138 antigen, which is highly expressed on plasma cells, permits quantitation of rare circulating plasma cells (CPCs) in blood and subsequent fluorescence-based assays. The microfluidic device is based on a herringbone channel design, and exhibits an estimated cell capture efficiency of ~ 40 – 70 %, permitting detection of < 10 CPCs/mL using 1 -mL sample volumes, which is difficult using existing techniques. In bone marrow samples, the microfluidic-based plasma cell counts exhibited excellent correlation with flow cytometry analysis. In peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>samples,</b> the <b>device</b> detected a baseline of 2 – 5 CD 138 ⁺ cells/mL in healthy donor blood, with significantly higher numbers in <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> of MM patients in remission (20 – 24 CD 138 ⁺ cells/mL), and yet higher numbers in MM patients exhibiting disease (45 – 184 CD 138 ⁺cells/mL).

40|$|Serotonin is an {{important}} neurotransmitter that {{plays a major role}} in the pathogenesis of a variety of conditions, including psychiatric disorders. The detection of serotonin typically relies on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), an expensive technique that requires sophisticated equipment and trained personnel, and is not suitable for point-of-care applications. In this contribution, we introduce a novel sensor platform that can measure spiked neurotransmitter concentrations in whole <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> in a fast and low-cost manner by combining synthetic receptors with a thermal readout technique—the heat-transfer method. In addition, the design of a miniaturized version of the sensing platform is presented that aims to bridge the gap between measurements in a laboratory setting and point-of-care measurements. This fully automated and integrated, user-friendly design features a capillary pumping unit that is compatible with point-of-care sampling techniques such as a <b>blood</b> lancet <b>device</b> (<b>sample</b> volume—between 50 µL and 300 µL).

40|$|The proper {{technique}} of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> {{to determine the}} level of glycemia {{plays an important role}} in diagnostics and therapy of diabetes mellitus. There has been a large shift in this disease in recent years, especially in diagnostics and treatment. It is a disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. In practice, it often happens that although it is a procedure nurses carry out almost daily, during capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia, a number of errors occurs. This fact inspired me to write a bachelor thesis on the topic "The issue of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia?. The empirical part of the thesis deals with both the disease Diabetes Mellitus itself and the capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling.</b> In the introductory part history and definition of diabetes are given, the causes of the disease, complications, diagnostics and treatment of Diabetes Mellitus are described. The issue of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the levels of glycemia is discussed in detail, as well as the recommended procedure of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> and <b>devices</b> designed for the sampling. The practical part of the thesis is focused on selected objectives, research questions and hypotheses. The objective of the research was to identify the factors that may affect the results of the examination, to find out whether nurses follow the recommended procedure for capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> and to identify the most common errors nurses make during the sampling. To achieve the objectives both quantitative and qualitative research surveys were carried out. The qualitative research was conducted by observations of six nurses working in inpatient wards in České Budějovice Hospital, plc, supplemented by interviews with the nurses. The three research questions can be answered as follows. The most common factors that may affect the test results is poor sample handling, sample exposure to unsuitable temperature conditions, and forced squeeze of blood from a finger. While collecting capillary blood nurses often make mistakes in communicating with the patient, when they do not give information about the performed punction and do not properly explain the whole procedure to the patient. They wash their hands before <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> without using a disinfectant. The interviews gave the answer to the last research question that the most common problem the nurses are aware of during capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> is forced squeeze of blood from a finger, poor disinfection of the punction site and a delayed transport to the laboratory. Qualitative research survey was supplemented by quantitative research, which consisted of 66 observations of capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling,</b> which were carried out by nurses in České Budějovice Hospital, plc. This research survey was conducted to verify the results obtained from the qualitative research. This hypothesis was formulated: H 1 : During capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia nurses most often make mistakes in communication with the patient. Based on the quantitative research, it has been found out that the most common mistake made by nurses is a failure to use a disinfectant for hand hygiene before <b>sampling</b> <b>blood</b> (16 %). The mistake in communication took the third place (14 %). Based on the above results the conclusion can be made that H 1 : During capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia nurses most often make mistakes in communication with the patient, has not been confirmed. Using the knowledge earned from literature and the conducted research I have proposed a standard of nursing care for nurses called "Capillary <b>blood</b> <b>sampling</b> to determine the level of glycemia.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: External {{pneumatic}} compression devices (EPC) prevent deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT) by reducing lower extremity venous stasis. Early studies suggested they also enhance fibrinolytic activity; however, in a recent study, EPC {{had no effect on}} systemic fibrinolysis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The hypothesis of this study was that EPCs enhance regional fibrinolysis in these subjects. Methods: Forty-five patients (44 male, one female; mean age, 67 years) undergoing major abdominal surgery (35 bowel procedures, 10 aortic reconstructions) were prospectively randomized to one of three groups for DVT prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin injections (HEP), thigh-length sequential EPC devices (EPC), or both (HEP+EPC). Prophylaxis was begun immediately before surgical incision and continued until postoperative day 5 or patient discharge. Venous <b>blood</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from the common femoral vein for measurement of regional fibrinolysis after induction of anesthesia but before initiation of prophylaxis, and on postoperative days 1, 3, and 5. A baseline sample was collected the day before surgery. Fibrinolysis was quantified with measurement of the activities of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; the activator of fibrinolysis) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) with amidolytic technique. Results: tPA activity in all groups was normal at baseline; baseline PAI- 1 activity was elevated. Within each prophylaxis group, no significant changes occurred in either tPA or PAI- 1 activities after induction of anesthesia or after surgery compared with before surgery (P >. 05, analysis of variance with repeated measures). No changes occurred between postoperative samples and after anesthesia within each group. No significant enhancement of fibrinolysis, manifested as either increased tPA activity or decreased PAI- 1 activity, occurred in either EPC group compared with the HEP group at any time point (P >. 05, analysis of variance with repeated measures). No differences were noted when surgery was performed for malignant disease versus nonmalignant disease. Conclusion: In this study, enhanced regional fibrinolysis in the lower extremities could not be detected with the use of EPCs, as measured with tPA and PAI- 1 activity in common femoral venous <b>blood</b> <b>samples.</b> EPC <b>devices</b> do not appear to prevent DVT with fibrinolytic enhancement; effective and safe prophylaxis is provided only when the devices are used in a manner that reduces lower extremity venous stasis.
