5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love <b>behavior</b> <b>modification</b> programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} {{take place in the}} wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed gratification, and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of gratification. It {{is important to note}} that for a <b>behavior</b> <b>modification</b> regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E

5|$|Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids is a non-fiction book by Maia Szalavitz {{analyzing}} {{the controversy surrounding}} the tough love <b>behavior</b> <b>modification</b> industry. The book was published February 16, 2006, by Riverhead Books. Szalavitz focuses on four programs: Straight, Incorporated, {{a copy of the}} Straight Inc. program called KIDS, North Star wilderness boot camp, and the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools. She discusses the background, history and methodology of the troubled-teen industry, including techniques drawn from attack therapy and Synanon. She uses first-person accounts and court testimony in her research, and states that no evidence exists proving that these programs are effective. The book also includes advice for parents and an appendix with additional resources on how to get responsible help for teenagers.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification <b>behavior</b> <b>modification</b> plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

50|$|The {{composite}} reuse {{principle is}} an alternative to inheritance. This technique supports polymorphism and code reuse by separating behaviors from the primary class hierarchy and including specific behavior classes as required in any business domain class. This approach avoids the static nature of a class hierarchy by allowing <b>behavior</b> <b>modifications</b> at run time and allows one class to implement behaviors buffet-style, instead of being restricted to the behaviors of its ancestor classes.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time of Eysenck's work, B. F. Skinner and his {{associates}} were beginning {{to have an impact}} with their work on operant conditioning.

First, the evolution of past ambient display applications is analyzed according to their persuasive capabilities and environmental contexts, ranging from large-scale installations towards more personalized applications of ubiquitous and wearable computing.

25|$|Behavior therapies use {{behavioral}} techniques, including applied behavior analysis (also {{known as}} <b>behavior</b> <b>modification),</b> to change maladaptive {{patterns of behavior}} to improve emotional responses, cognitions, and interactions with others. Functional analytic psychotherapy is one form of this approach. By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused {{on the environment and}} context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behavior ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behavior as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analyzing bidirectional interactions).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective:The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of pregabalin on the behavior of rats under the influence of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist that mimics the symptoms of schizophrenia. Methods:Rats were injected with saline or 25 mg/kg ketamine intraperitoneally. After that, <b>behavior</b> <b>modifications</b> were investigated by the evaluation of stereotypy and hyperlocomotion, after treating rats with pregabalin (at doses of 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) or placebo (saline solution). Results:The administration of pregabalin reduced ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion. However, neither doses of pregabalin had a significant effect on ketamine-induced stereotypy. Conclusion:This is the first study to investigate the effects of pregabalin using an animal model of psychosis. Furthermore, our results indicate that behavioral changes induced by ketamine in rats can be reversed with the use of pregabalin, suggesting its potential to treat psychotic symptoms...|$|R

Knowledge is necessary but not sufficient for behavior change, and teaching {{should not be confused}} with learning. The education of patients with osteoporosis poses two problems: patient involvement in deciding whether to initiate treatments such as estrogen replacement therapy, calcium supplements, and weight-bearing exercises, and assuring that the patient adheres to the prescribed regimen. The physician, while adequately outlining the risks of treatments, should also simplify the explanation to assist patients in making a decision about treatment. Guidelines are provided to aid the clinician in this task.

40|$|Both non-determinism and {{multi-level}} networks compactly {{characterize the}} flexibility allowed in implementing a circuit.

The theory supports all the network manipulations commonly applied to deterministic binary networks, such as node minimization, elimination, and decomposition. It is shown that an ND network's {{behavior can be}} interpreted in three ways, all of which coincide when the network is deterministic. Operations performed on an ND network are analyzed under each interpretation for changes in a network's <b>behavior.</b> <b>Modifications</b> of a few operations are given which must be used to guarantee that a network's behavior does not violate its external specification.
