2500|$|The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again {{verified}} {{the great}} pottery {{tradition of the}} Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting {{question is whether or}} not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply [...] "made in Luzon." [...] In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified [...] "Imbe" [...] jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ("Chinese Pottery," [...] Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the <b>basnig,</b> a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture: ...|$|E
50|$|The piloto {{will then}} {{instruct}} {{the crew of}} two who will manually operate a huge fish net to get the fish into the boat. Then a net will be deployed in the middle part of the boat to temporarily put the live fish for separation. After {{a few minutes the}} crew will then start the segregation of the fish according to type and will be stored in a Styrofoam box with crushed ice. A <b>basnig</b> catch mostly composed of types of scad fish, mackerel, tuna, sardines, red fish, anchovy, squid and a few other fishes and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|The piloto {{will then}} {{communicate}} with the machinist {{to turn off the}} lights from each section. First, the bow and stern then the next section until the only remaining light is the light in the mid section. The Piloto will sometimes use a lid saklob that looks like a pail with no bottom or a funnel. This makes the light become thinner like a laser effect these will make the group of fish to compress. The piloto will now give the signal to the crew to start pulling the ropes. The <b>basnig</b> has a total of 8 poles, each poles will have at least 3 crew members one to stop the rope and the two crews pulls the rope. When the pabigat weight/net is already one meter above the water one of the crew will walk through the outrigger to pull the net {{to the side of the}} boat usually the right side of the boat then the crews from the left side of the boat will pull the net to the right side of the boat. Then the rest of the net will be pulled up by the crew at the right side of the boat until the catch are visible.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Basnig</b> is a {{traditional}} fishing technique in the Philippines also {{the name of the}} boat used in this method. Usually, made up of wood with a small [...] "fuente/pwente" [...] cabin wherein the crew sleeps and also where the ship's wheel [...] "timon" [...] is located. It also has outriggers katig composed of three huge logs and bamboo. They lure fish with gas powered lights during the nightly fishing trips. 24 to 30 person crew boats go to sea in the afternoon and return early the following morning. Most signal/communications from piloto to makinista and crews are through ringing a bell because of the noise emitted by the machine/engine which is always on because it serves as an engine to run the boat and a generator during the night. Each crew member has individual responsibilities; a Pilot or Piloto {{is the head of the}} boat, and has one or two subordinates, Segunda Piloto (2nd Pilot) and sometime Tricera Piloto (3rd Pilot). The Makinista is in charge of the motor and the electrical system, the Timonil is like the driver, the Taong Lambat is in charge of the net in case of damage, the Kusinero is the Cook, and the rest are just crew members.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{important}} pottery traditions that spread into the Oceania region had {{their counterparts in the}} Philippines including the well-known Lapita culture. This quote from American anthropologist Wilhelm Solheim illustrates the matter: I hypothesize that the Sa-huynh Kalanay and Lapita pottery traditions had a common origin somewhere in the Palawan-Sarawak-Sulu Sea-Sulawesi area and that it was {{at this point in time}} and space that a second and main stage in the spread of the Austronesian languages began.
