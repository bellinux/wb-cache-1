5|$|The {{museum is}} the largest {{repository}} of rail relics in North and South Carolina and averages 80,000 visitors annually. About three-thousand people were employed to repair the trains at the Spencer Shops {{in the first half}} of the twentieth-century. The Flue Shop, where all the flues for steam engines were formerly produced, has become the <b>Bumper</b> To <b>Bumper</b> exhibit, featuring vintage and antique cars. These include: several Model Ts, a Model A, and even a Ford Model R (the 1907 predecessor to the Model T). A Highway Patrol car from 1935, a Divco Milk Truck, a Lincoln Continental and others are also part of the museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|Chavez praised Del Rey's {{translation}} for {{retaining the}} manga's original identity; the header, <b>bumper</b> artwork, character biographies, and front covers {{are all but}} identical to the Japanese. Eries also thanked Del Rey's translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her, although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses.|$|E

5000|$|Stainless steel <b>bumpers,</b> {{as opposed}} to the chromed mild steel <b>bumpers</b> on the Giulia Sprint GT. The <b>bumpers</b> are the same shape, but are made in two pieces (front) and three pieces (rear) with small covers hiding the joining rivets.|$|R
50|$|Most tables have twelve <b>bumpers,</b> {{although}} some tables have fourteen or sixteen. Two <b>bumpers</b> flank each pocket. The remaining <b>bumpers</b> {{are arranged in}} a cross {{in the center of}} the table, with one line of the cross in line with the pockets. At the center of the cross, there is an open space just large enough to allow a ball to pass through. Tables with fourteen <b>bumpers</b> have three rather than two <b>bumpers</b> on each side of the center space on the line midway between the two holes.|$|R
5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front <b>bumper,</b> with integrated foglamps, a unique rear <b>bumper</b> with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
5|$|In 1927 Butlin leased a {{piece of}} land from the Earl of Scarbrough by the seaside town of Skegness, where he set up an {{amusement}} park with hoopla stalls, a tower slide, a haunted house ride and, in 1928, a miniature railway and Dodgem carsthese were the first <b>bumper</b> cars in Britain, as Butlin had an exclusive license to import them.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the IAU definition of dwarf planet, some scientists expressed their disagreement with the IAU resolution. Campaigns included car <b>bumper</b> stickers and T-shirts. Mike Brown (the discoverer of Eris) agrees with the reduction of the number of planets to eight.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, United States Government-mandated rubber <b>bumpers</b> were attached. In 1974 [...] "5mph" [...] <b>bumpers</b> were required.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Télétoon started airing <b>bumpers</b> {{with its}} first mascot, Teletina. These <b>bumpers</b> {{were made by}} Spin Productions in Toronto. Several more <b>bumpers</b> using CGI {{animation}} with some made by Guru Studio premiered on the channel in 2001. An updated look for the channel, no longer featuring the original logo, was later created for a partial rebranding in 2005. The <b>bumpers</b> were removed in 2007 {{as part of an}} on-air rebranding.|$|R
50|$|In most jurisdictions, <b>bumpers</b> {{are legally}} {{required}} on all vehicles. Regulations for automobile <b>bumpers</b> {{have been implemented}} for two reasons - to allow the car to sustain a low-speed impact without damage to the vehicle's safety systems, and to protect pedestrians from injury. These requirements are in conflict: <b>bumpers</b> that withstand impact well and minimize repair costs tend to injure pedestrians more, while pedestrian-friendly <b>bumpers</b> tend to have higher repair costs.|$|R
5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the <b>bumper</b> blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing into the wall {{at the end of the}} line. The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|Several rock {{prominences}} {{exist on}} the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence {{near the bottom of}} Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The <b>Bumper</b> are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck was {{featured}} prominently on the October 18, 2007 episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money. Cramer exited the Wreck's passenger door {{to start the}} show and one of Cramer's trademark soundboards {{was attached to the}} front <b>bumper.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{second time}} I was ditched the shack {{gave me a}} lecture. He told me I was risking my life, {{that it was a}} fast freight and that she went some. I told him I was used to going some myself, but it was no go. He said he wouldn't permit me to commit suicide, and I hit the grit. But I nailed her a third time, getting in between on the <b>bumpers.</b> They were the most meagre <b>bumpers</b> I had ever seen--I do not refer to the real <b>bumpers,</b> the iron <b>bumpers</b> that are {{connected}} by the coupling-link and that pound and grind on each other; what I refer to are the beams, like huge cleats, that cross the ends of freight cars just above the <b>bumpers.</b> When one rides the <b>bumpers,</b> he stands on these cleats, one foot on each, the <b>bumpers</b> between his feet and just beneath.|$|R
50|$|Until 1983 the Alfasud Sprint had {{stainless}} steel <b>bumpers,</b> restyling in 1983 brought plastic and lower <b>bumpers,</b> a different grille, {{and some other}} upgrades like 14 in Italspeed wheels with 8 circles and nonstandard Michelin 340 mm tyres. Depending on equipment, some Sprints had plastic side <b>bumpers</b> and rear spoiler (mainly Quadrifoglio Verde).The most common was the Zender pack add-in, with lower <b>bumpers</b> and sideskirts, sold mostly in the UK {{and a few other}} countries.|$|R
50|$|Chassis' are {{designed}} with front <b>bumpers,</b> optional side and rear <b>bumpers</b> designed to hold guide rollers that interact with the track's 58mm high walls.|$|R
5|$|The Season Eight DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Jim and the others {{trying to get the}} truck into the warehouse door but getting the truck stuck instead, Dwight trying to use Kevin as a <b>bumper</b> on the oil track, and Phyllis, Toby, and Ryan revealing what they would do if they won the lottery.|$|E
5|$|Altgens recovered, and {{his next}} {{photograph}} showed the First Lady {{with her hand}} on the vehicle's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill standing on the <b>bumper</b> behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
5|$|Altgens was on {{assignment}} for the AP when he captured two historic images on November 22, 1963. The second photograph, showing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy {{toward the rear}} of the presidential limousine and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on its <b>bumper,</b> was reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Within days, Altgens' preceding photograph became controversial after people began to question whether accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was visible in the main doorway of the Texas School Book Depository as the gunshots were fired at JFK.|$|E
50|$|Special <b>bumpers</b> add a {{multiplier}} to the player’s score when hit. Players {{attempting to}} maximize scores {{will try to}} hit as many special <b>bumpers</b> in a single shot as possible. Bonus points are earned when all special <b>bumpers</b> disappear and when the player clears a level in a single or two shots.|$|R

5|$|Cooder's fifteenth album, Election Special {{was first}} {{released}} in the Netherlands on August 16, 2012. It was subsequently released as a digital download to iTunes on August 17 by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records. The album's physical release in Germany was also on August 17. It followed on August 20 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and on August 21 in North America and Australia. Its pre-order from Nonesuch Records' website was bundled with a campaign button and <b>bumper</b> sticker designed similarly to the album artwork.|$|E
5|$|Marge is {{depicted}} in much The Simpsons-related merchandise, including T-shirts, baseball caps, <b>bumper</b> stickers, cardboard stand-ups, refrigerator magnets, key rings, buttons, dolls, posters and figurines. She has appeared in each of The Simpsons video games, including The Simpsons Game, released in 2007. Besides the television series, Marge regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics, which were first published on November 29, 1993, and are issued monthly. Marge also {{plays a role in}} The Simpsons Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front <b>bumper</b> and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing <b>bumper</b> guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
50|$|Off-road {{vehicles}} often utilize aftermarket off-road <b>bumpers</b> made {{of heavy}} gauge metal {{to improve the}} road clearance, maximize departure angles, clear larger tires and ensure additional protection from the elements. The same as bull bars off-road <b>bumpers</b> feature a rigid construction and transmit all force of a collision to the object that they bump on, which is more dangerous for pedestrians than factory plastic <b>bumpers.</b> The legality of the aftermarket off-road <b>bumpers</b> varies significantly {{from country to country}} (from state to state in the USA).|$|R
25|$|In 1999, Teletoon started airing <b>bumpers</b> {{with its}} first mascot, Teletina. These <b>bumpers</b> {{were made by}} Spin Productions in Toronto.

An updated look for the channel, no longer featuring the original logo, was later created for a partial rebranding in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the park}} opened, {{the cars were}} tested without the <b>bumpers,</b> and were almost {{completely}} destroyed by the test drivers. <b>Bumpers</b> were fitted around the vehicle, but there were still problems with collisions, as a guide rail {{had yet to be}} implemented on the ride. Eventually the vehicles were fitted with spring-loaded <b>bumpers</b> to discourage collisions.|$|R
5|$|Ring's main {{contribution}} to the second Test, at Sydney, which Australia won by seven wickets, came with bat rather than ball. He took only one wicket in a match made controversial by liberal use of the <b>bumper</b> by the faster Australian bowlers. But batting at No 9 and joining Lindwall at 372 for seven, just 10 ahead of the West Indies' first innings total, his 65 in 102 minutes helped add 113 before he was ninth out.|$|E
5|$|The MCU Park, home park of the Brooklyn Cyclones, {{is located}} {{slightly}} to the west. The nearby area also has assorted amusement park attractions such as <b>bumper</b> cars, carousels, and ice skating rinks, especially along Surf Avenue. The former Parachute Jump is nearby and visible from the station. In addition, the seasonal Coney Island Mermaid Parade is held every summer near the station. The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, held on July 4th each year, also takes place near the station across Surf Avenue at the original Nathan's Famous store.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} four tracks {{underneath}} this station, {{which are not}} visible from the platforms. An emergency exit located {{in the middle of}} the Jamaica-bound platform leads to this lower level. The two outer tracks lead to Jamaica Yard while the two center tracks are used for reversing trains from Forest Hills–71st Avenue and end at <b>bumper</b> blocks just east of 75th Avenue under the mainline tracks.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{the vehicle}} <b>bumpers</b> were {{required}} to be painted with the respective MRT line colors. G 2, for example serves the Brown, Green and Orange Lines, therefore was required to have <b>bumpers</b> painted in brown, green and orange, later all painted in green. As of now most vehicles have their <b>bumpers</b> returned to the original livery, pink.|$|R
