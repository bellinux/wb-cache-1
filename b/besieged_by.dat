The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but most the refugees were <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E

5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> land and sea by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the cold {{and the lack of}} provisions.|$|E

5|$|Pope Gregory VIII {{called for}} a Third Crusade against the Muslims in early 1189. Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, Philip Augustus of France, and Richard the Lionheart of England formed an {{alliance}} to reconquer Jerusalem.

From 1189 to 1191, Acre was <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> the Crusaders, and despite initial Muslim successes, it fell to Richard's forces. A massacre of 2,700 Muslim inhabitants ensued, and the Crusaders then planned to take Ascalon in the south.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{garrison}} in Montevideo, {{the capital}} of Cisplatina (then Brazil's southernmost province), {{was the last to}} surrender. In 1825, secessionists in the province rebelled.

The Emperor's Battalion, to which Luís Alves was attached, was sent to guard Montevideo, then <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> rebel forces. Luís Alves fought in engagements against the insurgents during 1827 (7 February, 5 July, 7 July, 14 July, 5 August and 7 August).|$|E
5|$|The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the {{official}} residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> many foreign powers. Since {{the end of the}} 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> unruly British soldiers who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return.|$|E

They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops.

De Lacy also led an army in an attack against Bath {{in the service of the}} Empress, along with Geoffrey Talbot, which also occurred in 1138 and which some historians have seen as the opening act of the civil war.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of 1449, Branković imprisoned Hungarian regent John Hunyadi in the dungeons of the fortress until he was ransomed by his countrymen.

The Turks took 50,000 men, women and children during that raid, but Smederevo was well-led by Thomas Kantakouzenos. Despite having only 6,000 men, compared to the Ottomans' 20,000, the city withstood. Mehmed the Conqueror besieged Smederevo for the second time and the fortress was <b>besieged</b> <b>by</b> the Ottomans {{for the third time in}} 1456, being defended by Serbian forces. In 1459, Smederevo was captured by the Ottomans, leading to the end of the medieval Serbian state.|$|E

In 1359 the Castilian fleet raided the Valencian and Catalan coasts, not obtaining satisfying results but menacing the town of Alicante. Peter IV, seeing that his southern frontier was in danger, dispatched several horse companies led by Pere de Xèrica to defend the area around Orihuela, Crevillente and Elche, and also ordered all the fortresses to be provisioned with enough ammunitions and supplies.|$|R
