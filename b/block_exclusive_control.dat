40|$|In {{object-oriented}} systems, object associations generally {{result in}} a complex structure whose precise description is {{a crucial part of}} the system 's formal specification. A particularly common object association arises when one object exclusively controls (owns) another. As <b>exclusive</b> object <b>control</b> is an important aspect of safety and security critical systems, specific notation to capture directly such a notion needs to be included in any formal specification language. This paper first discusses the problems that arise when using the existing Object-Z notations, such as object containment, to capture the notion of <b>exclusive</b> <b>control.</b> Then the Object-Z notation is extended to enable the notion of <b>exclusive</b> <b>control</b> to be modelled directly. Finally, a case study is presented to contrast the distinction between the use of <b>exclusive</b> <b>control</b> and object containment when modelling objectoriented systems...|$|R

40|$|If {{property}} {{is defined as}} something over which an individual should have <b>exclusive</b> <b>control,</b> then the traditional notion of property must be abandoned. Specifically, {{the idea that a}} physical object is someone’s property fails to meet the definition given. This paper examines why an individual should not always have <b>exclusive</b> <b>control</b> over physical things, and, if not objects, what exactly an individual should have <b>exclusive</b> <b>control</b> over. The proposed solution is that property be delineated not by physical boundaries, but by human action. This does not include all action, for scarcity makes certain actions mutually exclusive. Therefore, {{property is}} conceived of as proper action, i. e., action consistent with the non-aggression principle. Those physical objects traditionally considered property are then simply means of proper action. The benefits of this change in perspective are then examined with regard to production, exchange, aggression and other related topics...|$|R

50|$|Most American courts {{recognize}} res ipsa loquitur. The Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 328D {{describes a}} two-step process for establishing res ipsa loquitur.
