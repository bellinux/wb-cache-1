A number of combinations of walls and roofs for the house have been used, and the annual electrical energy to air-condition the model house for these combinations are estimated. Comparison of the results revealed that a house whose walls are built from thermostone blocks would consume 25 % to 30 % less electrical energy than one whose walls are built from hollow concrete blocks.

40|$|SUMMARY This paper proposes per-tone {{equalization}} {{methods for}} single <b>carrier</b> <b>block</b> transmission with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) systems. Minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) based optimum weights of the per-tone equalizers are derived for SISO (single-input single-output), SIMO (single-input multipleoutput), and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) SC-CP systems. Unlike conventional frequency domain equalization methods, where discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is employed, the per-tone equalizers utilize sliding DFT, {{which makes it}} possible to achieve good performance even when the length of the guard interval is shorter than the channel order. Computer simulation results show that the proposed equalizers can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the SISO, SIMO, and MIMO SC-CP systems with the insufficient guard interval. key words: per-tone equalization, single <b>carrier</b> <b>block</b> transmission, cyclic prefix 1...|$|R

40|$|Background—Isolated cardiac {{conduction}} {{block is}} a relatively common condition in young and elderly populations. Genetic predisposing factors have long been suspected because of numerous familial case reports. Deciphering genetic predisposing factors of conduction blocks may give a hint at stratifying conduction <b>block</b> <b>carriers</b> in a more efficient way. Methods and Results—One Lebanese family and 2 French families with autosomal dominant isolated cardiac conduction blocks were used for linkage analysis. A maximum combined multipoint lod score of 10. 5 was obtained on a genomic interval including more than 300 genes. After screening 12 genes of this interval for mutation, we found a heterozygous missense mutation of the TRPM 4 gene in each family (p. Arg 164 Trp, p. Ala 432 Thr, and p. Gly 844 Asp). This gene encodes the TRPM 4 channel, a calcium-activated nonselective cation channel of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) ion channel family. All 3 mutations result in an increased current density. This gain of function is due to an elevated TRPM 4 channel density at the cell surface secondary to impaired endocytosis and deregulation of Small Ubiquitin MOdifier conjugation (SUMOylation). Furthermore, we showed by immunohistochemistry that TRPM 4 channel signal level is higher in atrial cardiomyocytes than in common ventricular cells, but is highest in Purkinje fibers. Small bundles of highly TRPM 4 -positive cells {{were found in the}} subendocardium and in rare intramural bundles. Conclusions—the TRPM 4 gene is a causative gene in isolated cardiac conduction disease with mutations resulting in a gain of function and TRPM 4 channel being highly expressed in cardiac Purkinje fibers.
