5|$|Large chromatophores densely {{cover the}} upper {{surfaces}} of the head, mantle and arms. They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side. The fins do not possess chromatophores on the underside. Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to <b>brownish</b> pink and <b>brownish</b> violet.|$|E
5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to <b>brownish</b> orange or <b>brownish</b> pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to <b>brownish</b> dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores of M.sextelata are {{elliptical}} and smooth, typically measuring 18–25 by 10–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, hyaline (translucent), cylindrical, {{and measure}} 200–325 by 5–25µm. Paraphyses are cylindrical, septate, and measure 175–300 by 2–15µm. Their tips are variably shaped, from rounded, to club-shaped, to fuse-shaped. The {{contents of the}} paraphyses are hyaline (translucent) to faintly <b>brownish</b> in dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH). Hyphae on the sterile cap ridges are septate and measure 50–180 by 5–25µm. The terminal cells are variably shaped (similar to the paraphyses), and have <b>brownish</b> contents in KOH.|$|E
5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is <b>brownish</b> {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are {{surrounded}} with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark <b>brownish</b> grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adult females, {{but have}} broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly streaked rather than scalloped appearance, {{and the overall}} appearance is browner rather than uniformly blackish. Juvenile males have brownish-orange feet while juvenile females have <b>brownish</b> feet and a dusky greyish-green bill.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook cinnamomina {{is found}} on Tepa and Babar Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It has {{cinnamon}} upperparts, <b>brownish</b> crown and cinnamon-streaked underparts. Its redder coloration and small size led German naturalist Ernst Hartert to describe it as a distinct taxon in 1906. The call is {{similar to those of}} the Australian subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Oecomys sydandersoni is an {{arboreal}} {{species of}} rodent in the genus Oecomys. It lives in forest patches {{in a small}} area in eastern Bolivia.

5|$|The only specimen, the holotype, {{is mostly}} <b>brownish</b> above, with {{dark and light}} spots, and white below. The snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in). Several {{features}} of the scales align it with Trachylepis over the related American genus Mabuya.|$|E
5|$|The spores are broadly , smooth, colorless, amyloid (staining bluish to blue-black when {{treated with}} Melzer's reagent), {{thin-walled}}, and measure 8–9 by 5–6µm. The basidia are 40–60 by 10–12µm, club-shaped, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant, club-shaped, and measure 30–45 by 10–17µm. Their tips {{are covered with}} one or more, knob-like short excrescences that are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 12–21µm wide, cylindrical (but often somewhat inflated), smooth, and contain cytoplasmic <b>brownish</b> pigment. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–7µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth, or can be covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or pale <b>brownish,</b> and dextrinoid. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle is parallel, cylindrical, hyaline or <b>brownish,</b> and dextrinoid; it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–8µm wide, and similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 45–88 by 5–8µm, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or <b>brownish,</b> and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8–25µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} cap cuticle, the stem cuticle, the gill flesh, and at the basal septa of the basidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{stems of}} most cacti are some shade of green, often bluish or <b>brownish</b> green. Such stems contain {{chlorophyll}} {{and are able}} to carry out photosynthesis; they also have stomata (small structures that can open and close to allow passage of gases). Cactus stems are often visibly waxy.|$|E
5|$|The subhymenium (a {{layer of}} cells {{immediately}} below the hymenium) consists of spherical {{cells that are}} interwoven with hyphae; this layer is hyaline to yellowish or <b>brownish,</b> and does not have pigment crusted {{on the walls of}} the hyphae. The epicutis (the upper of two layers of the cap cuticle) is made of a thin gelatinous layer of hyaline or <b>brownish</b> hyphae measuring 1.5–2.5μm in diameter. The hypodermium (the cuticle tissue layer under the epicutis) is hyaline, and has elongated to roughly spherical hyphae that are 10–18μm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of P.aztecorum.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to <b>brownish</b> gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E
5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans are mixed with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered in olive oil and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and <b>brownish</b> color.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and pedicel are noticeably darker and <b>brownish</b> red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys peninsulae is a {{medium-sized}} {{member of the}} genus, smaller than O.albiventer but larger than O.couesi mexicanus. Its fur is grayish-brown on the forequarters, but reddish-brown on the hindquarters; this coloration pattern is unique among western Mexican Oryzomys. The underparts are a dirty white, the feet white above, and the tail dark or <b>brownish</b> above and dirty white below.|$|E
5|$|Portia labiata is a {{jumping spider}} (family Salticidae) found in Sri Lanka, India, {{southern}} China, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, Singapore, Java, Sumatra and the Philippines. In this medium-sized jumping spider, the front part is orange-brown {{and the back}} part is <b>brownish.</b> The conspicuous main eyes provide vision more acute than a cat's {{during the day and}} 10times more acute than a dragonfly's, and this is essential in P. labiata′s navigation, hunting and mating.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or <b>brownish</b> white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E
5|$|Species that {{resemble}} A.deserticola include the desert fungi Montagnea arenaria and Podaxis pistillaris. Montagnea arenaria is a whitish stalked puffball with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva {{at the base}} of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. Podaxis pistillaris has a cylindrical to oval white to <b>brownish</b> cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.|$|E

It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and <b>brownish</b> red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces {{are covered with}} small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae of the flesh are <b>brownish</b> with thin walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The female is {{very similar}} to the male but the upper parts are {{somewhat}} more <b>brownish</b> and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven <b>brownish</b> seeds. The species typically grows {{in areas where the}} soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , smooth, colorless, {{distinctly}} amyloid (absorbing iodine stain from Melzer's reagent), thin-walled, {{and measure}} 11.5–14 by 6–8µm.
