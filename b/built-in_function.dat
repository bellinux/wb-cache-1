25|$|In 2011 {{researchers}} at Hanyang University, Korea, reported a polygon-surface reference Korean male phantom (PSRK-Man). This phantom was constructed by converting the Visible Korean Human-Man (VKH-man) into a polygonal mesh-based phantom.

Without voxelization the PSRK-man could be directly implemented in Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation using a <b>built-in</b> <b>function,</b> but the computation time was 70~150 times longer than that required by High Definition Reference Korean-Man (HDRK-Man), a voxelized phantom derived also from VKH-man.|$|E
