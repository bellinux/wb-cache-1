40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{laminar flame}} speeds and Markstein lengths of iso-octane/n-butanol−air {{mixtures}} were measured via the outwardly expanding spherical flame method and high-speed schlieren photography {{over a wide}} range of equivalence ratios and blending ratios of n-butanol at elevated initial temperatures. Results show that laminar flame speeds of fuel blends slightly increase with increasing <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> of n-butanol. The effect of <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> on laminar flame speed of fuel blends was mechanistically interpreted through examining the thermodynamic and diffusive property, as well as the overall oxidation kinetics. Measurements on the burned gas Markstein length show a generalized behavior. There exists a minimum absolute Markstein length at the critical equivalence ratio ϕ*, under which the stretch effect on the flame propagating speed is minimized. At equivalence ratios less than ϕ*, Markstein length is decreased with increasing <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> of n-butanol, indicating that the addition of n-butanol reduces the diffusional thermal stability of the blend; while at equivalence ratios larger than ϕ*, Markstein length increases with increasing <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> of n-butanol. This experimental observation on the Markstein length is consistent with the theoretical investigation. A correlation of laminar flame speed of n-butanol/iso-octane blend as a function of equivalence ratio, temperature, and <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> of n-butanol is given on the basis of experimental data. 1...|$|E

This paper {{describes}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} effects of the particle <b>blend</b> <b>ratio</b> on surface quality in surface polishing using magnetic polishing liquid (MPL). MPL is produced by mixing sub-micrometer- or micrometer-size abrasive particles into a Magnetic Compound Fluid (MCF), a functional fluid composed of MF(Magnetic Fluid) and MRF (Magneto-rheological Fluid), that reacts with magnetic fields.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{biodiesel}} on emissions of diesel passenger cars {{is a combination}} of the fuel properties, the <b>blending</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the vehicle technology. In this study, saturated and unsaturated biodiesel fuels were tested neat (B 100) and in 30 % blend with fossil diesel (B 30) on two Euro 3 diesel passenger cars of different engine technologies, namely common rail and unit injector. The measured dataset is enlarged by introducing B 10 results from an earlier study [15] in order to produce generalized conclusions over a wider range of blends. None of these vehicles was equipped with a particle filter and different conclusions might be reached for filter-equipped vehicles. The results indicate that the influence of biodiesel on pollutant emissions primarily depends on the <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> and secondly on the level of unsaturation and engine technology. Tailpipe CO 2, NOx and PM emissions with biodiesel varied from 1 % to + 3 %, 1 % to 14 %, and 18 % to 35 %, respectively, compared to fossil diesel. The difference over fossil diesel generally increased with an increasing <b>blending</b> <b>ratio.</b> CO and HC emissions increased over the fossil diesel but remained at low levels and did not threaten the compliance of the vehicles with their respective emission limits. Use of biodiesel on the common rail vehicle led to a smaller NOx increase and a higher PM reduction than in the unit-injector case. The unsaturated fuel generally led to higher NOx emissions from both engine technologies. However, the maximum <b>blending</b> <b>ratio</b> of saturated biodiesel is limited to around B 30 due to cold-flow limitations. Hence, the saturated vs. unsaturated species ratio should be carefully designed in market fuels in order to optimize environmental and operational benefits.

30|$|In this study, Ch/PEGF blend {{films were}} {{prepared}} with different <b>blend</b> <b>ratios.</b> In vitro degradation {{results revealed that}} any decrement in Ch/PEGF <b>blend</b> <b>ratio</b> resulted in a corresponding increase in their degradation rate due to higher PEGF water solubility. The pH evaluations made in the polymer degradation media showed the presence of that enzyme with a concentration similar to the human serum that was negligible. Cell behaviors toward all the formulations showed acceptable high biocompatibility and non-toxicity properties with fibroblast L 929 cells under in vitro testing conditions. The film of Ch/PEGF with 80 / 20 of <b>blend</b> <b>ratio</b> {{was chosen as the}} optimum support for wound dressing applications due to biodegradation and biocompatibility properties as well as keeping their integrity during 28  days after incubation. We believe these films with such properties can be widely applied to biomedical applications such as a wound dressing material.|$|R
