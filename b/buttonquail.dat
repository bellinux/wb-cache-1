5|$|The birds {{most often}} {{mentioned}} {{in relation to}} North Island are the Abrolhos painted <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix varius scintillans), a rare subspecies of the widespread painted <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix varius) known only from the Wallabi Group and protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950; and the brush bronzewing (Phaps elegans), {{one of the most}} common birds on North Island, the mainland populations of which are decreasing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>buttonquail</b> are {{an ancient}} lineage of {{shorebirds}} which closely resemble true quail in appearance but are unrelated. They {{are found in}} Africa, Asia and Australia, with one species reaching Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|North Island is {{considered}} to have high conservation value with respect to its populations of brush bronzewing and Abrolhos painted <b>buttonquail,</b> and its dune, limestone and salt lake vegetation communities. The potential existence of historically significant artefacts on Record Hill, namely the bottle left by Wickham and Stokes in 1840, has not been assessed.|$|E

50|$|Red-chested <b>buttonquails</b> are partial migrants. Red-chested <b>buttonquails</b> {{are known}} to have {{seasonal}} migration between inland arid regions to semi-arid areas nearer the coast, from winter to spring and summer. Some populations remain in one region all year round. The amount of movement is influenced by factors such as rainfall, plant growth and food availability.|$|R
50|$|Red-chested <b>buttonquails</b> {{are found}} {{along the eastern}} side of Australia and the top of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. They are not found in Tasmania.|$|R
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted <b>buttonquail.</b> Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
25|$|A boat-trip {{along the}} Luwomwba River, {{or any other}} major river in the park may reveal Pel’s fishing owl, African finfoot, half-collared kingfisher, Ross’ turaco and Böhm’s bee-eater. The vast {{wetlands}} of Kasanka support some species not easily seen elsewhere such as rufous-bellied heron, lesser jacana and African pygmy goose. The shoebill was confirmed {{for the first time}} in 20 years at the end of 2010 and a breeding pair of wattled cranes and their offspring are often encountered. Marsh tchagra, coppery-tailed coucal, Fulleborn's longclaw, locustfinch, pale-crowned, croaking and short-winged cisticola, chestnut-headed and streaky-breasted flufftail, harlequin and blue quail, black-rumped <b>buttonquail</b> and fawn-breasted waxbill are amongst the other specials on the wetland fringes and in the large dambo’s.|$|E
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred <b>buttonquail,</b> Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Buttonquails</b> are small, drab, running birds, which avoid flying. The female is {{the more}} richly-colored of the sexes. While the quail-plover {{is thought to be}} monogamous, Turnix <b>buttonquails</b> are {{sequentially}} polyandrous; both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but normally only the male incubates the eggs and tends the young, while the female may go on to mate with other males. The eggs hatch after an incubation period of 12 or 13 days, and the young are able to fly within two weeks of hatching.|$|R
5|$|The <b>buttonquails</b> are small, drab, running birds which {{resemble}} the true quails. The female is the brighter {{of the sexes}} and initiates courtship. The male incubates the eggs and tends the young.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>buttonquail,</b> Kurrichane <b>buttonquail,</b> small <b>buttonquail,</b> or Andalusian hemipode (Turnix sylvaticus) is a <b>buttonquail,</b> {{one of a}} {{small family}} of birds which resemble, but are {{unrelated}} to, the true quails. This species is resident from southern Spain and Africa through India and tropical Asia to Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The black-rumped <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix nanus) {{is a small}} {{species of}} bird in the <b>buttonquail</b> genus.|$|E
50|$|The Hottentot <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix hottentottus) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Turnicidae {{formerly}} considered conspecific with the black-rumped <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix nanus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>buttonquails</b> are a {{group of}} small {{terrestrial}} birds. The smallest species is the quail-plover, the only species in the genus Ortyxelos, which is 10 cm in length and weighs only 20 g. The <b>buttonquails</b> in the genus Turnix range from 12 to(-) 23 cm in length and weigh between 30 to(-) 130 g. They superficially resemble the true quails of the genus Coturnix, but differ from them in lacking a hind toe and a crop. The females of this family also possess a unique vocal organ created by an enlarged trachea and inflatable bulb in the oesophagus, which they use to produce a booming call.|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} a brown back, rufous chest, and pale belly, brown irises {{and a black}} rump. As usual for <b>buttonquails</b> but not for most birds, the female is larger and {{brighter}} than the male. This species is shy and difficult to flush.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{formerly}} {{believed to be}} related to the <b>buttonquails</b> and thus placed in the gamebird order Galliformes or with the cranes and rails in Gruiformes. DNA-DNA hybridization and RAG-1 sequence data places it as a wader related to the jacanas (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990, Paton et al. 2003, Thomas et al. 2004, van Tuinen et al. 2004). It thus represents a remarkable case of morphological convergence, or perhaps it is simply extremely plesiomorphic in morphology (the <b>buttonquails,</b> meanwhile, having turned out to be a very basal offshoot of the wader radiation). In the latter case, this would mean that the jacanas, painted snipe and seedsnipes [...] - [...] all ecologically very different birds [...] - [...] all evolved from birds very similar to the living plains-wanderer.|$|R
50|$|The lark <b>buttonquail,</b> lark-plover or quail-plover (Ortyxelos meiffrenii) is {{a species}} of <b>buttonquail</b> in the family Turnicidae. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Ortyxelos.|$|E
50|$|The painted <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix varius) is {{a species}} of <b>buttonquail,</b> the family Turnicidae, which resemble, but are {{unrelated}} to, the quails of Phasianidae. This species is resident in Australia where numbers {{are believed to be}} in decline. A subspecies, the Abrolhos painted <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix varius scintillans), is endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos islands.|$|E
50|$|The buff-breasted <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix olivii) is {{the largest}} and {{possibly}} the rarest of the <b>buttonquail.</b> This species is endemic to Cape York Peninsula, in Queensland, Australia.|$|E
50|$|The species breeds within tussock grasslands, spinifex or Melaleuca woodland, {{pastures}} {{of native}} grass, standing crops and stubble. The red-chested <b>buttonquails</b> are solitary breeders and females are sequentially polyandrous. The female usually constructs the nest {{and it is}} depression lined with grass, hooked, and shelter by grass tussock.|$|R
5000|$|New World quail {{are also}} found in the Galliformes, but are not in the same family (Odontophoridae). <b>Buttonquails</b> are not closely related at all, but are named for their similar appearance. [...] They are {{presently}} found in the Turnicidae family in the Charadriiformes, more closely related to shorebirds, gulls and auks.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the <b>buttonquails</b> (Turnicidae), mesites (Mesitornithidae) and the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) {{were placed}} in the Galliformes, too. The former are now known to be {{shorebirds}} adapted to an inland lifestyle, whereas the mesites are probably closely related to pigeons and doves. The relationships of the hoatzin are entirely obscure, and it is usually treated as a monotypic order Opisthocomiformes to signify this.|$|R
50|$|The red-chested <b>buttonquail</b> is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} by its uniformed grey-brown tone on its upper side and orange chestnut flakes. While the Little <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix velox) can be recognised by its distinctly reddish brown or pinkish toned under {{body and the}} contrasting tones between parts of its wings. The Red-backed <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix maculosus) has a darker slate-grey or blackish tone on its upper side and has dark underparts except for a contrasting wing panel.|$|E
50|$|The little <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix velox) is a <b>buttonquail,</b> {{one of a}} {{small family}} of birds which resemble, but are {{unrelated}} to, the true quails. This species is resident in Australia, where {{it is one of}} the more common button-quails.|$|E
50|$|The barred <b>buttonquail</b> or common bustard-quail (Turnix suscitator) is a <b>buttonquail,</b> {{one of a}} {{small family}} of birds which resemble, but are {{unrelated}} to, the true quails. This species is resident from India across tropical Asia to south China, Indonesia and the Philippines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species was}} {{classified}} as vulnerable until 2012 when it downlisted to near threatened; most of the black-breasted <b>buttonquail's</b> original habitat has been cleared and the remaining populations are fragmented. The population has been estimated at as little as 2500 breeding birds and declining, it is listed as vulnerable in Queensland and listed as [...] "near threatened" [...] on the IUCN Redlist.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant populations of threatened red goshawks and Gouldian finches, as well as globally important populations of grey falcons, Australian bustards, chestnut-backed <b>buttonquails,</b> bush stone-curlews, white-quilled rock-pigeons, varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, purple-crowned fairywrens, silver-crowned friarbirds, white-gaped, yellow-tinted, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, sandstone shrike-thrushes, white-browed robins, spinifexbirds, painted firetails, masked and long-tailed finches.|$|R
50|$|The {{suborder}} Lari is {{the part}} of the order Charadriiformes which includes the gulls, terns, skuas and skimmers, with the waders and snipes making {{up the rest of the}} order. Following recent research, the auks are now placed into the Lari too. Sometimes, the <b>buttonquails</b> are also placed here, but the molecular data and fossil record rather suggests them be a quite basal offshoot along with the snipe-like and aberrant waders.|$|R
50|$|The red-chested <b>buttonquail</b> {{is thought}} to be {{uncommon}} but secure throughout the rest of its Australian range. This species was formerly hunted for food and sport, and occasionally killed by feral pests for example cats and foxes. The major threat to this species is loss of suitable habitat. This species has not adapted to crop and farmland habitats to the extent of many other <b>Buttonquail</b> species. Red-chested <b>buttonquail</b> who nest in crops have been known to lose their clutches due to harvesting.|$|E
50|$|Black-fronted <b>buttonquail</b> is an {{alternate}} name.|$|E
50|$|The Abrolhos painted <b>buttonquail</b> (Turnix varius scintillans) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the painted}} <b>buttonquail</b> endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos. It is common on North Island, and also occurs on other {{islands of the}} Wallabi Group, namely East Wallabi, West Wallabi, Seagull and Pigeon Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International principally because it is home to a population of endangered Gouldian finches. It also supports chestnut-backed <b>buttonquails,</b> bush stone-curlews, varied lorikeets, northern rosellas, hooded parrots, white-gaped, yellow-tinted, bar-breasted and banded honeyeaters, masked and long-tailed finches, and silver-crowned friarbirds. [...] Other birds occasionally recorded from the IBA include the Australasian bittern, partridge pigeon, yellow-rumped munia and the northern subspecies of the crested shrike-tit.|$|R
5000|$|More conservatively, the Thinocori {{could be}} {{included}} in the Scolopaci (this combined sub-order is called Limicoli), and the Chionidi in the Charadrii. The suborders Thincori, Scolopaci, Chionidi, and Charadri are commonly referred to collectively as Waders. Some taxonomy sources place the Glareolidae family in its own suborder, instead of being classified under suborder Lari. The <b>buttonquails</b> are of indeterminate or [...] basal position in the Lari-Scolopaci sensu lato group. The arrangement as presented here is a consensus of the recent studies.|$|R
50|$|Gruimorphae is a clade {{of birds}} that {{contains}} the orders Charadriiformes (plovers, gulls, and allies) and Gruiformes (cranes and rails) identified in 2014 by genome analysis. This grouping has had historical support, as various charadriiform families such as the families Pedionomidae and Turnicidae were classified as gruiforms. The relationship between these birds is due similar anatomical and behavioral characteristics. A morphological study went further {{to suggest that the}} gruiforms might be paraphyletic in respect to the shorebirds, with the rails being closely related to the <b>buttonquails.</b>|$|R
