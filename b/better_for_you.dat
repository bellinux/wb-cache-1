It is much <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> {{to return to}} your own estate, and not be quitting it on my account. You see well that if I wished it I could take away all you have, but I am not {{inclined}} to do so.|$|E
25|$|I am {{very fond}} of jazz music, and I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person shall be spared in whose home a jazz band {{is in full swing}} at the time I have just mentioned. If {{everyone}} has a jazz band going, well, then, so much the <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> people. One thing is certain and that is that some of your people who do not jazz it out on that specific Tuesday night (if there be any) will get the axe.|$|E
2500|$|Khomeini did {{not give}} a legal {{reasoning}} for his judgement. [...] It {{is thought to be}} based on the ninth chapter of the Qur'an, called At-Tawba, verse 61: [...] "Some of them hurt the prophet by saying, 'He is all ears!' Say, 'It is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> that he listens to you. He believes in God, and trusts the believers. He is a mercy for those among you who believe.' Those who hurt God's messenger have incurred a painful retribution".|$|E

6000|$|... "Speak," [...] {{said the}} corporal, [...] "and {{it shall be}} the <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee.</b> Hast thou any {{knowledge}} where the priests of Baal have bestowed the vessels of their mockery of worship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blaspheme not the saints, {{my young}} friend," [...] said Maitre Pierre. [...] "Saint Julian is the {{faithful}} patron of travellers; and, peradventure, the blessed Saint Quentin hath done more and <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> than thou art aware of." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jesus counsels his {{followers}} to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying [...] "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out." [...] [...] In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions {{as an obstacle to}} faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty. [...] Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} native Jews was soon bolstered by {{small groups of}} Ashkenazi Jews that immigrated to the Ottoman Empire between 1421–1453. Among these new Ashkenazi {{immigrants}} was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati (Hebrew: צרפתי–Sarfati, meaning: [...] "French"), a German-born Jew whose family had previously lived in France, who became the Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting the European Jewry to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he stated that: [...] "Turkey is a land wherein nothing is lacking" [...] and asking: [...] "Is it not <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to live under Muslims than under Christians?".|$|E
2500|$|O People of the Scripture, do {{not commit}} excess in your {{religion}} or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, {{the son of}} Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [...] from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, [...] "Three"; desist - it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.|$|E
5000|$|And whosoever shall offend one {{of these}} little ones that believe in me, it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> him that a {{millstone}} were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> {{to enter into the}} kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. (42-50) KJV ...|$|R

2500|$|Jewish {{communities}} in the Ottoman Empire held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion, as did Christians, though both were subject to additional restrictions, such as restrictions on the areas where they could live or work or in clothing, and both had to pay additional taxes. Yitzhak Sarfati, born in Germany, became the Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting European Jews to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he asked: [...] "Is it not <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to live under Muslims than under Christians?'". Sultan Beyazid II (1481–1512), issued a formal invitation to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain and Portugal, leading to a wave of Jewish immigration.|$|E
2500|$|God condemns usury, and blesses charities. God dislikes every disbeliever, guilty. Those {{who believe}} and do good works and {{establish}} worship {{and pay the}} poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. O you who believe, you shall observe God and refrain {{from all kinds of}} usury, if you are believers. If you do not, then expect a war from God and His messenger. But if you repent, you may keep your capitals, without inflicting injustice, or incurring injustice. If the debtor is unable to pay, wait for a better time. If you give up the loan as a charity, it would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> if you only knew. (Al-Baqarah 2:276-280) ...|$|E
2500|$|Those who devour usury {{shall not}} rise again except as he rises, whom Satan of the touch prostrates; {{that is because}} they say, 'Trafficking (trade) is like usury.' God has {{permitted}} trafficking, and forbidden usury. Whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and gives over, he shall have his past gains, and his affair is committed to God; but whosoever reverts -- those are {{the inhabitants of the}} Fire, therein dwelling forever.God blots out usury, but freewill offerings He augments with interest. God loves not any guilty ingrate.Those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms - their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.O believers, fear you God; and give up the usury that is outstanding, if you are believers.But if you do not, then take notice that God shall war with you, and His Messenger; yet if you repent, you shall have your principal, unwronging and unwronged.And if any man should be in difficulties, let him have respite till things are easier; but that you should give freewill offerings is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> did you but know.

6000|$|... "The <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee,</b> if it prove so," [...] {{said the}} Preceptor; [...] "if no {{champion}} appears, {{it is not}} by thy means that this unlucky damsel shall die, but by the doom of the Grand Master, with whom rests all the blame, and who will count that blame for praise and commendation." ...|$|R

"'Twere indeed <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> to {{have done}} so, good fellow, if thou canst say nothing better than that," [...] replied Hamet angrily, for he was a stupid {{as well as an}} ambitious man.
