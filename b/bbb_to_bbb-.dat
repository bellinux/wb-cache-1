On 8 January 2010, International credit rating agency Moody's upgraded Turkey's rating one notch. In 2012, Fitch upgraded Turkey's credit rating to investment grade (long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>BBB-</b> (from BB+) and long-term local currency IDR was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>BBB</b> (from BB+)) after an 18-year gap; this was followed by a ratings upgrade by Moody's in May 2013, as the service lifted Turkey's government bond ratings to the lowest investment grade Baa3. The decision is Moody's first investment-grade rating for Turkey in two decades and the service stated in its official statement that the nation's [...] "recent and expected future improvements in key economic and public finance metrics" [...] was the basis for the ratings boost.|$|R

In October 2012 the ratings agency dropped BGC's status to Ba2.

Debt increased from around $27 million to $2.8 billion dollars in just five years, which in addition to the misinformation surrounding the amount owed (previously stated as being 700 million dollars) led to Coahuila's credit rating being downgraded by Standard & Poor's from A+ <b>to</b> <b>BBB-,</b> a downgrade of six levels.

5000|$|Hungary was {{supposed}} to join the eurozone in 2010, which {{would have resulted in}} the MNB losing control of monetary policy, but central bank leaders criticized this plan, saying that the fiscal austerity requirements would slow growth. In December 2011 two of the three major credit rating agencies downgraded Hungarian long term currency debt to [...] "junk status", due in part to changes to the Constitution of Hungary, creating doubts about the independence of the central bank. On 20 May 2016, Fitch Ratings upgraded Hungary's corresponding debt status <b>to</b> <b>BBB-</b> (which is investment grade), assigning a stable outlook to the rating. The upgrade was mainly motivated by, among other factors, high current account surpluses, high European Union (EU) fund inflows, banks' external deleveraging, the central bank's self-financing programme and foreign currency mortgage conversion reducing Hungary's external debt and financial vulnerability.|$|R

40|$|Intranasal {{delivery}} {{provides a}} practical, non-invasive method of bypassing the blood-brain barrier (<b>BBB)</b> <b>to</b> deliver therapeutic agents {{to the brain}} and spinal cord. This technology allows drugs that do not cross the <b>BBB</b> <b>to</b> be delivered to {{the central nervous system}} within minutes. It also directly delivers drugs that do cross the <b>BBB</b> <b>to</b> the brain, eliminating the need for systemic administration and its potential side effects. This is possible because of the unique connections that the olfactory and trigeminal nerves provide between the brain and external environment. Intranasal delivery does not necessarily require any modification to therapeutic agents. A wide variety of therapeutics, including both small molecules and macromolecules, can be targeted to the olfactory system and connected memory areas affected by Alzheimer's disease. Using the intranasal delivery system, researchers have reversed neurodegeneration and rescued memory in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Intranasal insulin-like growth factor-I, deferoxamine, and erythropoietin have been shown to protect the brain against stroke in animal models. Intranasal delivery has been used to target the neuroprotective peptide NAP to the brain to treat neurodegeneration. Intranasal fibroblast growth factor- 2 and epidermal growth factor have been shown to stimulate neurogenesis in adult animals. Intranasal insulin improves memory, attention, and functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and even improves memory and mood in normal adult humans. This new method of delivery can revolutionize the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and other brain disorders...|$|R

Rating agencies seem not to have lost any credibility despite their failure to recognize the risks of the subprime derivatives.

40|$|The {{impermeability}} of {{the adult}} blood-brain barrier (<b>BBB)</b> <b>to</b> lysosomal enzymes impedes the ability to treat {{the central nervous system}} manifestations of lysosomal storage diseases. Here, we found that simultaneous stimulation of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenoreceptor restores in adult mice the high rate of transport for the lysosomal enzyme P-GUS that is seen in neonates but lost with development. Beta adrenergics, other monoamines, and acetylcholine did not restore this transport. A high dose (500 microg/mouse) of clonidine, a strong alpha 2 and weak alpha 1 agonist, was able to act as monotherapy in the stimulation of P-GUS transport. Neither use of alpha 1 plus alpha 2 agonists nor the high dose clonidine disrupted the <b>BBB</b> <b>to</b> albumin. In situ brain perfusion and immunohistochemistry studies indicated that adrengerics act on transporters already at the luminal surface of brain endothelial cells. These results show that adrenergic stimulation, including monotherapy with clonidine, could be key for CNS enzyme replacement therapy...|$|R

2500|$|For {{the third}} time in 13 months, Moody's Investors Service has cut Spain's rating. On 18 October 2011 Moody's Rating cut Spain's rating by 2 notches to A1 from Aa2 with the outlook {{remaining}} negative. Standard and Poor's has downgraded Spain on 14 October 2011 and Fitch Ratings cut it to the same level on 7 October 2011. On 14 June 2012, Moody's downgraded Spain to Baa3, just one notch above [...] "junk". Standard and Poor's downgraded Spain <b>to</b> <b>BBB-</b> (one notch above junk) on 11 October 2012. DBRS downgraded Spain to single-A, which remains higher than the major credit rating agencies. This rating allows the ECB to use a lower margin for banks that borrow with Spanish debt as collateral. After a recent review, Moody's maintained Spain's investment-grade credit rating, removing the pressure on the country's debt. This decision by Moody's assures that Spanish bonds will continue to gain investor support; yields feel 5.50%, a level last seen in April. Although Moody's can still downgrade the country's ratings in the future, the decision to not downgrade will encourage the buying of Spain's bonds.|$|R
