5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder {{that he wanted}} a divorce from Ellen two years ago, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E

25|$|During {{the trial}} of David Westerfield in 2002 for the kidnap and murder of Danielle van Dam, Grace made it clear on Larry King Live that {{she thought he was}} guilty, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> some facts wrong. For example, she said he had steam-cleaned his RV, but no {{evidence}} was introduced that he had. Dr. Henry Lee pointed out that if he had done so, they wouldn't have found the fingerprints and the bloodstain on the carpet. It should be noted, however, that David Westerfield was convicted of kidnapping and murdering Danielle van Dam.|$|E
25|$|The torpedoes had hit aft and amidship on {{the port}} side, detonating the {{magazine}} and causing the vessel to keel over and sink in three minutes at position 33-17'N, 32-00'E. The attack killed 2,046 men. In response Captain Ishii launched some of his twenty-seven depth charge-equipped Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers {{to search for the}} Queenfish <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> away. The USS Barb, under Lieutenant Commander Eugene B. Fluckey, is credited with making an unsuccessful attack the same day on Junyo though she was not part of Convoy Hi-81 and was in company with three other ships, one a cruiser. Because of this some American accounts cite Junyo as having been sunk.|$|E
500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Lapham, [...] "she {{has got to}} bear it. I don't know what's to come of it all. <b>But</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> to bear {{her share}} of it." [...] She rose and went toward the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now bless that ar gal," [...] {{said the}} Captain, {{when he saw}} her. [...] "Our Sally here's handsome, <b>but</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> the real New-Jerusalem look, she has--like them in the Revelations that wears the fine linen, clean and white." ...|$|R
500|$|Closing {{towards the}} finish {{in a bunch}} sprint, Wiggle-Honda had {{intended}} Chloe Hosking to be the sprinter to try and win, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> caught up behind a crash in the final kilometre, and so Giorgia Bronzini acted as a lead-out for Annette Edmondson. She had initially intended to move out from behind Kirsten Wild (...) for a sprint with around [...] to go, {{but there was no}} room, so she stayed in Wild's draft. She then found that Edmondson {{had not been able to}} follow her, and opted to defend her position and launch a late sprint to pass Wild. Bronzini won, followed by Wild and Fanny Riberot, riding for the France national team. The first 74 riders were all designated the same time.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, Robbie {{confirmed}} rumours {{that she}} was to leave Neighbours after almost three years. Of her reason to leave Robbie said [...] "I {{want to go to}} America; it's always been my goal to work in Hollywood. It's the one stage in my life where I have absolutely nothing holding me down". Robbie filmed her final scenes in October and her character left on-screen in early 2011. Robbie later revealed her character's exit is positive and that Donna departs Ramsay Street for a fashion design school in New York. Robbie said [...] "It is very daunting for Donna at first. Ringo was the one who applied for Donna to do this course – it's like he's doing this one last thing for her." [...] She said that Donna becomes determined to be a success and that it is her last chance to live up to Ringo's expectations of her. Robbie added that she wanted Donna to go to rehab or have a dramatic death, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> a [...] "boring old happy ending" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even then Maksakova fascinated us {{with her}} special way with words. Not only clear and crisp was her diction, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> this {{dramatic}} expressiveness of phrase charged with inner strife {{of passion and}} jealousy. Besides, Amneris was enchantingly feminine", Lemeshev added.|$|E
6000|$|... "She ain't {{good enough}} for you, that's the truth, Hughey, though I say it, her own kith and kin. I can't make you understand, I know; <b>but</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> to have {{somebody}} that she can feel the power of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forget it!" [...] said Steve. [...] "Mamie is a queen, all right, believe me, <b>but</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> {{the wrong}} dope on this microbe proposition. You don't {{need to be}} scared of them any more. Why, some of me best pals are germs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's not the trouble," [...] George {{replied with}} heat. [...] "I know my sister; so do you! <b>But</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> to start {{business}} since she can't teach school, and I {{hate to think}} of her clerking in a store. She has talent and ambition." ...|$|R
2500|$|One day, {{she finally}} decided to confess to Da Ye, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> {{rejected}} because Da Ye {{told her that he}} doesn't know the true meaning of [...] "LOVE".

2500|$|In 2005, Shetty starred {{opposite}} Upendra in the Kannada film Auto Shankar.

The same year, she starred in the film Fareb with her younger sister Shamita Shetty. Shilpa had one release in 2006, the much delayed Shaadi Karke Phas Gaya Yaar.

6000|$|... "Yes--well, I'm {{not so much}} of a fool as some of the rest--or else more of a one. There's Mamie Magen--she's living here; she's with Pitcairn, too. You'll {{meet her}} and be crazy about her. She's a lame Jewess, and awfully plain, except <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> lovely eyes, <b>but</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> a mind like a tack. Well, she's the little angel-pie about staying late, and some day she'll {{probably}} make four thousand bucks a year. She'll be mayor of New York, or executive secretary of the Young Women's Atheist Association or something. <b>But</b> still, <b>she</b> doesn't stay late and plug hard because <b>she's</b> scared, <b>but</b> because <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> ambition. <b>But</b> most of the women--Lord! they're just cowed sheep." ...|$|R
