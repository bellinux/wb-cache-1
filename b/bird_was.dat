5|$|The inquiry {{was run by}} Sir Louis Blom-Cooper; <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> {{formally}} fired as a Cabinet minister on 10 May, the day Blom-Cooper {{arrived on}} Antigua. Blom-Cooper began work on 4 June, with Bird retaining a team of six lawyers for his defence; the inquiry, concluded in November, recommended banning Bird from holding public office {{for the rest of}} his life. The report was acted on and <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> banned from becoming a minister again, although he retained his seat in the House. The report did not, however, recommend that Bird be forced to resign from the House or prosecuted criminally; it was felt that the public ridicule the guilty parties had been subjected to was punishment enough. <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> later re-hired by the government, not as a Minister but as a special advisor to the Prime Minister on the subject of Public Utilities. After the Prime Minister finally retired and Lester became Antigua and Barbuda's leader on 5 September 1995, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> made Chairman of the ALP.|$|E
5|$|The ALP {{government}} {{lost the}} 2004 election, with the United Progressive Party under Baldwin Spencer taking 14 of the 17 seats in House. A year later, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> ousted as Chairman of the ALP {{and replaced by}} Molwyn Joseph. Following an unauthorised ALP march on May Day in 2009 to protest the Spencer government, Bird and six other senior ALP figures, including the former Prime Minister, were {{arrested and charged with}} public order offences. They pleaded not guilty, but were convicted and fined. This followed severe delays after Bird suffered a seizure during the trial, his third since 2008. Two more seizures occurred in 2010, the second on 11 March 2010 in court, where <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> defending an individual accused of grievous bodily harm.|$|E
50|$|There is {{consensus}} among paleontologists that <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{the descendants of}} coelurosaurs. Under modern cladistic definitions, <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> considered the only living lineage of coelurosaurs. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora.|$|R
5000|$|Wood chip <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{a carved}} wooden item with thin wavy plumage of the wings. The plumage and tail of these <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> usually made of split pine, that <b>is</b> why the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> called [...] "wood chip". The {{place of the}} wooden toy origin {{in the form of}} a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> the Arkhangelsk region. It’s also called a [...] "Pomor dove".|$|R
50|$|Toxic <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> <b>birds</b> {{that use}} toxins to defend {{themselves}} from predators. No species of <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> known to actively inject or even produce venom, but some <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> known to be poisonous to touch or eat. These birds usually sequester poisons from animals and plants that they feed on, commonly from poisonous insects.|$|R
5|$|The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> {{intended}} to be illustrated on an Australia Post 45c pre-stamped envelope released on 12 August 1999; however, a superb fairywren was mistakenly illustrated instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{maximum age}} {{recorded}} from banding has been 22 years 1.7 months, {{for an individual}} banded in Rockhampton in June 1988 and recovered in August 2010—7 km away. The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> injured {{and had to be}} euthanased.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made when a <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' calls were given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{with land}} creatures and fish, the Torah doesn't give signs for {{determining}} kosher birds; instead {{it gives a}} list of unkosher birds, The Talmud also offers signs for determining whether a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> kosher or not. If a bird kills other animals to get its food, eats meat, or <b>is</b> a dangerous <b>bird,</b> then <b>is</b> not kosher, a predatory <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> unfit to eat, raptors like the eagles, hawks, owls and other hunting <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> not kosher, vultures and other carrion-eating <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> not kosher either. Crows {{and members of the}} crow family such as jackdaws, magpies and ravens are not kosher. The storks, kingfishers, penguins and other fish-eating <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> not kosher.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bird</b> remains <b>are</b> very fragmentary {{because of}} their {{delicate}} structure. At least one aquatic <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> known. Based on the diversity of birds from the Early Cretaceous of China, other <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> probably present in Utah at this time as well.|$|R
500|$|The <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} {{granivorous}} (grain eating) and carnivorous groups, which are explained in some detail. The speed, senses, flight, migration, pairing behaviour and feeding of <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> then discussed, with observations from Spallanzani and Gilbert White, whose Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne {{was published in}} 1789. The pleasure of watching <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> mentioned: ...|$|R
5|$|Although {{these are}} mainly {{mountain}} species with limited interactions with humans, the red-billed chough has a coastal {{population in the}} far west of its range, and has cultural connections particularly with Cornwall, where it appears on the Cornish Coat of Arms. A legend from that county says that King Arthur did not die but {{was transformed into a}} red-billed chough, and hence killing this <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> unlucky.|$|E
5|$|Caged <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> {{nominated}} for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years. It {{has been used in}} educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.|$|E
5|$|Development of Ratatouille {{began in}} 2000 when Pinkava wrote the {{original}} {{concepts of the}} film. In 2005, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> approached to direct the film and revise the story. Bird {{and some of the}} film's crew members also visited Paris for inspiration. To create the food animation used in the film, the crew consulted chefs from both France and the United States. Bird also interned at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry restaurant, where Keller developed the confit byaldi, a dish used in the film.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 seven {{birds and}} in 2000 again 10 <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{released}}. Thus in all 31 sub-adult <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{released in the}} pre-selected proper habitat of the birds.|$|R
5000|$|Flightless <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> <b>birds</b> {{that through}} {{evolution}} {{lost the ability}} to fly. There are over 60 extant species including the well known ratites (ostrich, emu, cassowary, rhea and kiwi) and penguins. The smallest flightless <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> the Inaccessible Island rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless <b>bird,</b> which <b>is</b> also the largest living <b>bird,</b> <b>is</b> the ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg). Ostriches are farmed for their decorative feathers, meat and their skins, which are used to make leather.|$|R
50|$|The {{association}} of Apsat with fish and <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> thought {{to stem from}} the eagle, which, as a fishing <b>bird,</b> <b>is</b> associated with both {{the sky and the}} water.|$|R
5|$|Following the ALP's {{victory in}} the 1999 general election, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again {{appointed}} to the Cabinet, this time as Minister of Trade, Industry and Business Development. By July 2000, he had become Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; in this role, he held talks with fishermen over the dumping of dredged material in the ocean and signed a trade agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to end a year-long ban on the import of Trinidadian produce.|$|E
5|$|Jan Pinkava came up {{with the}} concept in 2000, {{creating}} the original design, sets and characters and core storyline, but he was never formally named the director of the film. Lacking confidence in Pinkava's story development, Pixar management replaced him with Bird in 2005. <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> attracted to the film because of the outlandishness of the concept and the conflict that drove it: that rats feared kitchens, yet a rat wanted to work in one. <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> also delighted that the film could be made a highly physical comedy, with the character of Linguini providing endless fun for the animators. Bird rewrote the story, with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner and Colette, and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Longacre's obverse of {{an eagle}} in flight {{is based on}} that of the Gobrecht dollar, struck in small {{quantities}} from 1836 to 1839. Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on Peter the eagle, a tame bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it {{was caught up in}} machinery and killed. The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
50|$|In all cases, a <b>bird's</b> diet <b>is</b> {{carefully}} measured {{to control}} its weight. Weight determines how hungry the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> and how lazy it will act. A <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> overweight {{will be more}} likely to fly away or not hunt. A <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> somewhat underweight will act aggressively, and a <b>bird</b> that <b>is</b> severely underweight will have health problems.|$|R
50|$|Bold and inquisitive, this <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> readily approachable by humans. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} observed {{using a small}} chip of bark held in {{its beak}} {{as a tool to}} dig for insects.|$|R
50|$|The fabulous {{qualities of}} the oozlum <b>bird</b> <b>are</b> {{the subject of a}} poem by W. T. Goodge (1862-1909). In the poem The Oozlum <b>Bird,</b> the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to fly {{backwards}} and has the singular ability of being able to fly up in the air while letting the earth turn under it. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> said to be large enough to bear the weight of a man.|$|R
5|$|The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} wild birds. The oldest banded wild <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can {{live up to}} 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at , {{and a large}} population of about 320million individuals. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as least concern. At one point, the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Act.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> {{also kept}} by Māori as a pet, {{and like the}} tui, it could be trained {{to say a few}} words. There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European {{settlers}} in a small village in the Forty-Mile Bush in the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bird</b> <b>is</b> Gone: A Manifesto is {{a murder}} mystery by Stephen Graham Jones. It was {{published}} in 2005 by Fiction Collective 2. The <b>Bird</b> <b>is</b> Gone: A Manifest is Jones' third novel.|$|R
50|$|This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} the scaly {{appearance}} of its breast and back feathers. Along with its scaly markings, the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> easily identified by its white crest that resembles a tuft of cotton.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bird</b> life <b>is</b> rich, {{especially}} during the migration seasons. Ducks, geese and wading <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> especially abundant.|$|R
5|$|The old name of Royston crow {{originates}} {{from the}} days when this <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> a common winter visitor to southern England, the sheep fields around Royston, Hertfordshire, providing carcasses on which the birds could feed. The local newspaper, founded in 1855, is called The Royston Crow, and the hooded crow is also featured on the crest of the North Hertfordshire District Council.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{disappearance}} of the Rodrigues rail may {{have been caused by}} introduced cats, but {{it is also possible that}} deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} one bird on the North American list, the ivory-billed woodpecker, is controversial. Until 2005 this <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> widely {{considered}} to be extinct. In April of that year, {{it was reported that}} at least one adult male bird had been sighted in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. This report however, has not been universally accepted, and the American Birding Association still lists the ivory-billed woodpecker as extinct.|$|E
25|$|The next {{significant}} {{event was}} on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, {{and more than}} 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> killed and the remainder scattered before any more could be killed. No more <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> sighted that day.|$|R
50|$|Some {{scientists}} {{claim that}} after plucking, mamo were kept as pets, or cooked. Others {{claimed that the}} <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> released, {{and that there was}} a Kapu or restriction that required live release. Even if the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> released, they would still be {{in a state of shock}} and risk injury. However, Hawaiian <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> relatively tame and unafraid when captured, and so might have survived handling better than most birds.|$|R
5000|$|Trapshooting {{has been}} a sport since the late 18th century when real <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> used; usually the {{passenger}} pigeon, which was extremely abundant at the time. <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> placed under hats or in traps which were then released. Artificial <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> introduced {{around the time of}} the American Civil War. Glass balls (Bogardus) and subsequently [...] "clay" [...] targets were introduced in the later 1800s, [...] gaining wide acceptance.|$|R
