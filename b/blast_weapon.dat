5000|$|The U.S. Air Force has {{not officially}} {{recognized}} specific military requirement for an ultra-large bomb, {{but it does}} have a concept for a collection of massively sized penetrator and <b>blast</b> <b>weapons,</b> the so-called [...] "Big BLU" [...] collection, which includes the MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast) bomb. Development of the MOP was performed at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida with design and testing work performed by Boeing. It is intended that the bomb will be deployed on the B-2 bomber, and will be guided using GPS.|$|R
5000|$|This {{break from}} the linear {{expectation}} of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors. First, the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal {{for the creation of}} fires. In an incendiary bombing raid, incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive <b>blast</b> <b>weapons</b> were dropped, in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons. The so-called two-ton [...] "cookies", also known as [...] "blockbusters", were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains, as well as to blow off roofs, doors, and windows, creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped, ideally, into holes created by the prior <b>blast</b> <b>weapons,</b> such into attic and roof spaces. On the other hand, nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order, with thermal effects and [...] "flash" [...] occurring first, which are then followed by the slower blast wave. It {{is for this reason that}} conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield. It is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts Franklin D'Olier, Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at Hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton/1,000 tons of incendiary bombs.|$|R

40|$|Aluminum is an {{important}} energetic material that burns {{with a variety of}} oxidizers with a high reaction enthalpy. It is a top performer for energy density if oxidizer mass is considered as well as the fuel. Because of this, it is often used as an energetic additive in anaerobic conditions because it reacts in what typically are products of primary fuels and oxidizers and further increases chamber temperatures in solid rocket motors or blast overpressure in enhanced <b>blast</b> <b>weapons.</b> Despite decades of research, gaps still exist in the knowledge of how aluminum burns, especially with the recent trend of using smaller particles (10 µm and below). While aluminum is a very energetic material, its rate of oxidation is relatively low, and efforts are made to not only increase the heat release rate of particles reacting with oxidizer, but also to increase peak combustion temperature. Experimental studies were performed measuring the combustion characteristics of aluminum in the heterogeneous shock tube. The heterogeneous shock tube provides unmatched control of temperature, pressure, oxidizer concentration, etc., in which to test energetic materials of different particle sizes. The burning time diameter exponent, n as in tb ∼ dn, in aluminum particle combustion was measured to be as low as, or lower than 0. 3, in conditions in the transition regime between kinetic and diffusion limited particles.

40|$|Abstract: Buried {{pipelines}} {{are important}} lifeline engineering. During war conventional <b>weapons</b> <b>blasting</b> {{in the air}} would induce indirect ground shock, and the shock to the buried pipeline {{can lead to the}} paralyzed of urban economic and social function. And the numerical simulation of the dynamic damage of buried pipeline is complicated and time consuming, so this article using the equivalent static load method proposes analytic solution method of stress calculation of buried pipeline under ground shock. Through comparing the results calculated by analytic solution method and numerical solution, it shows that the analytical solution is feasible in engineering application. Intruduction When conventional <b>weapons</b> <b>blast</b> in the air they would produce air shock wave which compresses soil to generate indirect ground shock. The shock may cause damage to the sewer line, fire pipelines, oil pipelines, gas pipelines and power cables pipeline buried in soil. Newmark’s studies show that the anti-seismic design of the pipeline is generally determined by the maximum axial strain[1]. There are two common methods of research on the transmission of shock in soil and the interaction with underground structure. One is analytical solution[2], the other is numerical solution[3]. Numerical solution is usually used to solve many complex issues. But the process o...|$|R
