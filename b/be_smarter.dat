5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will <b>be</b> <b>smarter.</b> Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

5000|$|According to Mandarino, coach Greasy Neale {{reportedly}} {{told him to}} play tackle after Vic Sears was injured.

500|$|Steve Darlington, in his review, {{stated that}} [...] "even {{if you never}} play this game, you will <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> simply for having read it" [...] since [...] "it quickly becomes hard to {{distinguish}} [...] choice of attributes from a high-level academic deconstruction of the character tropes in gothic horror films at a level which could easily be found on a college reading list." [...] He also {{said that it is}} [...] "one of the very few horror games that may actually need disclaimers, and maybe even safe words too" [...] for its [...] "darker subtext" [...] about escaping from abusive relationships.|$|E
500|$|... "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Matt Selman, although {{the idea for the}} episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. It featured the first official appearance of Lindsey Naegle and was the first episode in which theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking guest-starred as himself. The Simpsons staff wanted Hawking to guest-star because they needed someone who would <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> than all of Springfield's Mensa members, and because they had heard that he was a fan of the show. The episode features references to Star Trek, painter Vincent van Gogh and architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and mentions the theory of the universe being toroidal, the same shape as a doughnut.|$|E

He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else.

500|$|The Griffins invite {{their neighbors}} over for game night. While playing Trivial Pursuit, Lois uses {{questions}} from the preschool edition for Peter in order to let him win. When Peter wins, he brags to everyone, believing himself to <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> than everyone else. Irritated at Peter's arrogance, Brian challenges Peter to take the MacArthur Fellows Program test to prove he is a genius. The results of the test show that Peter is not a genius; in fact, the results show that, technically speaking, Peter is [...] "mentally retarded." [...] Peter sinks into depression after being publicly labeled as retarded. While driving home with Lois, Peter accidentally knocks down Tom Tucker. Tucker, recognizing Peter as [...] "the retarded fellow," [...] does not press charges, and Peter realizes his condition means he {{can get away with}} anything.|$|E
500|$|Benfica's first {{match in}} September {{was on the}} 14th against Belenenses. Despite leading the game with 90 minutes played, Benfica allowed the {{visitors}} to score two goals in extra time to draw the match 3–3. Camacho took responsibility for the goals in extra-time, admitting the team needed to <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> and waste time. The next match was the Clássico away on the 21st; Porto had a five-point lead in the league table, although Benfica had played one less game. Porto won 2–0. Camacho complained of bad luck: [...] "What happened was that one team entered the game to dominate, achieved some control, {{but it was the}} other team who scored. What matters in football is goals, and Porto scored, while we did not." [...] Three days later, Benfica started their UEFA Cup campaign against La Louvière, a Belgian team that António Simões described as [...] "easy". The game ended in a 1–1 draw, with Camacho dismissing the idea that it was a bad result, saying that an away draw in a European competition was still a satisfying outcome. On the 28th, Benfica closed the month with a home win against Nacional, with Tiago scoring the only goal. Despite the fans whistling the team, Camacho was pleased with the performance, noting the opportunities the team had to double the lead.|$|E

2500|$|Because Torchwood {{is shown}} after the watershed– that is, after 9pm– {{it has more}} mature content than Doctor Who.

Though bear in mind that it's very teenage to indulge {{yourself}} in blood and gore, and Torchwood is going to <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> than that.

2500|$|The marine chemist Scott Doney thinks [...] "the main {{tactics are}} raising energy efficiency, {{switching}} to renewable and nuclear power, protecting forests and exploring carbon sequestration technologies. Regionally, nutrient runoff to coastal waters not only creates dead zones but also amplifies acidification. The excess nutrients cause more phytoplankton to grow, {{and as they}} die the added CO2 from their decay acidifies the water. We have to <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> about how we fertilize fields and lawns and treat livestock manure and sewage [...] Locally, acidic water could be buffered with limestone or chemical bases produced electrochemically from seawater and rocks. More practical may be protecting specific shellfish beds and aquaculture fisheries. Larval mollusks such as clams and oysters {{appear to be more}} susceptible to acidification than adults, and recycling old clamshells into the mud may help buffer pH and provide better substrate for larval attachment. The drop in ocean pH is expected to accelerate in coming decades, so marine ecosystems will have to adapt. We can enhance their chances for success by reducing other insults such as water pollution and overfishing, making them better able to withstand some acidification while we transition away from a fossil-fuel energy economy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016". In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. [...] "If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it’s not done... it will be because there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would <b>be</b> <b>smarter</b> to hold onto it until next year. But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E
