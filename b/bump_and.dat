The {{sculpture}} of the 12' stainless steel hawk, Strike Force, {{is located in}} a small park just south of Carver-Hawkeye arena.

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting and depth of field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, <b>bump,</b> <b>and</b> parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E

25|$|Speed bumps vary in length, but it {{is typical}} to leave space between the <b>bump</b> <b>and</b> either edge of an {{enclosed}} road (i.e. with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage.

25|$|Autobiographical {{memories}} can differ {{for special}} periods of life. People recall few personal events {{from the first}} years of their lives. The loss of these first events is called childhood or infantile amnesia. People tend to recall many personal events from adolescence and early adulthood. This effect is called the reminiscence bump. Additionally, people recall many personal events from their previous few years. For adolescents and young adults the reminiscence <b>bump</b> <b>and</b> the recent events can coincide.|$|E

25|$|Disco is {{a musical}} style {{originating}} in the early 1970s that remained urban and largely underground {{until the middle of}} the decade when it began to emerge from America's urban nightlife scene, where it had been curtailed to house parties and makeshift discotheques, and began making regular appearances mainstream, gaining popularity and increasing airplay on radio. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco {{can be seen as a}} reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Disco was popular with both men and women from many different backgrounds, with dances including the <b>Bump</b> <b>and</b> the Hustle.|$|E

25|$|Zbyszko {{took part}} in an eighteen-man battle royal in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 7, 1989 to fill the vacant AWA World Heavyweight Championship. By {{stalling}} and avoiding confrontations with other wrestlers, Zbyszko was able {{to remain in the}} match until only two men remained: himself and Tom Zenk. The two men fought for several minutes. When Zenk went for a pin, referee Gary DeRusha inexplicably entered the ring to make the count. Zbyszko kicked out and the two continued in what now appeared to be a conventional wrestling match. DeRusha ended up taking a <b>bump</b> <b>and</b> was unable to make the three count when Zenk covered Zbyszko for the pin. As DeRusha slowly recovered, Zenk continued to dominate the match. As he attempted a flying body press, however, Zbyszko managed to catch him in mid-air and deliver a fallaway slam, throwing him over the top rope and to the ground below. Zbyszko was thus the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
25|$|Just {{as in the}} {{original}} Swan Lake, where customarily (although not always) one ballerina performs the roles of both the white swan (Odette) and the black swan (Odile), the same ballet dancer performs the white Swan and the black-clad young von Rothbart in this version. The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his lewdness, especially towards his mother. During <b>bump</b> <b>and</b> grind group numbers and a sequence of national dances, {{it becomes clear that}} the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats into his mind and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence.|$|E
25|$|Kyle Busch {{started on}} pole, and he, Matt Kenseth, and Jimmie Johnson took several turns leading {{through the first}} 70 laps as Kasey Kahne, Brad Keselowski, Kurt Busch, Austin Dillon, and others were caught up in early accidents. Joey Logano then took over the lead from Kyle Busch for a few laps, but yielded to Johnson and Kenseth. Meanwhile, Kurt Busch and Keselowski would {{continuously}} <b>bump</b> <b>and</b> race each other very hard because of an incident on pit road several laps before. This would ultimately lead to a caution for Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. running up into the wall after checking up for the ongoing battle between Busch and Keselowski. Kenseth retook the lead during pit stops under the caution, but quickly yielded to Logano after the restart. After another caution and restart, Johnson took over from Logano. Johnson, Logano, Hamlin, and Kenseth all faded soon after, and after lap 165, Greg Biffle, Marcos Ambrose, and A. J. Allmendinger became the new top-three. After another caution for a spin by Casey Mears, Ambrose won the race off of pit road to become the new leader. Kenseth and Johnson would get by Ambrose after several laps, but another caution would wave after Jamie McMurray got bumped into the wall by Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. After the restart, Kenseth would lose the lead to Johnson, then fade back to tenth after getting stuck on the outside.|$|E

The cap sometimes has a small abrupt umbo (a central <b>bump),</b> <b>and</b> the cap margin is pressed closely against the stem when young, often flaring or curving slightly inward.

The cap surface is smooth, faintly translucent- when moist, at first [...] but soon naked. The color is red when young, soon becoming yellowish toward the margin, and slowly fading to bright orange-yellow. The flesh is thin, brittle, yellow, and has no distinctive odor or taste.|$|E

500|$|Attendees {{of metal}} concerts do not {{dance in the}} usual sense. It {{has been argued that}} {{this is due to the}} music's largely male {{audience}} and [...] "extreme heterosexualist ideology." [...] Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture. The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home. According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which [...] "were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture." [...] Weinstein states that moshing participants <b>bump</b> <b>and</b> jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the [...] "pit" [...] near the stage.
