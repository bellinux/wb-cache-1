50|$|The Trichiini are a {{tribe of}} the scarab beetle family (Scarabaeidae), though {{historically}} {{they were often}} classified as a subfamily, Trichiinae. The conspicuous <b>bee</b> <b>beetles</b> (Trichius) are probably the best-known genus in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Western toads {{wait for}} their prey {{on the surface}} of the ground or in shallow burrows dug by other animals. Their diet {{consists}} largely of <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> ants, and arachnids. Other foods include crayfish, sowbugs, grasshoppers, trichopterans, lepidopterans, and dipterans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flowers are}} bright yellow, and pea-like, which cover {{the tree in}} late spring. They attract pollinators such as <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and flies. They are {{followed}} by seed pods which are slightly larger and flatter and have harder shells than the foothill paloverde. These are a food source for small rodents and birds.|$|R
5000|$|Insects of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, {{also known}} as Holometabola, such as butterflies, ants, <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> fleas, flies, moths, and wasps, undergo holometabolism - complete metamorphism in four stages - from (1) embryo (ovum, egg), to (2) larva (such as grub, caterpillar), then (3) pupa (such as the chrysalis), and finally (4) the imago.|$|R
50|$|The {{range is}} across eastern Australia from southeastern Queensland through New South Wales and into eastern Victoria, the {{preferred}} habitat is gullies in forested areas. Flies are the likely most common pollinators, and native <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and diurnal moths may {{do so as}} well. The kerrawang is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed.|$|R

In this world Frogger is trying to rescue Mechanic Frog. (Mechanic Frog is {{actually}} a baby, and uses a machine shaped like a frog's head for mobility.) ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{cauliflorous}} species are pollinated by small <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles</b> or flies {{although there are no}} direct observations of this. Birds disperse the purple or black drupes, for example Sayornis phoebe (a Tyrant flycatcher) eats the fruit of Cocculus. In Tinospora cordifolia a lapse of 6-8 weeks has been observed between fertilization and the first zygotic cell division.|$|R
50|$|During spring, renosterveld flowers {{attract a}} wide variety of pollinators, like <b>bees,</b> flies, <b>beetles</b> and sunbirds.|$|R
50|$|Tamandua is a genus of anteaters {{with two}} species: the {{southern}} tamandua (T. tetradactyla) {{and the northern}} tamandua (T. mexicana). They live in forests and grasslands, are semiarboreal, and possess partially prehensile tails. They mainly eat ants and termites, but they occasionally eat <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and insect larvae. In captivity, they will eat fruits and meat. They have no teeth and depend on their powerful gizzards to break down their food.|$|R
50|$|The flowers attract many insects, {{including}} {{short and}} long-tongued <b>bees,</b> flies, <b>beetles,</b> and butterflies, but most numerous of all are wasps.|$|R
25|$|Insect visitation is {{the likely}} method of pollen {{transfer}} {{due to the}} spatial separation of the anthers and stigma, which would make self-pollination unlikely. Abe reported V. rotundifolia flowers on Nishino-shima Island were visited by flies, honey <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> butterflies, and ants {{though most of the}} visitors were ants. Diverse groups of pollinators visit the flowers in search of the 0.5 µl/flower nectar reward. Due to this wide range of visitors, it is unlikely the plant would require a specialist insect to mediate successful pollination.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{developed}} and produced for more than 3 years at Animal Logic's studios in Sydney, Australia. A team of 500+ artists, technicians, and support staff were amassed to design and develop the film. The film was conceived in 3D stereoscopic from the get-go. Animal Logic's team of artists designed, created, and animated 15 unique species of owls, {{as well as other}} forest creatures such as snakes, crows, bats, centipedes, <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> bugs, moths, a hermit crab, a Tasmanian Devil, and an echidna.|$|R
25|$|The commonest pollinators are <b>bees</b> {{and small}} <b>beetles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tillandsia paucifolia are {{angiosperms}} {{with flowers}} {{that range from}} a pale pink to a lavender-blue color. Flowers of these epiphytes can be animal-pollinated. Animals such as <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> and hummingbirds are known to pollinate T. paucifolia diurnally (during the day) while {{there have been reports}} of moths and bats that pollinate nocturnaly. As a reward to the animals that facilitate the pollination, these angiosperms will sometimes produce nectar. With increased visitation from animal pollinators, these epiphytes are more likely to receive more genetically varying pollen, leading to better quality seeds.|$|R

5000|$|Glaphyridae is {{a family}} of beetles, {{commonly}} known as bumble <b>bee</b> scarab <b>beetles.</b> There are eight extant genera with about 80 species distributed worldwide and two extinct genera described from the fossil record of China.|$|R
50|$|Sium suave, also {{widely known}} as water parsnip, is a wildflower native {{to parts of}} the {{northern}} hemisphere and thriving in primarily wetland habitats. Sium suave belongs to the Apiaceae family {{which is also the}} carrot family. Water parsnip blooms from July to August and creates many small white flowers with umbel inflorescences. Sium suave resembles a few quite poisonous plants, and consumption should be avoided. There is a vast number of insect species of <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> wasps, butterflies, and flies that visit this plant for its nectar and pollen. Sium come from the Latin sion meaning water parsley, and suave comes from the Latin suâvis meaning sweet.|$|R

50|$|Since Aloe {{flowers are}} usually reddish in colour, {{sunbirds}} {{are attracted to}} them for the nectar they produce, and are likely the plant's main pollinators. Other creatures which visit flowers are usually insects such as <b>bees,</b> wasps, <b>beetles</b> and ants.|$|R
50|$|The plants produce copious nectar which attracts an {{assemblage}} of <b>bees,</b> wasps, <b>beetles,</b> and ants, which likely act as pollinators. Plants of the genus appear to be adapted to wildfire-prone habitat, and have been observed flowering most abundantly after fire.|$|R
50|$|Zingiberales forms a major {{component}} of tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Many of these plants have formed specialized pollination relationships with mammals e.g. bats and lemurs, birds and insects e.g. <b>bees,</b> dung <b>beetles,</b> moths and butterflies through alterations in floral form.|$|R
50|$|The famous Montanan Tertiary {{deposits}} of the Ruby Valley basin were also first studied in 1947. The early research {{was performed by}} Dr. Herman F. Becker {{on behalf of the}} New York Botanical Garden. These deposits from the southwestern part of the state are one of the best sources of plant and insect fossils in North America. In 1959 Becker's Ruby Valley excavations uncovered about 5,000 specimens of more than two hundred species of plants, insects, and fishes. Invertebrate finds included ants, <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> earwigs, caddis flies, crane flies, damsel flies, lantern flies, may flies, grasshoppers, leaf hoppers, mosquitoes, snails, and wasps. Vertebrate remains included feathers, and, once in a while, a bird.|$|R
5000|$|Animals {{as varied}} as <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> mice, foxes, {{crocodiles}} and elephants play {{a wide variety of}} roles in literature and film.A genre of films has been based on oversized insects, including the pioneering 1954 Them!, featuring giant ants mutated by radiation, and the 1957 The Deadly Mantis.Birds have occasionally featured in film, as in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 The Birds, loosely based on Daphne du Maurier's story of the same name, which tells the tale of sudden attacks on people by violent flocks of birds. [...] Ken Loach's admired 1969 Kes, based on Barry Hines's 1968 novel A Kestrel for a Knave, tells a story of a boy coming of age by training a kestrel.|$|R

30|$|The {{sampling}} of pollen by honey-bees {{serves as an}} indicator of exposure of foraging NTOs. Quite a few NTOs living in the nature reserve, for example insects like wild bees, bumble <b>bees,</b> wasps, <b>beetles</b> etc., collect and consume maize pollen from surrounding maize fields.|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} microclimates occur, so {{the flora}} changes from west to east, and also varies with altitude up the hillsides {{away from the}} coast and according to compass direction. Lower elevations are covered with protea fynbos, with ericas taking over further up. Plant species include pincushions (Leucospermum). The wildlife includes a number of endemic <b>bees,</b> <b>beetles,</b> horseflies, and ants, and birds such as Cape sugarbirds and the orange-breasted sunbird. Many of these birds and insects are important and specific pollinators for the fynbos, such as the mountain pride butterfly (Aeropetes tulbaghia) which only visits red flowers such as Disa uniflora and pollinates 15 different species. Larger animals include antelopes, particularly Cape grysbok (Raphicerus melanotis), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), and klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus). The extinct blue antelope and quagga were also fynbos natives.|$|R
50|$|In the wild, A. coronaria is winter {{flowering}} {{and cross}} pollinated by <b>bees,</b> flies and <b>beetles,</b> which can carry pollen over long distances.|$|R
