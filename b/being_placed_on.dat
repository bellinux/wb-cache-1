5|$|Late on 9 February, the Japanese {{made more}} landings, in the Causeway sector, {{held by the}} 27th Infantry Brigade. Despite having been reduced to just two {{infantry}} battalions due to {{the transfer of the}} 2/29th to the hard-pressed 22nd Infantry Brigade, they were able to mount a stiff defence, supported by the machine guns of 'B' Company. 8 Platoon inflicted many casualties in the Japanese landing craft coming ashore {{at the mouth of the}} Sungei Mandi. With casualties mounting and pressure <b>being</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the brigade's rear due to a large gap that had developed around Kranji, by the Japanese advances in the 22nd Infantry Brigade's area, the decision was made to withdraw from the beach and realign north–south along the Woodlands Road.

Their advance was not as quick as that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, until the New Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was <b>being</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the German lines elsewhere and the emphasis for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line.|$|E
5|$|The Celts practiced {{advanced}} {{agriculture and}} favored fertile lands; they {{brought with them}} and disseminated the inventions, including a variety of tools, and other achievements of La Tène culture.

The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons. The ceramic shops used the potter's wheel and produced with great precision (especially the Tyniec group) baked, thin walled, painted vessels, {{one of the best}} in Europe. Domed bilevel furnaces were used, the pots <b>being</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> a perforated clay shelf, with the hearth underneath.
