50|$|Beaumont was a {{successful}} finder of coal and an innovator {{in the development of}} mining techniques. A key innovation currently attributed to him is the introduction of <b>boring</b> <b>rods</b> to assist in finding coal without sinking a shaft. His working life covered involvement in coal mining activities in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Northumberland. His coal mining and waggonway activities in the early 1600s near Blyth in Northumberland were, like most of his ventures, unprofitable. However, the <b>boring</b> <b>rod</b> and wagonway technology he took with him was implemented by others to significant effect. The wagonway evolutionary chain he started in the English north east was to later encompass George Stephenson.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the problem}} of week strength, {{tripping}} and bad sealing of the hollow sucker <b>rod</b> <b>joints,</b> we designs a new sucker <b>rod</b> <b>joint,</b> which has two kinds of prototypes, including tapered shoulder and round shoulder. The hollow sucker rod’s characteristic is easy disassembling, multiple sealing, and also has a large contact area of the shoulder. By using the method of finite-element analysis, we set up the finite-element model and analyze the contact stress and deformation distribution of two kinds of structure in different friction coefficients. Through the analysis, we find not only the bearing capacity of the circular arc shoulder joint, but also the sealing is also better than the tapered shoulder's joint. And for both kinds of joints, the friction coefficient is an important factor to affect the pretightening force...|$|R
40|$|Glued-in rod {{connections}} for timber beams {{are increasingly}} being used, as they offer high strength and stiffness and a better appearance in comparison with traditional mechanical connections. First, a campaign of experimental tests on glued-in threaded steel <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> subjected to monotonic bending moments was carried out checking {{the effect of a}} confining system for the bars (transversal screws), the different arrangement of the rods or varying the mechanical characteristics of the steel of the bars. A negligible effect on joint ductility was observed using transversal screws whereas with a correct design and a proper choice of rod steel grade an important ductile behaviour was achieved. The experiments were then extended to cyclic tests so to emphasize the cyclic performance of glued-in <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> under bending moments. The aim was mainly to understand the joint structural response under cyclic loads, simulating the effects of seismic action. The test results indicate that the joint can initially develop a high dissipative capacity, but after a few cycles, the energy dissipation is considerably reduced by the occurrence of longitudinal splitting in the timber edge of the joining bars leading to lateral instability of the rods...|$|R
50|$|After hand extracting the {{bad case}} from the chamber, the {{clearing}} charge is removed from its special container and is hand rammed into the chamber. With the clearing charge sealed in the chamber, the projectile is fired out the muzzle. It is important to clear the projectile through the muzzle {{because it is not}} easy nor safe pushing a <b>bore</b> <b>rod</b> down the barrel to force a fuzed projectile back through the chamber and into the gun house. Also, if the gun has fired a number of rounds just prior to the misfire, time is critical because the barrel may be hot enough to cook off the high explosive in the projectile.

30|$|There are two {{combination}} {{forms of}} rock bolting and grouting: one is grouting first, then installing rock bolts and cables; another is grouting and bolting {{at the same}} time using pipe grouting bolts, which are not only used as grouting tubes to inject slurry, but also the bolts anchored by slurry. Based on the characteristics of roadways in coal mines, many kinds of grouting bolts have been developed (Wang et al. 2005). For extremely broken rocks, the self-boring grouting bolts have been invented. These bolts are used as <b>boring</b> <b>rods</b> and grouting tubes {{at the same time}}, and provide an effective way {{to solve the problem of}} borehole caving in the extremely broken rocks (Lu 2003). On the basis of the pretension resin cable with small borehole, the cable anchored with resin capsules and grout slurry was developed. The rock grouting can be achieved through adjusting the grouting parameters (Wu et al. 2001; Kang et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Bonded-in <b>rod</b> <b>joints</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} over the conventional type of joints {{in terms of}} performance, cost and aesthetics. The use of basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) rods would result in lower weight of the joint and improved resistance to corrosion but {{there appears to be}} little or no investigation on the use of these rods in the bonded-in rod technique. The aim of this research was to examine the behaviour of bonded-in BFRP and steel rods and to propose design models to enhance current knowledge in bonded-in rod technology. The mechanical properties of the timber members were characterised so as to predict the behaviour of donor and spliced beams for the proposed stressed model. Pull-out tests of the rods were conducted to investigate some factors that affect joint capacity and based of the results bonded-in rod timber beams were fabricated and tested for ultimate capacity and flexural stiffness. An analytical model based on the interfacial tress-strain interaction of the BFRP rods with the adhesive layer and the timber members was developed to predict pull-out capacity of the samples. Average shear strength from steel pull-out tests was also used to propose a design equation for pull-out capacity of steel samples. In both the BFRP and steel samples, good agreement with the tests results was observed. A trapezoidal timber compressive stress model was developed to predict ultimate moment capacities of steel and BFRP timber beams. Good agreement was found between the theoretical and bonded-in steel rod beams whereas results form bonded-in BFRP rod beams were lower due to tensile splitting. Bonded-in steel beams recorded higher stiffness than the theoretical stiffness, whereas there was strong agreement between the theoretical predictions and BFRP beam tests. Thus, the presented models may serve as a useful reference for future design of bonded- in <b>rod</b> <b>joints.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|A growing {{interest}} has arisen towards {{the possibility of}} joining wood elements with steel bars glued with epoxy resin into timber members. This type of joint is interesting, because it allows to obtain an higher joint stiffness, a more uniform stress distribution and a better aesthetical appearance in comparison with traditional mechanical connections.

40|$|The use of Glued In <b>Rod</b> <b>joints</b> for wooden constructions is an {{efficient}} technology to connect and design members in new timber structures and to rehabilitate the damaged structural elements of historical buildings. The major issue concerning {{the use of}} adhesive anchors in timber {{is the lack of}} a standard regulation in the current Eurocode 5 for timber structures. Due to the gap in knowledge of this specific topic in engineering structural design, designers' choices are still supported by test analysis which enables knowledge, and the prediction, of the structural behaviour of Glued In <b>Rod</b> <b>joints.</b> Over the last 30 years, research studies have suggested diverse and contradictory procedures for the prediction of the withdrawal capacity of adhesive anchors in timber whose application led to the relay of inconsistent information about the use of Glued In Rods in the timber engineering field. The presented research work is aimed at clarifying the contradictory nature amongst existing design rules and at proposing a correct design procedure to assess the load bearing capacity of adhesive anchors in timber, whilst also taking into consideration the high product-dependency which Glued In Rod connections are characterised by. Moreover, the thesis investigates the development of new prototypes of resin connectors in timber through the identification of innovative technical solutions in order to achieve an improved structural performance of the studied adhesive joints. An extensive experimental program has been carried out on 'traditional' and new prototypes of adhesive anchors in timber, identified respectively by smooth-cylindrical and rough-threaded internal boreholes in which 8 mm steel rods have been glued by the use of low and high viscosity epoxy resins. The tensile performance of more than 100 samples of single adhesive anchors made from solid timber and glulam has been tested by pull-compression tests in confined test regimes, in both cold states and at elevated temperatures. Experimental findings suggest that in cold states and in restrictive manufacturing conditions, the adoption of the new prototype of Glued In Rods, characterised by the presence of a threaded and rough internal bonding surface, can simultaneously provide an increase of up to 12...|$|R
