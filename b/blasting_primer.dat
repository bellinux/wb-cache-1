40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Plant PathologyJohn P. FellersAllan K. FritzLeaf rust {{is caused}} by Puccinia triticina {{and is one of}} the most {{widespread}} diseases of wheat worldwide. Breeding for resistance is one of the most effective methods of control. Lr 16 is a leaf rust resistance gene that provides partial resistance at the seedling stage. One objective of this study was to use RNA-seq and in silico subtraction to develop new resistance gene analog (RGA) markers linked to Lr 16. RNA was isolated from the susceptible wheat cultivar Thatcher (Tc) and the resistant Thatcher isolines TcLr 10, TcLr 16, and TcLr 21. Using in silico subtraction, Tc isoline ESTs that did not align to the Tc reference were assembled into contigs and analyzed using <b>BLAST.</b> <b>Primers</b> were designed from 137 resistance gene analog sequences not found in Tc. A population of 260 F[subscript] 2 lines derived from a cross between the rust-susceptible cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) and a Thatcher isoline containing Lr 16 (TcLr 16) was developed for mapping these markers. Two RGA markers XRGA 266585 and XRGA 22128 were identified that mapped 1. 1 cM and 23. 8 cM from Lr 16, respectively. Three SSR markers Xwmc 764, Xwmc 661, and Xbarc 35 mapped between these two RGA markers at distances of 4. 1 cM, 10. 7 cM, and 16. 1 cM from Lr 16, respectively. Another objective of this study was to use genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to develop single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers closely linked to Lr 16. DNA from 22 resistant and 22 susceptible F[subscript] 2 plants from a cross between CS and TcLr 16 was used for GBS analysis. A total of 39 Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers were designed from SNPs identified using the UNEAK and Tassel pipelines. The KASP marker XSNP 16 _TP 1456 mapped 0. 7 cM proximal to Lr 16 in a TcxTcLr 16 population consisting of 129 F[subscript] 2 plants. These results indicate that both techniques are viable methods to develop new molecular markers. RNA-seq and in silico subtraction were successfully used to develop two new RGA markers linked to Lr 16, one of which was more closely linked than known SSR markers.

40|$|Military {{aircraft}} routinely {{operate in}} harsh, corrosive environments that necessitate aggressive maintenance methods and products to prevent deterioration. Three primary tasks associated with corrosion control of these aircraft are abrasive <b>blasting,</b> sanding, and <b>primer</b> paint application. The {{most frequently used}} primer paints for these applications contain chromium VI (Cr VI) {{in the form of}} barium chromate and strontium chromate. Due to aircraft size and the nature of these tasks, control of Cr VI exposures is often difficult. Numerous studies of chromate related industries have identified worker exposures in excess of the OSHA PEL of 5 Î¼g/m 3. Long-term analysis of chromate workers with known Cr VI exposures levels have shown elevated risk of mortality due to lung cancer. These evaluations highlight the importance of multi-layered control systems to reduce Cr VI exposure levels. This goal {{of this study was to}} investigate occupational inhalation exposures to Cr VI during worker performed tasks for corrosion control for military aircraft. Sample results for three primary tasks, abrasive <b>blasting,</b> sanding, and <b>primer</b> (paint) application, were obtained at a major military aircraft maintnance facility.

Among these proteases metalloproteases (Mep) have already been described as potential virulence factors in different zoonotic species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum canis. In the present study, primers targeting five metalloproteases Mep 1 - 5 {{have been designed to}} screen a large scale of Microsporum audouinii strains isolated in Belgium. Material and methods A total of 84 strains of M. audouinii were included in this study. This concerned 2 reference strains (IHEM 2758 and 2214) and 82 strains isolated from patients refered to the Mycology Laboratory of the University Hospital of LiÃ¨geduring the 2013 - 2016 period. The strains were identified as M. audouinii by microscopy and confirmed by ITS sequencing. Primers were newly designed based on nucleotide sequences of the genes MEP 1 - 5 available in GenBank database for the close related species M. canis and using <b>primer</b> <b>Blast</b> (NCBI-NIH) Results Among the analyzed strains, the presence of at least one gene encoding for Mep 1 - 5 was revealed in 93 % (78 / 84) of the M. audouinii strains with 80 % (67 / 84) being positive for the five Meps (1 - 5). The percentage of detection was 89 % (75 / 84) for Mep 1, 88 % (74 / 84) for Mep 2 and Mep 5 and 85 % (71 / 84) for Mep 3. Finally, Mep 4 was successfully amplified in 92 % (77 / 84) of the isolates. In total, 7 % (6 / 84) of the strains did not express any Mep gene. An internal control of amplification (ITS sequence) was also included to exclude a false negative result due to amplification inhibitors. Conclusion The presence of the Mep 1 - 5 genes in M. audouinii strains circulating in Belgium was confirmed in this study. Fairly close percentages of expression of these genes let us think that all tested Meps could be implicated in the virulence process of M. audouinii strains. Next step will be the in vitro biochemical characterization of the expression of these Meps in M. audouinii. Another class of endoproteases called subtilisins has been recently considered to be involved in virulence process. Their presence will also be further checked in M. audouinii strains.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate {{intracellular}} parasite that is estimated to infect {{one third of the}} worldâs human population. Upon infection this parasite causes the disease toxoplasmosis which in most healthy humans is chronic and often asymptomatic. If infection occurs in a human host without a competent immune system such as an unborn baby or infant or someone suffering from AIDS, toxoplasmosis can lead to permanent disability or death. A growing amount of evidence indicates a statistical relationship between chronic infection in healthy adults and neurological disorders leading to behavioural and psychological problems. Toxoplasma gondii can be spread through contact with cat faeces. This was thought to be the main mode of human infection. Subsequent testing with murine and Felidae models has shown that the bradyzoite of Toxoplasma gondii within intracellular cysts in muscle and neural tissue are far more infectious than the oocyst morphology shed in cat faeces. This indicates that consumption of infected meat products may also play a major contributing role in the worldâs high rate of toxoplasmosis infection. The chief aim {{of this study was to}} develop a sensitive PCR assay to detect the presence of Toxoplasma gondii in fresh raw meat products. Beef, chicken, lamb and pork mince were chosen as convenient forms of fresh raw meat as each pack available for purchase contains the meat from several animalâs tissues (increasing the likelihood of contamination) and it has been partially homogenised allowing for easier sampling and DNA extraction. Secondary aims of this study were to evaluate PCR primer sets targeting polymorphic regions to gain some understanding of what strains of Toxoplasma gondii are present in our meat and the prevalence in the local cat populations. To accomplish these aims positive and negative PCR controls were also developed using a live toxoplasmosis vaccine and DNA extracted from Zebrafish. DNA extraction techniques were developed to purify DNA from both muscle tissue and feline faecal samples and primer sets were selected from published literature as well as designed using NCBI <b>primer</b> <b>BLAST.</b> Toxoplasma gondii specific DNA was detected in only one of the 25 meat samples purchased. This was achieved using a primer set targeting the P 30 region of the SAG 1 gene and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Using primer sets targeting polymorphic sites within the Toxoplasma gondii genome, sequencing and restriction enzyme digests it was shown that Toxoplasma gondii present in the feral Felis catus population in the raglan area is type II at the GRA 6 and SAG 3 loci. Amplification of polymorphic PCR targets from DNA extracted from meat samples could not be achieved. Non-specific amplification occurred with a majority of primer sets trialed with meat DNA extracts indicating improvements are needed in primer design for the purpose of PCR detection of Toxoplasma gondii in meat. Nested PCR increased specificity however resulted in contamination in several instances...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} Kunitz Proteinase Inhibitors (KPI) gene family in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) as this family of inhibitors {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} among the serine proteinase inhibitor families in legume species. In other studies, these proteins have mainly been shown to serve as storage proteins and to also act as potent defensive factors against insect herbivory. As they are involved in regulating proteolytic activity, the question arises as to how much they are also involved with regulating plant growth and development and how they respond to different stresses other than insect herbivory? Here, in this thesis effort has been under taken to answer these questions using the perennial legume white clover which is a major contributor to pasture productivity in New Zealand. However, as yet, very little is known about the occurrence of Kunitz proteinase inhibitor (TrâKPI) genes or the functions of these genes in white clover. In this study, therefore, the spectrum of TrâKPI genes is characterized, and the regulation of expression at the transcriptional level of different members of the gene family is examined. To obtain KPI genes from white clover, degenerate primers were designed based on known legume KPI sequences. Four full length cDNA were obtained using degenerate and later geneâspecific <b>primers.</b> <b>Blast</b> searching of the JCVI and NCBI database showed that they encode for proteins fall into the soybean trypsin inhibitor superâfamily (STI) and were named TrâKPI 1, TrâKPI 2, TrâKPI 4 and TrâKPI 5. The expression in the transcript level of these four genes showed that TrâKPI 1, TrâKPI 2, TrâKPI 5 are constitutively expressed in vegetative and reproductive parts whereas TrâKPI 4 is more organâspecific such that it is expressed in the root and mature seed. A leaf and root developmental study showed that TrâKPI 2 and TrâKPI 5 are more developmentally regulated and transcript abundance during a germination time course study also suggests the involvement of TrâKPI 1 and TrâKPI 5 during seedling establishment. To explore the function of these genes further, different forms of biotic and abiotic stress were applied to white clover. A mechanical wounding study revealed the possible involvement of TrâKPI 1, TrâKPI 2 and TrâKPI 5 in plant defense in both local and systemic tissues, and TrâKPI 4 in the systemic tissue. A shoot herbivore (Spodoptera litura) and root herbivore (root knot nematode Meloidogyne trifoliophila and cyst nematode Heterodera trifolii) were also used to characterize the involvement of the TrâKPI genes in plant defense response. Expression of the TrâKPI genes against the generalist herbivore S. litura further supported the view that the TrâKPIs in white clover are involved in plant defense responses where local (leaf), basipetal (root) and acropetal i (apical tissue) tissues were compared. The expression results suggest that TrâKPI 1, TrâKPI 2 and TrâKPI 5 are induced by herbivore attack and TrâKPI 1 was found to be most involved (1600 âfold at 24 h) followed by TrâKPI 2 and TrâKPI 5. In the nematode experiment, inoculation by a cyst nematode was able to trigger the expression of TrâKPI 1, TrâKPI 4 and TrâKPI 5 in the root tissue at day 4 and a systemic response of nematode feeding was also observed in the leaf tissue for these genes at day 8. Invasion by the rootâknot nematode did not result in any significant upâregulation for TrâKPI genes at day 4 and day 8. This finding suggests that TrâKPIs might be involved in defense against cyst nematode invasion but not by rootâknot nematodes. To further elucidate the involvement of TrâKPI genes under cyst nematode attack, a resistant line 17 R and a susceptible line 23 S were used. In the resistant line 17 R, all four TrâKPI genes were significantly expressed by day 4 and day 8, and in the susceptible line 23 S, high transcript abundance was observed only at day 4. Therefore, it can be proposed that TrâKPIs in white clover are important in defense against white clover cyst nematode in combination with other defense genes. For an abiotic stress study, water deficiency and limited phosphorus (Pi) treatments were employed to examine the expression of the TrâKPI genes in white clover. For the water deficiency trials, two treatments were imposed: a preâstressed (PS) treatment in which plants were subjected to a water deficit for 7 days, followed by watering for a further 7 days before the experimental water deficit was applied, or a nonâpre stressed (NPS) treatment in which plants were subjected immediately to a water deficit. The level of TrâNCED 1 (9 âcisâepoxycarotenoid dioxygenase) expression, coding for an enzyme involved in ABA biosynthesis, was also investigated to prove that a water deficit is perceived by the plants. The TrâNCED 1 level was found to be upâregulated in the NPS treatment when compared with the level observed in fully hydrated tissue. Under the NPS and PS treatments, the transcription level of TrâKPI 1 and TrâKPI 5 were induced significantly in the leaf tissue when compared with the control. Interestingly, the preâstressed treatment triggered the expression of all three genes studied which were significantly higher compared to the expression level under the NPS treatment. To further characterize the role of TrâKPIs under water stress, a drought tolerant ecotype Tienshan and drought susceptible cultivar, Kopu was used. A clear upregulation of TrâKPI 1 in Tienshan and TrâKPI 5 in Kopu was observed under the PS treatment when compared with the initial moisture content and NPS treatments indicating some selective pressure on the TrâKPIs under water stress in susceptible and resistant plants. In a macroânutrient (Pi) limitation experiment, where the growing root is divided in different developmental regions comprising the elongation zone (EZ), the visible lateral root zone (VL) and the mature zone, a higher level of TrâKPIs expression was observed in the growing zone rather than mature root zone. Although expression of all four TrâKPIs was upâregulated in the EZ region, only TrâKPI 2 and TrâKPI 4 showed an extended level of expression in the visible lateral root zone indicating a possible involvement in lateral root formation as Pi limitation does induce a higher number of lateral root primordia. In leaf tissue, the down regulation of TrâKPIs was observed up to 12 h of the Pi starved treatment and the transcript level started to increase from 24 h onward indicating that TrâKPIs are not early response genes in leaf tissue. Finally, the cisâbinding elements in the promoter regions of four TrâKPI genes indicate that this gene family in white clover is controlled by different transcription factors. A number of growth and developmentârelated transcription factor binding sites such as AREF, ASRC, LFY, MADS and biotic and abiotic stress responsive transcription factors binding sites such as EINL, MYBL, MYBS, MYCL, and WNAC have been identified in all the four promoter sequences, although differences in the pattern and frequency were observed across the four TrâKPI genes were observed. This further highlights that this gene family is regulated by a complex network of hormonal and other stress induced cues...|$|R
