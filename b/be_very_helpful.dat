5|$|The day Cariappa {{took over}} the reins of the Indian Army, 15 January 1949, was marked as {{official}} Army Day and celebrated annually. As {{the chief of the}} Army, Cariappa was instrumental {{in the formation of the}} Territorial Army in 1949. Though the National Cadet Corps had been already formed in 1948, it was Cariappa who extended support during its formative years. These two complimentary branches of the Army later proved to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> in the wars India fought in later years.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session he swung a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E
5|$|Leterrier had {{to direct}} four units {{with a broken}} foot. Filming began on July 9, 2007. Shooting {{primarily}} took place in Toronto, because mayor David Miller is a Hulk fan and promised to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> to the crew when closing Yonge Street for four nights in September to shoot Hulk and Blonsky's climactic fight. Despite messing up the street with explosives and overturned burning vehicles, the crew would clean it up within twenty minutes so business could continue as normal each day. The first action sequence shot was the Culver University battle, which was filmed at the University of Toronto and Morningside Park. The filmmakers built a glass wall over a walkway at the University for when the soldiers trap Banner inside to smoke him out. There was also shooting in the Financial District. A factory in Hamilton, Ontario, which was due for demolition, was {{the interior of the}} Brazilian factory. The site's underground floors were used for Ross' military command center. The crew also shot part of the Hulk and Blonsky's fight on a backlot in Hamilton. Other Canadian locations included CFB Trenton and a glacier in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in New York City and two weeks in Rio de Janeiro. While there, the crew shot at Rocinha, Lapa, Tijuca Forest and Santa Teresa. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.|$|E

50|$|Moreover, {{the wheel}} offense <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> for team-building. Because the wheel offense demands every player {{to have good}} ball-handling and {{shooting}} skills, each player is forced to develop more fully. In the wheel offensive play, five players play as a team rather than individuals. Thus practicing and running the wheel offense <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> for developing a team spirit among the players.|$|R

25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program input channel of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, but it can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused {{by the arrival of}} a crowd. Because this is still a very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} of concepts and cases in Rabinow’s work distinguishes {{itself from the}} more common mode of social science work predicated on using examples to test general theories or philosophical practice that seeks analytic clarity about universals or general (often highly abstract) cases. In contrast, Rabinow argues that work on concepts opens up and orients inquiry into the concrete features of distinctive cases, whereas the use of ostensibly timeless theory or universal concepts are unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> in drawing attention to particularities and singularities. Given this goal, such traditional approaches can function as a real impediment to inquiry. Rabinow defines concept work as “constructing, elaborating and testing a conceptual inventory as well as specifying and experimenting with multi-dimensional diagnostic and analytic frames.” In that sense, Rabinow’s work continues with appropriate modifications a social scientific tradition stretching from Max Weber through Clifford Geertz.|$|E
500|$|Ahmedabad {{is divided}} by the Sabarmati into two {{physically}} distinct eastern and western regions. The eastern {{bank of the river}} houses the old city, which includes the central town of Bhadra. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed bazaars, the pol system of closely clustered buildings, and numerous places of worship. A Pol (pronounced as pole) is a housing cluster which comprises many families of a particular group, linked by caste, profession, or religion. This is a list of Pols in the old walled city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India. Heritage of these Pols [...] has helped Ahmedabad gain a place in UNESCO's Tentative Lists, in selection criteria II, III and IV. The secretary-general of EuroIndia Centre quoted that if [...] 12000 homes of Ahmedabad are restored they could <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> in promoting heritage tourism and its allied businesses.

500|$|Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who a {{year earlier}} had told {{physicist}} Leo Szilard that a public demonstration of the bomb might make the Soviet Union [...] "more manageable" [...] in Europe, now argued the opposite: that further display of U.S. nuclear power could harden the Soviet Union's position against acceptance of the Acheson–Lilienthal Plan, which discussed possible methods for the international control {{of nuclear weapons and}} the avoidance of future nuclear warfare. At a March 22 cabinet meeting he said, [...] "from the standpoint of international relations it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> if the test could be postponed or never held at all." [...] He prevailed on Truman to postpone the first test for six weeks, from May 15 to July 1. For public consumption, the postponement was explained as an opportunity for more Congressional observers to attend during their summer recess.|$|E
500|$|Depending {{on their}} {{language}} and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards. Visual scene displays {{have been used}} on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction. Approaches such as [...] "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" [...] train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation. Communication boards can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe. They can be produced at a very low tech level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words {{they are trying to}} say. Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.|$|E

2500|$|The photon propagator, {{which is}} the multiplicative factor {{corresponding}} to an internal photon in the Feynman diagram expansion of a QED calculation, contains a factor gμν corresponding to the Minkowski metric. [...] An expansion of this factor as a sum over photon polarizations involves terms containing all four possible polarizations. [...] Transversely polarized radiation can be expressed mathematically as a sum over either a linearly or circularly polarized basis. [...] Similarly, one can combine the longitudinal and time-like gauge polarizations to obtain [...] "forward" [...] and [...] "backward" [...] polarizations; these are a form of light cone coordinates in which the metric is off-diagonal. [...] An expansion of the gμν factor in terms of circularly polarized (spin ±1) and light cone coordinates is called a spin sum. [...] Spin sums can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>helpful</b> both in simplifying expressions and in obtaining a physical understanding of the experimental effects associated with different terms in a theoretical calculation.|$|E
