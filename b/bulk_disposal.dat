40|$|Guam’s only {{municipal}} solid waste disposal site is centrally located {{in the village of}} Ordot and has been in use for over fifty years. Lacking in the conventional technology built in to modern day sanitary landfills, the site is essentially an open dump covering ~ 20 acres of the upper Lonfit River valley. The dump was operated by the US Navy at the end of WWII and transferred to the Government of Guam shortly thereafter. Although slated for closure more than 20 years ago, it still receives around 200 tons of solid waste per day from the civilian community. Early records of the types of materials disposed of at the Ordot Dump are nonexistent but are suspected to include the same array of toxic chemicals found at other military dumpsites on island. Today, there is some control over the <b>bulk</b> <b>disposal</b> of industrial chemicals, waste oil, and metallic waste at Ordot Dump. However, household waste is rarely screened and is known to contain a variety of hazardous substances, both biological and chemical. Leachate streams occur in several places {{around the perimeter of the}} dump and course their way down gradient into the Lonfit River and out into Pago Bay. Their chemical composition is largely unknown and their impact on the local environment in terms of ecology, agriculture, and huma...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has {{conducted}} {{a series of}} ''scoping'' tests (referred to as Phase 1) to assess the potential use of a Mylar{reg_sign} tear-off system as a primary or secondary protective barrier to minimize acid etching (''frosting''), accidental scratching, and/or radiation damage for shielded cells windows. Conceptually, thin, multi-layered sheets of Mylar (referred to as a ''tear-off'' system) could be directly applied to the Lexan{reg_sign} sheet or glovebox/hood sash window to serve as a secondary (or primary) barrier. Upon degradation of visual clarity due to accidental scratching, spills/splatters, and/or radiation damage, the outer layer (or sheet) of Mylar could be removed ''refreshing'' or restoring the view. Due to the multi-layer aspect, the remaining Mylar layers would provide continued protection for the window from potential reoccurrences (which could be immediate or after some extended time period). Although the concept of using a tear-off system as a protective barrier was conceptually enticing, potential technical issues were identified and addressed as part of this Phase 1 feasibility study. These included resistance to: (1) acid(s) (concentrated (28. 9 M) HF, concentrated (15. 9 M) HNO{sub 3 }, 6 M HCl, and 0. 6 M H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }), (2) base (a simulated sludge with pH of 12. 9), (3) gamma radiation (cumulative dose of {approx} 200, 000 rad), and (4) scratch resistance (simulating accidental scratching with the manipulators). Not only can these four factors {{play a significant role in}} determining the visual clarity of the integrated system, they can also contribute to the mechanical integrity issues which could dictate the ability to remove the outer layer when visual clarity has degraded. The results of the Phase 1 study clearly indicate that the Mylar tear-off concept (as a primary or secondary protective barrier) is a potential technical solution to prevent or retard excessive damage that would result from acid etching, base damage (as a result of a sludge spill or splatter), gamma radiation damage, and/or accidental scratching (due to manipulator/tool contact). The short term tests performed in this task showed that Mylar tear-offs can withstand the chemical and physical abuses expected in off-normal shielded cells operations. The ''tear-offs'' not only provide some measure of acid resistance, as reflected by the lack of visual degradation after being exposed to four acids, but also act as a protective barrier to accidental contact with the manipulators and/or tools. The conceptual ''erasing'' of scratches or marks was demonstrated in the shielded cell mock-up facility through the removal, with manipulators, of the outer layer tear-off. The successful removal of the outer layer tear-off with the manipulator, using tabs not specifically designed for remote operations, demonstrates that the system is ''manipulator-friendly'' and could be implemented in the shielded cells. The ability to remove the outer layer tear-off not only regains visual clarity but also reduces waste disposal volumes (i. e., disposal of a thin sheet of Mylar which is ''collapsible'' versus the <b>bulk</b> <b>disposal</b> of a rigid Lexan sheet or glovebox/sash window) which is more cost effective. The ''tear-off'' system could also reduce the number of cell entries needed to replace the Lexan sheet and increase the time interval between glovebox/sash window change outs which can be costly and time consuming. Although the primary focus of this report addresses the application of the Mylar tear-offs on shielded cells windows, the concept is also potentially applicable to glovebox and hood sash windows. In fact, the tear-off concept is potentially applicable to any system where visual clarity is compromised given the environmental conditions of the test. In addition, the tear-offs could be applied to walls or shelves where a protective barrier would reduce deterioration or discoloration. This concept is referred to as the ProTec{trademark} tear-off system as its primary intent is to protect windows or surfaces...|$|E

Conceptually, thin, multi-layered sheets of Mylar (referred to throughout this report as the ProTec{trademark} tear-off system) can be directly applied to the shielded cell, glovebox, or hood sash window to serve as a secondary (or primary) barrier. Upon degradation of visual clarity due to accidental scratching, spills/splatters, and/or radiation damage, the outer layer (or sheet) of Mylar could be removed refreshing or restoring the view. Due to the multilayer aspect, the remaining Mylar layers would provide continued protection for the window from potential reoccurrences. Although the concept of using a tear-off system as a protective barrier is conceptually enticing, potential technical issues were identified and addressed as part of this phased study to support implementation of this type of system in the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). Specific test conditions of interest to the DWPF included the performance of the tear-off system exposed to or under the following conditions: (1) acid(s) (concentrated (28. 9 M) HF, concentrated (15. 9 M) HNO{sub 3 }, 6 M HCl, and 0. 6 M H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }); (2) base (based on handling of radioactive sludges with pH of {approx} 12 - 13); (3) gamma radiation (due to radioactive sources or materials being used in the analytical cells); (4) scratch resistance (simulating accidental scratching with the manipulators); and (5) in-situ testing (sample coupons exposed to actual field conditions in DWPF). The results of the Phase 1 study indicated that the ProTec tear-off concept (as a primary or secondary protective barrier) is a potential technical solution to prevent or retard excessive damage that would result from acid etching, base damage (as a result of a sludge spill or splatter), gamma radiation damage, and/or accidental scratching (due to manipulator/tool contact). Although identified as a potential solution, the Phase 1 testing was relatively short-term with exposure times up to 1 - 2 months for the acid and gamma radiation tests. Phase 2 testing included longer exposure times for the acid resistance (up to 456 days) and gamma radiation exposure (700 days with a cumulative gamma dose of {approx} 3. 1 x 10 {sup 5 } rad) assessments. The tear-off system continued to perform well in these longer-term acid resistance testing and gamma exposure conditions. Complete removal of the tear-offs after these long-term exposure times indicate that not only could visual clarity be restored but the mechanical integrity could be retained. The results also provided insight into the ability of the ProTec tear-off system to withstand the chemical and physical abuses expected in off-normal shielded cells operations. The conceptual erasing of scratches or marks by excessive manipulator abuse was demonstrated in the SRNL Shielded Cells mock-up facility through the removal of the outer layer tear-off with manipulators. In addition, the Phase 2 testing included an in-situ assessment of a prototype tear-off system in the DWPF Sampling Cells where the system was exposed to actual field conditions including radioactive sources, acidic and basic environments, dusting, and chemical cleaning solutions over a 5 - 6 month period. DWPF personnel were extremely satisfied with the performance (including the successful removal of 3 layers with manipulators) of the ProTec tear-off system under actual field conditions. The successful removal of the outer layer tear-offs with the manipulator, using tabs not specifically designed for remote operations, demonstrates that the system is 'manipulator-friendly' and could be implemented in a remote environment. The ability to remove the outer layer tear-off not only regains visual clarity but also reduces waste disposal volumes (i. e., disposal of a thin sheet of Mylar which is 'collapsible' versus the <b>bulk</b> <b>disposal</b> of a rigid Lexan{reg_sign} sheet (alpha shield) or glovebox/sash window) which is more cost effective.

Although the primary focus of this study addresses the application of the ProTec tear-off system to shielded cells windows, the concept is also potentially applicable to glovebox and hood sash windows.

40|$|The Area 3 Radioactive Waste Management Site (RMWS) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) {{is managed}} and {{operated}} by National Security Technologies, LLC (NSTec) for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO). This document is the first update of the interim closure plan for the Area 3 RWMS, which was presented in the Integrated Closure and Monitoring Plan (ICMP) (DOE, 2005). The format and content of this plan follows the Format and Content Guide for U. S. Department of Energy Low-Level Waste Disposal Facility Closure Plans (DOE, 1999 a). The major updates to the plan include a new closure date, updated closure inventory, the new institutional control policy, and the Title II engineering cover design. The plan identifies the assumptions and regulatory requirements, describes the disposal sites and the physical {{environment in which they}} are located, presents the design of the closure cover, and defines the approach and schedule for both closing and monitoring the site. The Area 3 RWMS accepts low-level waste (LLW) from across the DOE Complex in compliance with the NTS Waste Acceptance Criteria (NNSA/NSO, 2006). The Area 3 RWMS accepts both packaged and unpackaged unclassified <b>bulk</b> LLW for <b>disposal</b> in subsidence craters that resulted from deep underground tests of nuclear devices in the early 1960 s. The Area 3 RWMS covers 48 hectares (119 acres) and comprises seven subsidence craters [...] U- 3 ax, U- 3 bl, U- 3 ah, U- 3 at, U- 3 bh, U- 3 az, and U- 3 bg. The area between craters U- 3 ax and U- 3 bl was excavated to form one large disposal unit (U- 3 ax/bl); the area between craters U- 3 ah and U- 3 at was also excavated to form another large disposal unit (U- 3 ah/at). Waste unit U- 3 ax/bl is closed; waste units U- 3 ah/at and U- 3 bh are active; and the remaining craters, although currently undeveloped, are available for disposal of waste if required. This plan specifically addresses the closure of the U- 3 ah/at and the U- 3 bh LLW units. A final closure cover has been placed on unit U- 3 ax/bl (Corrective Action Unit 110) at the Area 3 RWMS. Monolayer-evapotranspirative closure cover designs for the U- 3 ah/at and U- 3 bh units are provided in this plan. The current-design closure cover thickness is 3 meters (10 feet). The final design cover will have an optimized cover thickness, which is expected to be less than 3 m (10 ft). Although waste operations at the Area 3 RWMS have ceased at the end of June 2006, disposal capacity is available for future disposals at the U- 3 ah/at and U- 3 bh units. The Area 3 RWMS is expected to start closure activities in fiscal year 2025, which include the development of final performance assessment and composite analysis documents, closure plan, closure cover design for construction, cover construction, and initiation of the post-closure care and monitoring activities. Current monitoring at the Area 3 RWMS includes monitoring the cover of the closed mixed waste unit U- 3 ax/bl as required by the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, and others required under federal regulations and DOE orders. Monitoring data, collected via sensors and analysis of samples, are needed to evaluate radiation doses to the general public, for performance assessment maintenance, to demonstrate regulatory compliance, and to evaluate the actual performance of the RWMSs. Monitoring provides data to ensure the integrity and performance of waste disposal units. The monitoring program is designed to forewarn management and regulators of any failure and need for mitigating actions. The plan describes the program for monitoring direct radiation, air, vadose zone, biota, groundwater, meteorology, and subsidence. The requirements of post-closure cover maintenance and monitoring will be determined in the final closure plan...|$|R
