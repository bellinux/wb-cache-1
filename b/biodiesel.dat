5|$|A {{major benefit}} of <b>biodiesel</b> is lower carbon emissions, {{although}} the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into <b>biodiesel,</b> and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing <b>biodiesel</b> in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure.

The wear coefficient values are in the range 10 − 8 – 10 − 9 mm 3 /N·m, denoting a mild wear regime, in agreement with the high lubricity of these fuels assessed by the ASTM D 6079 standard.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study examines {{the effect on}} performance and emission outputs of a compression ignition engine operating on <b>biodiesels</b> of varying carbon chain length {{and the degree of}} unsaturation. A well-instrumented, heavy-duty, multi-cylinder, common-rail, turbo-charged diesel engine was used to ensure that the results contribute in a realistic way to the ongoing debate about the impact of biofuels. Comparative measurements are reported for engine performance as well as the emissions of NOx, particle number and size distribution, and the concentration of the reactive oxygen species (which provide a measure of the toxicity of emitted particles). It is shown that the <b>biodiesels</b> used in this study produce lower mean effective pressure, somewhat proportionally with their lower calorific values; however, the molecular structure has been shown to have little impact on the performance of the engine. The peak in-cylinder pressure is lower for the <b>biodiesels</b> that produce a smaller number of emitted particles, compared to fossil diesel, but the concentration of the reactive oxygen species is significantly higher because of oxygen in the fuels. The differences in the physicochemical properties amongst the biofuels and the fossil diesel significantly affect the engine combustion and emission characteristics. Saturated short chain length fatty acid methyl esters are found to enhance combustion efficiency, reduce NOx and particle number concentration, but results in high levels of fuel consumption...|$|R

The performance is compared {{on the basis of}} brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and emissions of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen.

40|$|In this paper, the {{combustion}} noise of a compression ignition (CI) diesel engine operating with <b>biodiesels</b> {{has been investigated}} experimentally. It aims to explore an effective method for combustion process monitoring and fuel quality evaluation through analysing {{the characteristics of the}} engine combustion noise. The experiments were conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection and turbocharged diesel engine fuelled with <b>biodiesels</b> (B 50 and B 100) and normal pure diesel, and operating under different loads and speeds. The signals of cylinder head vibration, engine noise and in-cylinder pressure were measured during the tests. A coherent power spectrum analysis method was used to investigate the vibration and noise signals that related to {{the combustion}} process. The results shown that the noise components at the frequency band of 2 - 3 kHz are closely related to the combustion process. Subsequently, the Wigner-Ville distribution is employed to present the energy distribution of engine noise in the time-frequency domain. Then a band-pass filter based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) is developed to extract the main component of the combustion noise for feature extraction. The results show that the sound pressure levels (SPLs) of the extracted combustion noise of the test diesel engine fuelled with <b>biodiesels</b> are higher than that fuelled with diesel. This is also identical to the variation of in-cylinder pressure. The results demonstrate that the features of the extracted combustion noise can indicate the combustion characteristics and provide useful information for monitoring the combustion process and evaluating the fuel quality of diesel engines...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{nutrients}} are accumulating {{rapidly in}} the environment due, in part, to increasing demand for food and energy products derived from agriculture. Recently, biobased fuels from renewable resources have gained high development priority due to national energy security policies and to their potential carbon emission reduction compared to their petroleum counterparts. However, biofuels from first generation feedstocks (e. g., corn and soybean) exhibit a significant environmental tradeoff {{in the form of}} increased water quality degradation (i. e. eutrophication and hypoxia). To mitigate eutrophication resulting from increased agricultural production, it is important 1) to identify eutrophication potential of the main bioproducts including biofuels and foods; and 2) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} possible mitigation strategies. Multiple strategies exist for reducing nutrient loading including optimizing farming practices and encouraging consumers to purchase low nutrient intensity bioproducts. This research quantified the life cycle nutrient flows and environmental impacts of foods and biofuels, and subsequently evaluated the mitigation potentials of management strategies. Research results show that different food groups exhibit highly variable nitrogen- intensity, on average, red meat and dairy products require much more nitrogen than cereals/carbohydrates. The ranking of foods' nitrogen footprints is not consistent with their carbon footprint. For example, dairy products and chicken/eggs have relatively high nitrogen footprint and low carbon footprints. The life cycle assessment of <b>biodiesels</b> in Pennsylvania exhibits that fertilizer usage in the agricultural phase and fuel combustion in the use phase are main contributors to <b>biodiesel's</b> life cycle environmental impacts for all blends. Comparing <b>biodiesels</b> with conventional diesel, environmental tradeoffs exist between global warming potential and eutrophication potential. Local scouring of <b>biodiesels</b> has the lowest environmental impacts for B 20 and B 100. Dietary shifts from dairy products and red meat to cereals can be an effective approach for lowering the personal nitrogen footprint. Altering farming practices (including shifting conventional tillage to no tillage, using manure, installing buffer strips surrounding farmlands etc) could reduce environmental impacts of bioproducts from life cycle perspectives too. The life cycle assessment analysis of bioproducts suggests environmentally benign farming practices and consumption shift to low nitrogen intensity foods to mitigate eutrophication issues...|$|R
