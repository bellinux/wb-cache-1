25|$|In {{informal}} {{applications such}} as personal letters where low priority {{was placed on the}} appearance of the document, or conversely in highly formal applications in which it was important that any corrections be obvious, the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> could be used to back up over the error and then overstrike it with hyphens, slashes, Xs, or the like.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you kind of {{have to go back and}} look at your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|E
5000|$|Algebraic mode {{works by}} the user {{entering}} an expression, then pressing [...] to have it evaluated. The expression appears on the upper line of the display, the result on the lower line. The expression can be edited using the arrow and <b>backspace</b> <b>keys,</b> and re-evaluated as desired.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is notable}} that the Enter key {{has moved to}} a half-length [...] "spacebar" [...] {{position}} alongside the spacebar itself. Each is now used by one thumb alone; left for Enter and right for Space. Also, the Tab and <b>Backspace</b> <b>keys</b> are conveniently and centrally located within the array of letters, as are the comma and period.|$|R
50|$|Most Selectric IIIs and Electronic Typewriters {{only had}} keys for 92 {{printable}} characters; the 96-character keyboard was an optional feature. Fitting the additional keys onto the keyboard required shrinking the Return <b>key</b> and <b>Backspace</b> <b>keys.</b> This was annoying to many typists, {{so it was}} not the default configuration. The keytops on the Selectric III and Electronic Typewriters were larger and more square than those on earlier Selectrics.|$|R
2500|$|The Insert key {{is mainly}} used to switch between overtype mode, {{in which the}} cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a {{character}} at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a <b>Backspace</b> <b>key.</b> The <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> deletes the preceding character.|$|E
2500|$|The Perkins Brailler is a [...] "braille typewriter" [...] {{with a key}} {{corresponding}} {{to each of the}} six dots of the braille code, a space key, a <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and a line space key. [...] Like a manual typewriter, it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a carriage return lever above the keys. [...] The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|E

50|$|GNOME Terminal {{supports}} multiple profiles. A {{user can}} create multiple profiles {{for his or}} her account. Users can then set configuration options on a per-profile basis and assign a name to each profile. The available configuration options range from different fonts, different colors, emission of the terminal bell, the behavior of scrolling, and how the terminal handles compatibility with the <b>backspace</b> and delete <b>key.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The letter [...] "Í" [...] {{is often}} placed {{left of the}} space key, leaving {{the width of the}} left Shift key intact. [...] "Ű" [...] may be located to the left of <b>Backspace,</b> making that <b>key</b> smaller, but {{allowing}} for a larger Enter key. Ű being close to Enter often leads to it being typed instead of hitting Enter, especially when one has just switched from a keyboard that has Ű next to backspace.|$|R
50|$|TypeMatrix {{keyboards}} {{are significantly}} {{different than a}} standard computer keyboard. The primary difference is its matrix architecture (straight vertical key columns), which is intended to increase typing accuracy and decrease wrist distortion. Large centered <b>Backspace</b> and Enter <b>keys</b> move usage {{of some of the}} most-used keys from the pinky to the index finger. TypeMatrix keyboards are designed to have a smaller footprint and decrease the reaching distance to a user's mouse, in an attempt to lessen arm and shoulder stress.|$|R
50|$|For the Italian {{market the}} {{keyboard}} {{is in the}} QZERTY layout, as with most Italian machines (excluding modern computer keyboards). Aside from the typing keys, the keyboard includes a space bar, two shift keys, one caps lock key, a <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> and a margin release key. Of these, only the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> bears a mark on it (an arrow pointing right), while the other five mentioned are left anonymous.|$|E
50|$|The <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> is {{commonly}} used to go back a page or up one level in graphical web or file browsers.|$|E
50|$|GNOME Terminal {{supports}} {{a couple of}} different compatibility options for interfacing with older software that depends on varying keyboard-to-ASCII assignments. In computing, there has been ambiguity between the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> and delete key. When the user presses the <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> the computer can either delete the character before the cursor, or the character at the cursor, which introduces this ambiguity (see ASCII). GNOME Terminal allows the user specify which control character or escape sequence the delete and the backspace keys should generate. Users can specify this option on a per-profile basis.|$|E
50|$|If {{you make}} a mistake typing in a line, you can either retype it from scratch (or DEL it).. or you can EDIT it.When in EDIT mode, you get a reprint of the line, and a second copy that you SPACEbar across chars. You cannot use arrow <b>keys.</b> <b>backspace</b> takes you left, but does not {{actually}} erase it in the buffer. 'i' puts you in insert mode. pressing return gets you out of it. 'c' changes one char, 'd' deletes one char. 'x' takes you to end of line, allowing you to e'x'tend it. 'l' redraws the line.|$|R

"Alphabetical {{duplicating}} keypunches recorded alphabetic {{information in}} tabulating cards so that complete words and names, together with numerical data, could be later printed by an alphabetical accounting machine. The Type 31 Alphabetical Duplicating Punch {{was introduced by}} IBM in 1933, and it automatically ejected one card and fed another in 0.65 second. These machines were equipped with separate alphabetical and numerical keyboards. The alphabetical keyboard was similar to a conventional manual typewriter except that the shift, tab, <b>backspace</b> and character <b>keys</b> were eliminated, and a skip, release, stacker and '1' key were provided."

5000|$|... rTorrent uses ncurses and is {{suitable}} for use with screen or Tmux; it uses commands such as Carriage return to load a torrent, after which ^S {{can be used to}} start a torrent (where ^ is shorthand for Ctrl <b>key),</b> <b>backspace</b> can be used to automatically start a torrent once it is loaded, making a subsequent issue of ^S unnecessary, ^K for stop, and ^D for pause, or if already paused or stopped, ^D again to delete the torrent. It supports saving of sessions and allows the user to add and remove torrents. It also supports partial downloading of multi-file torrents. In the release of rTorrent-0.7.0 support for BitTorrent protocol encryption was also implemented. PEX, DHT and initial seeding were recently implemented in rTorrent.|$|R
50|$|Editing of the typed-in {{line was}} done on the screen via the delete or <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and the entire line was {{transmitted}} to the computer when the send key was pressed.|$|E
50|$|In modern systems, the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> {{is often}} mapped to the delete {{character}} (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the backspace key's function of deleting the character before the cursor remains.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} defining (albeit optional) {{feature of}} the Colemak layout {{is the lack of}} a Caps Lock key; an additional <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> occupies the position typically occupied by Caps Lock on modern keyboards.|$|E
5000|$|On some keyboards, the {{backslash}} key (...) can {{be found}} {{to the left of}} the enter key, rather than on the top row {{to the left of the}} <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> where it resides normally.|$|E
50|$|The Delete key is {{typically}} smaller and less-conveniently located than the <b>Backspace</b> <b>key,</b> and on keyboards where space is limited, for example those omitting the numeric keypad or virtual keyboards on mobile devices, {{it is often}} omitted altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Note that on some keyboards, the [...] "ű" [...] key {{is located}} {{to the left}} of the Enter key, while on others it is placed {{to the left of}} the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> (see the two {{pictures}} on the right).|$|E
50|$|The {{keyboard}} uses QWERTY, AZERTY {{and various}} other layouts. Apart from the typing keys, the keyboard includes a Space bar, two Shift keys, a caps lock, a <b>backspace</b> <b>key,</b> margin release key, paragraph indentation key and a tab-stop set/unset key.|$|E
50|$|It {{was common}} that the 0 numeral was omitted (in favour {{of using the}} {{uppercase}} O letter), and there were also some typewriters without the 1 numeral (with the lowercase L being used to achieve it). Also absent were symbols such as the exclamation mark (achieved by typing an apostrophe and overwriting it with a period using the <b>backspace</b> <b>key),</b> the asterisk (achieved in a similar way, with lowercase X and the plus or minus sign — for eight- or six-pointed asterisks, respectively), the number sign (which was achieved by some through intricate methods involving partial depressions of the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> to overwrite the equals sign with two slashes), and the inequality sign (typing an equals sign and overwriting it with one slash).|$|E

50|$|Pressing the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> on a {{computer}} terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which {{did not have the}} backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret backspace by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender's screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular '^' key followed by typing a regular 'H' key.|$|E
50|$|Since {{many people}} are {{familiar}} with word processors, the notation aspect of MusicEase is designed to work much like a word processing program. For instance, pressing the G key enters the note G. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> (Windows) then deletes this note. Pressing the Enter key begins a new system. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> (Windows) {{at the beginning of}} a system appends it to the previous system. Blocks can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort.|$|E

Compared with the ANSI layout (top left), the enter key is vertical rather than horizontal. In addition, the left shift key is smaller, {{to make room}} for an additional key to its right. The JIS mechanical layout (bottom right) is the basis for Japanese keyboards. Here it is the right-hand shift key that is smaller. Furthermore, the space bar and <b>backspace</b> <b>key</b> are also smaller, {{to make room for}} four additional keys.|$|E
