5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not merely}} by the title of example that we cherish the memory of those in heaven; we seek, rather, that by this devotion to the {{exercise}} of fraternal charity the union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be strengthened.

25|$|Lessig {{supports}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act {{and believes that}} it <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> closer to giving Americans a sense of financial security. Although he voices strong support, he also believes that legislation should be passed that adds a public option to the insurance mandate and repeals the ban on the government negotiating for lower drug prices. Lessig has proposed prize funding drug research and banning drug companies from negotiating with generic drug providers to delay entry into the market.|$|E
25|$|However, Haufniensis {{mentions}} that anxiety {{is a way}} for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E

25|$|He {{considered}} it {{the task of}} the artist to create beauty. How the artist did this did not really matter. But originality was no virtue; personality was. Great music, like Beethoven’s, is admired because the composer’s personality shines through; Beethoven’s daring originality is now only of historical interest. However, Ryelandt was highly critical of atonality, claiming that the modernists’ “empty game of sound combinations <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> no interior enrichment at all,” and that the value of works like Honegger’s “unforgettable” Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher lay chiefly in their tonal passages.|$|E
25|$|This <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his {{reliance on}} thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't {{able to see}} family resemblances. We've {{made a mistake in}} understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

On separate occasions, they were kidnapped, beaten and thrown into remote locations. The incidents attracted much concern over the Internet, as well as wide speculation and theories about what exactly happened. This documentary presents interviews of the two victims, witnesses and concerned netizens.

25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service – unique and incomparable both {{in the power of}} tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> {{to the foot of the}} cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E

One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to destruction."

[...] She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system that <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> out-of-season produce. Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as [...] " [...] chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." [...] Reflecting that the recipes would [...] "probably never" [...] be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers {{a glimpse into the}} world of Jane Austen and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.|$|E
500|$|The Age of Plastic {{starts with}} the title track [...] "The Plastic Age," [...] which, {{according}} to Downes, is about a person's view of plastic experiences from watching and reading news reports on the Vietnam War.

The fast-paced third song, [...] "Kid Dynamo," [...] is about the effects of media on a futuristic kid of the 1980s. [...] "I Love You (Miss Robot)" [...] is the album's fourth track, that Downes said it talks about [...] "being on the road and making love to someone you don't really like, while all the time you're wanting to phone someone who's a long way off."

500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But {{it is also clear that}} a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E

ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband, declaring [...] "Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!", and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence. At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book: A way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.|$|E
