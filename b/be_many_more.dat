They have also proposed that individuals having contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This means that there may <b>be</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> vCJD patients with longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{as late as}} 1917 {{maintained}} only a small army, {{and smaller}} than thirteen of the nations and empires already active in the war. After {{the passage of the}} Selective Service Act in 1917, it drafted 4 million men into military service. By the summer of 1918, about 2 million US soldiers had arrived in France, about half of whom eventually saw front-line service; by the Armistice of November 11 approximately 10,000 fresh soldiers were arriving in France daily. In 1917, Congress gave US citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the Jones Act. In the end, Germany miscalculated the United States' influence on the outcome of the conflict, believing it would <b>be</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> months before US troops would arrive and overestimating the effectiveness of U-boats in slowing the American buildup.|$|E

The DPP's Principal Legal Advisor concluded that Savile could have been prosecuted for offences against at least three victims during his lifetime.

[...] Thus, when Cornwallis returned victorious from India, he was celebrated well beyond parliamentary and company circles. He was raised to Marquess, but was also celebrated publicly through commissioned portraits and statues; published books, songs and poems; and even purchasable medallions and tea trays. This was the first time a military victory in India at the expense of a non-European enemy garnered such public praise. While there would <b>be</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> bumps along the way, such widespread enthusiasm marked a turning point towards British acceptance of an overseas empire of conquest.|$|E

Although primarily involved with the work at Chichen Itza, Morley also took on responsibilities which extended Carnegie-sponsored fieldwork to other Maya sites, such as Yaxchilan, Coba, Copán, Quiriguá, Uxmal, Naranjo, Seibal and Uaxactun. Morley rediscovered the last of these sites (located in the Petén Basin region of Guatemala, to the north of Tikal). Believing that there must <b>be</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> as-yet unknown ancient Maya sites in the area, Morley advertised a [...] "bounty" [...] in return for news of such sites to the local chicleros, who ranged through the jungles seeking exploitable sources of natural gum; in due course he was rewarded with the information which led to its rediscovery. He also bestowed its name, uaxactun, from the Mayan languages, after a stela inscription he found there which recorded a Maya Long Count Calendar date in the 8th cycle (i.e., [...] "8-tuns"; the name could also literally mean [...] "eight stones").|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert, who {{had given}} the 2007 film three stars, [...] gave the sequel only one, calling it [...] "...a horrible {{experience}} of unbearable length", a phrase which later became {{the title of his}} third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying [...] "If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination." [...] He later wrote on his blog about the film, [...] "The day will come when Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will <b>be</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'." [...] Which he later did name it the [...] "worst film of the decade". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, The A.V.

Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil.
