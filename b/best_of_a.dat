That same day, Gallopin took sixth in a sprint finish to the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan.

5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E

25|$|South Africa named an {{unchanged}} side, {{boosted by}} {{the confidence of}} the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated second time around. Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, but this was the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have some confidence with the bat, having had very little success in his recent county appearances.

25|$|Vacuum tubes {{may have}} or develop defects in {{operation}} that make an individual tube unsuitable {{in a given}} device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. Microphonics refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from {{the ends of the}} heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for many purposes. Selecting the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Australia was {{scheduled}} to tour England {{to play for the}} Ashes. Before the squad was selected, Greg Chappell announced {{that he would not be}} leading the Australian team, citing business and family reasons. In his absence, the Australian Cricket Board turned to Hughes as captain. The Australian team arrived in England in May and was greeted by rain, leaving them short of needed match practice. Nevertheless, Hughes and his team unexpectedly won the preliminary One Day International series. The first Test was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Australia won the low scoring and rain affected match by six wickets, after Hughes had taken the opportunity to put England into bat after winning the toss. Australia then had the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drawn match in the second Test at Lord's. After making a pair in this match, Ian Botham resigned his position as captain of England.|$|E
25|$|After Camberley he was {{appointed}} to command 2nd Division, a post he held for two years with little effect or interest – he was frustrated by the task of training an infantry force with no modern equipment – and then sent to command the Meerut district, in India, in 1928. He enjoyed life in India, but found the military situation to be equally uninteresting; the equipment was old-fashioned, as were the regimental officers and the overall strategic plans. He was promoted to lieutenant general in March 1931, and left for England in May, where he returned to half-pay with the sinecure of Lieutenant of the Tower of London. He was relieved from this bleakness by a posting to India as Quartermaster-General in 1933, where he travelled extensively, crossing the country to visit regiments and oversee the Indianisation process. For all this, however, it was the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad job; he was still far from the War Office, and unable to make {{significant impact on the}} army's preparation for a future war.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Nintendo Power listed Mega Man V as the 14th best Game Boy or Game Boy Color video game, praising {{it as the}} <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quality {{series of}} {{portable}} Mega Man games. Game Informers Ben Reeves called it the 11th best Game Boy game due to its relative ambition compared to its Game Boy predecessors. Mega Man V was available for the similarly named Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan on April 13, 2001 alongside its four Game Boy Mega Man predecessors. Outside Japan, the game {{is considered to be}} quite rare. All five games on the Game Boy were to be released as part of a Game Boy Advance compilation in 2004 titled Mega Man Anniversary Collection, but it was delayed indefinitely, renamed Mega Mania, and eventually cancelled. In 2011, IGN listed the game among titles they wished to see downloadable from the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man V is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console; it came out November 6, 2013 in Japan, on May 22, 2014 in North America. and August 28, 2014 in the PAL Region.|$|E

25|$|The {{main story}} {{leading up to}} the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the health of the England vice-captain Denis Compton. His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century – 115 vs an Australian XI – and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager Brigadier Michael Green expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was {{replaced}} by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the Australian XI game and opener Ken Archer (12th man at Brisbane) was given his Baggy Green ahead of the middle order batsman Jim Burke (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128. Lindsay Hassett won the toss and batted first on a yellow, matted wicket made for batting.|$|E
25|$|The team's winning ways {{continued}} at Paris–Nice in March. Goss won the field sprint finish to stage 3, after narrowly missing {{a victory in}} stage 2, maneuvering around riders who fell after 's Peter Sagan crashed on the course's final sharp turn. In the mountainous stage 5, Martin finished with the first group {{on the road to}} assume fourth place {{at the end of the}} day, ten seconds down on race leader Andreas Klöden. This was an advantageous position with the stage 6 individual time trial to come; Martin was viewed as a favorite for the time trial. The next day, Martin handily won the time trial, with only five riders finishing within a minute of his winning time. He took the race lead, with a 36-second lead over Klöden in the overall standings. His advantage largely held steady over the last two days, giving him the overall race crown. The team won the flat first stage of the Volta a Catalunya, but not in the manner by which they regularly win flat stages. New acquisition Smukulis made the morning breakaway and had it stick to the finish. Last shedding former teammate Ben Gastauer of , Smukulis soloed to victory 28 seconds ahead of the charging peloton. It was his first professional victory, and he was visibly emotional as he crossed the finish line. He held the race lead for a second day before giving it up on the high mountain stage 3, as he lost nearly 17 minutes that day. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Albasini won the mountains classification thanks to back-to-back nearly day-long efforts in the breakaways in stages 4 and 5. Also, Martin won the time trial which closed out the event, again besting Klöden, though this time the elder German was the overall race winner. The team was successful on two fronts at the Tour of California. Van Garderen showed solid climbing legs on the race's two summit finishes. Though he was more than a minute back of the stage winner both days, he was well better than the majority of the field, including all his rivals for the youth classification. He won the award at the end of the race by almost six minutes over 's Andrew Talansky. The last stage featured a group sprint finish. Where their leadout train had been outmaneuvered by 's earlier in the race, this time Goss was successfully delivered to the line first. Van Garderen's final overall placing was fifth. Degenkolb and Albasini both found their way into the winner's circle at Bayern-Rundfahrt. First, Degenkolb edged out fellow young German sprinter Marcel Kittel in the finish to stage 2. Albasini won a breakaway sprint the next day, <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nine-man group. This win gave him the race lead for a day, and he held on to finish on the event's final podium in third place.|$|E
