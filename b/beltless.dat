25|$|The Navy Service Uniform is {{a year-round}} service uniform to {{withstand}} day-to-day classroom and office-like environments where the service uniform is typically worn. It {{consists of a}} short-sleeve khaki shirt for males and a khaki weskit-style blouse for females, made from a wash and wear 75% polyester, 25% wool blend, with permanent military creases, black trousers for males with <b>beltless</b> slacks for females and optional <b>beltless</b> skirt, and a black unisex garrison cap. Silver anodized-metal rank insignia is worn on shirt/blouse collars and cap. The service uniform also includes a black relaxed-fit Eisenhower-style jacket with a knit stand-up collar and epaulets, on which petty officers wear large, silver anodized-metal rate insignia. Those entitled to wear gold chevrons continue to wear gold chevrons on the large metal rate insignia on the jacket.|$|E
25|$|Taihō {{was noted}} for his skill and power when {{he grabbed his}} opponents' mawashi or belt– {{techniques}} known as yotsu-sumo. His preferred grip was hidari-yotsu, a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His most common winning move was yori-kiri, a straightforward force out, which accounted for about 30 percent of his wins. His most frequently used throws were sukuinage (the <b>beltless</b> scoop throw) and uwatenage (the overarm throw).|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the White House, Kennedy's style {{underwent}} a change, with her new looks consisting of wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, gypsy skirts, silk Hermès head scarves, and large, round, dark sunglasses. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public. <b>Beltless,</b> white jeans with a black turtleneck, never tucked in, but pulled down over the hips, was another fashion trend that she set.|$|E
25|$|Kotonishiki was {{regarded}} as an oshi-sumo specialist, favouring tsuki (thrusting) and oshi (pushing) techniques. However, he was also capable of fighting on the mawashi or belt. Somewhat unusually, his preferred grip on the mawashi was morozashi, with both arms inside his opponent's. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri (force out), closely followed by oshi-dashi (push out). Together these two techniques accounted for half his victories at sekitori level. He very rarely employed throwing moves, {{with the exception of}} sukuinage, a <b>beltless</b> scoop throw.|$|E
25|$|The Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniform {{consists}} of a navy blue suit coat and trousers (or the optional skirt for women) that are nearly black in color, a white shirt, and a four-in-hand necktie for men or a neck tab for women. The material is generally wool or a wool blend, depending on the vendor. The men's jacket is double breasted with six gold-colored buttons, and the women's jacket has a single row of four gold-colored buttons. Rank insignia is the gold sleeve stripes for commissioned officers, while rating badges and service stripes are worn on the left sleeve by Chief Petty Officers (CPOs). The prescribed headgear is the white combination cap, although a navy blue garrison cap is optional, unless stated otherwise by the prescribing authority in some situations when the jacket is not worn. Beginning in 2016, the Navy began phasing out the female combination cap and now prescribes a cover similar to the male version for female officers and CPOs. Commissioned and warrant officers wear a cap badge of the American shield and eagle in silver upon gold crossed anchors; CPOs wear a single fouled anchor. The combination cover's chinstrap is gold for commissioned and warrant officers, narrower gold for midshipmen, and black for CPOs. Female officers and chief petty officers wear <b>beltless</b> slacks with the SDB, although since January 2017, belted slacks can be worn as an alternative.|$|E

2500|$|The [...]300 RUM {{features}} a rebated rim {{much like the}} [...]300 Canadian Magnum so as to allow the cartridge to function in the Remington M700 action without having to increase the bolt and bolt face diameter of the action. Unlike the belted Magnum cases based on the [...]375 H Magnum cartridge, the [...]300 RUM {{does not have a}} belt. All things being equal, a <b>beltless</b> cartridge would feed more reliably and more smoothly than a belted cartridge. Furthermore, as this is a <b>beltless</b> cartridge headspacing is designed to take place on the shoulder, which is considered beneficial by some as it is thought to promote accuracy and prolong case life of the cartridge. As modern belted magnums such as 7mm Remington Magnum and [...]300 Winchester Magnum actually headspace on the shoulder despite retaining the belt found on their parent cartridge, belted or unbelted is basically irrelevant in discussions of modern cartridges, and particularly so in discussions of unbelted cartridges.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum, {{also known}} as the [...]300 Ultra Mag or [...]300 RUM is a 7.62mm (.308in.) caliber rifle {{cartridge}}, 7.62×72mm, or [...]30 caliber rifle cartridge introduced by Remington Arms in 1999. The [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum {{is one of the largest}} commercially available [...]30 caliber magnums currently being produced. It is a <b>beltless,</b> rebated rim cartridge, capable of handling all large North American game, as well as long-range shooting. Among commercially produced [...]30-caliber rifle chamberings, the [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum is second only to the [...]30-378 Weatherby Magnum in cartridge-case capacity.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1944, {{some of the}} arrested {{perpetrators}} of the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler were taken before Freisler for punishment. [...] The proceedings were filmed {{to be seen by}} the German public in cinema newsreels, portraying how Freisler ran his court, showing him alternating between cerebral questioning of the defendants, with clinical interrogations to prove their guilt of the charges, and verbally and psychologically toying with them to the point of enraged hysterical screaming of personal abuse at them from the bench. At one point he yelled at Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, who was trying to hold his trousers up after being given old oversized and <b>beltless</b> clothing, [...] "You dirty old man, why do you keep fiddling with your trousers?" [...] Nearly all were sentenced to death by hanging, the sentences being carried out within 2 hours of the verdicts.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the seventh}} day of the January 2010 tournament he finally managed to defeat a yokozuna, Hakuhō, by sukuinage, or <b>beltless</b> arm throw, his first win over a yokozuna in {{nineteen}} attempts. This earned him his first Outstanding Performance award, and he finished on 12–3. He became only the third wrestler to compile 33 wins over three tournaments in a san'yaku rank and not be promoted to ōzeki, following Kotogahama in 1957 and Miyabiyama (twice) in 2006. At the March tournament in Osaka it was indicated by Sumo Association official Tomozuna Oyakata that {{he would need to}} win at least 13 bouts and be in contention for the yūshō to earn [...] ōzeki promotion. Baruto was nursing an injury to his left thumb throughout the basho, which he picked up in a training session with Aran. However, he produced his best score in the top division to date of 14–1, and lost only to Hakuhō on Day 11. He was in contention for the championship until the final bout of the tournament, which Hakuhō won over Harumafuji to complete an undefeated 15–0 performance. Baruto was rewarded with special prizes for Fighting Spirit and Technique, the first time since Kotomitsuki in July 2007 that one wrestler has received two prizes in the same tournament.|$|E
6000|$|January 14. [...] Hotel Bristol. Servant Brompy. Alert, gentle, smiling, winning young brown {{creature}} as ever was. Beautiful shining {{black hair}} combed {{back like a}} woman's, and knotted {{at the back of}} his head --tortoise-shell comb in it, sign that he is a Singhalese; slender, shapely form; jacket; under it is a <b>beltless</b> and flowing white cotton gown--from neck straight to heel; he and his outfit quite unmasculine. It was an embarrassment to undress before him.|$|E
6000|$|The general {{effect of}} a Utopian {{population}} is vigour. Everyone one meets seems {{to be not only}} in good health but in training; one rarely meets fat people, bald people, or bent or grey. People who would be obese or bent and obviously aged on earth are here in good repair, and as a consequence the whole {{effect of a}} crowd is livelier and more invigorating than on earth. The dress is varied and graceful; that of the women reminds one most of the Italian fifteenth century; they have an abundance of soft and beautifully-coloured stuffs, and the clothes, even of the poorest, fit admirably. Their hair is very simply but very carefully and beautifully dressed, and except in very sunny weather they do not wear hats or bonnets. There is little difference in deportment between one class and another; they all are graceful and bear themselves with quiet dignity, and among a group of them a European woman of fashion in her lace and feathers, her hat and metal ornaments, her mixed accumulations of [...] "trimmings," [...] would look like a barbarian tricked out with the miscellaneous plunder of a museum. Boys and girls wear much the same sort of costume--brown leather shoes, then a sort of combination of hose and close-fitting trousers that reaches from toe to waist, and over this a <b>beltless</b> jacket fitting very well, or a belted tunic. Many slender women wear the same sort of costume. We should see them in it very often in such a place as Lucerne, as they returned from expeditions in the mountains. The older men would wear long robes very frequently, but the greater proportion of the men would go in variations of much the same costume as the children. There would certainly be hooded cloaks and umbrellas for rainy weather, high boots for mud and snow, and cloaks and coats and furry robes for the winter. There would be no doubt a freer use of colour than terrestrial Europe sees in these days, but the costume of the women at least would be soberer and more practical, and (in harmony with our discussion in the previous chapter) less differentiated from the men's.|$|E

50|$|Takamisugi liked a solid frontal pushing attack, and relied almost {{exclusively}} on oshisumo and tsuppari (thrusting). The push out or oshidashi was the winning kimarite in nearly half his sekitori matches. He usually lost if his opponents were able to grab hold of his mawashi or belt. He very rarely employed throwing moves; his most common throw was the <b>beltless</b> kotenage, or armlock throw.|$|E

5000|$|Standard uniform for all ranks {{since the}} late 1920s was the US Army {{tropical}} 'Chino' khaki cotton shirt and pants, worn with the US M1912 Campaign Hat (aka 'Montana Peak Hat') in Olive Drab felt with the triangular Nicaraguan national cap badge. Military Academy cadets were issued a special version of the 'Chino' uniform, with the shirt modified {{by the addition of}} black shoulder straps and breast pockets' flaps dyed black. Officers and sometimes NCOs wore in the field breeches and riding boots or the US M1931 cavalry laced boots whereas the other ranks' had their trousers trucked into US-type canvas (or leather) gaiters and ankle boots. A four-pocket, open-collar <b>beltless</b> tunic modelled after the US M1926 pattern was adopted by Guardia Officers' and worn with a khaki shirt and tie, replaced by a white shirt and black tie on formal occasions; in active and formal service, a brown leather Sam Browne belt (US Officer's belt, M1921) was frequently worn with the tunic. A tropical white linen dress uniform very similar to the US Navy's Service Dress White or [...] "chokers", was adopted by the Guardia and naval service officers and Military Academy cadets. Comprising a high-collar tunic, slacks and white shoes plus a matching peaked cap, the tunic was worn with removable exaggerated twisted cord epaulettes and a red silk sash tied around the waist on formal occasions whilst enlisted ranks wore exaggerated black bluff chevrons instead.Starting in the mid-1930s, Guardia officers began being issued with the M1937 or M1942 American peaked caps, in either light tropical khaki and Olive Drab wool cloth, which slowly began to replace the campaign hat in service dress.

5000|$|Examples of 8×68mm S based wildcats are the {{relatively}} well known American 7 mm and [...]30 caliber Boo Boo and 7 mm and [...]30 HV wildcats. The Boo Boo wildcats were developed for long range target shooting where participants usually handload their ammunition. Several 1,000 yard shooting competitions have been won with Boo Boo wildcats. A wildcat from Europe {{that uses the}} 8×68mm S as its parent case is the [...]30 Kovacs. It was designed in 1996 by Stefan Kovács, Austria-7041 Wulkaprodersdorf. The [...]30 Kovacs has much more powder-room (longer L2, wider P2, 40 degree Ackley-shoulder) then its parental case. It falls powder-room-wise between the [...]300 Winchester Magnum and [...]300 Weatherby Magnum but has energy and velocity falling between [...]300 Weatherby Magnum and the [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum. This wildcat cartridge will be fitted only by Büchsenmachermeister Egon Kriebernegg. Another European wildcat based on the 8×68mm S is the [...]300 Styria Magnum. It was developed by Ing. Michael W. Mayerl from the Styria Arms company in Austria in 2005 as a reliable <b>beltless</b> high power cartridge for Mauser 98 rifles. The parent case is shortened to 65 mm (2.559 in) case length and necked down to 7.82 mm (.308 in) calibre. The shoulder angle {{is the same as}} the 8×68mm S so fire forming is not necessary and no new headspace gages are needed. The development goal of this cartridge was to get a highly reliable [...]30-calibre magnum cartridge that fits in the standard Mauser 98 action without any modification of the feeding lips, follower, feeding ramp or magazine length. Only the bolt face must be opened to a diameter of 13.3 mm (0.524 in). The throat of the [...]300 Styria Magnum is similar to the proven [...]308 Winchester and short enough to seat the bullets to the lands without exceeding the maximum length of 84.8 mm (3.339 in) to fit the original Mauser 98 magazine. The thick-walled 8×68mm S parent case manufactured by RWS can handle a usage piezo pressure up to 460 MPa (66717 psi).|$|E
