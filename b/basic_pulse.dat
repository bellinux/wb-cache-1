500|$|A main {{element of}} Debuts sound is its {{incorporation}} of dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London's club culture, {{with which the}} singer had established close ties. While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took on all these new sounds, that <b>basic</b> <b>pulse</b> was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's More to Life Than This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy". Björk felt house music was [...] "the only pop music that [...] truly modern," [...] stating in 1993 that it was [...] "the only music where anything creative is happening today." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{bass drum}} (also {{known as the}} [...] "kick drum") {{provides}} a regular but often-varied foundation to the rhythm. The bass drum is the lowest pitched drum and usually provides the basic beat or timing element with <b>basic</b> <b>pulse</b> patterns. Some drummers may use two or more bass drums or use a double bass drum pedal with a single bass drum. Double bass drumming is an important technique in many heavy metal genres. Using a double bass drum pedal enables a drummer to play a double bass drum style with only one bass drum, saving space in recording/performance areas and reducing time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as Continuum—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit which cannot be divided any further. Different rhythms appear through multiplications of the <b>basic</b> <b>pulse,</b> rather than divisions: {{this is the}} {{principle}} of African music seized on by Ligeti. It also appears in the music of Philip Glass, Steve Reich and others; and significantly it shares {{much in common with}} the additive rhythms of Balkan folk music, the music of Ligeti’s youth. He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as [...] "the greatest discovery since Webern and Ives ... something great and important for all music history! His music is so utterly original, enjoyable, perfectly constructed, {{but at the same time}} emotional ... for me it's the best music of any composer living today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morton {{loosened}} ragtime's rigid rhythmic feeling, decreasing its embellishments and {{employing a}} swing feeling. Swing {{is the most}} important and enduring African-based rhythmic technique used in jazz. An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is: [...] "if you don't feel it, you'll never know it." [...] The New Harvard Dictionary of Music states that swing is: [...] "An intangible rhythmic momentum in jazz ... Swing defies analysis; claims to its presence may inspire arguments." [...] The dictionary does nonetheless provide the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat contrasted with duple subdivisions: swing superimposes six subdivisions of the beat over a <b>basic</b> <b>pulse</b> structure or four subdivisions. This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in African-American music than in Afro-Caribbean music. One aspect of swing, which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics, places strokes in-between the triple and duple-pulse [...] "grids".|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We extend Mazo’s {{concept of}} faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) {{signaling}} to pulse trains that modulate {{a bank of}} subcarriers, a method called two dimensional FTN signaling. The signal processing is similar to orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) transmission but the subchannels are not orthogonal. Despite nonorthogonal pulses and subcarriers, the method achieves the isolated-pulse error performance; it does so {{in as little as}} half the bandwidth of ordinary OFDM. Euclidean distance properties are investigated for schemes based on several <b>basic</b> <b>pulses.</b> The best have Gaussian shape. An efficient distance calculation is given. Concatenations of ordinary codes and FTN are introduced. The combination achieves the outer code gain in as little as half the bandwidth. Receivers must work in two dimensions, and several iterative designs are proposed for FTN with outer convolutional coding. I...|$|R

40|$|Background: Non-Newtonian fluids {{occur in}} many {{relevant}} flow and mixing scenarios {{at the lab}} and industrial scale. The addition of acid or basic solutions to a non-Newtonian fluid is not an infrequent operation, particularly in Biotechnology applications where the pH of Non-Newtonian culture broths is usually regulated using this strategy. Methodology and Findings: We conducted mixing experiments in agitated vessels using Non-Newtonian blue maize flour suspensions. Acid or <b>basic</b> <b>pulses</b> were injected to reveal mixing patterns and flow structures and to follow their time evolution. No foreign pH indicator was used as blue maize flours naturally contain anthocyanins that act as a native, wide spectrum, pH indicator. We describe a novel method to quantitate mixedness and mixing evolution through Dynamic Color Analysis (DCA) in this system. Color readings corresponding to different times and locations within the mixing vessel were taken with a digital camera (or a colorimeter) and translated to the CIELab scale of colors. We use distances in the Lab space, a 3 D color space, between a particular mixing state and the final mixing point to characterize segregation/mixing in the system. Conclusion and Relevance: Blue maize suspensions represent an adequate and flexible model to study mixing (and fluid mechanics in general) in Non-Newtonian suspensions using acid/base tracer injections. Simple strategies based on the evaluation of color distances in the CIELab space (or other scales such as HSB) {{can be adapted to}} characterize mixednes...|$|R

The <b>basic</b> Swiss <b>pulse</b> timetabling technique is reviewed, along with the application of the approach to a remote rural case study in Graubünden’s Lower Engadine and Val Müstair.

40|$|Distribution {{packaging}} design often relies on cushion curves to determine required material thickness needed for product protection during shipment. The material thickness chosen based on cushion curves establishes overall package size, a key determiner of logistics costs. Cushion curves are constructed by dropping a mass onto a cushion, and interpreting the resulting shock pulse deceleration. The reported deceleration {{can be highly}} influenced by applying a “filter ” to the shock pulse, a useful standard prac-tice that removes unwanted high frequency elements superimposed {{on top of the}} <b>basic</b> shock <b>pulse</b> shape. Standard test methods for generating cushion curves generally do not require reporting what filter was used, or whether the filter influenced the resulting cushion curve information. This paper demonstrates quantitatively how shock pulse filtering influences cushion curves and cushion thickness, which in turn affects logistics costs...|$|R
