A small minority of homes are not in the main centre but instead along the south-eastward leading street and these are locally known as Muchelney Ham. Many of the homes have agricultural farms or smallholdings, and some of the fields are orchards.

40|$|The shelter {{situation}} Rescue shelters {{are considered}} a place where cats are kept temporarily until the legal owner or a new guardian is found or they are euthanased. The ABCD states clearly that keeping cats in shelter situa-tions should be avoided as far as possible. Cats have evolved to become solitary territorial predators. The situation in a rescue shelter is not conducive to their wellbeing due to the progressive accumulation of infectious disease agents and the high animal density. The crowding stress of the shelter environment – noise, odour and sight of other cats, potential aggression – is immunosuppressive. Therefore, we at the ABCD strongly recommend that a rescue shelter should be a place of last option – with attempts being made to rehome unwanted cats, and especially kittens, without recourse to a shelter. However, where nec-essary, good practice should be adopted to minimise the side effects. The special situations in <b>boarding</b> <b>catteries</b> (a place where cats are put temporarily while their guardians are on vacation or business), multicat pet households (where people intentionally keep more than one pet cat), cat sanctuaries (where rescued cats are kept until they die) and breeding catteries (where cats are intentionally bred) are not con-sidered in these guidelines, although aspects of hygiene will also be applicable to these scenarios. In shelter situations, infectious diseases spread frequently and are difficult to prevent for the following reasons: < According to regional situations, in some or even many cases all incoming cats must be accepted. < Cats may be persistently/latently infected with infectious agents. < High turnover of cats reside alongside long-term residents. < Often a no-kill policy is maintained. < Concurrent factors like stress, poor nutrition, etc, facilitate spread of infectious agents and development of disease. < Shelters are often short of money, resulting in crowding, inadequate hygiene and vaccination measures, and lack of testing for infectious diseases. < Persons who work in shelters are highly motivated but often untrained in hygiene and disease management (the veterinary surgeon is often responsible for such training) ...|$|R
