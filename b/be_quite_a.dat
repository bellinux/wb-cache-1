5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and {{stepped up to}} the Western League. This proved to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance for a home game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but that was their highest placing until 1969–70 when they finished as runners-up.|$|E
5|$|Moscovium is {{predicted}} to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 in the periodic table, below bismuth. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5: {{it is very difficult}} to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect, so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that moscovium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1/2 electrons, as the binding energy of the lone 7p3/2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1/2 electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and moscovium(I) is likely to show some unique properties, probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I). Because of spin-orbit coupling, flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, moscovium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Mc+ will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving moscovium some alkali metal character. However, the Mc3+ cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3+. The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and moscovium may be considered to have only three valence electrons. Moscovium would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> reactive metal, with a standard reduction potential of −1.5V for the Mc+/Mc couple.|$|E

25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} operating efficiency by reducing train length {{and the number}} of axles per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. Another benefit was created by permanently joining five cars in a set. This reduced the number of couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E

25|$|Prevalence {{estimates}} {{place the}} number of people with PBA between 1.5 and 2million in the United States alone, which would be less than 1% of the U.S. population even at {{the high end of the}} estimate. Some argue that the number is probably higher and that clinicians underdiagnose PBA. However, the prevalence estimate of 2million is based on an online survey. Self-selected computer-savvy patients in at-risk groups evaluated their own symptoms and submitted their self-diagnoses. No doctor or clinic confirmed the data. Motivation to participate could have been influenced by the presence of symptoms, which would have skewed the results. The actual prevalence could very well <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit lower than estimated.|$|E
25|$|The litas was {{established}} at {{a value of}} 10 litų = 1US dollar and was subdivided into 100 centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the litas appeared to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the Lithuanian economy. One litas was covered by 0.150462grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 litas, backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities. It was required {{that at least one}} third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai, falling to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of the MADS-box family has been extensively studied. These genes are present even in pteridophytes, but the spread and diversity is many times higher in angiosperms. There appears to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> bit of pattern into how this family has evolved. Consider the {{evolution of}} the C-region gene AGAMOUS (AG). It is expressed in today's flowers in the stamens, and the carpel, which are reproductive organs. It's ancestor in gymnosperms also has the same expression pattern. Here, it is expressed in the strobili, an organ that produces pollens or ovules. Similarly, the B-genes' (AP3 and PI) ancestors are expressed only in the male organs in gymnosperms. Their descendants in the modern angiosperms also are expressed only in the stamens, the male reproductive organ. Thus, the same, then-existing components were used by the plants in a novel manner to generate the first flower. This is a recurring pattern in evolution.|$|E

500|$|To {{depict the}} supernatural {{aspects of the}} show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. While various {{companies}} were contracted for the Los Angeles-based production of the pilot episode, subsequent episodes being filmed in Vancouver required a new crew to be hired. The company Entity FX performed the visual effects for the pilot episode, with Ivan Hayden taking over as visual effects supervisor {{for the rest of}} the season. The crew was required to design all of the external airplane shots in [...] "Phantom Traveler" [...] from scratch using computer-generated imagery (CGI). As well, they created a time-manipulation effect for the titular villain in [...] "Bloody Mary" [...] by altering the capture frame rate of the camera. Randy Shymkiw acted as special effects supervisor, and the department found the episode [...] "Asylum" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> challenge because one scene has the vengeful spirit collapse into dust.

500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri muses that Valhalla must {{be quite}} crowded, to which High {{responds}} {{by stating that}} Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite {{the large amount of}} inhabitants, and then quotes Grímnismál stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says that Odin seems to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> powerful lord, as he controls quite a big army, but he yet wonders how the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking. High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when mealtime comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes that, [...] "right at the beginning, when the gods were settling" [...] they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla. The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, where the mistletoe that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.|$|E
500|$|Steph {{initially}} reacted angrily {{towards her}} diagnosis, which Pinder confirmed was not uncommon, explaining: [...] "The character {{is going through}} stages that someone with epilepsy is likely to go through. Teenagers can have terrible trouble {{coming to terms with}} epilepsy {{at a time when they}} have a lot of other difficult things to deal with. It can also <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> blow to their independence." [...] Writing for the Sunday Mail, Steve Hendry assessed that the plot would serve to [...] "bring the arrogant and often spiteful Steph down a peg or two", humbling her. Stenson agreed that Steph's epilepsy would make her [...] "more understanding", inspiring thoughtfulness towards others, as opposed to her former rejection of those different to her. However, she observed that the condition may also serve to worsen her behaviour towards [...] "a chosen few." [...] The character's epilepsy was further explored in the Hollyoaks spin-off , in which Steph has a seizure and believes she is possessed by a spirit, almost causing her to drown.|$|E
500|$|Being an entomologist, {{he has a}} {{wide and}} varied {{knowledge}} of insects, which he applies to his investigations. This has led to his nickname, [...] "The Bug Man". In {{the beginning of the}} show, he was referred as [...] "Gruesome Grissom" [...] for his sometimes morbid fascination with the more bizarre aspects of man and nature. Grissom keeps a variety of specimens in his office, including a radiated fetal pig, a tarantula, and a two-headed scorpion. He also has a bulletin board that looks like a fish on which unsolved cases go: [...] "the ones that got away". Occasionally, he keeps evidence from closed cases (such as the models created by [...] "The Miniature Killer"). In , CSI newcomer Michael Keppler takes a look around Grissom's office and observes that he must <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> freak.

500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes time to really find its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E

500|$|She began {{performing}} at age six {{when she was}} cast in the lead singing role of [...] "Little Star" [...] in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents {{to tell them that}} their daughter was [...] "pitch perfect". The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; Hayley soon after learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: [...] "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I was Tiny Tim, so I got to <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing." [...] Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour. She won a talent quest in her first year (Year 9) at Burnside High School, which she attended from 2000 to 2003.|$|E
