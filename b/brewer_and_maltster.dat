50|$|Grant {{was the son}} of James Brighton Grant, a <b>brewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>maltster</b> from Kettleburgh in Suffolk who {{had been}} imprisoned for non-payment of Church Rates. He was educated at the City of London School, worked as a journalist, and was called to the bar in 1877 at the Middle Temple, after which he practised on the North Eastern Circuit.|$|E
50|$|Sittig {{had several}} {{successful}} {{years at the}} company before leaving to co-publish the weekly The Business Guide. He then worked {{with a series of}} German-centric publications, including the Freie Presse, the Handels-Zeitung, German American Miller, and Deutsche Industrie. Later in his life he edited the <b>Brewer</b> <b>and</b> <b>Maltster,</b> a brewing trade journal. In 1876, Sittig was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Republican, serving a two-year term. In 1884, he was again elected to the house for another two-year term. During this second term, Sittig gained notoriety as the vote that broke a 102-102 stalemate in the house concerning the re-election of John A. Logan as a U.S. Senator.|$|E
5000|$|An EBC Symposium is {{organised}} on {{a specific}} technical subject of interest to <b>brewers</b> <b>and</b> <b>maltsters</b> usually every two years (in-between congress years). In September 2010, a highly acclaimed EBC hop symposium {{took place at the}} Deutsches Hopfenmuseum in Wolnzach / Hallertau (Germany). A total of 131 delegates registered for this event. [...] "From Chiller to Filler", a workshop type symposium on cold-bloc management, fermentation, lagering, filtration and related issues was held in Copenhagen in September 2012 (see EBC symposium website). Delegates expressed themselves positively in terms of structure, contents and organisation of this event.|$|R
5000|$|Wethered was {{the eldest}} son of Owen Wethered of Great Marlow and his wife Anne Peel, a {{daughter}} of the Rev. Giles Haworth Peel, of the Grotto, Basildon, Berkshire. His grandfather, who died in 1854, had been vicar of Ince in Cheshire and {{was the son of}} Jonathan Peel, of Accrington, a younger brother of Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, so was a first cousin of the British Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. His father was said to be [...] "descended from the well-known family of that name, so long in residence at Ashlyns, Great Berkhamsted," [...] and first recorded there in 1431. They had been <b>brewers</b> <b>and</b> <b>maltsters</b> at Marlow since the middle of the 18th century. The young Wethered was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was a contemporary of Lewis Carroll. In the author's diaries a note reading [...] "Harvey sang too, and Wethered" [...] refers either to him or to his younger brother Owen Peel Wethered (1837-1908).|$|R
5000|$|Aged 29, Tetley married Hannah Carbutt on 12 March 1808 at Sheffield Parish Church. Carbutt {{was from}} an {{affluent}} family which included former Mayors of York and Leeds. [...] They settled {{in a house}} on Park Square in Leeds. In 1822, aged 44, Tetley leased William Sykes' Brewery in Salem Place, Hunslet. [...] Unusually for the time, Tetley head hunted staff, looking only for the most skilled <b>brewers</b> <b>and</b> <b>maltsters</b> {{from as far away}} as Manchester. Once the brewery was established it became the second largest in Leeds and had an estimated value of £22, while Robert Arthington's brewery held an estimated value of £100. [...] Following the passing of the Beer House Act of 1830, Tetley's business grew and his recently acquired ale houses opened between 4 am and 10 pm. The temperance movement approved beer as a temperate alternative to spirits, which led to the growth of many small breweries. When Tetley's father William Tetley died in 1834, Joshua received (according to William's 1820 will) £450 worth of his assets, much of which was invested in the Tetley business.|$|R
50|$|In 1640, Jeffrey Ward {{operated}} as a <b>brewer</b> <b>and</b> a <b>maltster</b> in Church Plain, Great Yarmouth, {{on a site}} {{which was}} to become The Falcon Brewery. His son, who died in 1690, and his grandson Robert Ward, who died in 1741 managed the business in succession. Ward's widow took their son-in-law John Laycon in partnership. Lacon became the sole owner of the brewery on her death in 1760 and thus Lacons Brewery was formed. By 1810's the business owned three maltings, two breweries and 45 tied houses in Great Yarmouth.|$|R
50|$|The maltings and brewery are {{documented}} in the Letheringsett Laviles manor court book which records the manufacturers living in Letheringsett. John Brereton, John Priest and Henry Hagon were the first three <b>maltsters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brewers</b> from before 1721 to 1780.|$|R
40|$|Premature yeast {{flocculation}} (PYF) is a sporadic problem encountered during industrial brewing fermentations. Current hypothesis {{states that}} factors, thought to arise from fungal {{infection of the}} barley in the field and/or the malt in the maltings cause yeast to flocculate prematurely and/or heavily before the depletion of the sugars in the wort. This results in poorly attenuated worts, with higher residual extract and lower ABV, flavor abnormalities (i. e. diacetyl, SO 2), lower carbonation levels, disruption of process cycle times and potential issues with the re-use of the yeast in subsequent fermentations. Consequently, PYF generates significant financial and logistical problems both to the <b>brewer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>maltster.</b> In {{the current study a}} small-scale fermentation assay was developed and optimized to predict the PYF potential of malts, as well as to investigate the importance of yeast strain in the incidence and severity of the phenomenon. Furthermore, the impacts of the PYF factor(s) (i. e. arabinoxylans, antimicrobial peptides) on yeast fermentation performance and metabolite uptake were also studied, whilst the Biolog detection system was investigated as a potential rapid tool which to detect PYF. The results obtained suggested that our in-house assay can be successfully used to predict the PYF potential of malts 69 or 40 h post-pitching depending upon the yeast strain used. Whilst ale yeasts were not found susceptible to PYF, lager yeasts exhibited different degrees of susceptibility even to the same PYF factor(s). More specifically, the more flocculent lager yeast SMA was found to be more susceptible than the medium flocculent lager yeast W 34 / 70. However, interestingly, the fermentation performance of a PYF+ wort could be significantly improved by using a non-flocculent and relatively insensitive to PYF lager yeast. It was also shown that worts with lower amount of glucose and maltose could be responsible for poor fermentation profiles and/or heavy PYF as well as elevated residual sugars and lower fermentability. The observation that linoleic acid (6 mg. l- 1) exacerbated PYF (P = 0. 047) and made its detection more rapid was found to be contrary to the “titration hypothesis” (Axcell et al., 2000) which hypothesized that the addition of fatty acids might “titrate” out antimicrobial peptides so that they can no longer bind to the yeast cells. High gravity fermentations with worts inducing PYF did not have a significant effect (P > 0. 05) on yeast physiological characteristics or fermentation performance suggesting that the PYF+ sample used in this study was inducing PYF though the ‘bridging’ polysaccharide mechanism rather than through the antimicrobial peptides. The Biolog system can be used for the metabolic characterization of different flocculence lager yeasts incubated in different fermentation media, whilst wort composition had a significant effect in redox reduction reactions...|$|R
50|$|In 1705, Thomas Lister, {{a farmer}} <b>and</b> <b>maltster,</b> of Bingley, Yorkshire, England, married Hannah, the {{daughter}} of a yeoman (an independent small farmer). They joined the Society of Friends, becoming Quakers, as were most of their descendants. They had a son, Joseph, who left Yorkshire in about 1720 to become a tobacconist in Aldersgate Street in the City of London.|$|R

25|$|In general, none {{of these}} early malts would have been well {{shielded}} from the smoke involved in the kilning process, and consequently, early beers {{would have had a}} smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that <b>maltsters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brewers</b> constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer.|$|R
