5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the <b>bog</b> turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating <b>bog</b> turtles indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the <b>bog</b> turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy <b>bog</b> turtles into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed <b>bog</b> turtles in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Mulvihill {{continued}} {{breeding and}} promoting the ponies, and in 2002, the breed was recognised by the Irish Government as the Irish Heritage Pony. The same year, the Kerry <b>Bog</b> Pony Society was formed. Also in 2002, Americans {{became interested in}} the breed, and the first ponies were exported from Ireland to the US in 2003, to a farm in Ohio. In 2005, the American Kerry <b>Bog</b> Pony Society was founded, with 11 initial registrants. Also in 2005, the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission recognised the Kerry <b>Bog</b> Pony as an official breed; the following year, the Irish Horse Board issued the first equine passports for members of the breed. Until 2009, there was an exception in place that allowed unrelated ponies that met the physical breed standards to be bred as Kerry <b>Bog</b> Ponies, with the offspring being registered and given passports certifying them as purebred Kerry <b>Bog</b> Ponies. This was in part due to a concern of inbreeding among the small number of ponies initially registered. Kerry <b>Bog</b> Ponies were also part of the Irish Rural Environment Protection Scheme (closed to new applicants in 2009), which financially rewarded farmers for using environmentally-friendly methods. The Kerry <b>Bog</b> Village, an open-air museum on the Ring of Kerry is one location that breeds and houses part of the existing Kerry <b>Bog</b> Pony population.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bog</b> turtle is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins its search for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the <b>bog</b> turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the <b>bog</b> turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the <b>bog</b> turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the <b>bog</b> turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the <b>bog</b> turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E

25|$|More than 90% of the <b>bogs</b> in England {{have been}} damaged or destroyed. A handful of <b>bogs</b> have been {{preserved}} through government buyouts of peat-mining interests. Over longer time scales, however, some parts of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales have seen expansion of <b>bogs,</b> particularly blanket <b>bogs,</b> in response to deforestation and abandonment of agricultural land.|$|R
5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the <b>bog</b> turtle. The <b>bog</b> turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the <b>bog</b> turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{rebounding}} of <b>bog</b> turtle colonies {{depends on}} private intervention. Population monitoring involves meticulous land surveys over vast countrysides. In addition to surveying land visually, remote sensing {{has been used}} to biologically classify a wetland as either suitable or unsuitable for a <b>bog</b> turtle colony. This allows for comparisons to be made between known areas of <b>bog</b> turtle success and potential areas of future habitation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bog</b> turtles are {{omnivorous}} and eat {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a <b>bog</b> turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. <b>Bog</b> turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
5000|$|North America: A {{region of}} {{peatland}} extends from Alaska {{in the west}} to the coast of the Atlantic in the east, and is comparable in size to that of West Siberia. A zone of domed raised <b>bogs</b> adjoins the zones of palsa <b>bogs</b> and string fens. In the direction of descent towards the ocean, blanket <b>bogs</b> occur east of Hudson Bay.

5|$|Lindow Moss is a peat <b>bog</b> in Lindow, {{an area of}} Wilmslow, Cheshire, {{which has}} been used as common land since the medieval period. It formed after the last ice age, one of many such peat bogs in {{north-east}} Cheshire and the Mersey basin that formed in hollows caused by melting ice. Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity. Once covering over , the <b>bog</b> has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the <b>bog</b> was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised. Lindow Moss is a lowland raised mire; this type of peat <b>bog</b> often produces the best preserved <b>bog</b> bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27bodies to be recovered from such areas.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the <b>bog</b> turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because <b>bog</b> turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the <b>bog</b> turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal <b>bog</b> turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate <b>bog</b> turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{variations}} in mitochondrial DNA indicate {{low levels of}} genetic divergence among <b>bog</b> turtle colonies. This is unusual in species such as the <b>bog</b> turtle, which have fragmented distributions and exist in small isolated groups (fewer than 50 individuals in <b>bog</b> turtle colonies). These conditions limit gene flow, typically leading to divergence between isolated groups. Data indicate that the <b>bog</b> turtle suffered dramatic reductions in numbers – a population bottleneck – as colonies were forced south {{in the face of}} glaciation. Receding glaciers led to the relatively recent post-Pleistocene expansion, as the <b>bog</b> turtles moved back into their former northern range. This recent colonization from a relatively limited southern population may account for the reduction of genetic diversity. The northern and southern populations are at present genetically isolated, likely as a consequence of farming and habitat destruction in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.|$|E

40|$|The {{member states}} of the European Community are obliged to monitor the {{development}} of conservation status of natural habitats protected by the Habitats Directive. In Denmark a comprehensive programme on nature monitoring, called NOVANA, was launched in 2004. The monitoring programme is developed by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI). Raised <b>bogs</b> {{are one of the}} natural habitats included in the programme. This master thesis investigates how the nature monitoring of raised <b>bogs</b> is organized in Denmark. Based on raised bogs’ unique ecology, it is assessed whether NERI’s approach to monitor raised <b>bogs</b> is adequate. The thesis focuses on application of methods to monitor vegetation ecology. As a part of this research project, two raised <b>bogs,</b> Skidendam and Holmegårds Mose, have been subjected to nature monitoring during autumn 2004. Similar nature monitoring was conducted in both <b>bogs</b> in 1987 and 1995. In order to examine the development of conservation status of the <b>bogs</b> over the time span, the results from the three sets of data are compared. The thesis takes in theories on ecology of raised <b>bogs,</b> theories on organization of nature monitoring and theories on aggregation of monitoring data. It is concluded that the conservation status of Skidendam is favourable; that the conservation status of Holmegårds Mose is unfavourable. Moreover, it is concluded that NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of raised <b>bogs</b> is inadequate. NERI’s approach to nature monitoring of raised <b>bogs</b> is based on an insufficient understanding of the special hydrological and morphological structure of raised <b>bogs.</b> This has resulted in the use of inappropriate criteria for favourable conservation status of raised <b>bogs.</b> NERI’s approach to nature monitoring is organized against these criteria. Furthermore, the placement of sample plots to monitor vegetation ecology do not consider the inhomogeneous structure of raised bogs’ vegetation. Hence, the sampling design is unsuitable for raised <b>bogs...</b>|$|R
