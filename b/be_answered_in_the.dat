500|$|The (deterministic) {{decision}} tree complexity of determining a graph property {{is the number}} of questions of the form [...] "Is there an edge between vertex [...] and vertex ?" [...] that have to <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> worst case to determine whether a graph has a particular property. That is, it is the minimum height of a boolean {{decision tree}} for the problem. There are [...] possible questions to be asked. Therefore, any graph property can be determined with at most [...] questions. It is also possible to define random and quantum decision tree complexity of a property, the expected number of questions (for a worst case input) that a randomized or quantum algorithm needs to have answered in order to correctly determine whether the given graph has the property.|$|E
500|$|Aspects of [...] "The Big Bang" [...] were {{outlined}} by lead writer {{and executive producer}} Steven Moffat as he planned the arc of the series. Moffat stated he left room to improvise on the story and {{was pleased with the}} result, describing it as [...] "mad" [...] and [...] "amazing". Moffat stated that the title [...] "The Big Bang" [...] is his favourite dirty Doctor Who joke as it is a reference to the fact that Amy and Rory conceive their child on the TARDIS that night, as revealed in the next series in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". Gillan described Rory's vigil for Amy as the [...] "ultimate romantic gesture" [...] which showed how much he loved Amy, and was where Amy realised how much she loved him. Moffat thought that standing guard for two thousand years would make up for shooting her. Moffat had always intended for Amy and Rory to get married [...] "from the off". Moffat described the conclusion as the story of how Amy has been changed by the Doctor and the Doctor's success at restoring her spirit to the girl he first met, believing that a man could drop out of the sky and [...] "fix everything". However, he did not return for her as he had promised and she grew believing that he was a liar and could not be trusted; Amy returns to her original belief when she stands up at her wedding and proclaims that the Doctor is real and that he will arrive. Though the episode {{is the end of the}} series, Moffat left questions to <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next series, including the mystery of River Song's identity and the [...] "Silence" [...] which appeared to cause the TARDIS to blow up.|$|E
2500|$|As {{seen in this}} example, simply {{answering}} [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] {{does not}} suffice {{as a response to}} the question. This question must <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "A" [...] or [...] "not A" [...] form.|$|E
30|$|General {{questions}} of which <b>the</b> first <b>is</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> positive <b>in</b> most concrete cases, and <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>in</b> many cases, {{as we shall}} see, are the following.|$|R
25|$|If all {{applicable}} special issues <b>were</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, {{then the}} result would be an automatic death sentence; if any special issue <b>was</b> not <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, the sentence would be life imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|If {{all three}} {{questions}} <b>are</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, {{the criteria for}} a mortal sin have been met. If any one of <b>the</b> three questions <b>are</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative, only the criteria for a venial sin have been met. In cases of doubt regarding any of these three questions, {{it is assumed that}} the criteria for a mortal sin were not met.|$|R
2500|$|Here, {{the verb}} sleep, {{along with its}} {{complement}} is [...] "A", and it is reduplicated after the negative. Like A-not-A questions in Mandarin, A-not-A questions in Korean must also <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "A" [...] or [...] "Not A" [...] form. One cannot answer just [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] in response to A-not-A questions in Korean.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{successful}} college achievements, whether Flutie {{was too small}} to play professional football was uncertain. When asked on television [...] "Can a guy who's five-foot-nine, 175 pounds make it in the pros?", he answered [...] "Yes, he can. But it's a matter of ability and not size. I feel I can play; I don't know for sure, and those questions will <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{renormalization}} group concept {{associated with}} the first question predates the concept {{associated with the}} second question. Certainly, if one were {{in possession of a}} good answer to the second question, the first question could also <b>be</b> <b>answered.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> absence of a good answer to the second question, one may wonder why any specific choice of parameters and their cutoff dependence could secure cutoff independence of all observables [...] with finite scales [...]|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of each episode, off-camera announcer Rod Roddy gives {{a brief description of the}} convoluted storyline and remarks, [...] "Confused? You won't be, after this week's episode of...Soap." [...] At the end of each episode, he asks a series of life-or-death questions in a deliberately deadpan style—"Will Jessica discover Chester's affair? Will Benson discover Chester's affair? Will Benson care?" [...] and concludes each episode with the trademark line, [...] "These questions—and many others—will <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next episode of...Soap." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{test was}} {{introduced}} by Turing in his paper, [...] "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", while working at the University of Manchester (Turing, 1950; p.460). It opens with the words: [...] "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think? Because [...] "thinking" [...] is difficult to define, Turing chooses to [...] "replace the question by another, which {{is closely related to}} it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words." [...] Turing's new question is: [...] "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?" [...] This question, Turing believed, is one that can actually <b>be</b> <b>answered.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that [...] "machines can think".|$|E
60|$|Hark! the {{children}} were waiting; she must go and teach. The letter, Geoffrey's dear letter, could <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. So she thrust it in her breast with the other, but closer to her heart, and went.|$|E

60|$|This {{question}} {{he has asked}} me every day since the first day Mr. Pike began cudgelling his brains over it.

6000|$|That {{letter was}} {{altogether}} in a wrong tone--that he must own. A heartless man-of-the-world tone {{was what the}} juncture required.

60|$|Carroll {{decided that}} the {{question}} could only <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> negative; {{but he had no}} intention of disputing his comrade's point of view. In the first place, this would probably only make Vane more determined or ruffle his temper; and in the second Carroll, who felt very dubious about the prospect of working the cedar profitably, was neither a covetous nor an ambitious person, which was, perhaps, on the whole, fortunate for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{that is a}} {{question}} of pure credibility. It is possible that I may {{be in a position to}} prove to the satisfaction of the bench that you did use them, and many others of an equally offensive character. Mr. Wyatt naturally resented such language, which you had no more right to address to him than you would have to address to me. If a magistrate forgets his position, and abuses a prisoner in the language of a fish-fag, he must expect to <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way by anyone of spirit. You say that, thereupon, he became abusive and used murderous threats? Now we should like to hear a little more about this. First of all, let us hear the abuse, will you? Tell the court, if you please, Mr. Faulkner, what were the abusive expressions," [...] he added.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> first {{question}} <b>was</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, as the Parliament's jurisdiction over [...] "Bankruptcy and Insolvency" [...] arose from s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867. As the Board noted: ...|$|R

60|$|The {{man turned}} {{his back to the}} window and gazed at the western sky with a wealth of unuttered and unutterable exultation in his heart. Far off a rooster gave a long, clear blast--would it <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barn? Yes; some wakeful ear had caught it, and now came the answer, but faint, muffled and drowsy. The dog at his feet whined uneasily as if suspecting {{something}} wrong. The wind from the south was full of the wonderful odor of springing grass, warm, brown earth, and oozing sap. Overhead, to the west, the stars were shining in the cloudless sky, dimmed a little in brightness by the faint silvery veil of moisture in the air. The man's soul grew very tender as he stood waiting for his bride. He was rough, illiterate, yet there was something fine about him after all, a kind of simplicity and a gigantic, leonine tenderness.|$|E
60|$|The enquirer would next {{come to the}} {{important}} point, whether man tends to increase at so rapid a rate, as to lead to occasional severe struggles for existence, and consequently to beneficial variations, whether in body or mind, being preserved, and injurious ones eliminated. Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace each other, so that some finally become extinct? We shall see that all these questions, as indeed is obvious in respect to most of them, must <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, {{in the same manner}} as with the lower animals. But the several considerations just referred to may be conveniently deferred for a time; and we will first see how far the bodily structure of man shows traces, more or less plain, of his descent from some lower form. In the two succeeding chapters the mental powers of man, in comparison with those of the lower animals, will be considered.|$|E
60|$|There is {{no fault}} {{to be found}} with Mr. Darwin's method, then; but it is another {{question}} whether he has fulfilled all the conditions imposed by that method. Is it satisfactorily proved, in fact, that species may be originated by selection? {{that there is such}} a thing as natural selection? that none of the phenomena exhibited by species are inconsistent with the origin of species in this way? If these questions can <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative, Mr. Darwin's view steps out of the rank of hypotheses into those of proved theories; but, so long as the evidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that affirmation, so long, to our minds, must the new doctrine be content to remain among the former--an extremely valuable, and in the highest degree probable, doctrine, indeed the only extant hypothesis which is worth anything in a scientific point of view; but still a hypothesis, and not yet the theory of species.|$|E
