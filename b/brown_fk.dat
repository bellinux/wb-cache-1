5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>FK,</b> {{also called}} Kipper Brown, Chocolate <b>Brown</b> <b>FK,</b> and C.I. Food Brown 1, is a brown mixture of six {{synthetic}} azo dyes, with addition of sodium chloride, and/or sodium sulfate. It is very soluble in water. Its CAS number is [...] When {{used as a}} food dye, its E number is E154.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{a review}} by the European Food Safety Authority {{concluded}} that <b>Brown</b> <b>FK</b> was no longer used and the Authority could not conclude on {{the safety of the}} substance due to the deficiencies in the available toxicity data. Therefore, it should not be included in the Union list of approved food additives.|$|E
5000|$|The dyeing of kippers was {{introduced}} as an economy measure in the First World War by avoiding {{the need for}} the long smoking processes. This allowed the kippers to be sold quickly, easily and for a substantially greater profit. Kippers were originally dyed using a coal tar dye called <b>Brown</b> <b>FK</b> (the FK is an abbreviation of [...] "For Kippers"), Kipper Brown or Kipper Dye. Today, kippers are usually brine dyed using a natural annato dye, giving the fish a deeper orange/yellow colour. European Community legislation limits the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of <b>Brown</b> <b>FK</b> to 0.15 mg/kg. Not all fish caught are suitable for the dyeing process, with mature fish more readily sought, because the density of their flesh improves the absorption of the dye. An orange kipper is a kipper that has been dyed orange.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The heat and light stabilities of the 16 UK-permitted synthetic food colouring matters were investigated in aqueous solution. A specially constructed light box was used to provide exaggerated lighting conditions with fan-cooling of the samples. Comparison of stability has been {{made on the basis}} of the shape of the entire decay curve rather than by simple comparison of loss after a fixed degradation period. Indigo carmine and erythrosine showed little light stability, while ponceau 4 R, chocolate brown HT and <b>brown</b> <b>FK</b> all showed fairly mediocre stability. The thermal stabilities of chocolate brown HT, ponceau 4 R and, most especially, indigo carmine, all proved poor. A new polarographic peak which appeared during the thermal degradation of red 2 G was shown to be due to the deacetylation product, red lOB. Identification was made by polarographic and chromatographic (hplc) comparison with a red lOB standard. A method for the analysis of red 2 G and red lOB present in the same solution was developed using differential pulse polarography. This method included the use of tetrapheny 1 phosphonium chloride to produce a differential shift 1 n the E 1 / 2 values of the respective colouring matters, and so increase the resolution of their polarographic peaks. Hplc analysis was conducted using reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography. A temperature control system was devised for the hplc column (water jacket) which was shown to improve the resolution and reproducibility of retention of the chromatographic peaks. An eluent comprising 63 / 37 / 0. 25 v/v/w methano 1 /water/cetrimide, an SAS-Hypersil packing and thermos tatting at 40 Â°C were found to be suitable for most of the thermal degradation solutions. A series of 13 chromatograms of thermally degraded solutions were produced under these conditions for comparative purposes. An unexpectedly large number of decay product chromatographic peaks were observed for some food colours. Whereas thermally degraded ponceau 4 R only showed four peaks, most colours showed up to about ten peaks, and a few, e. g. amaranth, green S and sunset yellow FCF showed a dozen or more. Tentative identifications were made of some products from azo colours by reference to standard phenols and aromatic amines. Growth curves were plotted by hplc for a number of the products from the thermal degradation of yellow 2 G. Polarographic and/or chromatographic evidence clearly showed that the thermal degradations of yellow 2 G and of red 2 G were not single step, single pathway processes. The large number of products observed by hplc indicate that this is true of most of the colours. Moreover, thermal degradation pathways need not be the same as photodegradation pathways. This has been shown simply for ponceau 4 R by comparison of UV spectra. Qualitative analysis linked to hplc was also investigated. The construction of UV spectra of decay products by repeated chromatography at different detection wavelengths proved to be quite straightforward. It was found that the use of diazotisation as a pre-column reaction for the differentiation of aromatic amines from phenolic analogues was not suitable: the acidic and strongly ionic conditions employed for diazotisation disrupted the chromatographic ion-pair mechanism beyond correction. Use of fluorescamine proved rapid and simple for sulphanilic acid, but no significant reaction occurred in the aase of naphthionic acid. A method was devised for the analysis of phenol- 4 -sulphonic acid and sulphanilic acid when chromatographically unresolved by comparison of peak absorbance at two wavelengths. Finally, preliminary work was carried out to find how the dependence of retention on eluent composition was affected by the presence of specific functional groups in the analyte. This was seen as of particular application where functional group (e. g. carboxylate) analysis was required for decay products present in low concentration...|$|E
