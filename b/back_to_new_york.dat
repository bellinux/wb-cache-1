5000|$|The lyrics reach <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> own Rakim: dense battle rhymes potent with metaphors. Each Wu MC links his rhymes {{to crime}} and violence, {{allowing}} his preoccupations to surface subtly and indirectly, rather than spouting off overt gangsta-isms designed to shock ... The hood {{imagery of the}} lyrics is utterly pervasive and uncompromising, immersing the listener in a foreign land {{smack in the middle}} of <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> There is no celebration here, and little hope. Gavin Mueller ...|$|R

50|$|The stereotypical {{views about}} blacks {{imparted}} <b>to</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Yorks</b> Mike Mizanin by his uncle offended Coral Smith and Nicole Mitsch when he related them, {{and they tried}} to educate him on African American culture.

Arnold wrote out passes for André {{so that he would}} be able to pass through the lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E
