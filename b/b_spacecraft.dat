At this time, we began to see large-scale differences in the morphology and total intensity between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed with SECCHI-COR 2 on STEREO-A and B. Due to the effects of the Thomson scattering geometry, the intensity of an observed CME is dependent on the angle it makes with the observed plane of the sky. From the intensity images, we can calculate the integrated line of sight electron density and mass.

The apogee reached the Moon's orbit. On December 15, 2006, {{on the fifth}} orbit, the pair swung by the Moon for a gravity assist. Because the two spacecraft were in slightly different orbits, the [...] "ahead" [...] (A) spacecraft was ejected to a heliocentric orbit inside Earth's orbit while the [...] "behind" [...] (<b>B)</b> <b>spacecraft</b> remained temporarily in a high Earth orbit. The <b>B</b> <b>spacecraft</b> encountered the Moon again on the same orbital revolution on January 21, 2007, being ejected from Earth orbit {{in the opposite direction}} from spacecraft A. Spacecraft B entered a heliocentric orbit outside the Earth's orbit. Spacecraft A will take 347 days to complete one revolution of the Sun and Spacecraft B will take 387 days. The A spacecraft/Sun/Earth angle will increase at 21.650 degree/year. The B spacecraft/Sun/Earth angle will change −21.999 degrees per year. Given that the length of Earth's orbit is around 940 million kilometres, both craft have an average speed, in a rotating geocentric frame of reference in which the sun is always in the same direction, of about 1.8 km/s, but the speed varies considerably depending on how close they are to their respective aphelion or perihelion (as well as on the position of Earth). Their current locations are shown here.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We study {{longitudinal}} {{properties of}} SEP distribution during the proton events of 2012 {{using data from}} SOHO, STEREO-A and <b>B</b> <b>spacecrafts</b> located in different points in the heliosphere. Totally in 2012 near the Earth were registered six proton events by pairs in January, March and May. The parent flares of the events on January 23 and 27, May 17 with coordinates of N 28 W 36, N 27 W 71 and N 11 W 76 were well connected to the Earth by magnetic field lines and showed a promt proton arrival. Increasing rate and maximum values of proton intensity near the Earth were determined by duration and intensity of the particle injection into the magnetic field line. Much less and delayed proton enhancements observed by STEREO A and STEREO-B spacecrafts indicating effective cross-field propagation of SEP. The proton event of March 7, 2012 is the largest one recorded {{so far in the}} 24 th solar cycle. Because its two parent solar flares were located at N 17 E 27 and N 22 E 12 the maximum of proton intensity was delayed and depressed near the Earth. The event of March 7, 2012 was better observed by STEREO-B than STEREO-A. Initial phase of these six proton events corresponds to our expectations basing on the East-West effect. During the late decay phase the resevoir effect was observed only under quite solar wind conditionson on 25 - 28 (140 - 144) days of 2012 by STEREO-B (SOHO) and disturbed conditions by SOHO (STEREO-A).

40|$|During {{relatively}} quiet solar conditions throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 2007, the SECCHI HI 2 white-light telescope on the STEREO <b>B</b> solar-orbiting <b>spacecraft</b> observed a succession of wave fronts sweeping past Earth. We have compared these heliospheric images with in situ plasma and magnetic field measurements obtained by near-Earth spacecraft, and we have found a near perfect association between the occurrence of these waves and the arrival of density enhancements at the leading edges of high-speed solar wind streams. Virtually all of the strong corotating interaction regions are accompanied by large-scale waves, and the low-density regions between them lack such waves. Because the Sun was dominated by long-lived coronal holes and recurrent solar wind streams during this interval, there is little doubt that we have been observing the compression regions that are formed at low latitude as solar rotation causes the high-speed wind from coronal holes to run into lower speed wind ahead of it.
