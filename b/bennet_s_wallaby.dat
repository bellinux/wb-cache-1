IDEA group. Group {{interaction}} {{has to be}} meticulously {{designed to}} foster an effective and efficient collaborative learning. IMS LD {{can be used to}} represent group interaction formally and then the formal model can be used to scaffold group interaction at run-time. In this chapter, we investigate the expressiveness of IMS LD in representing coordination mechanisms by using coordination theory as an analytical framework. We found that IMS LD can represent almost all the basic coordination mechanisms. We also found some hurdles to be overcome in representing certain dynamic coordination mechanisms. According to coordination theory, common coordination mechanisms can be reused in different settings. We briefly explore the feasibility of representing coordination mechanisms at a high-level of abstraction and then automatically transforming the abstract description to computational coordination mechanisms represented in IMS LD.

IMS Learning Design (IMS LD 2003) {{is an open}} {{standard}} {{that can be used}} to specify a wide range of pedagogical strategies as formal models. Such formal models then can be interpreted and executed by IMS LD compatible players to support online learning. This chapter introduces the basic knowledge required to effectively use IMS LD. First of all, we present fundamental principles behind IMS LD. Then, we briefly introduce IMS LD including the conceptual model, the information model and XML binding. Finally, how to model learning designs using IMS LD is explained through demonstrating the whole procedure to model a use case in the form of XML. Through this tutorial, we expect that the readers of this chapter can apply IMS LD to create simple learning designs and understand learning designs with sophisticated features.
