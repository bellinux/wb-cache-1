5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process that might have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> costly {{if he had not}} learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} the house would have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E

5|$|The French were {{initially}} {{unable to take}} possession of the fourth rate as {{every single one of}} the boats on board had been smashed by British shot. In the end, a French midshipman and a boatswain dived into the sea and swam to the British ship to take the formal surrender. Leander had lost a third of the crew: 35 men killed and 57 wounded, the latter including Thompson three times and Berry, who had a piece of human skull lodged in his arm. The ship had been completely dismasted except the stubs of the fore and main masts and the bowsprit, and was leaking badly from dozens of shot holes. Généreux had also been damaged, losing the mizzen topmast and almost losing the foremast as well. Losses on the crowded decks had <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> severe than on Leander, with casualties estimated at 100 killed and 188 wounded, again approximately a third of the total.|$|E

25|$|Another early {{representation}} is in a mosaic in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli (Rome, Italy), probably {{made in the}} year 682.

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} three schools mentioned, this approach, {{associated}} with Joseph Maréchal (1878–1944), Karl Rahner (1904–84), and Bernard Lonergan (1904–84), does not oppose modern philosophy wholesale, but seeks to reconcile Thomism with a Cartesian subjectivist approach to knowledge in general, and Kantian epistemology in particular. It seems {{fair to say that}} most Thomists otherwise tolerant of diverse approaches to Aquinas's thought tend to regard transcendental Thomism as having conceded too much to modern philosophy genuinely to count as a variety of Thomism, strictly speaking, and this school of thought has in any event <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> influential among theologians than among philosophers.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} major {{problems}} with this story. First, the Yongzheng Emperor's eldest surviving son, Hongshi, was only seven when Hongli was born, far too young to make the drastic choice of replacing a child of imperial birth with an outsider (and risking disgrace if not death). Second, the Yongzheng Emperor had three other princes who survived to adulthood and {{had the potential to}} ascend the throne. Indeed, since Hongshi was the son forced to commit suicide, it would have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> logical for him to be the adopted son, if any of them were.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{directly}} following the peace {{a number of}} conflicts erupted between the stadtholder and especially the States of Holland about policy. William (though a lax Calvinist himself, like his father) keenly supported the Calvinist die-hards {{in their attempts to}} force the Protestant religion on the Catholic inhabitants of the recently acquired Generality Lands (though his father had <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> tolerant of Catholic freedom of conscience). William managed to gain much popularity by this hard-line policy among the more orthodox lower classes in the Republic-proper, but especially the Holland regents thwarted the policy, because they were aware of the needless resentment it caused.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{was published in}} the Journal of the Royal United Services Institute and {{a couple of years later}} a shorter article suggested that if the Soviets themselves had used SMAs in swarms in Afghanistan their COIN operations against the Mujaheddin would have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> successful. Contemporary Western armies in Afghanistan can readily accept that swarming at the tactical and operational levels is appropriate, but the physical structure of the country rules out the currently available fighting vehicles. However, networked and swarming SMAs, again 5,000 in number, all armed with laser designators for the second echelon of conventional ground attack aircraft, would constitute force multipliers with a substantial impact.|$|E

25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} have historically {{focused on the}} textual evidence to construct the history of idolatry in Judaism, a scholarship that post-modern {{scholars have}} increasingly begun deconstructing. This biblical polemics, states Naomi Janowitz, a professor of Religious Studies, has distorted the reality of Israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in Judaism. The direct material evidence is more reliable, such as that from the archaeological sites, and {{this suggests that the}} Jewish religious practices have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> complex than what biblical polemics suggest. Judaism included images and cultic statues in the First Temple period, the Second Temple period, Late Antiquity (2nd to 8th century CE), and thereafter.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 2012, Garrett, with Jenny Macklin, the Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, {{announced}} {{an expansion of}} the Improving School Enrollment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure (SEAM), a controversial program under which parents of indigenous students in the Northern Territory can have their Centrelink payments suspended for three months if their children are not attending or enrolled in school. Though the Government claimed that the program improved indigenous school attendance, it was heavily criticised by indigenous spokespeople and academics for being excessively punitive rather than implementing other policies that have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> effective in improving school attendance, such as reinstating bilingual learning. Furthermore, the Government was criticised for being deceptive about getting a mandate for this from consultation with indigenous leaders.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{while the}} {{campaign}} on Timor had little strategic value, the Australian commandos had prevented an entire Japanese division from {{being used in}} the earlier phases of the New Guinea campaign {{while at the same time}} inflicting a disproportionate level of casualties on them. In contrast to those in Java, Ambon or Rabaul, Australian operations in Timor had <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> successful, even if it was also largely a token effort in the face of overwhelming Japanese strength. Likewise, they had proved that in favourable circumstances, unconventional operations could be both versatile and more economic than conventional operations, for which the resources were not available to the Allies at that time. Most civilian deaths were caused by Japanese reprisals against the civilian population. The civilian death toll is estimated at 40,000 to 70,000.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8Ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy {{bombardment}} by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the Hadean Earth would have <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> active {{than at any other time}} in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. Internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.|$|E
25|$|On 1 September 1715 Louis XIV died, {{bringing}} {{an end to}} {{his long}} reign that had made France the supreme power in Europe. Louis's five-year-old great-grandson and heir survived his precarious childhood and, including the eight-year regency of the Duke of Orléans, reigned in France as Louis XV {{until his death in}} 1774. Louis XIV had ended the war with some minor adjustments along France's eastern borders, but the final settlement had <b>been</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> favourable than what the Allies had offered in 1709/10: France had resisted the Allied demand of 'no peace without Spain', and Louis XIV could claim dynastic victory in Spain, thereby avoiding Habsburg encirclement. In North America France lost territory, and the French settlers were vastly outnumbered by the British in their colonies. Nevertheless, the French held on to Canada, Louisiana, Cape Breton Island, and Prince Edward Island, and thus control of the St Lawrence; thousands more remained in Acadia, and they still held the vast territory to the west between French Canada and Louisiana in the south. However, the war had stretched Louis XIV's finances beyond its limits, and France was left with a massive burden of debt. The kingdom remained inherently strong, but it could not maintain its former dominance and suffered a relative decline in military and economic terms.|$|E
