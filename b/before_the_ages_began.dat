25|$|Demographic Model: This model {{suggests}} that Scandinavia experienced a population boom just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Viking <b>Age</b> <b>began.</b> <b>The</b> agricultural {{capabilities of the}} land were not enough {{to keep up with}} the increasing population. As a result, many Scandinavians found themselves with no property and no status. To remedy this, these landless men took to piracy to obtain material wealth. The population continued to grow, and the pirates looked further and further beyond the borders of the Baltic, and eventually into all of Europe.|$|R

50|$|Antiquity is {{referred}} to as thetime period <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Middle <b>Ages</b> which <b>began</b> around 500A.D. The majorcivilizations are those of the Mediterranean region, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, and southwest Asia. Nutrition consisted of simple fresh whole foods thatwere either locally grown or transported from neighboring towns during times of crisis. Physicians and philosophers studied the effect of food on the humanbody and they generally agreed that food was important in preventing illnessand restoring health.|$|R

40|$|Multi-level {{marketing}} is a marketing approach that motivates its participants {{to promote a}} certain product among their friends. The popularity of this approach increases due to the accessibility of modern social networks, however, it existed {{in one form or}} <b>the</b> other long <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Internet <b>age</b> <b>began</b> (<b>the</b> infamous Pyramid scheme that dates back at least a century is in fact a special case of multi-level marketing). This paper lays foundations for the study of reward mechanisms in multi-level marketing within social networks. We provide a set of desired properties for such mechanisms and show that they are uniquely satisfied by geometric reward mechanisms. The resilience of mechanisms to false-name manipulations is also considered; while geometric reward mechanisms fail against such manipulations, we exhibit other mechanisms which are false-name-proof. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{people are}} indoors, running to windows to {{investigate}} the source of bright flashes in the sky still remains a common and natural response to experiencing a bright flash. Thus, although the advice to duck and cover is over half a century old, ballistic glass lacerations caused {{the majority of the}} 1000 human injuries following the Chelyabinsk meteor air burst of February 15, 2013. The dangers of viewing explosions behind window glass was known of <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Atomic <b>Age</b> <b>began,</b> being a common source of injury and death from large chemical explosions. In the accidental Halifax Explosion of 1917, an ammunition ship exploding with the force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT, and injured the eyes and faces of hundreds of people who looked out of their windows after seeing a bright flash. Every window in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, was shattered.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{types of}} spacesuits are featured. During {{the events of}} the story, which take place in the 1890s, {{standard}} diving dresses, each fitted with a 1960s-type aqualung cylinder worn backpack instead of a NASA-type life support backpack, and no lifeline or airline from outside, are used as spacesuits. The film's Victorian-era astronauts may be outfitted in diving suits with oxygen tanks, but their suits are neither pressurized nor heated or cooled. The do not wear protective gloves despite the vacuum of space and extreme cold (and heat) of the lunar surface. There are other technical issues confronting the moviemaker: even with heating and cooling provided, using rubber-lined diving suits on the Moon is impractical. Even <b>before</b> <b>the</b> space <b>age</b> <b>began,</b> <b>the</b> 1948 science fiction short story, [...] "Gentlemen, Be Seated!" [...] by Robert A. Heinlein, deftly describes the brittleness of rubber once it is exposed to the vacuum of space.|$|R
40|$|Investigations in {{wood and}} archaeological {{artefacts}} collected during rescue excavations in the drainage ditches {{on the location}} of copper-age, i. e. Eneolithic pile dwelling Založnica at Ljubljansko barje (Ljubljana Moors, Slovenia) are presented. 35 % of 1315 samples were dendrochronologically investigated. We constructed three tree-ring chronologies, two of ash-wood (Fraxinus sp.) and one of oak (Quercus sp.), and reconstructed the building activities {{that occurred in the}} period of 90 years. We found out that the activities in Založnica coincided with those in another pile dwelling Parte, which existed in the same period and was located 10 km away from Založnica. Based on radiocarbon dating, the activities in Založnica ended in the 25 th century BC. The last 40 years of the settlement delineate <b>the</b> youngest Copper <b>Age</b> settlement at Ljubljansko barje and in Slovenia. We describe how the dated wood and its relation to other archaeological artefacts helped us to place Zloznica in the Somogyvár-Vinkovci culture. This cultural classification constitutes a new interpretation of settlement activities <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Bronze <b>Age</b> <b>began</b> at Ljubljansko barje, in Slovenia in general, and in the neighbouring countries...|$|R

He {{is known to}} be an {{advocate}} for education and was enrolled in school <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> required. He <b>began</b> his education at an Agogo practice school and later attended Konongo Odumase Senior High School, where he found his passion for writing poetry. [...] His poems were later used in his songs, most notably in his song [...] "Asew." [...] He dropped out of school and later met music bigwig Daddy Lumba, gaining access into the music industry. At an early age, he discovered his love for music. He <b>began</b> writing at <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of 13 after being inspired by the talented music legend Michael Jackson, which may account for his R&B style of music.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the underlying mechanisms}} of systemic autoimmune disease in MRL-+/+, (NZB X NZW) F 1, and (NZB X SWR) F 1 mice, since these strains develop glomerulonephritis without the superimposition of any secondary lupus-accelerating genes. All three strains manifested a common immunoregulatory defect specific {{for the production of}} pathogenic anti-DNA autoantibodies that are of IgG class and cationic in charge. At or just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> they <b>began</b> to develop lupus nephritis, spleen cells of the mice contained a subpopulation of Th cells that selectively induced their B cells in vitro to produce highly cationic IgG autoantibodies to both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). By contrast, T cells from younger preautoimmune mice were incapable of providing this help. Moreover, only B cells of the older lupus mice could be induced to secrete cationic anti-DNA antibodies of IgG class. B cells of young lupus mice could not produce the cationic autoantibodies even with the help of T cells from the older mice, nor upon stimulation with mitogens. In the older lupus mice we found two sets of Th cells that spontaneously induced the cationic shift in autoantibodies; one set belonged to the classical Th category with L 3 T 4 +,Lyt- 2 - phenotype, whereas the other surprisingly belonged to a double-negative (L 3 T 4 -,Lyt- 2 -), Lyt- 1 + subpopulation. The latter set of unusual Th cells were unexpected in these lupus mice since they lacked the lpr (lympho-proliferation) gene. Thus three apparently different murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus possess a common underlying mechanism specific for the spontaneous production of pathogenic anti-DNA autoantibodies...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 13) My sculptures {{are products}} of my heritages??? popular culture and ancient stories combined together to reveal the disconnect I feel from my roots. Japan???s popular culture of animated cartoons and movies contain {{bits and pieces of}} its history and folklore of legendary and mythical creatures that were used to explain the unexplainable at a time when science was not a prevailing rationale. Cute creatures with exaggerated heads are portrayed to reflect Japan???s ???kawaii??? (super cute) trend that is being produced and marketed to the Japanese and American culture. The surface of the sculptures are rounded, smoothed, and sanded to a point of near perfection to emulate Japanese toys and Anime characters. I primarily use clay to create my sculptures to add a connection to the past where clay was the primary material of use <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> of metals <b>began.</b> Clay also allows me to easily manipulate the surface in both an additive and subtractive manner. The details, such as scales or fur, are representative of some of the Japanese designs, simple and extremely detailed.
