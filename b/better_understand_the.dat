5|$|In {{order to}} <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some {{physicists}} have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical {{model in which}} spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, {{eliminating the need for}} string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Efforts to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{mechanisms}} of sebum production are underway. The {{aim of this}} research is to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Additional sebum-lowering medications being researched include topical antiandrogens and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles in order to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.|$|E

5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E

The castle grounds, including the remains of St Nicholas College, two sections of castle wall and the motte hill, are now open to the public. An archaeological research project run by Leicester University conducted a sequence of excavations between 2002 and 2010, aiming to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> historical transition from the Anglo-Saxon town of Wallingford and the burgh, to the period of the Norman castle.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new work is being done to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E

5|$|Several Psilocybe {{species have}} an {{appearance}} roughly similar to P.allenii, but these {{can usually be}} distinguished by differences in morphology or distribution. The European species P.serbica var. moravica has a similar cap and stipe, but is generally more slender than P.allenii. The closely related P.cyanescens is indistinguishable by microscopic characteristics, but features a wavy cap in maturity, a longer fruiting season (from late September through April), and lacks a ring zone on the stipe often seen in P.allenii. P.azurescens has a broader cap, an umbo that may be broad or acute, a longer stipe up to , and a growing season {{similar to that of}} P.cyanescens. The authors also note that the Australian P.subaeruginosa is similar (including three taxa that have since been synonymized: P.australiana, P.eucalypta, and P.tasmaniana) but suggest that further research is required to <b>better</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> delimitation of this species complex.|$|E
