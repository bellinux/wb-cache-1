5000|$|Overlock {{stitching}} {{was invented}} by the Merrow Machine Company in 1881.J. Makens Merrow and his son Joseph Merrow, who owned a knitting mill established in Connecticut in 1838, developed a number of technological advancements {{to be used in}} the mill’s operations. Merrow's first patent was a machine for crochet stitching, and the Merrow Machine Company still produces crochet machines based on this original model. This technology was a starting point for the development of the overlock machine, patented by Joseph Merrow in 1889. Unlike standard lockstitching, which uses a bobbin, overlock sewing machines utilize loopers to create thread loops for the needle to pass through, in a manner similar to crocheting. Merrow's original three-thread overedge sewing machine is the forerunner of contemporary overlocking machines. Over time, the Merrow Machine Company pioneered the design of new machines to create a variety of overlock stitches, such as two- and four-thread machines, the one-thread <b>butted</b> <b>seam,</b> and the cutterless emblem edger.|$|E

Development of finite element model node beznabornoy welded panels based on its solid geometric model, taking into account the parameters of a heating source for laser welding and panel material. Originality/value. In this paper for thr element of sandwich welded panels evaluated the residual stress-strain state in laser welding of longitudinal slotted <b>butt</b> <b>seam.</b> The developed finite element model verified implementation of the basic assumptions that are used in engineering approximate methods of calculation of the stress-strain state of welded joints (linearity of the stress state, the hypothesis of plane sections, symmetry relative of the stress-strain state to the average cross-section of the welded joint). ? ?????? ?? ??????? ???? ??????????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????????-???????????????? ????????? ??? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???. ?? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????-??????????????????, ??????????? ?? ???? ????????????? ???????-?????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????, ??????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????-???????????????? ?????????

5000|$|Clinker built (also {{known as}} lapstrake) {{is a method}} of boat {{building}} where the edges of hull planks overlap, called a [...] "land" [...] or [...] "landing." [...] In craft of any size planks are also joined end to end into a strake. The technique developed in northern Europe and was successfully used by the Norsemen and typical for the Hanseatic cog. A contrasting method, where plank edges are <b>butted</b> smoothly <b>seam</b> to seam, is known as carvel construction.|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and <b>butts</b> the <b>seam,</b> using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|R
40|$|The {{laser welding}} {{in the car}} body shop has become a {{conventional}} joining process. This is independent from the type of the laser beam source, {{the course of the}} radiation and for the complete safety-, control-, automation- and equipment-technology. More and more modules are especially designed for the laser procedure, use their specific characteristics and cannot be produced by any other joining processes. Different characteristics of welds are not caused by the laser technique, but mostly due to unfavourable clamping conditions or because of tolerances of parts, material or coating. Despite the big precision of all production components, systematic and stochastic welding imperfections appear due to the sensibility of the joining process. Systematically identifiable causes are the deviations or tolerances of a few hundredths to tenths of a millimetre concerning the component’s geometry, positions and coatings, whose complete control is still due. Independent from that appear seemingly random irregularities, despite the well-optimal conditions. In result to this work, a method for pre-calculating welding characteristics through an amazingly simple approach was developed. The classification is based on the test specification and achieved even at this early stage of development a good or very good rating level. This method is justified and supported through the addition of the already existing image of the model to the laser/material interaction; from weld-in to the weld-together of square <b>butt</b> form- <b>seams</b> on 2 zinc coated sheets lap joint. The transactions within the welding process for each pre-calculated seam-characteristic are outlined, justified and related to the process emissions in context...|$|R
5000|$|There {{were many}} coal mines {{surrounding}} Hallbankgate, exploiting shallow lying seams {{on a steep}} incline. The closest was the Roachburn pit, at Coalfell where three men {{lost their lives in}} 1908. The subsequent accident report documents a very wet electrically driven pit with fractured <b>seams</b> <b>butting</b> up to a slab of clay- and this was typical of most pits in the area. After the accident the pit closed.It was worked by the Thompson family of Kirkhouse under a lease from Lord Carlisle, and passed under and was connected to their Byrom Pit. It had employed 300 men of which 200 were to lose their jobs and move out of the area. Thompson gave up the lease, which was taken up by the Naworth coal company which worked the other mines in the area. The Gairs mine [...] is often described as being in Hallbankgate though lies in parish of Castle Carrock. In 1925, it had 55 working underground and 28 above, though two years earlier it had employed 148 underground and 44 above. It output 70,000 tons of household and steam coal. It was a safe mine and worked two seams, known as the Little Limestone Coal and the Little Limestone seam. It was abandoned in 1936. It was operated by the Naworth Coal Company. There were other mines in the area notably the Tindale Drift Mine and the Black Syke Mine in Haltwhistle, and Bishops Hill Colliery at Brampton and the Naworth Colliery and drift mines at Midgeholme. Limestone was quarried at the Silvertop Quarry, and there was a spelter works at Tindale which would process zinc and lead.|$|R
