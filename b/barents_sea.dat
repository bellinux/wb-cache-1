5|$|U-255 sailed from Narvik on 29 March 1943 {{to patrol}} the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea,</b> but had no successes, {{arriving}} at Bergen on 29 April. On 1 June 1943, U-255 {{was transferred to the}} newly created 13th U-boat Flotilla based at the DORA 1 submarine base at Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|By early 1943, {{the ship}} had been {{sufficiently}} repaired to begin the conversion process, but Hitler, angered {{by the failure of}} German surface raiders at the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> in December 1942 ordered the cessation of all work. Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found any evidence of a collision.|$|E

5|$|Z31 was a German Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer, {{which was}} {{completed}} in 1942 and served with the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. She {{spent much of the}} war in Arctic and Norwegian waters, taking part in the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> on 31 December 1942. She survived the war, and was passed on to the French Navy as a war prize, serving under the name Marceau until 1958.|$|E
5|$|Proximity of the {{peninsula}} to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.|$|E
50|$|Her second patrol {{was similar}} to the first, sailing through the Norwegian, Greenland and <b>Barents</b> <b>Seas.</b> She docked at Narvik on 12 April 1944.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to Norway in 1942 and ran aground yet again as she prepared to attack one of the convoys to Russia in July. Repairs were completed in December and Theodor Riedel participated in the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> {{at the end of}} the year and in the German attack on Spitzbergen in mid-1943. After another lengthy refit, the ship began escorting ships between Denmark and Norway in mid-1944 and continued to do so until May 1945 when she made several trips to rescue refugees from East Prussia before the end of the war on 8 May.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine {{species of}} fresh water fish are {{recognized}} on the territory of peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and European perch. The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, {{with a number of}} remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider, is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea.</b> They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E
50|$|The submarine's first patrol {{began with}} her {{departure}} from Bergen on 21 February 1944. After covering the Norwegian and <b>Barents</b> <b>seas,</b> she docked at Narvik on 9 March.|$|R

50|$|While the Arctic Oscillation has an annular {{structure}} centered {{over and}} covering the entire Arctic, the Arctic dipole anomaly has two poles of opposite sign: {{one over the}} Canadian Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland, the other over the Kara and Laptev Seas. This dipole structure leads to a pressure gradient with a zero isopleth oriented from the Bering Strait, across the Arctic to the Greenland and <b>Barents</b> <b>Seas.</b> As a result, anomalous winds are generally directed parallel to the zero isopleth either towards the Greenland and <b>Barents</b> <b>Seas</b> (positive Arctic dipole anomaly) or toward the Bering Strait (negative Arctic dipole anomaly).|$|R
5|$|Lützow and Admiral Scheer were {{deployed}} to Norway in 1942 {{to join the}} attacks on Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. Admiral Scheer conducted Operation Wunderland in August 1942, a sortie into the Kara Sea to attack Soviet merchant shipping, though it ended without significant success. Lützow participated in the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> in December 1942, a failed attempt to destroy a convoy. Both ships were damaged {{in the course of}} their deployment to Norway, and eventually returned to Germany for repairs. They ended their careers bombarding advancing Soviet forces on the Eastern Front; both ships were destroyed by British bombers in the final weeks of the war. Lützow was raised and sunk as a target by the Soviet Navy while Admiral Scheer was partially broken up in situ, with the remainder of the hulk buried beneath rubble.|$|E
5|$|She {{made her}} first kill on 6 July, sinking the 7,191 ton American Liberty ship John Witherspoon about 20 miles off Novaya Zemlya. The ship, {{en route from}} Baltimore to Arkhangelsk with 8,575 tons of {{ammunition}} and tanks aboard, had {{been a part of}} Convoy PQ 17 which had dispersed on Admiralty orders in the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> on 4 July. After being hit by four torpedoes, the ship broke in two, and sank within minutes. The crew abandoned ship, and one seaman fell overboard and drowned. U-255 questioned the survivors, offered food and water, gave directions to the nearest land, and left. The crew were picked up by Royal Navy ships on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|The 330 Squadron has a {{detachment}} {{with two}} Westland Sea King Mk 43B helicopters at Banak. They {{are part of}} the Norwegian Air Ambulance service, organized by the four regional health authorities. Medical personnel is provided by Finnmark Hospital Trust, while the remaining personnel are military. The detachment flew 271 missions and 854 hours in 2009. The Sea Kings' primary role is for search and rescue (SAR) mission, with a portfolio of northern Troms, Finnmark and the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea.</b> In SAR missions, the squadron operates under the management of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway located in Bodø. The detachment's secondary responsibility is as an air ambulance, under management of Hammerfest Hospital.|$|E
50|$|U-432s first patrol {{was from}} Kiel in Germany and {{took in the}} Norwegian and <b>Barents</b> <b>Seas.</b> She docked at Kirkenes, {{not far from the}} border between Norway and the Soviet Union on 17 February 1942.|$|R
50|$|Having berthed in Skjomenfjord (south of Narvik) on 27 July 1942, {{the boat}} {{departed}} on her fourth sortie on 2 April. Her route took {{her through the}} Norwegian, Greenland and <b>Barents</b> <b>Seas.</b> She returned to Skjomenfjord on 20 August.|$|R
50|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, the Anglo-Russian War (2 September 1807- 18 July 1812) was {{the phase}} of {{hostilities}} between the United Kingdom and Russia after the latter signed the Treaty of Tilsit that ended its war with France. Anglo-Russian hostilities were limited primarily to minor naval actions in the Baltic and <b>Barents</b> <b>Seas.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and {{was transferred to}} Norway in June 1941 {{as part of the}} preparations for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Richard Beitzen spent some time {{at the beginning of the}} campaign conducting anti-shipping patrols in Soviet waters, but these were generally fruitless. She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year. The ship escorted several German heavy cruisers at the beginning and end of their anti-shipping raids in 1942. She participated in the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> when Convoy JW 51B was attacked on 31 December 1942 near the North Cape, Norway.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Scharnhorst arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had {{temporarily}} ceased. To give the ships {{an opportunity to}} work together, Admiral Karl Dönitz, who had replaced Raeder {{in the aftermath of}} the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> on 31 December 1942, ordered an attack on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base. Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6 September; in a ruse de guerre, Tirpitz flew the white ensign on the approach to the island the following day. During the bombardment, Tirpitz fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15cm secondaries. This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target. An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners. By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.|$|E
5|$|Repairs were {{completed}} by March 1941, Lützow returned to Norway {{to join the}} forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during a planned attack on convoy PQ 17, which necessitated another return to Germany for repairs. She next saw action at the Battle of the <b>Barents</b> <b>Sea</b> with the heavy cruiser , which ended with a failure to destroy the convoy JW 51B. Engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul {{at the end of}} 1943, after which the ship remained in the Baltic. Sunk in shallow waters in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, Lützow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target in the Baltic.|$|E
