500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far <b>better.</b> <b>If</b> <b>we</b> had hope to use them as keys, we {{discover}} they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
500|$|The National Congress of Brazil {{passed a}} large naval {{acquisition}} program on 14 December 1904, {{but it was}} two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered. One, supported by the British armament company Armstrong Whitworth (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships. Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that [...] "with six small battleships we would be much <b>better.</b> <b>If</b> <b>we</b> lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three ? With two damaged or destroyed, we would be left with one only." ...|$|E
500|$|Romeo Void's {{best known}} song is [...] "Never Say Never", which {{contains}} the famous line [...] "I might like you <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> slept together." [...] Allmusic writer Heather Phares {{has argued that}} Iyall's [...] "teasing, existential musings [...] predated and predicted the aloof yet frank sexuality of early- and mid-'90s artists such as Elastica and Liz Phair". Phares concluded that the song was [...] "a subversive, influential classic" [...] and [...] "one of new wave's most distinctive and innovative moments. [...] " [...] The song has been covered by many artists, among them are Queens of the Stone Age and Amanda Blank. The song [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)", their highest-charting single, was reportedly written {{as a response to}} Michael Jackson's hit song [...] "Billie Jean", but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events. Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes like social alienation ("Undercover Kept") and generation gaps ("Chinatown").|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix we cut things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. But it really shoulda been much <b>better.</b> <b>If</b> <b>we</b> had more time and we didn't {{have to deal with the}} situation of nobody talking".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1994, the K Foundation {{attempted}} to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, {{wanted to be part of}} the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. [...] "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do." [...] Cauty: [...] "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an event}} in September 2013, Mohanlal {{announced}} that the film will start in February 2014. In March 2014, it was reported the filming will begin in {{the second week of}} April 2014. Principal photography began in mid-April 2014 in Kollam, Kerala. Two sequences in the filma fight and an item song, which are taking place in the U. S. was shot in a set created inside the compound of The Raviz Hotel, Kollam. The Kollam schedule was completed on 8 May 2014. Filming in Kollam for a film set in America, was criticized by some medias in Kerala. Replying to it Vaidyanathan said in an interview: [...] "If you are making Titanic, you don't have to build an entire ship and make it sink. The news of us shooting in the U. S. got lesser prominence in the media than the shooting in Kerala, which was there for three or four days. There are certain things that we thought would be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shot it here [...] What matters in the end is the content on screen,".|$|E

2500|$|Barton started {{mixing the}} album in mid-April 2013, after the {{recording}} {{had just been}} finalized, and mixing was finished {{by the end of}} the month. It was then, that the album's short length, just 35 minutes and 3 seconds, surprised even the band: [...] "It wasn't until we got the masters sessions that we realized, 'Wow, this is like an old Van Halen record'..." [...] Wilton says that it wasn't possible for them to deliver more within the time frame they had, adding: [...] "To tell you the truth, we were at one point considering just doing 5 songs and doing an EP. But, basically, Century Media said it would be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could do an album." [...] Its length would later become a point of criticism, but Wilton has explained that the band prefers to choose quality over quantity: [...] "we don't want to have an album with filler songs. We want every song to be quality. I'd rather have a 35 minute badass album, than a 50 minute long with a bunch of epic songs that really shouldn't have been on the CD." [...] La Torre has added: [...] "We tend to focus on good content, we didn't want to have ten more minutes or fifteen more minutes of music, just to say that we could." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be <b>better</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
