25|$|A <b>bailout</b> <b>bottle</b> (BoB) or bailout {{cylinder}} is a scuba cylinder {{carried by}} an underwater diver {{for use as}} an emergency supply of breathing gas {{in the event of}} a primary gas supply failure. A bailout cylinder may be carried by a scuba diver in addition to the primary scuba set, or by a surface supplied diver using either free-flow or demand systems. The bailout gas is not intended for use during the dive except in an emergency. The term may be used to refer to just the cylinder, or the bailout set or emergency gas supply (EGS), which is the cylinder with the gas delivery system attached.|$|E
2500|$|... "Spare Air" [...] <b>bailout</b> <b>bottles,</b> {{introduced}} in the 1980s, are very small cylinders with integral scuba regulators. Their disadvantage is that in many emergency situations {{they do not have}} sufficient capacity to get a diver back to the surface safely, and thus may cause divers carrying them to feel an unjustified sense of safety. Their advantage is that they are compact and easy to deploy, and that a small amount of air is better than none in an emergency.|$|R

2500|$|A pony bottle is {{an example}} of a bailout {{cylinder}} which has a standard diving regulator with first and second stages.

50|$|On 16 April 2016, {{a sailor}} lost his leg while two others {{were injured in}} an oxygen {{cylinder}} explosion on board the ship. The explosion took place while a diving <b>bailout</b> <b>bottle,</b> a small 12-inch oxygen bottle which is carried by divers in their diving helmet, was being charged. This incident has never happened in history of the Indian Navy before. One sailor sustained serious injuries and his right leg was amputated from just above the knee and two other sailors received splinter injuries in the stomach region and legs. They were admitted in Military Hospital, Trivandrum as ship was on it way to Mumbai from Visakhapatnam.|$|E
5000|$|A pony bottle {{is a small}} diving {{cylinder}} {{which is}} fitted with an independent regulator, and carried by a scuba diver as an extension to the scuba set. In an emergency, such as depletion of the diver's main air supply, {{it can be used}} as an alternate air source or <b>bailout</b> <b>bottle</b> to allow a normal ascent in place of a controlled emergency swimming ascent. The key attribute of a pony bottle is that it provides a totally independent and redundant source of breathing gas for the diver. The name [...] is due to the smaller size, often of only a few litres capacity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{technical}} diving, where larger {{volumes of}} breathing gas {{need to be}} supplied the usefulness of pony bottles greatly diminishes. This type of diving is the province of twinsets, rebreathers or even more complex assemblages. The diver however still needs to consider bailout - an interruption of the planned dive by breathing gas problems that requires a safe exit to the surface. In certain technical diving equipment configurations the use of larger pony bottles can again come to the fore, particular if the diving is not excessively deep and decompression requirements are modest. An example {{can be in the}} case of rebreathers, where the diluent gas supply is also used as a <b>bailout</b> <b>bottle</b> for rebreather failure. The capacity of the diluent bottle is very often insufficient for this bailout purpose, and an appropriate larger sized pony can serve as a [...] "backup to the bailout".|$|E
