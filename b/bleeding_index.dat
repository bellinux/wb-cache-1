50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the periodontal health of a patient, the dentist or dental hygienist records the sulcular depths of the gingiva and observes any bleeding on probing. This is often accomplished {{with the use of a}} periodontal probe. Alternatively, dental floss may also be used to assess the Gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>index.</b> It is used as an initial evaluation on patient's periodontal health especially to measure gingivitis. The number of bleeding sites is used to calculate the gingival bleeding score.|$|E

Methods: Fifty-one serologically confirmed HIV positive individuals {{were included in}} the study. Plaque index and <b>bleeding</b> <b>index</b> was recorded by a single examiner. CD 4 cell count was obtained within 30 days from the day of examination. CD 4 cell counts and gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>index</b> was correlated using Spearman?s correlation test. p < 0. 01 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Mean plaque score, mean gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>index</b> score and mean CD 4 cell count was 1. 40, 0. 96 and 249. 86 cells/mm 3 respectively. It was noticed that gingival bleeding was enhanced in individuals with increased immunosuppression. However, no significant positive correlation was seen between mean CD 4 cell count and gingival bleeding (p = 0. 14).

40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} bleeding on marginal probing (BOMP) and bleeding on pocket probing (BOPP), and the correlation of both <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices</b> with plaque. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study screened 336 participants, from which 268 were eligible for examination and analysis. <b>Bleeding</b> and plaque <b>indices</b> were assessed by single examiners, at six sites per tooth. Results The mean percentage of sites per individual with bleeding on marginal probing, bleeding on pocket probing and dental plaque were 19. 9 %, 51. 2 % and 32. 2 % respectively. In the quadrants where the margin was probed before the pocket, a 4. 6 percentage points higher bleeding tendency with BOPP was observed (p < 0. 05). At a site level, the correlation coefficients of plaque and bleeding on marginal probing and bleeding on pocket probing were 0. 19 and 0. 20 respectively. Both <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices</b> were also shown to be correlated (r = 0. 89, fixed effect model).

40|$|Introduction: In this {{double-blind}} and {{randomized controlled}} trial, we analyzed whether a lower concentration of chlorhexidine in dentifrices {{could reduce the}} risk of tooth staining without compromising its effectiveness in controlling gingivitis, bleeding, and dental plaque. Methods: Volunteers with fixed orthodontic appliances were randomly divided into 3 groups: control, 1100 ppm F, NaF (n = 27); experimental, chlorhexidine 0. 50 % (n = 27); and experimental, chlorhexidine 0. 75 % (n = 27). At baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks, clinical examinations were carried out. Staining, calculus, gingivitis, bleeding, and dental plaque data were analyzed with Friedman tests to evaluate intragroup changes over time. To detect intergroup differences after 12 months, the data were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis tests. Dunn tests were used in both situations for necessary post-hoc analyses. Results: The groups were statistically similar for the stain, calculus, and plaque indexes, but there were statistically significant differences for the gingival and <b>bleeding</b> <b>indexes.</b> During the experimental periods, gingivitis and bleeding scores improved in all 3 groups. Only the 0. 75 % chlorhexidine dentifrice significantly increased the stain index, although most patients did not notice the stains. The intergroup comparison showed a statistically significant better performance of the experimental groups regarding the gingival and <b>bleeding</b> <b>indexes.</b> Conclusions: This study suggests that the use of dentifrices with lower concentration of chlorhexidine can {{reduce the risk of}} tooth staining without compromising its effectiveness in controlling gingivitis and bleeding in orthodontic patients.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} prospectively the influence {{and the evolution}} of periodontal disease (PD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients submitted to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Methods: Eighteen patients with RA (according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria) were assessed for PD before (BL) and after 6 months (6 M) of anti-TNF treatment: 15 infliximab, 2 adalimumab, and 1 etanercept. Periodontal assessment included plaque and gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices,</b> probing pocket depth, cementoenamel junction, and clinical attachment level. Rheumatologic evaluation was performed blinded to the dentist's assessment: demographic data, clinical manifestations, and disease activity (Disease Activity Score using 28 joints [DAS 28], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], and C-reactive protein [CRP]). Results: The median age and disease duration of patients with RA were 50 years (25 - 71 y) and 94 % were female. Periodontal disease was diagnosed in 8 patients (44. 4 %). Comparing BL to 6 M, periodontal parameters in the entire group remained stable (P > 0. 05) throughout the study (plaque and gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices,</b> probing pocket depth, cementoenamel junction, and clinical attachment level), whereas an improvement in most analyzed RA parameters was observed in the same period: DAS 28 (5. 5 vs. 3. 9, P = 0. 02), ESR (21 vs. 12. 5 mm/first hour, P = 0. 07), and CRP (7. 8 vs. 2. 8 mg/dL, P = 0. 25). Further analysis revealed that this improvement was restricted to the group of patients without PD (DAS 28 [5. 5 vs. 3. 6, P = 0. 04], ESR [23. 0 vs. 11. 5 mm/first hour, P = 0. 008], and CRP [7. 4 vs. 2. 1, P = 0. 01]). In contrast, patients with PD had lack of response, with no significant differences in disease activity parameters between BL and 6 M: DAS 28 (5. 2 vs. 4. 4, P = 0. 11), ESR (17. 0 vs. 21. 0, P = 0. 56), and CRP (9. 0 vs. 8. 8, P = 0. 55). Conclusions: This study supports the notion that PD may affect TNF blocker efficacy in patients with RA. The possibility that a sustained gingival inflammatory state may hamper treatment response in this disease has high clinical interest because this is a treatable condition.

40|$|Background: One of {{the major}} direct or {{indirect}} targets of ultraviolet exposure of skin is the melanocyte or the melanin -forming cell. Epidermal melanocytes act as a trap for free radicals. Based on the protective role of melanocytes in medical literature, the role of melanin pigmentation in gingiva needs to be elucidated. Periodontal pathogens and their products demonstrate the ability to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species. Hence {{purpose of this study}} was to unravel the protective role of melanin (if any) against the gingival inflammation. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 subjects; 20 in each group were selected. The selection of subjects regarding gingival pigmentation was based on Dummett′s scoring criteria 0, 3. A complete medical, dental history and an informed consent were obtained from the patients. After evaluation of clinical parameters the GCF was collected using microcapillary pipettes at the selected sites. IL- 1 β levels were quantitated using ELISA. Results: In non-pigmented healthy and gingivitis groups, there was a positive correlation between plaque index, gingival index and <b>bleeding</b> <b>index</b> versus IL- 1 β level: indicating an increase in the biochemical mediator of inflammation corresponding to an increase in the clinical parameters of inflammation. Also a positive correlation was found between the gingival index and <b>bleeding</b> <b>index</b> versus the IL- 1 β levels in the pigmented healthy group. The pigmented gingivitis groups showed a negative correlation between the plaque index, gingival index and <b>bleeding</b> <b>index.</b> Conclusions: The clinical markers of inflammation such as gingival index, <b>bleeding</b> <b>index</b> was of low numerical value in pigmented group than in the non-pigmented group, supposedly due to the protective action of melanin. The negative correlation of clinical markers of inflammation to the IL- 1 β levels in the pigmented gingivitis group could possibly be attributed to the protective role of melanins...|$|E

40|$|Periodontal {{diseases}} are multi-factorial in etiology, and bacteria are one among these etiologic agents. Thus, {{an essential component}} of therapy is to eliminate or control these pathogens. This has been traditionally accomplished through mechanical means (scaling and root planing (SRP)), which is time-consuming, difficult, and, sometimes, ineffective. From about the past 30 years, locally delivered, anti-infective pharmacological agents, most recently employing sustained-release vehicles, have been introduced to achieve this goal. This systematic review is an effort to determine the efficacy of the currently available anti-infective agents, with and without concurrent SRP, in controlling chronic periodontitis. Four studies were included, which were all randomized controlled trials, incorporating a total patient population of 80, with 97 control sites and 111 test sites. A meta-analysis completed on these four studies including SRP and local sustained-release agents compared with SRP alone indicated significant adjunctive probing depth (PD) reduction for 10 % Doxycycline hycylate (ATRIDOX), minocycline hydrochloride (ARESTIN), tetracycline hydrochloride (PERIODONTAL PLUS AB), and chlorhexidine gluconate (PERIOCHIP). Essentially, all studies reported substantial reductions in gingival inflammation, plaque scores, and <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices,</b> which were similar in both the control and the experimental groups. Use of antimicrobial sustained-release systems as an adjunct to SRP does not result in significant patient-centered adverse events.

40|$|Aim: To {{report on}} a {{possible}} relationship {{between the use of}} dental floss or superfloss and the development of peri-implantitis. Materials and methods: Ten patients with progressive peri-implantitis with an intensive oral hygiene protocol, which consisted of extensive professional supra- and submucosal cleaning, and not responding to this therapy were scheduled for examination. Plaque and <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices</b> and probing depth measurements were assessed, and radiographic examination was performed every two years. Results: In all ten cases, remnants of dental floss were found around the neck and coronal part of a dental implant. After careful removal of these floss remnants and implant cleansing, a significant improvement in the peri-implant conditions in nine of ten cases was noted. In one case, peri-implant probing depth decreased substantially. However, bleeding on probing was still present. In vitro testing yielded that the application of various types of dental floss on the exposed rough implant surfaces may easily lead to tearing of floss fibers. This may result in the deposition of floss remnants on rough implant surfaces, which, in turn, may lead to the development of plaque-related peri-implant inflammation and, subsequently, bone loss. Conclusion: In case of exposed rough surfaces of the dental implant, the peri-implant conditions may be jeopardized by the application of dental floss, and hence, the utilization of interproximal brushes or toothpicks may be preferred for daily home care practices...|$|R

A thorough anamnesis was followed by oral examinations including saliva flow measurements, the DMFT score for cariological status, complete periodontal status with plaque and <b>bleeding</b> <b>indexes</b> as well as assessment of mucosal alterations and temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD). Student's t-test and Pearson chi-square test were utilized to compare the oral diseases between HLA positive and negative subjects. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used and PBonf< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. HLA types -B 15 (PBonf =  0. 002), -B 51 (PBonf =  0. 02) and -DRB 1 * 12 (PBonf =  0. 02) were associated with less periodontal disease manifestations. HLA-A 32 had a positive association with TMD dysfunction (PBonf =  0. 012). No other statistically significant associations were observed. In conclusion, HLA types {{may contribute to the}} development of oral diseases in generally healthy Caucasian adults...|$|R

A case-control study was done to assess the influence of smoking on clinical, microbiological, and histopathological parameters. Methods. Two hundred dentate male patients (100 smokers and 100 nonsmokers) ranging between 25 and 50 years {{were enrolled in the}} study. Periodontal parameters were recorded. Plaque samples were collected for microbial analysis for BANA test. Gingival biopsies were obtained from selected site for assessing histopathological changes. Results. Both groups showed almost similar plaque levels (P = 0. 258), but smokers had reduced gingival (0. 62 ± 0. 31) and <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices</b> (28. 53 ± 17. 52) and an increased calculus index (1. 62 ± 0. 36). Smokers had an increased probing depth of 4 – 7 mm (P = 0. 009) and overall increased CAL. No difference in microbiota was found between the two groups. Histopathologically smokers showed a decreased blood vessel density (8. 84 ± 0. 96) and inflammatory cells (52. 00 ± 9. 79). Conclusions. It is quite possible that many of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in tissue degradation in periodontitis in smokers could be quite different from those in nonsmokers. 1...|$|R
30|$|Two hundred eleven {{patients}} with 967 dental implants were analyzed up to 15  years after implant placement. Implants {{were divided into}} two groups: no keratinized mucosa (NKM) and KM.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} {{that there are no}} differences in Streptococcus mutans count in the early phase of orthodontic treatment between organic and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients were divided into two groups: Group I: Organic mouthwash and Group II: Chlorhexidine mouthwash. The gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>index,</b> pocket depths, and level of S. mutans counts were calculated at the different intervals of time. Paired t-test in SPSS software was used for statistical evaluations. Results: There was {{a significant difference in the}} values of GI, PI, gingival <b>bleeding</b> <b>index,</b> and pocket depth as well as in the level of streptococcal count (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Null hypothesis is rejected. This study indicates that organic mouthwash showed the lesser level of S. mutans count as compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash hence it is recommended to use organic mouthwash...|$|E
40|$|Text message {{reminders}} {{have proven}} effective for positive behavioral changes in medicine, but {{their influence on}} oral hygiene compliance has never been tested. This study aimed to determine if text message reminders about oral hygiene have an influence {{on the level of}} compliance. In this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, 42 orthodontic patients were assigned to a text message or control group. Parents of patients assigned to the text message group received a reminder text message one weekday each week. Oral hygiene compliance was measured using <b>bleeding</b> <b>index,</b> modified gingival index, plaque index, and visual examination of white spot lesion development at baseline (T 0), two appointments after baseline (T 1), and four appointments after baseline (T 2). <b>Bleeding</b> <b>index,</b> modified gingival index, and plaque index scores were significantly lower in the text message group than the control group at T 2. A text message reminder system is effective for improving oral hygiene compliance in orthodontic patients...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that the wound healing {{in a closed}} submerged location {{is one of the}} prerequisites for osseointegration of dental implants. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the tissue integration of intentionally non-submerged titanium implants inserted by a one-stage surgical procedure. 100 ITI implants were consecutively placed in 70 partially edentulous patients. After a healing period free of masticatory loading for at least 3 months, the implants were examined. The clinical status showed for all implants neither detectable mobility nor signs of a peri-implant infection. Therefore, prosthetic abutments were inserted, and the patients were restored with fixed partial dentures. All patients were regularly recalled at 3 -month intervals, and no patient dropped out of the study. Thus, all 100 implants were re-evaluated 12 months following implantation. Plaque- and sulcus <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices,</b> probing depth, clinical attachment level, width of keratinized mucosa, and periotest scores were assessed. In addition, standardized radiographs were analyzed for the presence of peri-implant radiolucencies and for the location of alveolar bone levels around the implants. Based on predefined criteria, the implants were classified as successful or failing. 98 implants were considered successful, and 1 implant failing. The remaining implant exhibited a peri-implant infection requiring local and systemic antimicrobial treatment. The results of this short-term study indicate that intentionally non-submerged ITI implants yield a high predictability for successful tissue integration. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, Framingham Risk {{score for}} atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), and the Rietbrock modified CHADS 2 scoring systems {{are better than}} chance and the CHADS 2 scoring system at predicting the risk for stroke in patients with AF.

40|$|Objectives: Periodontitis is {{believed}} to be an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to be associated with a moderate systemic inflammatory reaction and hyperlipidaemia. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA 2) is an enzyme that {{has been shown to be}} a risk factor of CVD and that is involved in the degradation of the phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent mediator of inflammation. Material and Methods: In the present study, we measured concentrations of plasma lipids and plasma activity of Lp-PLA 2 in 32 patients (mean age 43 ± 11 years) with moderate-to-severe periodontitis before and 3 months after local treatment. Results: Periodontal therapy resulted in a significant reduction of local inflammation and tissue destruction as reflected in reduced pocket depths and reduced <b>bleeding</b> <b>indices.</b> Pre- and post-treatment plasma lipid levels were (median and range, mmol/l) : total cholesterol (C) 5. 01 (3. 94 – 7. 15) and 4. 91 (3. 32 – 8. 01); low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 3. 14 (2. 40 – 4. 84) and 2. 96 (1. 39 – 5. 04); HDL-C 1. 27 (0. 73 – 2. 17) and 1. 25 (0. 74 – 2. 55); triglycerides 1. 37 (0. 48 – 5. 11) and 1. 14 (0. 38 – 792). Using the Wilcoxon's rank test, neither parameter showed a significant change. In contrast to the lacking response of plasma lipids, we observed a significant reduction in the activity of Lp-PLA 2. Local treatment lowered the enzyme activity by about 10...|$|R
