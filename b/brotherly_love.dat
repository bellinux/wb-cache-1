5|$|The Brothers did {{not appear}} for JAPW again until late 2005, again in a tables, ladders, and chairs match for the tag team title, this time against the teams of Teddy Hart and Homicide, the Backseat Boyz, and The S.A.T.. The match, which took place at JAPW's 8th Year Anniversary Show, was won Hart and Homicide. At the next show, Fall Out, the S.A.T. {{defeated}} them and thus became number one contenders to the tag team championship. More recent JAPW appearances came in early 2006, losing along with the Outcast Killers to the S.A.T. once again at Wild Card II in a tag team title match, and then at <b>Brotherly</b> <b>Love</b> to the team of Sabu and Sonjay Dutt, a match they also lost. In October 2008, the Briscoes competed at JAPW's 11th Anniversary Show against LAX (Homicide and Hernandez).

King also sometimes used the concept of [...] "agape" [...] (<b>brotherly</b> Christian <b>love).</b> However, after 1960, he ceased employing it in his writings.|$|R
50|$|Struggle against envyThrowing away envy is {{a crucial}} {{condition}} in our path to salvation. Envy was seen by the Apostle Paul as a real danger even within the first Christian communities. Envy should remain a sin of the past, defeated by God teaching, which, as in the tenth commandment, forbids us from coveting our neighbour's things, woman, and servants, and urges us to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, as Apostle Paul said, and to love our neighbours as ourselves. Because <b>brotherly,</b> Christian <b>love</b> banishes definitively envy from our hearts.|$|R

25|$|However, {{a number}} of renowned Kabbalists claimed the exact opposite, {{stressing}} universality of all human souls and providing universal interpretations of the Kabbalistic tradition, including its Lurianic version.

Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz, a prominent Lithuanian-Galician Kabbalist of the 18th century and a moderate proponent of the Haskalah, called for <b>brotherly</b> <b>love</b> and solidarity between all nations, and believed that Kabbalah can empower everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, with prophetic abilities.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach <b>brotherly</b> <b>love.</b> Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

Incapable of bending abilities himself, Sokka instead pursues martial arts, sciences, and engineering. He is intelligent, resourceful and at times he even proves to be quite scholarly. However, he is often clumsy and sometimes mistaken. Despite his flaws, he is <b>loving,</b> <b>brotherly,</b> and protective.

25|$|During {{the course}} of the early church, there were {{numerous}} followers who attached themselves to the Christ and His mission here on Earth, as well as followers who retained the distinct duty of being commissioned with preserving the quality of life and lessons revealed through the experience of Jesus living, dying, resurrecting and ascending among them. As a matter of practical distinction and logistics, people of varying gifts were accorded stations within the community structure – ranging from the host of agape meals (shared with <b>brotherly</b> and fatherly <b>love),</b> to prophecy and the reading of Scripture, to preaching and interpretations and giving aid to the sick and the poor.

500|$|In 2001, Brandon Flowers {{was fired}} by his first band, a Las Vegas synthpop trio known as Blush Response. After {{attending}} an Oasis concert at the Hard Rock Hotel during The Tour of <b>Brotherly</b> <b>Love,</b> Flowers realized his calling was {{to be in a}} rock band and began searching for like-minded musicians. He eventually came across an ad posted in a Las Vegas newspaper by Dave Keuning, a 25-year-old guitarist who had moved to Vegas from Iowa a year earlier. [...] When the pair met they bonded over similar musical influences and immediately began writing songs together in Keuning's apartment. In November 2001, they headed to Kill The Messenger Studio in Henderson, Nevada along with recently recruited drummer Matt Norcross to begin recording a demo; they recorded two tracks: [...] "Mr. Brightside", which was the first song Flowers and Keuning wrote together, and [...] "Desperate". A month later they recorded two more, [...] "Under the Gun" [...] and [...] "Replaceable", with Keuning's roommate Dell Neal on bass.|$|E

The album, Heathen Chemistry, Oasis' first album with new members Andy Bell and Gem Archer, was released in July 2002. The album reached number1 in the UK and number23 in the US, although critics gave it mixed reviews. There were four singles released from the album: [...] "The Hindu Times", [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out", [...] "Little by Little/She Is Love" [...] which were written by Noel, and [...] "Songbird", written by Liam and the first single not to be written by Noel. The record blended the band's sonic experiments from their last albums, but also went for a more basic rock sound. The recording of Heathen Chemistry was much more balanced for the band, {{with all of the}} members, apart from White, writing songs. Johnny Marr provided additional guitar as well as backup vocals on a couple of songs.|$|E

Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6points, 11.9assists, and 6.2rebounds per game despite missing 10 games with a groin injury. In the 1988 playoffs, the Lakers swept the San Antonio Spurs in 3 games, then survived two 4–3series against the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks to reach the Finals and face Thomas and the Detroit Pistons, who with players such as Bill Laimbeer, John Salley, Vinnie Johnson and Dennis Rodman were known as the [...] "Bad Boys" [...] for their physical style of play. Johnson and Thomas greeted {{each other with a}} kiss on the cheek before the opening tip of Game 1, which they called a display of <b>brotherly</b> <b>love.</b> After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP James Worthy had his first career triple-double of 36points, 16rebounds, and 10assists, and led his team to a 108–105win.

6000|$|For the {{remaining}} {{forty years of}} his life he lived, like Wordsworth, [...] "in the stillness of a great peace," [...] writing steadily, and enjoying the friendship {{of a large number of}} people, some distinguished, some obscure, from the kindly and sympathetic Victoria to the servants on his own farm. All of these he called with equal sincerity his friends, and to each one he was the same man, simple, strong, kindly, and noble. Carlyle describes him as [...] "a fine, large-featured, dim-eyed, bronze-colored, shaggy-headed man, ... most restful, <b>brotherly,</b> solid-hearted." [...] <b>Loving</b> solitude and hating publicity as he did, the numerous tourists from both sides of the ocean, who sought him out in his retreat and insisted upon seeing him, made his life at times intolerable.

60|$|He {{had come}} there eager with two high feelings, {{love for his}} sister, real fond <b>brotherly</b> affection, and <b>love</b> and respect for his family name; he had wished to protect the former from insult and unhappiness, and to sustain the fallen respectability of the latter; and he had only been scoffed at and upbraided by the sister he loved. For he did love her, though little real {{communication}} had ever passed between them; he had always supposed that she loved him; he had taken it for granted, and had asked for no demonstrative affection; but her manner and her words now cut him very deep. He was not aware how very uncouth his own manner had been; that instead of reasoning with her gently he had begun by sneering at her lover, {{that he had taken}} the very course to offend her self-love, and that therefore Feemy was quite as convinced {{at the end of the}} meeting that she had a right to be angry, as he was that he was the injured party.|$|R
500|$|John Eliot Gardiner, who {{conducted}} the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage with the Monteverdi Choir in 2000, evaluated the work, connected to Bach's first cantata for Leipzig: this cantata is clearly {{more than just a}} sequel to the previous Sunday's ...together they form a diptych revealing a thematic continuity extended over two weeks, with plentiful cross-referencing between the two set Gospels and Epistles beyond the obvious parallels between the injunction to give charitably to the hungry (BWV 75) and of <b>brotherly</b> <b>love</b> manifested in action (BWV 76). He described the works as featuring [...] "a characteristically Lutheran interpretation" [...] of the First Epistle of John. He also noted the depth of metaphorical uses of [...] "eating and drinking", highlighting [...] "the rich man's table, from which Lazarus tried to gather fallen crumbs (BWV 75), standing in opposition to the [...] "great supper" [...] and God's invitation through Christ to the banquet of eternal life (BWV 76)". Summarising both pieces, Gardiner wrote: evidently a lot of thought and pre-planning had gone on while Bach was still in Köthen, as well as discussions with his unknown librettist and possibly with representatives of the Leipzig clergy, before he could set the style, tone and narrative shaping of these two impressive works.|$|E

50|$|Zhao Yin, who {{was said}} to be filially pious, was greatly saddened by his father's death, and he spent more than a decade {{thereafter}} studying near his father's tomb, not submitting himself for the imperial examinations. During this time, the household {{was said to}} be poor, and he and Zhao Zhi, who had a <b>loving</b> <b>brotherly</b> relationship, farmed to support their mother. During the Huichang era (841-847) of Emperor Dezong's great-great-grandson Emperor Wuzong, some friends of Zhao Cunyue's became powerful officials, and they urged Zhao Yin to enter official service; only then did Zhao Yin do so, and he served as an assistant to various officials. In 849, by which time Emperor Wuzong's uncle Emperor Xuānzong was emperor, Zhao passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class. (His brother Zhao Zhi would do so eventually as well.) He served at various posts as prefectural prefect, supervisory official, imperial attendant, and eventually the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the region of the Tang eastern capital Luoyang). He would later serve as deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang) and then the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang), also serving {{as the director of the}} salt and iron monopolies.|$|R
40|$|Pastoral {{guidance}} of {{ministers of the}} Dutch Reformed Church during ecclesiastical discipline. The process of ecclesiastical discipline evokes feelings of guilt and shame. Whilst literary study suggested {{this to be the}} case, the empirical research confirmed it. It is clear that the three-fold process was a traumatic and shocking experience for ministers. Most upsetting was the way that the process was handled. It was done in a non-professional way and without <b>brotherly</b> or sisterly <b>love.</b> The process triggered guilt and shame emotions in a number of ways, not least by the lack of support and guidance. Respondents indicated that they had positive and negative experiences of guilt and shame during the discipline process. Most respondents took action to amend their mistakes, and thereby used the guilt feeling functionally, whilst the use of defence mechanisms showed that they did not manage and process the feelings of shame. It is unsettling to realise that the Dutch Reformed Church fails her ministers in time of need. Only a few parishioners and ministers from other denominations provided some sort of comfort during the discipline process. The church gave no support and guidance in the processing of the feelings of guilt and shame. The church lacked in every aspect, even to show a basic understanding of the trauma, and none of the church councils offered any basic or interventive help. To remedy the situation, it is proposed that the church should take its task as caregiver during the ecclesiastical discipline of ministers very serious and give guidance in an official and professional way...|$|R
60|$|It {{was a happy}} {{circumstance}} that Antaeus was the Pygmy people's friend; for there was more strength in his little finger than in ten million of such bodies as this. If he had been as ill-natured to them as he was to everybody else, he might have beaten down their biggest city at one kick, and hardly have known that he did it. With the tornado of his breath, he could have stripped the roofs from a hundred dwellings and sent thousands of the inhabitants whirling through the air. He might have set his immense foot upon a multitude; and when he took it up again, {{there would have been}} a pitiful sight, to be sure. But, being the son of Mother Earth, as they likewise were, the Giant gave them his <b>brotherly</b> kindness, and <b>loved</b> them with as big a love as it was possible to feel for creatures so very small. And, on their parts, the Pygmies loved Antaeus with as much affection as their tiny hearts could hold. He was always ready to do them any good offices that lay in his power; as for example, when they wanted a breeze to turn their windmills, the Giant would set all the sails a-going with the mere natural respiration of his lungs. When the sun was too hot, he often sat himself down, and let his shadow fall over the kingdom, from one frontier to the other; and as for matters in general, he was wise enough to let them alone, and leave the Pygmies to manage their own affairs--which, after all, is about the best thing that great people can do for little ones.|$|R
