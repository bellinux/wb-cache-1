5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the <b>Breathalyzer</b> as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a <b>Breathalyzer</b> test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 Robert Frank Borkenstein (1912–2002) was {{a captain}} with the Indiana State Police {{and later a}} {{professor}} at Indiana University Bloomington. His <b>Breathalyzer</b> used chemical oxidation and photometry to determine alcohol concentrations. Subsequent breath analyzers have converted primarily to infrared spectroscopy. The invention of the <b>Breathalyzer</b> provided law enforcement with a non-invasive test providing immediate results to determine an individual's breath alcohol concentration {{at the time of}} testing.|$|E

25|$|Breath analyzers do not {{directly}} measure {{blood alcohol content}} or concentration, which requires the analysis of a blood sample. Instead, they estimate BAC indirectly by measuring the amount of alcohol in one's breath. In general, two types of <b>breathalyzer</b> are used. Small hand-held breathalyzers are not reliable enough to provide evidence in court but reliable enough to justify an arrest. Larger <b>breathalyzer</b> devices found in police stations can then be used to produce court evidence.|$|E
25|$|Breath {{analysis}} {{can be done}} with various forms of mass spectrometry, but there are also simpler methods for specific purposes, such as the Halimeter and the <b>breathalyzer.</b>|$|E
25|$|One major {{application}} for this reaction is in old police <b>breathalyzer</b> tests. When alcohol vapor makes {{contact with the}} orange dichromate-coated crystals, the color changes from orange to green. The degree of the color change {{is directly related to}} the level of alcohol in the suspect's breath.|$|E

25|$|On September 10, 2006, Barry {{was stopped}} by Secret Service Uniformed Division police {{officers}} after stopping at a green light and running a red light. According to a Secret Service spokesman, the police officers pulled over his car, smelled alcohol, and administered a field sobriety test. Barry was then taken to the U.S. Capitol Police station for a <b>breathalyzer</b> test. The Secret Service said that the <b>breathalyzer</b> test did not give an accurate reading, but Barry later said that it gave a successful reading of 0.02%, which {{is less than the}} legal limit of 0.08%. The police officers asked Barry to give a urine analysis, which Barry refused. The officers gave Barry a ticket for running a red light and failing to submit to a urine analysis. He was also charged with driving an unregistered vehicle and misuse of temporary tags. Barry pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors offered Barry a deal to drop the charge of driving under the influence in exchange for a guilty plea from Barry; he declined. A judge found him not guilty of the charges.|$|E
25|$|Acid reflux, or {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease, {{can greatly}} exacerbate the mouth-alcohol problem. The stomach is normally {{separated from the}} throat by a valve, but when this valve becomes herniated, {{there is nothing to}} stop the liquid contents in the stomach from rising and permeating the esophagus and mouth. The contents—including any alcohol—are then later exhaled into the <b>breathalyzer.</b> One study of 10 individuals suffering from this condition did not find any actual increase in Breath Ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Lynch {{was arrested}} on July 14, 2012, by the California Highway Patrol for DUI after he was {{observed}} driving erratically. He {{was reported to have}} registered a 0.10 on the <b>Breathalyzer</b> at Alameda County Sheriff's Office North County Jail in Oakland. He was incarcerated hours before hosting a youth football camp. A motion to dismiss the case was denied in November 2013, but in December the trial date was pushed back until after the NFL season. Lynch's attorney, Ivan Golde, accused the police of bending the truth and changing stories to try to convict Lynch. The case was settled in February 2014 when Lynch pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. Lynch received two years of probation and a $1,033 fine, and had to attend drivers' safety classes, but did not have his license suspended.|$|E

25|$|On August 27, 2009, Gillispie {{was arrested}} at 2:45am in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky for driving under the influence. A {{passenger}} in the 2009 Mercedes Benz C300, Charles O'Connor, {{was arrested and charged}} with alcohol intoxication. According to the police report, an officer saw the vehicle swerving and stopped the driver. The officers who were at the scene smelled a strong odor of alcohol, describing Gillispie's eyes as being red and glassy, with his speech slurred. When asked about his proof of insurance, Gillispie stated that it was in a golf bag in his trunk. He then refused a blood test and a <b>breathalyzer</b> on the scene and was subsequently arrested and taken to the Franklin County jail. Gillispie pleaded not guilty. A judge had scheduled a trial for February 10, 2010 in the case. However, on November 2, 2009, Gillispie changed his plea to guilty under a plea agreement. He was fined $1,028 and must complete an alcohol and drug education course before his Kentucky driver's license can be renewed. He has had two prior DUI arrests, the first in 1999 when he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and improper use of a lane in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving. He was arrested again in 2003 in his first year at the University of Texas at El Paso on suspicion of drunken driving, although it was later dismissed based on a lack of evidence.|$|E
500|$|Harris {{was driving}} his truck {{home on the}} evening of December 1, 1981, when he was pulled over by police. Though no bottles or cans were {{reportedly}} found in the vehicle, a <b>Breathalyzer</b> test returned a blood alcohol reading of [...]16%, leading to his arrest. Harris told an arresting officer at the scene that [...] "if he failed the test, {{that was the end of}} his life." [...] Family members went to the Groveton, Virginia jail where Harris was being held and attempted to have him released into their custody. Their request was denied by a local magistrate. Just past midnight on December 2 Cecil Harris was found dead in his cell, apparently having hanged himself in the interim. It was his 65th birthday.|$|E

On May 11, 2011, four days after scoring six touchdowns for the Slaughter, Grady was sentenced to twenty days in jail for his November drunk driving offense. The sentence included two years of probation, 80 hours of community service, random drug tests, confinement to the state of Michigan until given leave by the judge, and 180 days of car immobilization.

500|$|To {{determine}} the cause of death, the coroner, Gavin Thurston, ordered a post-mortem examination on Hendrix's body, which was performed on September 21 by Professor Robert Donald Teare, a forensic pathologist. Teare reported that Hendrix was [...] "well nourished and muscular", and he identified a quarter-inch scar on Hendrix's left wrist. He said that there were [...] "no stigmata of [...] drug addiction. Once these marks are there , they never go away. In this case, there were no marks at all." [...] Although Teare observed that the right side of Hendrix's heart was widely dilated, he found no evidence of valvular heart disease. He discovered a partially collapsed left lung and 400 ml of fluid in Hendrix's chest. Both lungs were congested, and vomit was found in the smaller bronchi. According to Teare, Hendrix's stomach [...] "contained a medium-sized partially digested meal in which rice could be distinguished." [...] Teare concluded that Hendrix's kidneys were healthy, and his liver was congested. His [...] "bladder was half full of clear urine." [...] He stated that Hendrix's blood alcohol content was 100mg per 100 ml, [...] "enough to fail a <b>breathalyzer</b> test... the equivalent of about four pints of beer." [...] Teare reported that analysis of Hendrix's blood [...] "revealed a mixture of barbiturates consistent with those from Vesparax", and he estimated that drug concentrations translated to ingestion of 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20mg of amphetamine, and 20mg of cannabis. Teare gave the cause of death as: [...] "Inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication." [...] He did not attempt to determine Hendrix's time of death.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>breathalyzer</b> or {{breathalyser}} (a portmanteau {{of breath}} and analyzer/analyser) is a device for estimating blood alcohol content (BAC) from a breath sample. <b>Breathalyzer</b> is the brand name (a genericized trademark) for the instrument that tests the alcohol level developed by inventor Robert Frank Borkenstein.

2500|$|In Canada, a {{preliminary}} non-evidentiary screening device can {{be approved by}} Parliament as an approved screening device, and an evidentiary breath instrument can be similarly designated as an approved instrument. [...] The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains a Conforming Products List of breath alcohol devices approved for evidentiary use, {{as well as for}} preliminary screening use. In order to demand a person produce a <b>breathalyzer</b> sample an officer must have [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] that the person drove with more than 80mg alcohol per 100 mL of blood. The demand must be within three hours of driving. Any driver that refuses can be charged under s.254 of the Criminal Code. Most states, including California and Michigan, have implied consent laws, which means that by applying for a driver's license, drivers are agreeing to take any <b>breathalyzer</b> test under suspicion of a DUI. However, if the officer lacks reasonable suspicion and the person refuses there is no crime since the demand was not lawful and without the <b>breathalyzer</b> readings there is usually not probable grounds for arrest on the above driving over 80 charge.|$|E
