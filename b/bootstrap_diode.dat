40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} High-Side (HS) NMOS power switch and {{bootstrap}} driver with DCM charging phase extension for high-frequency fully-integrated converters with 1. 2 V supply voltage. The conventional <b>bootstrap</b> <b>diode</b> {{is replaced by}} a self-synchronized switch and the efficiency loss and operation failure at DCM is prevented by an extra charging phase. Simulation at 100 MHz with UMC 0. 13 μm process shows that the optimum efficiency is driven 2 % higher with significant power loss reduction by the proposed design compared to a conventional converter under similar operation conditions. 20 % power stage area is saved by the dual NMOS structure compared to the conventional converter with PMOS and NMOS switches. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|For area reasons, NMOS {{transistors}} are preferred over PMOS for {{the pull-up}} path in gate drivers. Bootstrapping has to ensure sufficient NMOS gate overdrive. Especially in high-current gate drivers with large transistors, the bootstrap capacitor {{is too large}} for integration. This paper proposes three options of fully integrated bootstrap circuits. The key {{idea is that the}} main bootstrap capacitor is supported by a second bootstrap capacitor, which is charged to a higher voltage and ensures high charge allocation when the driver turns on. A capacitor sizing guideline and the overall driver implementation including a suitable charge pump for permanent driver activation is provided. A linear regulator is used for bootstrap supply and it also compensates the voltage drop of the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>diode.</b> Measurements from a testchip in 180 nm high-voltage BiCMOS confirm the benefit of high-voltage charge storing. The fully integrated bootstrap circuit with two stacked 75. 8 pF and 18. 9 pF capacitors results in an expected voltage dip of lower than 1 V. Both bootstrap capacitors require 70 % less area compared to a conventional bootstrap circuit. Besides drivers, the proposed bootstrap can also be directly applied to power stages to achieve fully integrated switched mode power supplies or class-D output stages...|$|E

40|$|The ADP 3611 is a dual MOSFET driver {{optimized}} for driving two N−channel switching MOSFETs in nonisolated synchronous buck power converters used to power CPUs in portable computers. The driver impedances {{have been chosen}} to provide optimum performance in multiphase regulators at up to 25 A per phase. The high−side driver can be bootstrapped relative to the switch node of the buck converter and is designed to accommodate the high voltage slew rate associated with floating high−side gate drivers. An internal synchronous MOSFET is used to replace an external <b>bootstrap</b> Schottky <b>diode.</b> This allows a larger high side gate voltage for increased efficiency. The ADP 3611 includes an anticross−conduction protection circuit, undervoltage lockout to hold the switches off until the driver has sufficient voltage for proper operation, a crowbar input that turns on the low−side MOSFET independently of the input signal state, and a low−side MOSFET disable pin to provide higher efficiency at light loads. The SD pin shuts off both the high−side and the low−side MOSFETs to prevent rapid output capacitor discharge during system shutdown. The ADP 3611 is specified over the extended commercial temperature range of − 10 °C to 100 °C and is available in a 10 −lead MSOP package and 8 −lead DFN 2 x 2 mm package...|$|R
40|$|Brief {{description}} of the application circuitry Considerations regarding the bootstrap stage Establishing if IR 2137 can be used directly to control an inverter Criteria for design of the gate resistors Conclusions 1. Brief {{description of}} the application circuitry IR 2137 is a three-phase gate driver with enhanced protection features such as desaturation for the highside devices. The usual application circuitry is presented in Fig. 1. It shows the communication link with the microcontroller stages through the PWM signal {{as well as the}} Fault and Clear_Fault signals. This stage needs a 5 V power supply. The operation mode of the Desat function or over-current protection (ITRIP) are not detailed in this design tip as they are presented in a separate technical paper. This design tip is trying to address the questions regarding the applicability of the IR 2137, the particular design of the bootstrap stage when applied within different PWM converters, to the design of the gate resistors {{as well as to the}} grounding issues. 2. Considerations regarding the bootstrap stage IR 2137 is delivering the control pulses for three-phase inverters that are working under a PWM algorithm. There are different types of PWM algorithms that are currently used by industry. Any particular PWM algorithm defines different values of the minimum and maximum pulse-widths. Since the bootstrap capacitor only charges when the low-side device is on, the duration of this interval should be high enough to ensure the rise of capacitor voltage to VCC. Denoting by R the resistor on the charging path of the <b>bootstrap</b> capacitor (<b>diode</b> plus additional current-limiting resistor), the voltage across the capacitor is given by: ⎡ ⎛ t ⎞⎤ vC (t) = [VCC −V f −VL...|$|R
