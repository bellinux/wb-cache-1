40|$|Abstract—Load-balanced {{switches}} {{have received}} a lot of attention lately as they are much more scalable than other existing switch architectures in the literature. One of the most salient features of load-balanced switches is its simplicity of implementing deterministic and periodic connection patterns for the switch fabrics. In particular, for an N × N load-balanced switch, its switch fabric only needs an N × N rotator that is capable of realizing all the powers of the circular shift permutation. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental update of the number of linecards in load-balanced switches. For this, our idea is to consider a 2 M × 2 M degenerated <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> that only uses half of the 2 M+ 1 inputs/outputs in the classical 2 M+ 1 × 2 M+ 1 <b>banyan</b> <b>network.</b> We show how one can use the 2 M × 2 M degenerated <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> as a p × p rotator for any 2 ≤ p ≤ 2 M. This is done by a specific rule of placing the p linecards in the 2 M input/output ports of the 2 M × 2 M degenerated <b>banyan</b> <b>network.</b> In special, when p = 2 M, the 2 M × 2 M degenerated <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> can also be used as a crosstalk-free 2 M × 2 M rotator, where all the routing paths do not share a common node. As such, one can use a 2 M+ 1 × 2 M+ 1 <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> as the switch fabric for a 2 M × 2 M load-balanced switch that is capable of providing incremental update of the number of linecards.

40|$|AbstractÐIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{design for a}} new {{self-routing}} multicast network which can realize arbitrary multicast assignments between its inputs and outputs without any blocking. The network design uses a recursive decomposition approach {{and is based on}} the binary radix sorting concept. All functional components of the network are reverse banyan networks. Specifically, the new multicast network is recursively constructed by cascading a binary splitting network and two half-size multicast networks. The binary splitting network, in turn, consists of two recursively constructed reverse banyan networks. The first reverse <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> serves as a scatter network and the second reverse <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> serves as a quasisorting network. The advantage of this approach is to provide a way to self-route multicast assignments through the network and a possibility to reuse part of network to reduce the network cost. The new multicast network we design is compared favorably with the previously proposed multicast networks. It uses O…n log 2 n† logic gates, and has O…log 2 n † depth and O…log 2 n † routing time where the unit of time is a gate delay. By reusing part of the network, the feedback implementation of the network can further reduce the network cost to O…n log n†.

Despite many advantages, optical banyan networks suffer from an intrinsic crosstalk problem that must be overcome in building a robust switching system. Vertical stacking of multiple copies of an optical <b>banyan</b> <b>network</b> is a novel scheme for building nonblocking optical switching networks. The resulting network, namely vertically stacked optical banyan (VSOB) network, preserves all the properties of the <b>banyan</b> <b>network,</b> but increases the hardware cost significantly under first order crosstalk-free constraint. Blocking behavior analysis is an effective approach to studying network performance and finding a graceful compromise among hardware cost, crosstalk tolerance and blocking probability. Little is known on analyzing the blocking behavior in such VSOB networks with some degree of crosstalk constraint. In this paper, the implementation of constructing negligible blocking VSOB networks under various small degree crosstalk constraints will be presented.
