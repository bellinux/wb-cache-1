40|$|We {{construct}} N= 1 supersymmetry in 4 + 2 dimensions {{compatible with}} the theoretical framework of 2 T physics field theory and its gauge symmetries. The fields are arranged into 4 + 2 dimensional chiral and vector supermultiplets, and their interactions are uniquely fixed by SUSY and 2 T-physics gauge symmetries. Many 3 + 1 spacetimes emerge from 4 + 2 by gauge fixing. Gauge degrees of freedom are eliminated as one comes down from 4 + 2 to 3 + 1 dimensions without any remnants of Kaluza-Klein modes. In a special gauge, the remaining physical degrees of freedom, and their interactions, coincide with ordinary N= 1 supersymmetric field theory in 3 + 1 dimensions. In this gauge, SUSY in 4 + 2 is interpreted as superconformal symmetry SU(2, 2 | 1) in 3 + 1 dimensions. Furthermore, the underlying 4 + 2 structure imposes some interesting restrictions on the emergent 3 + 1 SUSY field theory, which could be considered {{as part of the}} predictions of 2 T-physics. One of these is the absence of the troublesome renormalizable CP violating F*F terms. This is good for curing the strong CP violation problem of QCD. An additional feature is that the superpotential is required to have no dimensionful parameters. To induce phase transitions, such as SUSY or electro-weak symmetry <b>breaking,</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> the dilaton is needed. This suggests a common origin of phase transitions that is driven by the vacuum value of the dilaton, and need to be understood in a cosmological scenario as part of a unified theory that includes the <b>coupling</b> of supergravity <b>to</b> matter. Another interesting aspect is the possibility to utilize the inherent 2 T gauge symmetry to explore dual versions of the N= 1 theory in 3 + 1 dimensions. This is expected to reveal non-perturbative aspects of ordinary 1 T field theory. Comment: 54 pages, late...|$|R
40|$|If time-translations are spontaneously broken, so are boosts. This {{symmetry}} breaking pattern can be non-linearly {{realized by}} either just the Goldstone boson of time translations, or by four Goldstone bosons associated with time translations and boosts. In this paper we extend the Effective Field Theory of Multifield Inflation {{to consider the}} {{case in which the}} additional Goldstone bosons associated with boosts are light and <b>coupled</b> <b>to</b> the Goldstone boson of time translations. The symmetry <b>breaking</b> pattern forces <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> curvature so that the mass of the additional Goldstone bosons is predicted to be equal to √(2) H {{in the vast majority of}} the parameter space where they are light. This pattern therefore offers a natural way of generating self-interacting particles with Hubble mass during inflation. After constructing the general effective Lagrangian, we study how these particles mix and interact with the curvature fluctuations, generating potentially detectable non-Gaussian signals.

40|$|Direct {{detection}} experiments {{rule out}} fermion dark matter {{that is a}} chiral representation of the electroweak gauge group. Non-chiral real, complex and singlet representations, however, provide viable fermion dark matter candidates. Although {{any one of these}} candidates will be virtually impossible to detect at the LHC, it is shown that they may be detected at future planned direct detection experiments. For the real case, <b>an</b> irreducible radiative <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> quarks may allow a detection. The complex case in general has an experimentally ruled out tree-level <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> quarks via Z-boson exchange. However, in the case of two SU(2) _L doublets, <b>a</b> higher dimensional <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> the Higgs can suppress this <b>coupling,</b> and <b>a</b> remaining irreducible radiative <b>coupling</b> may allow <b>a</b> detection. Singlet dark matter could be detected through <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> quarks via Higgs exchange. Since all non-chiral dark matter can have <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>to</b> the Higgs, at least some of its mass can be obtained from electroweak symmetry breaking, and this mass is a useful characterization of its direct detection cross-section.
