5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health is a priority in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E
5|$|Northern Laos, however, was {{not going}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. {{aircraft}} could be used for interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in South Vietnam. General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial South Vietnam. That decision placed Barrel Roll behind South Vietnam, Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence. Only an estimated two percent of the total U.S. aerial effort in Southeast Asia was going to be utilized in northern Laos.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s, the Boulonnais were {{imported}} {{in large numbers}} to the United States and were quite popular in France; however, the European population suffered severe decreases during 20th-century wars. The breed nearly became extinct following World War II, but rebounded in France in the 1970s as a popular breed for horse meat. Breed numbers remain low; {{it is estimated that}} fewer than 1,000 horses remain in Europe, mostly in France, with a few in other nations. Studies as early as 1983 indicated a danger of inbreeding within the Boulonnais population, and a 2009 report suggested that the breed should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for conservation within France. The smallest type of Boulonnais was originally used to pull carts full of fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris, while the larger varieties performed heavy draft work, both on farms and in the cities. The Boulonnais was also crossbred to create and refine several other draft breeds.|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} administration, Malang {{is divided into}} two regions, Malang City andMalang Regency. Although the regions are different, {{economically}} two regionscan not separated because almost all economic activities are concentrated atMalang City. This has impacts on the economic gap between Malang City andMalang Regency. With respect to gap, the research was conducted to analyze thegrowth center of Regional Development Unit (RDU) of the Malang City, based ontwo development directions: identifying sectoral economic potentials and thatfor regional sowol potentials. In terms of regional aspects, the description of development centers in each RDUare: (1) Ngantang Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the development center of RDU I;(2) Singosari Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the development center of northernRDU II; (3) Pakisaji Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the development center ofsouthern RDU II; (4) Poncokusumo Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the developmentcenter of RDU IV; (5) Kepanjen Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the developmentcenter of RDU V; (6) Pagelaran Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the developmentcenter of RDU VII; and (7) Turen Sub-district <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the developmentcenter of RDU VIII. Since the results has policy impacts, the government of the Malang Regencyshould decide regional development policies referring to the regionaldevelopment concept based on the economic and regional potentials so that itcan give priorities to potential districts to be acted as development centers. Byimplementing the policy, it is expected that economic activities will not beconcentrated on one development point, the Malang City as the only developmentpoint...|$|R

5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{signed the}} Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a {{treaty with the}} Vatican that {{required}} the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches {{and to try to}} weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offenses. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority,</b> but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E
5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working}} on plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given to. The action was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E
5|$|No formula {{could be}} more {{accurate}} than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority,</b> but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for prompt neutrons to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E

5|$|In August 1940, the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{reported}} that the force necessary to hold Malaya and Singapore {{in the absence of}} a fleet was 336 first-line aircraft and a garrison of nine brigades. Churchill then sent reassurances to the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand that, if they were attacked, their defence would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> second only to that of the British Isles. A defence conference was held in Singapore in October 1940. Representatives from all three services attended, including Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton (Commander in Chief, China Station); the General Officer Commanding Malaya Command, Lieutenant General Lionel Bond; and Air Officer Commanding the RAF in the Far East, Air Marshal John Tremayne Babington. Australia was represented by its three deputy service chiefs, Captain Joseph Burnett, Major General John Northcott and Air Commodore William Bostock. Over ten days, they discussed the situation in the Far East. They estimated that the air defence of Burma and Malaya would require a minimum of 582 aircraft. By 7 December 1941, there were only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and all the fighters were the obsolete Brewster F2A Buffalo. The land forces situation was not much better. There were only 31 battalions of infantry of the 48 required, and instead of two tank regiments, there were no tanks at all. Moreover, many of the units on hand were poorly trained and equipped. Yet during 1941 Britain had sent 676 aircraft and 446 tanks to the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|The Energy Policy Act of 2005, {{passed in}} the U.S. House of Representatives, {{did not include a}} {{provision}} for shielding MTBE manufacturers from water contamination lawsuits. This provision was first proposed in 2003 and had been thought by some to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> of Tom DeLay and Rep. Joe Barton, then chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. This bill did include a provision that gives MTBE makers, including some major oil companies, $2 billion in transition assistance while MTBE was phased out over the next nine years. Due to opposition in the Senate, the conference report dropped all MTBE provisions. The final bill was passed by both houses and signed into law by President Bush. The lack of MTBE liability protection is resulting in a switchover to the use of ethanol as a gasoline additive.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to its {{campaign}} pledges, the Mauroy Government established 14,760 new permanent teaching posts {{at the elementary}} and secondary levels in June 1981, and provided for 16,800 more in the 1982 budget and an additional 8,370 in the 1983 budget. A major increase in the modest salaries of elementary school teachers was announced. Technical education at the secondary level was declared to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> area, with special attention in the form of more scholarship money, additional teaching positions, and the commitment of 430million francs per year for three years for the introduction of new technologies into the school programme. However, these actions (particularly the creation of only 400 new technical teachers’ positions in 1981, when enrolment went up by 11,000) were seen as inadequate by the National Union of Technical Education-Autonomous Apprenticeship. In December 1981, a general science programme in the eleventh grade (premier) was created to replace the mathematics programme (the Bac C) which, after the fall from favour of Latin and Greek, had {{come to be known as}} a “royal road into élitist schools and careers.” The Premier S programme was an attempt to postpone definitive scholastic and social segregation, and also to reduce the importance of mathematical aptitude as the primary criterion for selection into élite schools. Greater funds were allocated to education, with the education budget was increased by 17.3% in 1982 and by 15% in 1983. In 1981–82, as a means of tackling cases of education failure, the Ministry of Education subsidized projects designed to help weaker students in 4,500 of the country’s 7,300 secondary schools. Although these subsidies were only of 30million francs, the programme encouraged secondary schools to pay attention to the problem. They were heaviest in designated priority education and action zones.|$|E
