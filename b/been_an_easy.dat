5|$|For {{reasons not}} entirely clear, on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg {{to take his}} {{division}} of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Günzburg to Wertingen {{in preparation for the}} main Austrian advance out of Ulm. Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions– Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Nicolas Oudinot's grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians lost nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner. The Battle of Wertingen had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> French victory.|$|E

25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Hamilton was booed by the crowd. In the podium interview, conducted by Spanish TV presenter Noemi de Miguel, he shrugged off the reaction, saying: [...] "That's not my problem, it's theirs." [...] Both Hamilton and Verstappen expressed delight at their result, while Räikkönen {{said that it}} had not <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> day for the team, stressing that Ferrari had not achieved what they could have, since he felt that he could have overtaken Verstappen towards the end. Hamilton's win was the 250th victory by a British driver in Formula One and his first at the Spielberg circuit.|$|E

However, in August 2012, Iger announced that Whedon would return to write and direct the sequel and develop the Marvel television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., for ABC. Later in the month, Disney set a May 1, 2015 release date. When asked about his decision to return, Whedon said, [...] "Avengers 2, it wasn't a tough decision.

Then when I actually started to consider it, it became so clear that I desperately wanted to say more about these characters, it would've <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> no and it was a spectacularly easy yes. There was no wrestling." [...] Whedon said that they intended for the film's production to not be as rushed as the first one.|$|E
500|$|The ship's Armed Guard {{ordered the}} machine guns {{to be turned}} on the torpedo racing towards them. Newports {{merchant}} seamen loading the guns lost their nerve and scrambled to the ship's port side. One gunner remained at his post, directing bullets at the torpedo; but these were deflected by the water. The torpedo slammed into the ship's engine-room, tearing a gaping hole and knocking the steering gear out of action with an enormous explosion. The helpless ship was yawing out of control across the sixth and seventh columns of the convoy, narrowly missing collisions with other ships, before she lurched round {{in the opposite direction}} to that of the convoy and slowed to a standstill. The surviving ships rolled past her, and the convoy sped on in the fog. Christopher Newport (code-number in the convoy, 'Penway' [...] ) wirelessed the leading ship : 'Hit by aerial torpedo.' The Convoy Commander, Jack Broome, ordered Ledbury, [...] and [...] to '...take all possible action to keep U-boats down.' Ledbury was one of the ships chosen to stay behind to tend to, and if necessary scuttle, the torpedoed ship and they themselves could have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target to any submarines; however, none of the U-boats had maintained contact with the convoy.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums {{to let you know that}} they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
500|$|The NSW backs, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Verge and Wickham, did not play very well in the two inter-state matches, but the forwards, ahead of the match against the British Isles touring team, were seen to be good. The British team, in contrast, led by David Bedell-Sivright, arrived in Australia with a reputation for the excellence of its back line. The tourists' first game was against NSW on 18 June in front of 35,000 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The game had barely begun when the visitors were already attacking the tryline and NSW was forced to defend. Percy Bush, the British halfback, scored a drop goal within the first ten minutes, and soon after the British scored a try. They were proving to be very quick and aggressive, and the home side had to defend right on its tryline for much of the first half, which ended 0–12. Another try came for the British within three minutes of the second half. NSW's chance to score came when Britain was penalised inside its 25 [...] but Wickham missed what should have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> goal. Instead the visitors scored another two converted tries and ended victors, 0–27. It was said by The Sunday Times that it was the best rugby team to have visited Australia, whether from Britain or New Zealand. NSW played well but were [...] "outclassed in every point of play"; Verge, for his part, did [...] "as well as could be expected", although his attempt at a drop goal in the second half failed.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as the show's heart and moral conscience, {{the flaws in}} Gwen's own morality are explored throughout the series; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish. The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode [...] "Countrycide" [...] was deliberately structured {{in order to make}} the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life. For Davies, the dalliance is a [...] "human" [...] one, told in an adult manner characterised by [...] "lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair". Myles commented that Gwen's compromised morality, as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience, and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were [...] "safe" [...] from temptation. Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character. Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate, Walker claimed it would have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> trap to make her a [...] "one-dimensional paragon of virtue". Instead, the writers made Gwen more [...] "realistic" [...] by giving her [...] "distinct human failings", which Walker felt made her [...] "arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars". He identified these failures as her [...] "tendency towards egotism", [...] "self-righteousness", and [...] "selfishness", evident in her [...] "highly questionable treatment" [...] of boyfriend Rhys Williams. Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example, as well as the scene in [...] "Combat" [...] where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won't remember.|$|E

On the play before the touchdown, Reich had thrown the ball right {{into the hands of}} defensive back Richard Shelton while trying to connect with Beebe, but Shelton dropped the pass, costing his team what would have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> touchdown return. [...] "I was just running before I caught the ball, and that really hurt", Shelton said after the game. [...] "I could have had six." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two decades later, Strickler still {{disagreed}} with the Court. [...] "This had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> case for the lower courts and, I think, rightfully so", he told the Freedom Forum. Justice Brennan had been right, he said, [...] "that public employees are more at risk for expressing dissent." [...] He also called its standard [...] "not very workable", due to conflicting opinions from lower courts trying to apply it. Wessel characterized the speech as [...] "petty bickering" [...] and called the Court's ruling [...] "a common-sense approach." [...] Myers' questionnaire [...] "was nearly 100 percent internal".|$|E

[...] "Applying those subjective terms to Officer Roe's videotapes may have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task," [...] he wrote. [...] "But they could prove perilous in future cases involving, for example, supermarket tabloids or gossipy Web sites." ...|$|E

[...] But then he dropped a fly ball hit by Brooks Robinson with two outs in the 9th inning of a 5–4 Red Sox loss to the Baltimore Orioles on May 27. It should have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> catch, but Geiger bobbled it when he and two other Red Sox players tried to glove it. The error was the first by Boston in ten games.

2500|$|In 1817 the British naval {{architect}} Sir Robert Seppings first introduced {{the concept of}} the round or circular stern. The square stern had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target for enemy cannon, and could not support the weight of heavy stern chase guns. But Seppings' design left the rudder head exposed, and was regarded by many as simply ugly—no American warships were designed with such sterns, and the round stern was quickly superseded by the elliptical stern. The United States began building the first elliptical stern warship in 1820, a decade before the British. [...] became the first sailing ship to sport such a stern. Though a great improvement over the transom stern in terms of its vulnerability to attack when under fire, elliptical sterns still had obvious weaknesses which the next major stern development—the iron-hulled cruiser stern—addressed far better and with much different materials.|$|E
2500|$|... 1925 {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in Kern's career when he met Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he would {{entertain}} a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, [...] "I hear you're {{a son of a}} bitch. [...] So am I." [...] He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. [...] With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Their first show, written together with Harbach, was Sunny, which featured the song [...] "Who (Stole My Heart Away)?" [...] Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in Sally. [...] The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan.|$|E

2500|$|It is also umpire's {{interference}} when an umpire {{is struck}} by a fair batted ball before it touches a fielder including the pitcher or passes near an infielder other than the pitcher. [...] This can occur either because an umpire is inside the diamond or because the ball crosses 1st or 3rd base in fair territory then hooks or slices foul into the umpire positioned just outside the line behind the bag. [...] In this case, the ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, and all other runners advance only if forced. [...] A common example is when a batter hits a fair ball down the first base line so hard that the first base umpire can't avoid it. Even though the hit would have surely been a bases-clearing double or triple without the interference, {{it is only a}} single and runners advance no more than one base. [...] This happened in the 1989 All-Star Game when the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bobby Bonilla led off the 9th with a scorching grounder that would have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> double, but it hit first base umpire Bob Engel in the legs as he tried to jump out of the way. [...] Instead of being in scoring position down 5–3, Bonilla was forced out at 2nd the next play and the game ended on a double play.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1922, the Allies {{proposed}} an armistice. Feeling {{that he now}} held the strategic advantage, Mustafa Kemal declined any settlement while the Greeks remained in Anatolia and intensified his efforts to re-organise the Turkish military for the final offensive against the Greeks. At the same time, the Greeks strengthened their defensive positions, but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war. The Greek government was desperate to get some military support by the British or at least secure a loan, so it developed an ill-thought plan to force the British diplomatically, by threatening their positions in Constantinople, but this never materialised. The occupation of Constantinople would have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> task at this time because the Allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the Greek forces in Thrace (two divisions). The end result though was instead to weaken the Greek defences in Smyrna by withdrawing troops. [...] The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were recipients of significant assistance from Soviet Russia. On 29 April, the Soviet authorities supplied the Turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition, sufficient for three Turkish divisions. [...] On 3 May, the Soviet government handed over 33,500,000 gold rubles to Turkey—the balance of the credit of 10,000,000 gold rubles.|$|E
