5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand phaser, a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or <b>by</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> certain items in the game environment.|$|E
5|$|Lost Coast {{uses the}} same first-person shooter {{gameplay}} mechanics as Half-Life 2. The game is viewed {{from the perspective of}} the player character, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. A heads-up display at the bottom of the screen shows the player's health, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished <b>by</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from Half-Life 2 at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead <b>by</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. <b>By</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health <b>by</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> food items that randomly {{appear in the}} ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E

25|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of violence}} in slums is armed violence (gun violence), mostly existing in African and Latin American slums.

Gang and drug wars are endemic in some slums, predominantly between male residents of slums. The police sometimes participate in gender-based violence against men as well <b>by</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> some men, beating them and putting them in jail. Domestic violence against men also exists in slums, including verbal abuses and even physical violence from households.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{files were}} {{distributed}} by point-to-point technology: {{with a central}} uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, {{a large number of}} downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the more downloaders the faster the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader <b>by</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.|$|E
