5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a <b>box</b> <b>unit,</b> and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E

2500|$|As the 1977 models arrived, the {{engineering}} upgrades {{seen on the}} 258 six the year before finally saw {{the light on the}} 282. An all-new head design with Quench-type combustion chambers took compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity. The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns {{and for the first time}} since 1972 reclining mechanism (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanism were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear.

New decals covering only the front fenders in their top sides started near the doors all the way to the marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a [...] "Rally 4.6" [...] sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option.

40|$|Abstract—In popular {{symmetric}} ciphers, S-box substitution is {{the core}} operation that dominates executions of cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, a method of application-specific instruction-set extension is used for accelerating the key operation in symmetric cryptography. Two instructions for S-box access are designed by constructing a novel flexible on-chip parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> that consists of multiple lookup tables and a post-processing module. The <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> is integrated into the 32 -bit configurable Leon 2 processor. Configuration of Leon 2 is presented. Implementing this extended processor core on Virtex-II XC 2 V 3000 FPGA shows that the parallel substitution <b>box</b> <b>unit</b> uses very small amount of hardware resources (1 KB of memory and some logic circuits). Evaluation {{of the performance of}} S-box access instructions for AES is conducted according to Amdahl Law, and the results show that overall speedup of greater than 2 can be achieved.

Tobacco BY- 2 cells were immobilized in a semi- solid agarose matrix that was reinforced by a nylon mesh. This assembly allowed liquid medium refreshment, oxygen supply and chemical fixation, including a post- fixative wash. The method was optimized for post- flight analysis of cell structure,shape and size, cell division, and the microtubule cytoskeleton. The viability of cells in the agarose matrix was similar to cells grown in liquid medium under laboratory conditions, only the stationary growth phase was reached six days late...|$|R
