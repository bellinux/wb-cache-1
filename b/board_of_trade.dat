5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade,</b> I and 1999's Chicago <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trade,</b> II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is {{in the collection of}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
