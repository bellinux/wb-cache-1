2500|$|In {{response}} to the LGBT community being left [...] "very disgruntled" [...] with the Reese and Bianca storyline, Braun said, [...] "I am sorry they were not happy, because one of my main reasons for taking this role was {{to be able to}} give a positive voice to same-sex couples." [...] Braun agreed that [...] "the issues" [...] went [...] "off-point" [...] and that she understood why it was difficult for viewers to root for the Reese and Bianca couple. She thanked the viewers who supported the pairing despite the way the romance was told. [...] "I was shocked by [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was not the story they wanted," [...] she said, [...] "but they were so happy to be represented on TV and on a soap." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "On {{what other}} account? Mr. Gilmore? Indeed, indeed, I am not {{thinking}} of him. He is {{out of my mind}} altogether. I say it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is impossible that you and your cousin should be married, and because such an engagement is destructive to both the parties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{told you}} that?" [...] Sam said. [...] "If I staid, <b>it</b> was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't be long until I got {{the upper hand}} of the gang, an I've done it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} the sheep-faced feeling, Ralph?" [...] asked Harry mischievously. And {{probably}} my frown betrayed me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> well, though there was some consolation in the thought that this reckless wanderer of the ranges <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> also.|$|R
5000|$|He {{had spoken}} of the {{influencing}} experience boxing has had upon his early life, by stating: [...] "I didn't do too well at school, to be honest, but boxing saved me and changed my life. And {{it was going}} well, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was my best chance in life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew I shouldn't go far {{wrong in}} putting {{you on the}} window. The fact is, you and me are gentlemen, mind you I wouldn't say this in the department, but you and me are gentlemen, and that always tells. It's no good your telling me it doesn't tell, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> does tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] said Utterson; [...] "I know it {{must seem}} strange. The fact is, if I {{do not ask}} you {{the name of the}} other party it is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been inexact in any point, you had better correct it." ...|$|E
60|$|It is even {{difficult}} for me to believe that there was a gap of full two months between my return to Salem House and the arrival of that birthday. I can only understand that the fact was so, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> must have been so; otherwise I should feel convinced that there was no interval, and that the one occasion trod upon the other's heels.|$|E
5000|$|Anthony Michael Hall, who {{was cast}} as Bill Gates, commented on his {{interest}} in the role, stating that he, [...] "really fought for this part <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be the role of a lifetime ... it was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mellencamp concluded: [...] "I {{related to}} that song ever since I was like 17 years old". Sad Clowns: Mellencamp told Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "As soon as I wrote that, I looked up and said, 'Thanks, Ray.' <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it's</b> a Ray Davies song, like 'Sunny Afternoon' - a self-deprecating song".|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{go to see}} her. I met her in the street, just as she {{was leaving}} Miss Chancellor's door. I spoke to her, and {{accompanied}} her some distance. I passed that way <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was the direct way to Cambridge--from the Common--and I was coming out to see you any way--on the chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hear me, rascal!' said Mr Chuzzlewit. 'I have summoned {{you here}} to witness your own work. I have summoned {{you here to}} witness it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will be gall and {{wormwood}} to you! I have summoned you here to witness it, because I know the sight of everybody here must be a dagger in your mean, false heart! What! do you know me as I am, at last!' ...|$|E
60|$|IT is {{injuring}} some hearts, those hearts that elegantly {{bear the}} impression of the good Creator, {{to say to them}} you give them the trouble of obliging a friend; for this reason, I only tell you that I gratify my own feelings in requesting your friendly offices with respect to the enclosed, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will gratify yours to assist me in it to the utmost of your power.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, unkind, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is {{best for}} you not to come to see me, and you know it, and yet you will not help me when I {{try to do what}} is right. I shall be blamed for these visits," [...] she said. The young ladies in the novels always were. But it was a serious matter for poor Cynthia, and her voice trembled a little. Her {{troubles}} seemed very real.|$|E
5000|$|... “I have a keen {{interest}} in Uzbek culture and I am eager to see with my own eyes everything that will take place as part of this year’s festival.

6000|$|... "I {{opened the}} street door {{and went up}} stairs, and heard him {{sleeping}} his heavy sleep, exactly as I had heard him when I went out. I sat down on my bed and took off my bonnet, quite quiet in myself, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was to be. I damped the towel, and put it ready, and took a turn in the room.|$|R
5000|$|Hunter told Taste of Country {{about writing}} the song: [...] "At the time, I {{was trying to}} tell {{somebody}} something, but I couldn't figure out how to say it. So I wanted to say <b>it</b> in music <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be a little more impactful. I wanted to say we are great in this relationship together, and I feel like it could even get better." ...|$|R
60|$|No doubt I see this, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is so; but I am astray, {{and seem}} to see nothing. Nor do I believe {{anything}} whatever. Still, as we drive along in an open carriage, this fairy marriage is real enough to fill me {{with a sort of}} wondering pity for the unfortunate people who have no part in it, but are sweeping out the shops, and going to their daily occupations.|$|E
60|$|All this I tell you, my dear, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will {{interest}} you. I like Washington very well. (Did {{you see my}} {{last letter}} in the New York Times of October 4th, Sunday?) I {{have three or four}} hours' work every day copying, and in writing letters for the press, etc.; make enough to pay my way--live in an inexpensive manner anyhow. I like the mission I am on here, and as it deeply holds me I shall continue.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I do {{myself the}} honour of {{speaking}} to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> to be the established custom of your sex to reject {{a man on the}} first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character." ...|$|E
60|$|A chill crept {{through my}} bones. I had {{accepted}} Lady Pollacke's invitation, thinking my mere presence would be entertainment enough, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> {{was important to}} see life, and immensely important to see Mr Crimble. In actual fact it seemed I had hopped for a moment not out of my cage, but merely, as Fanny had said, into another compartment of it.|$|R
5000|$|... 10/28/12 - Scores of Scares: It was a creepy “Night on the Bare Mountain” {{when that}} “Psycho” “Harry Potter” grabbed {{a bottle of}} “Beetlejuice” in his “Jaws” and {{told me about the}} night he and “Young Frankenstein” took some “Gremlins” to see “The Dance of the Witches.” I’ll never forget “The Day the Earth Stood Still” <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would never scare me as much as “Ed Wood.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Max Cavalera {{and his son}} Igor Cavalera Jr. {{wrote and}} sing this song together. Igor's punk vocals {{satisfied}} Max by explaining to Metal Exiles, [...] "I needed a punk vocalist for the chorus and I was missing a punk vocalist to go with my vocals for the chorus. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Igor had a great punk voice so <b>I</b> called him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be cool to sing with my son on the song." ...|$|R

'I don't {{know who}} she may be, or what she may be,' he said: 'but I pity her {{with all my heart}} and soul; and I can't help her, nor can I any of the people against whom a hundred tricks, but none so vile as this, are plotted every day! Well, that adds to my pain, but not to theirs. The thing is no worse <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> and it tortures me as well as them. Gride and Nickleby! Good pair for a curricle. Oh roguery! roguery! roguery!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} twitted in print before now with rather {{flattering}} actors when I address them {{as one of}} their trustees at their General Fund dinner. Believe me, I flatter nobody, unless it be sometimes myself; but, in such a company as the present, I always feel it my manful duty to bear my testimony to this fact--first, because it is opposed to a stupid, unfeeling libel; secondly, because my doing so may afford some slight encouragement to the persons who are unjustly depreciated; and lastly, and most of all, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is the truth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me say one thing," [...] he said. [...] "If ever {{you do and}} I {{can help}} you in any way, by advice or inquiry or recommendation--You see, I'm no believer in {{feminine}} incapacity, but I do perceive {{there is such a}} thing as feminine inexperience. As a sex you're a little under-trained--in affairs. I'd take it--forgive me if I seem a little urgent--as a sort of proof of friendliness. I can imagine nothing more pleasant in life than to help you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> would pay to help you. There's something about you, a little flavor of Will, I suppose, that makes one feel--good luck about you and success...." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, {{during a}} dance tour in Europe with The Australian Ballet, he was {{discovered}} by a Russian fashion photographer. Hamilton stopped dancing {{at the age of}} 20 and decided to pursue a career as a model. Hamilton later said, [...] "Dancing was too confining and regimented for me. ... I became a model not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was interested in fashion or styles, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a good way to see the world. ... It gave me independence[...]. The money was good too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt--it is <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>it</b> {{will make}} you a popular and a famous actress. You will gain this. I wonder what you will lose." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Rawlings, [...] "I Dream a Highway" [...] {{had never}} been played before it was recorded. [...] "So, we played it twice and I edited both {{versions}} together.

6000|$|... 'MY DEAR AND GOOD FRIEND,--What do {{you think}} of me that I do not [...] write so long time? Excuse me, my good mamma, for I was so busy in [...] these days I could not do this {{pleasant}} thing. I write English [...] without the fear that you laugh at it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is more [...] agreeable to read the own language, and I think you are not [...] excepted of this rule. It is good of me, for the expressions of [...] love and regard, made with faults, take the funny appearance; they [...] are ridicule, and instead to go to the heart, they make the [...] laugh. Never mind, I do it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{hope this}} letter is not an impertinence. I have just been turning about, with my head full of Spenser and Shakespeare and [...] "Gil Blas," [...] looking for {{something}} in our own present day literature to which I could surrender myself as to those five gripping old writings. And nothing could I find until I took up [...] "Life on the Mississippi," [...] and [...] "Huckleberry Finn," [...] and, just now, the [...] "Connecticut Yankee." [...] It isn't the first time I have read any of these three, and it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> won't be the last, because these books {{are the only ones}} written in my lifetime that claim my unreserved interest and admiration and, above all, my feelings, that I've felt I had to write this letter.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to tell you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will be so disheartening after my last letter, that I am not so well as I was then, and {{that there has been}} a sort of hitch in the proceedings. After I had been treated for {{rheumatism}} a few days longer (in which treatment they pricked the place with a long needle several times,) I saw that Dr. Chestman was in doubt about something, and I requested that he would call in a brother professional man to see me as well. They consulted together and then told me that rheumatism was not the disease after all, but erysipelas. They then began treating it differently, as became a different matter. Blisters, flour, and starch, seem to be the order of the day now--medicine, of course, besides.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2011, Hibbert {{stated that}} the band had demo'd four songs for their second album {{and that it would}} be similar in style to the Wintering EP, that [...] "I want to get the second album done quickly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it's</b> going to have a lot of {{elements}} like that on it". In September 2011 the band posted a demo of new song 'Waterlight Park' online, a song similar in style to the material from the 'Wintering EP' and was set to feature on the band's next album.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} [...] "Antes de Você" [...] ("Before You"), and it {{received}} radio airplay on May 7.
