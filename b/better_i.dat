500|$|Barnes {{was made}} captain of New South Wales for the 1946–47 Australian season, though he only managed to play three matches {{for the state}} team. One of those was the match against the touring MCC team, and Barnes was {{approached}} during the match about becoming an opening batsman for the forthcoming Test series. He wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I had never opened before and was a little dubious. I had, however, struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that." [...] He also {{liked the idea of}} batting ahead of Bradman in the batting order: [...] "Much <b>better,</b> <b>I</b> thought, to get in before him than to come later, like flat beer after champagne." ...|$|E
500|$|Bohr {{read the}} 19th-century Danish Christian existentialist philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard. Richard Rhodes argued in The Making of the Atomic Bomb that Bohr was {{influenced}} by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's Stages on Life's Way as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, [...] "It {{is the only thing}} I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything <b>better...</b> <b>I</b> even think {{it is one of the}} most delightful things I have ever read." [...] Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with Kierkegaard's philosophy. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an atheist.|$|E

[...] "I regret that we couldn't have controlled Morrison <b>better...</b> <b>I</b> think he would have been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E

[...] The Breeders re-recorded [...] "Son of Three" [...] in July 2002 for its release as Title TKs third single; this version is faster than the album track, and reflects the speed they were playing the song in concert that year. The lyrics of both [...] "Son of Three" [...] and [...] "The She" [...] suggest extended road trips with unknown outcomes. The album's next song, [...] "Put on a Side", has a distinctive bassline and a cramped, repressive feel. Berger wrote that Kim Deal's [...] "voice grinds sweetly, weariedly, sloppily inside your brain," [...] as she repeats twelve words {{over the course of the}} song: [...] "Better I <b>better</b> <b>I</b> stayed up / Better mono, put on a side." ...|$|E

Harkins stated that he ordered Wilson to report to Lodge. Harkins then reported that he was undertaking [...] "a field trip", believed to {{be an attempt to}} lobby Saigon-based forces to join the coup. Harkins was later reported to have said in response to Khánh's asking whether he objected to a coup, [...] "No, I think you are a very fine general." [...] Afterwards, when asked why he had not tipped off the junta, Harkins said that the ruling officers [...] "weren't getting along anyway, so maybe it was a change for the <b>better.</b> <b>I</b> thought it was." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the management's {{rejection}} of the track, Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels. It was also given to English singer-songwriter Taio Cruz, who failed to convince his record company to release it. It was then opted by Island Def Jam chairman Antonio [...] "L.A." [...] Reid, a friend of Stewart who established his first studio. By early February 2007, the demo was sent to Reid's right-hand woman, A executive Karen Kwak, who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna, who was working on her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad, at the time. Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna, who was also positive of it: [...] "When the demo first started playing, I was like, This is interesting, this is weird.... But the song kept getting <b>better.</b> <b>I</b> listened to it over and over. I said, 'I need this record. I want to record it tomorrow." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Jackson starred as Scarecrow in {{the film}} musical The Wiz. The musical scores were {{arranged}} by Quincy Jones, who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album Off the Wall. Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs and panthers {{in order to learn}} graceful movements for his part. Jones recalled working with Jackson as one of his favorite experiences from The Wiz, and spoke of Jackson's dedication to his role, comparing his acting style to Sammy Davis, Jr. Critics panned The Wiz upon its October 1978 release. Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed [...] "genuine acting talent" [...] and [...] "provided the only genuinely memorable moments." [...] Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: [...] "I don't think it could have been any <b>better,</b> <b>I</b> really don't". In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was [...] "my greatest experience so far...I'll never forget that".|$|E
500|$|In December 2015, astronomers at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) {{detected}} a brief series of 350GHz pulses that they concluded must either be {{a series of}} independent sources, or a single, fast moving source. Deciding that the latter was the most likely, they calculated based on its speed that, were it bound to the Sun, the object, which they named [...] "Gna" [...] after a fast-moving messenger goddess in Norse mythology, would be about 12–25 AU distant and have a dwarf planet-sized diameter of 220 to 880km. However, {{if it were a}} rogue planet not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and as far away as 4000 AU, it could be much larger. The paper was never formally accepted, and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed. Scientists' reactions to the notice were largely sceptical; Mike Brown commented that, [...] "If it is true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer solar system object in its tiny, tiny, tiny, field of view, that would suggest that there are something like 200,000 Earth-sized planets in the outer solar system ... Even <b>better,</b> <b>I</b> just realized that this many Earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the entire solar system and we would all die." ...|$|E

500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the <b>better.</b> <b>I</b> wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him.

[...] The film received a positive critique for its elaborate set design, and the book American Jewish Filmmakers noted that it [...] "features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films." [...] In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song [...] "Ease on Down the Road", [...] "the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted mess that runs 135 agonizing minutes." [...] A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as [...] "a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess", and felt that the singing – especially Diana Ross's – was [...] "a marvel".|$|E
500|$|Lazenby said he {{experienced}} difficulties during shooting, not receiving any coaching despite {{his lack of}} acting experience, and with director Hunt never addressing him directly, only through his assistant. Lazenby also declared that Hunt also asked {{the rest of the}} crew to keep a distance from him, as [...] "Peter thought the more I was alone, the <b>better</b> <b>I</b> would be as James Bond." [...] Allegedly, there also were personality conflicts with Rigg, who was already an established star. However, according to director Hunt, these rumours are untrue and there were no such difficulties—or else they were minor—and may have started with Rigg joking to Lazenby before filming a love scene [...] "Hey George, I'm having garlic for lunch. I hope you are!" [...] Hunt also declared that he usually had long talks with Lazenby before and during shooting. For instance, to shoot Tracy's death scene, Hunt brought Lazenby to the set at 8 o'clock in the morning and made him rehearse all day long, [...] "and I broke him down until he was absolutely exhausted, and by the time we shot it at five o'clock, he was exhausted, and that's how I got the performance." [...] Hunt said that if Lazenby had remained in the role, he would also have directed the successor film, Diamonds Are Forever, and that his original intentions were concluding the film with Bond and Tracy driving off following their wedding, saving Tracy's murder for the pre-credit sequence of Diamonds Are Forever. The idea was discarded after Lazenby quit the role.|$|E

On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to me. It was a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E
