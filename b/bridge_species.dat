40|$|The 129 Xe nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) of xenon gas sorbed in zeolites has been combined with other experimental methods to characterize the state of ruthenium contained in Y-type zeolites at various stages of catalyst treatment. The adsorption of carbon monoxide on ruthenium and rhodium in Y zeolites has been investigated using high resolution magic-angle spinning NMR methods. ^ The xenon NMR experiments, combined with volumetric oxidation/reduction experiments and transmission electron microscopy, reveal {{that most of the}} ruthenium is highly dispersed and occupies the faujasite supercages upon initial ion exchange. Initial exposure to hydrogen gas at room temperature causes nearly complete reduction of Ru 3 + to Ru 0. Exposure of the reduced catalyst to oxygen at elevated temperatures results in quantitative oxidation to RuO 2, and no detectable migration of the ruthenium species accompanies this oxidation. Reduced ruthenium, however, is found to migrate to the exteriors of the zeolite crystallites upon high temperature treatment, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. ^ Three types of adsorbed carbon monoxide, linear, <b>bridging,</b> and dicarbonyl <b>species,</b> are identified in ruthenium and rhodium exchanged zeolites by 13 C magic-angle spinning NMR. In ruthenium-Y zeolites the <b>bridging</b> <b>species</b> is found to be thermally activated; whereas, this species forms at ambient temperatures in rhodium exchanged Y zeolites. This <b>bridging</b> <b>species</b> is inhibited in Rh-Y zeolites when the sodium co-cation is replaced by calcium or hydrogen.

This paradigm is used to infer epidemiological interactions {{in the context of}} Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) maintenance and spread at the interface between wild and domestic birds in a southern African ecosystem. We counted and sampled waterfowl community every two months during two years in the Chivero-Manyame catchment, an important wetland of Zimbabwe. We used the overlap in space and time of bird communities combined with ecological dynamic and non-dynamic risk factors to evaluate a risk of AIV maintenance in waterfowl and a risk of transmission of AIV to the domestic populations (backyard and intensive poultry, farmed ostriches) through the identification of potential ''bridge species''. We tested the validity of this risk model using: 1) AIV prevalence data in the waterfowl community estimated in parallel with counting; 2) AIV prevalence data in <b>bridge</b> <b>species</b> identified. The waterfowl risk identified is related to the AIV prevalence but with time lag. Prevalence in the potential <b>bridge</b> <b>species</b> indicates that some of them can play a role as <b>bridge</b> <b>species</b> in the ecosystem. We believe this protocol is a) reproducible using available bird census data and useful to explore AIV risk and identify wild bird species potentially acting as reservoir or spreader of pathogens at a local scale; b) {{can be used as a}} management tool to improve surveillance at a local level.

However, strong interspecific hybridization barriers exist between them. A comparative study of two wide hybridization approaches for introgressing C. baccatum genes into C. annuum was performed: i) genetic bridge (GB) using C. chinense and C. frutescens as bridge species; and, ii) direct cross between C. annuum and C. baccatum combined with in vitro embryo rescue (ER). A diverse and representative collection of 18 accessions from four cultivated species of Capsicum was used, including C. annuum (12), C. baccatum (3), C. chinense (2), and C. frutescens (1). More than 5000 crosses were made and over 1000 embryos were rescued in the present study. C. chinense performed as a good <b>bridge</b> <b>species</b> between C. annuum and C. baccatum, with the best results being obtained with the cross combination [C. baccatum (♀) × C. chinense (♂) ] (♀) × C. annuum (♂), while C. frutescens gave poor results as <b>bridge</b> <b>species</b> due to strong prezygotic and postzygotic barriers. Virus-like-syndrome or dwarfism was observed in F 1 hybrids when both C. chinense and C. frutescens were used as female parents.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop upland cotton plants {{resistant}} to Rotylenchulus reniformis Lind. & Oliveira reniform nematode, a three-species hybrids including Gossypium hirsutum L. (2 n = 4 x = 52, (AD) 1 genome) was created using G. longicalyx Hutch & Lee as donor parent (2 n = 2 x = 26, F 1 genome) and G. thurberi Tod. (2 n = 2 x = 26, D 1 genome) as <b>bridge</b> <b>species.</b> The morphology and the resistance to reniform nematode of the parents and of thirty plants belonging to the selfed progeny of G. hirsutum x G. longicalyx x G. thurberi (HLT) trispecific hybrid were assessed. G. longicalyx, G. hirsutum x G. longicalyx hexaploid and all the thirty plants issued from the selfing of HLT hybrid were very resistant to reniform nematode unlike G. hirsutum which was very sensitive to it. Cytogenetic studies showed that HLT hybrid and its direct progeny have 52 chromosomes as the main cotton cultivated species. HLT hybrid shows a good pollen fertility and {{a very high level}} of chromosome pairing at metaphase I. It is self fertile but presents important incompatibility barriers when crossed as female parent with G. hirsutum. The prospects to develop upland cotton commercial cultivars resistant to reniform nématodes from the available interspecific genetic stocks are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} the {{potential}} rodent-borne zoonotic helminths in wild-caught murid rodents from four categorized habitats-forest, nonflooded land, irrigated land, and human settlement in seven localities of Thailand, Cambodia, and Lao PDR. Out of 2478 rodent samples, 735 (29. 7 %) were infected {{by at least}} one of the following zoonotic helminth species: Echinostoma malayanum, Echinostoma ilocanum, Plagiorchis muris, Raillietina spp., Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, Cyclodontostomum purivisi, and Moniliformis moniliformis. Raillietina spp. showed the highest prevalence (13. 8 %), followed by H. diminuta (8. 6 %), H. nana (6. 7 %), and C. purvisi (1. 0 %). Habitat affected the intensity of helminth infection in murid rodent hosts. Specific habitats favoring each zoonotic helminth species are discussed in relation to the risk of human infection. Season and host maturity influenced intensity of total zoonotic helminths, but there was no influence of host gender. However, in terms of individual helminth species, female rodents were more infected by E. malayanum, E. ilocanum, and C. purvisi than males. Among the rodent species, Rattus tanezumi seems to play the most important role as a reservoir by hosting seven zoonotic heminth species. This rat is ubiquitously found in all types of the habitats, suggesting that it can act as an important <b>bridge</b> <b>species,</b> carrying parasites across different habitats.

40|$|To introgress {{resistance}} to Rotylenchulus reniformis from the East African wild diploid species Gossypium longicalyx Hutch & Lee into upland cotton, crosses involving G. hirsutum as the recipient species, G. longicalyx as the donor species and several D genome species (G. thurberi, G. harknessii, G. davidsonii, G. armourianum, G. gossypoïdes, G. aridum, G. raimondii) as <b>bridge</b> <b>species</b> were made. Only the combination [(G. hirsutum x G. thurberi) x G. longicalyx] gave seeds (10 seeds from 34 crosses) that produced viable plants (9 plants). These hybrids were denoted as HTL. The use of SSR markers revealed the {{presence in the}} hybrid of G. hirsutum, G. thurberi and G. longicalyx specific alleles proving {{the success of the}} crosses. GISH analysis confirmed this result showing the presence of 13 G. longicalyx chromosomes among the 52 of the hybrid. Three HTL hybrid plants evaluated under controlled conditions following inoculation revealed a high level of {{resistance to}} R. reniformis equivalent to that of the diploid donor species. All HTL hybrid plants were self-sterile and photoperiodic. Backcrosses achieved using them as female parents gave seeds that produced viable plants. A total of 13 HTL BC 1 plants were tested for their resistance to R. reniformis. Among them, nine were resistant (5 highly resistant and 4 resistant) and four were susceptible. The potential for development of commercial cotton with resistance to reniform nematodes is discussed...|$|E
