25|$|In the 15th century, the Dutch {{developed}} {{a type of}} seagoing herring drifter that became a blueprint for European fishing boats. This was the Herring Buss, used by Dutch herring fishermen until the early 19th centuries. The ship type buss has a long history. It was known around 1000 AD in Scandinavia as a bǘza, a robust variant of the Viking longship. The first herring buss was probably built in Hoorn around 1415. The ship was about 20 metres long and displaced between 60 and 100 tons. It was a massive round-bilged keel ship with a bluff bow and stern, the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The busses used long drifting gill nets to catch the herring. The nets would be retrieved at night and the crews of eighteen to thirty men would set to gibbing, salting and <b>barrelling</b> the catch on the broad deck.|$|E
500|$|Q {{called the}} album [...] "a <b>barrelling,</b> hugely {{confident}} record that should see Fall Out Boy swiftly elevated into mainstream rock's premier league," [...] and Blender called it [...] "the brightest, breeziest, giddiest record Fall Out Boy have ever made." [...] Blender ranked Folie at number 10 on its 33 best albums {{of the year}} list. Jaimie Hodgson of The Observer complimented producer Neal Avron's [...] "squeaky clean" [...] production. In a more negative review of the album, Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "the band's songs are catchy at heart, enjoyable in a trifling but substantial way, until they're smeared with layer after layer of smarm, nullifying any chance of their music being consumed as a simple, empty pleasure." [...] Cataldo also expressed displeasure with Lil Wayne's performance as well as production from Pharrell Williams, which he deemed a [...] "promising concept [...] quickly discarded", summarizing that, [...] "Folie à Deux seems to prove, if nothing else, that Fall Out Boy is good at masking their best qualities and pushing forward their most annoying ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Newman Brothers, brass founders {{and metal}} coffin {{fittings}} manufacturers, {{moved into the}} works in 1894. The company {{was set up by}} Alfred Newman and his two sons: Horace and George [...] During its time at the factory, the company produced some of the finest coffin furniture in the world that was used in the funerals for Sir Winston Churchill, Joseph Chamberlain and Diana, Princess of Wales. The owners and managers would have entered the building through the front entrance of the building whilst the poorer workforce would enter via the gated cart entrance. In the 1960s, the original single-storey range was demolished and replaced with a two storey brick building containing managerial, electroplating, warehousing and <b>barrelling</b> facilities. At its peak, the firm employed 100 people. In the 1950s, the company was exporting products internationally to West Africa, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, the Caribbean, Canada and Malta.|$|E

The ships sailed in fleets of 400 to 500 ships to the Dogger Bank fishing grounds and the Shetland isles. They were usually escorted by naval vessels, because the English considered they were [...] "poaching". The fleet would stay at sea {{for weeks at a}} time. The catch would sometimes be transferred to special ships (called ventjagers), and taken home while the fleet would still be at sea (the picture shows a ventjager in the distance).|$|E

One of the best things we found on board her, were casks, which we greatly wanted, especially for <b>barrelling</b> up beef and other provisions, which we found very difficult; but our cooper eked them out with making some new ones out of her old ones.|$|E

50|$|The MG 3 has a quick-change, chrome-lined <b>barrel</b> {{with four}} {{right-hand}} grooves and a rifling twist rate of 1 in 305 mm (1:12 in). Alternatively, MG 3 <b>barrels</b> {{can also have}} polygonal rifling. The <b>barrel</b> is integrated with the <b>barrel</b> breech. During sustained firing, {{there is a need}} for the <b>barrel</b> to be changed and this is how they are swapped: The gun is cocked and the <b>barrel</b> catch on the right of the <b>barrel</b> shroud is swung forward. Then, the breech end of the hot <b>barrel</b> swings out and can be removed by elevating or twisting the gun. A fresh <b>barrel</b> would be inserted through the <b>barrel</b> catch and the muzzle bearing. When the catch is rotated back, the <b>barrel</b> is locked and the machine gun can resume firing. Both the receiver housing and ventilated <b>barrel</b> casing are made from pressed sheet steel. A muzzle device is mounted at the end of the <b>barrel</b> and it acts as a flash suppressor, muzzle brake and recoil booster.|$|R

5000|$|Because of {{the varying}} sizes of paintballs and <b>barrels,</b> many people opt for an adjustable-bore <b>barrel,</b> {{commonly}} called a <b>barrel</b> system or <b>barrel</b> kit.

The kits may use pieces called [...] "backs" [...] to adjust bore size, or inserts, which are used in the Scepter <b>barrel</b> kit. Such examples of an adjustable-bore <b>barrel</b> are the Furious Lotus, Sly Dual-Carbon, Powerlyte Scepter, MacDev Matchstick, Smart Parts Freak <b>Barrel,</b> Dye Ultralight, Stiffi Switch Kit, and the Deadlywind Fibur.|$|R

5000|$|The current Lerwick celebration {{grew out}} of the older yule {{tradition}} of tar <b>barrelling</b> which took place at Christmas and New Year as well as Up Helly Aa. Squads of young men would drag barrels of burning tar through town on sledges, making mischief. After the abolition of tar <b>barrelling</b> around 1874-1880, permission was eventually obtained for torch processions. The first yule torch procession took place in 1876. The first torch celebration on Up Helly Aa day took place in 1881. The following year the torchlit procession was significantly enhanced and institutionalised through a request by a Lerwick civic body to hold another Up Helly Aa torch procession for the visit of the Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. [...] The first galley was introduced and burned in 1889. The honorary role of the 'Jarl' was introduced to the festival in the early twentieth century.|$|E
5000|$|Another, less {{commonly}} encountered type of break-action shotgun is {{the combination}} gun, which is an over and under design with one shotgun <b>barrel</b> and one rifle <b>barrel</b> (more often rifle on top, but rifle on bottom was not uncommon). There is also a class of break action guns called drillings, which contain three <b>barrels,</b> usually two shotgun <b>barrels</b> of the same gauge and a rifle <b>barrel,</b> though the only common theme is {{that at least one}} <b>barrel</b> be a shotgun <b>barrel.</b> The most common arrangement was essentially a side-by-side shotgun with the rifle <b>barrel</b> below and centered. Usually a drilling containing more than one rifle <b>barrel</b> would have both rifle <b>barrels</b> in the same caliber, but examples do exist with different caliber <b>barrels,</b> usually a [...]22 long rifle and a centerfire cartridge. Although very rare, drillings with three and even four (a vierling) shotgun <b>barrels</b> were made.|$|R

50|$|There {{is a small}} hamlet on the island; the old main {{residential}} area known as Paris which is noted for the bridge, which is only wide enough for one car to pass.

50|$|Rarer {{were the}} {{drillings}} that used two rifle <b>barrels</b> {{and a single}} shotgun <b>barrel.</b> These were harder to make, since, like a double rifle, the rifle <b>barrels</b> must be very carefully regulated, that is, aligned during manufacture to shoot to the same point of aim at a given distance. This requires more precision than regulation of double-barreled shotgun <b>barrels,</b> which are used at shorter ranges with wide patterns of shot where a small misalignment won't be significant. If the rifle <b>barrels</b> were the same caliber, then the three <b>barrels</b> were generally arranged in a triangle, both rifle <b>barrels</b> on top, or one rifle and the shotgun <b>barrel</b> on top (this being known as a cross-eyed drilling). If the rifle <b>barrels</b> differed in caliber, generally the layout would be an over/under using the shotgun and a centerfire rifle <b>barrel,</b> with a rimfire rifle <b>barrel</b> mounted between and to one side. These configuration, with shotgun/centerfire/rimfire <b>barrels,</b> are the most desirable configuration for modern collectors.|$|R
2500|$|Break-bulk {{boats and}} barges were {{originally}} used to transport Pennsylvania oil in [...] wooden <b>barrels.</b> But transport by <b>barrel</b> had several problems.

Finally, <b>barrels</b> were themselves expensive. For example, {{in the early years}} of the Russian oil industry, <b>barrels</b> accounted for half the cost of petroleum production.|$|R
