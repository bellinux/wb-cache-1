5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E

50|$|Roland {{and colleagues}} studied the dorsal premotor cortex and the {{supplementary}} motor area in humans while blood flow in the brain was monitored in a positron emission scanner. When people made complex sensory-guided movements such as following verbal instructions, <b>more</b> blood flow <b>was</b> measured in the dorsal premotor cortex. When people made internally paced sequences of movements, <b>more</b> blood flow <b>was</b> measured in the {{supplementary motor area}}. When people made simple movements that required little planning, such as palpating an object with the hand, the blood flow <b>was</b> <b>more</b> limited to the primary motor cortex. By implication, the primary motor cortex <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in execution of simple movement, the premotor cortex <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in sensory guided movement, and the supplementary motor area <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in internally generated movements.|$|R

25|$|The contact {{activation}} pathway {{begins with}} {{formation of the}} primary complex on collagen by high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), prekallikrein, and FXII (Hageman factor). Prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein and FXII becomes FXIIa. FXIIa converts FXI into FXIa. Factor XIa activates FIX, which with its co-factor FVIIIa form the tenase complex, which activates FX to FXa. The minor role that the contact activation pathway has in initiating clot formation can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} patients with severe deficiencies of FXII, HMWK, and prekallikrein do not have a bleeding disorder. Instead, contact activation system seems to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in inflammation, and innate immunity. Despite this, interference with the pathway may confer protection against thrombosis without a significant bleeding risk.|$|E
500|$|The {{competition}} {{to design the}} Cathedral was held in 1959. [...] The requirement was first, for a congregation of 3,000 (which was later reduced to 2,000) {{to be able to}} see the altar, in order that they could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in the celebration of the Mass, and second, for the Lutyens crypt to be incorporated in the structure. [...] Gibberd achieved these requirements by designing a circular building with the altar at its centre, and by transforming the roof of the crypt into an elevated platform, with the cathedral standing at one end. The construction contract was let to Taylor Woodrow.|$|E
500|$|During Stewart's tenure, {{the role}} of the {{correspondent}} broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in-studio exchanges. Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a correspondent initially involved [...] "character driven [...] pieces—like, you know, guys who believe in Bigfoot." [...] However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as experts discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen. Colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> with the show, as it has permitted them to work more closely with the host and writers.|$|E

Upon leaving Al-Ahram, he declared that he was [...] "retiring", but as his wife explained, [...] "he can't be retired for more than 15 seconds," [...] and he soon expanded his horse operation to include both breeding and racing stock. He still owns other business interests in Egypt, including being the majority shareholder of Misr Glass Manufacturing, which is Egypt's largest maker of glass containers.|$|E
500|$|Connor again {{returns for}} Angel:After the Fall. Brian Lynch was {{initially}} confused {{about how to}} incorporate Connor into the story. It was Whedon who hit upon the arc that Connor would follow in the series. He said, [...] "Connor's a young kid, he's got powers, he doesn't {{have any of the}} bad things, he's not a vampire, so maybe he would enjoy it, and maybe he would be {{the closest thing to a}} superhero hell has". Well-adjusted now, Connor is shown [...] "fully embracing his qualities and role of a hero" [...] for the comic series. Originally Lynch had planned for Nina Ash to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in his storyline, but with time it became clear to him that Connor's story is more about his relationship with Angel. So Nina fell to the wayside and Connor-Angel went on to become a much closer father-son unit. Connor also went from the character Lynch had the most trouble with to the character he enjoys writing most. Regarding Connor's upcoming role in Angel & Faith, Whedon joked about time-traveling him to the early 1960s and making him an ad executive, referencing Kartheiser 's recent role in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. Author Christos Gage describes the necessity of Connor's appearance with [...] "otherwise Angel is just a deadbeat Dad!" ...|$|E
500|$|Humphrey was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} campaigning for Johnson, and was described in the Associated Press as the [...] "administration's strongest advocate on Vietnam" [...] policy. The task became difficult following the Tet Offensive, which despite being a tactical victory, resulted {{in the deaths of}} thousands of American and South Vietnamese soldiers. The offensive included an invasion of the United States Embassy in Saigon, which led many Americans to believe that the North Vietnamese were stronger than had been reported, and that the war was not nearing an end. From this point, most Americans either believed that the war should be escalated to completely destroy the enemy or that all American troops should be withdrawn from Vietnam to prevent the use of any more resources for the [...] "hopeless task". McCarthy decried the handling of the war, and declared that [...] "the Administration's reports of progress are the products of their own self-deception." [...] The Johnson campaign tried many tactics to negate the war's detractors before the New Hampshire primary, including the circulation of the slogan, [...] "the communists in Vietnam are watching...don't vote for fuzzy thinking and surrender". Despite polls that placed McCarthy around 10% to 20% in the state, he won 42.2% of the vote, slightly below Johnson's 49.4%, and the result was hailed as a [...] "moral victory" [...] for McCarthy. Soon afterwards, inspired by the result, Senator Robert Kennedy of New York entered the race, despite previously announcing that he would not challenge the President for the nomination. Humphrey tried to encourage Johnson to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved</b> in the campaign, but the President seemed uninterested. He delayed meetings with Indiana Governor Roger Branigin to arrange a favorite son [...] "stand in" [...] for the campaign, and neglected to hire the campaign's 1964 campaign manager Larry O'Brien, despite Humphrey's insistence. But Humphrey was able to convince Johnson to speak to the influential National Farmers Union in Minneapolis, ahead of the Wisconsin Primary.|$|E

500|$|After a 1–4 {{start to}} the 2012–13 season, the Lakers {{replaced}} head coach Mike Brown with Mike D'Antoni. Gasol was struggling after seven games under D'Antoni, averaging 10.1 points and 8.0 rebounds while shooting 38.8 percent, and he was benched {{in the fourth quarter}} in multiple games. The team had difficulties getting Gasol involved in D'Antoni's offense, which historically had not had post players playing forward. Gasol ranked only 27th in the league in post-up points with 2.7 per game, down from prior seasons when he was fifth in 2010–11 and ninth in 2011–12. On November 18, 2012, in a win against the Houston Rockets, Gasol scored his 15,000th career point. Bothered by tendinitis in both knees since training camp, Gasol sat out eight games in December before returning to the starting lineup. Later, he was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis, but continued playing. General manager Mitch Kupchak told Lakers season-ticket holders the team needed Gasol to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>involved.</b> On January 7, 2013, Gasol received a blow to the face from Denver's JaVale McGee {{in the fourth quarter of}} a 112–105 loss. He suffered a concussion, forcing him to miss the next five games. In his first game back, he came off the bench after having started his first 345 games with the Lakers. In the next game, he returned to the starting lineup and scored 25 points against Toronto, only his second 20-point game of the season. However, in the next game on January 21, D'Antoni moved Gasol to a reserve role and started Earl Clark, a change the coach considered permanent. On February 5 against the Brooklyn Nets, Gasol tore the plantar fascia of his right foot. Gasol had tweaked the fascia in the first half, but played through the soreness until he felt it pop when he tried to block a shot by Brook Lopez towards the end of the game. He returned over six weeks later on March 22 after missing 20 games, with D'Antoni returning him to the starting lineup over Clark. After a two-game adjustment period, Gasol's play was solid, and Bryant insisted that Gasol receive the ball in the post. D'Antoni stated that Gasol had played well since January, and attributed the forward's earlier struggles to injuries and the team's evolving offensive system. [...] "I have a lot more confidence in him now, and he's playing great", D'Antoni said. He finished the season with career lows in points (13.7) and field-goal percentage (.466), and his rebounds (8.6) were his lowest since his first season with Los Angeles. He was limited to career-low 49 games. However, he had three triple-doubles in his last seven games including the playoffs. Gasol was owed $19.3 million in 2013–14 in the final year of his contract, which would cost the Lakers around $50 million including luxury taxes. He became a free agent after the season.|$|E
