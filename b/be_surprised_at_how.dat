[...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house".

Courtney Lear of online music site ShockHound, also praised the album, commenting that it had [...] "massive hooks and memorable choruses, with frontman Alex Gaskarth singing songs about cross-country partying, drinking too much, and hooking up.

2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I {{pick up the phone and}} try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> things work behind the scenes."

5000|$|... "The {{biggest problem}} in {{increasing}} awareness, I think, is that environmental protection still involves nothing but slogans. While many people see {{a conflict between}} economic development and environmental protection, I believe that when you come closer to nature {{to learn more about}} it, you will find no real conflict between the two. On the contrary, a deteriorating environment makes economic development a 'mission impossible.' It is just like when people sacrifice health to make money and then have to spend that money to recover their health. The Green Earth Volunteers is a big family of nature lovers.

Either way, you might <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> natural it will feel if you can get past the mind-fuck of stereotypes.

IGN however found the PS3 version to harbour many technical issues including drop in frame rate, long load times and lag in multiplayer, issues that GameSpot also found by concluding while the PS3 version is the best value for money, due to [...] "the unpredictable frame rate, sluggish controls, and fickle camera in the PS3 version", it suggested others to [...] "pick up the technically superior Xbox 360 version and spend a little extra to get the downloadable content".

50|$|However, {{we cannot}} neglect an {{important}} topic contain in this film----the women’s right and status. In the movie, women’s are not encouraged {{to work as}} the men do in industrial, modern city such as London. We can see John’s wife mainly concentrates on housework and supporting her husband in different aspects----she herself {{does not have a}} job. Even in the primitive society like the natives in island of Casanga, women are not allowed to join the rituals and have little rights. Women’s status is staying in a minority situation until the 1970s when women actively joining the labor force. That’s approximately 40 years after the film was produced. Before that ‘They (black women) suffered not only from racial discrimination in housing and employment but also from sex discrimination. They were susceptible to domestic violence, vulnerable to health problems at young age, and usually the primary caregivers for children.’ From the film, thought not mainly emphasized, we can clearly see how pathetic lives were the women, especially African American Women. Then we shouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> fiercely African American women fight for their rights and the frequently the movements for women rights are held afterward.|$|E

5000|$|Jubilee! was {{a long-running}} Las Vegas Strip-based {{spectacular}} revue. It opened on July 31, 1981 at an initial cost of 10 million dollars and was originally produced by Donn Arden. Donn Arden {{set the standard}} for all the spectacular Las Vegas shows that celebrated female beauty, in combination with a demand for only the best; in costumes, set, and talent. When it closed in 2016, this resident show at Bally's Las Vegas was the longest-running production show in Las Vegas. The Jubilee! showgirls were an icon of old Vegas. The show used costumes designed by Bob Mackie and Pete Menefee. UNLV Special Collections houses many of the original costume design drawings which can be accessed online through the Showgirls collection from UNLV Digital Collections. Many of the show's sets date back to the original production and include the sinking of the Titanic and the bull used in Samson and Delilah. The bull is 27 feet tall and collapses down to 13 feet after it has been destroyed. The bull is the heaviest single piece of scenery in the show weighing 3 tons. It takes 9 stagehands to move it from one position to another. Jubilee!'s longest serving principal dancer from the opening night until her departure 23 years later was Linda Green. The final closing cast consisted of 3 female singers, 3 male singers, 18 male dancers, 23 topless dancers, and 19 female dancers. Within the female covered and topless dancers, they are further categorized as [...] "short" [...] and [...] "tall" [...] dancers. A [...] "short" [...] dancer is a female dancer between 5'8" [...] and 5'9" [...] and a [...] "tall" [...] female dancer is between 5'10" [...] and 6'2." [...] One may <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> tall the dancers are because of the proportions of the stage, which is three and a half stories high, giving the illusion that the performers are smaller in relationship to the stage.|$|E
