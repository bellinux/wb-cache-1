We test here whether neutral copper or cadmium sulfates, negatively-charged copper or cadmium citrates and positively-charged copper acetate and cadmium chloride are bioavailable to a soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida. Adsorption onto the cell surface and uptake into the periplasm and cytoplasm of this Gram-negative root colonizing bacterium was studied by adding a single concentration of Cu or Cd and varying the concentration of the ligands to complex 10 - 100 % of the metal. Metal association from the complexes on and within the cell was defined using selective extraction procedures and compared with free ion controls using the Langmuir isotherm. Cellular responses also were assessed using a P. putida biosensor. Both uptake and <b>bioresponse</b> methodologies showed that P. putida was sensitive to the metal complexes. In particular, the <b>bioresponse</b> to Cu and Cd supplied as a citrate complex occurred with activities of free metal ions two orders of magnitude lower than for the control. We concluded that the tested metal complexes for Cu and Cd are taken up into the cell, where they trigger a <b>bioresponse.</b> We also discuss the implications of these findings on interactions between soil and water organisms and nanoparticles that release metal ions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Field parameters for therapeutic, pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMFs) were designed to induce voltages similar to those produced, normally, during dynamic mechanical deformation of connective tissues. As a result, {{a wide variety of}} challenging musculoskeletal disorders have been treated successfully over the past two decades. More than a quarter million patients with chronically ununited fractures have benefitted, worldwide, from this surgically non-invasive method, without risk, discomfort, or the high costs of operative repair.

We present an in-depth study of urinary chemical signals emitted by individual, behaviourally characterized, wild male African elephants, investigating whether these compounds were the same, accentuated, or diminished in comparison with captive individuals. Remarkably, most emitted chemicals were similar in captive and wild elephants with an exception traced to drought-induced dietary cyanates among wild males. We observed developmental changes predominated by the transition from acids and esters emitted by young males to alcohols and ketones released by older males. We determined that the ketones (2 -butanone, acetone and 2 -pentanone, and 2 -nonanone) were considerably elevated during early musth, musth and late musth, respectively, suggesting that males communicate their condition via these compounds. The similarity to compounds released during musth by Asian male elephants that evoke conspecific <b>bioresponses</b> suggests the existence of species-free 'musth' signals. Our innovative techniques, which allow the recognition of precise sexual and musth states of individual elephants, can be helpful to managers of both wild and captive elephants.

With advances in measuring signals on-line by means of several new technologies and analytical procedures, and processing these signals immediately with strong and compact processors, {{it may be possible}} to develop new training methods. In this research, the objective was to explore the possibilities of using modern model-based algorithms to control the heart rate of horses (bpm) on-line by means of the control input running speed (km/h). Forty-five experiments with five horses and four riders were carried out to generate measurements of physiological status during running. The dynamical characteristics of each horse were quantified using linear discrete transfer function models. The dynamic response of heart rate to step changes in running speed were accurately described. In 90 % of the cases, a first-order model gave the best fit. For 69 % of the models, the r(2) was higher than 0. 90 and for 34 % of the models, the r(2) Was even higher than 0. 95. In a next step, the model-based algorithm was evaluated by controlling cardiac responses of two horses (horses 2 and 4) to a pre-defined trajectory. The model parameters were kept constant. On average, the error between the defined target trajectory in heart rate and the actual controlled heart rate ranged between 0. 2 and 1. 4 bpm for the whole target heart rate trajectory. During the steady-state part of the trajectory the average error was maximum 1. 1 bpm. In the transient from one steady-state heart rate to another level, the error could increase on average up to 5 bpm. in the future, the combination of on-line measured <b>bioresponses</b> with real-time analysis can be used for adjusting the work load of the horse, during training, directly to the immediate needs of horse (welfare) and trainer (performance).

A new method for saturation analysis of CRABP and CRBP was applied to human tumors, human neuroblastoma cells, which retinoic acid causes to differentiate, and a bioselected subline resistant to retinoic acid. These data suggest that CRABP may not mediate cell differentiation by retinoic acid. In other studies, 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptors and <b>bioresponses</b> were characterized in cultured primate cells. Rhesus monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK₂) were resistant to 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃-dependent induction of 25 (OH) D- 24 -hydroxylase enzyme. The ED₅₀ in LLC-MK₂ cells was 10 - 100 fold higher than in other cultured cells. This resistance resulted from a low affinity receptor. Since the LLC-MK₂ variant receptor {{did not differ in}} size from the wild type rhesus 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptor, (Mᵣ = 52 kDa) a subtle alteration in the receptor likely caused the decreased ligand affinity. Also of interest was the possible cellular resistance to 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃, in the owl monkey (Aotus trivurgatus), which generally occurs in new world primates. Owl monkey kidney (OMK) cells had the same content of receptors for 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ and sensitivity to this hormone as cells from the rhesus monkey (old world primate). The ED₅₀ for induction of 24 hydroxylase was 2 - 3 nM in both the OMK cells and the rhesus monkey fibroblasts. Both cells contained 2300 high affinity receptor molecules per cell, which bound DNA and were characterized by immunoblot as 52 kDa proteins. 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ treatment increased the content of 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptors in OMK cells, by increasing the synthesis of receptor mRNA. These data indicate the owl monkey is not resistant to 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃, unlike other new world primates. This finding was confirmed independently by demonstration that the owl monkey maintained mean serum 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ levels (29 pg/ml) in the range of old world primates (33 pg/ml) and humans, in contrast to the elevated 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ in other new world primates (97 - 129 pg/ml). This result suggests the alteration of 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃-endocrine dynamics in new world primates occurred subsequent to the evolutionary divergence of the owl monkey...|$|R
40|$|Introdução: As interações entre o campo magnético com materiais diamagnéticos como a água ganharam mais visibilidade nos últimos anos por meio de relevantes estudos que demonstram uma pluraridade de atuação da água tratada magneticamente (ATM). Tais estudos envolvem resultados como o aumento da absorção {{intestinal}} de cálcio, aumento da permeação da ATM a nível celular, diminuição da osmolaridade e viscosidade sanguínea e maior facilidade na eliminação de toxinas. Essas biorrespostas parecem ser possíveis, segundo a literatura, a partir de alterações das ligações de hidrogênio, quando a água é magneticamente tratada, proporcionado rearranjos de clusters, de forma a deixá-los menores e mais organizados, favorecendo sua permeação nos tecidos. Além disso, também há relatos na literatura sobre incrementos nos valores de pH e condutividade da água frente a um campo magnético, o que, juntamente com as alterações moleculares, conferiria a água novas propriedades, de maneira a aumentar sua efetividade no organismo. Objetivo: Verificar se há diferenças físico-químicas e moleculares estatisticamente relevantes entre a ATM e seu grupo controle. Metodologia: Fizeram parte do estudo, 6 tipos diferentes de águas, desde a deionizada até águas minerais comerciais, que foram submetidas a tratamento magnético por meio de um dispositivo magnético comercial próprio para este fim. O grupo controle foi formado com alíquotas das mesmas águas, porém sem o tratamento magnético. A fim de se verificar as alterações moleculares da ATM em comparação com o grupo controle, foram realizadas análises de espectroscopia no Infravermelho com transformada de Fourier (FTIR) e Ultravioleta (UV), bem como foram realizadas mensurações de pH e condutividade em ambos os grupos. Com os dados obtidos, realizou-se uma análise estatística por meio do software estatístico SPSS. Resultado: Houve diferenças nos espectros de FTIR e UV bem como um incremento nos valores de pH entre o grupo teste e o grupo controle. Conclusão: Mediante o p-valor encontrado, concluiu-se que existem diferenças moleculares estatisticamente relevantes entre a ATM e seu grupo controle, mostradas por meio das espectroscopias realizadas, bem como uma maior tendência a alcalinização do grupo que foi tratado magneticamente, o que suscita a importância de mais estudos a fim de convergir resultados científicos em prol desta que parece ser uma área promissora de novas descobertas. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIntroduction: The {{interactions between}} the magnetic field with diamagnetics materials as water gained more visibility in recent years through relevant studies that demonstrate a variety of actuation of treated water magnetically (ATM). Such studies involve results such as the increase in intestinal calcium absorption, increase the permeation of the ATM cell level, decrease in osmolarity and blood viscosity and greater ease in the elimination of toxins. These <b>bioresponses</b> seem to be possible, according to the literature, from changes in hydrogen bonds, when the water is magnetically treated, provided rearrangements in clusters, in order to leave them smaller and more organized, thus favoring their permeation in tissues. In addition, there are also reports {{in the literature on}} increments in the pH and conductivity of the water front to a magnetic field, which, together with the molecular changes, would give the water new properties, so as to increase its effectiveness in the body. Objective: To Verify if there are any differences physical-chemical and molecular statistically relevant between ATM and its control group. Methodology: took part in the study, 6 different types of water, from the deionized water until mineral waters trade, which were subjected to magnetic treatment by means of a magnetic device own commercial for this order. The control group was formed with aliquots of the same waters, however without the magnetic treatment. In order to verify the molecular changes of ATM in comparison with the control group, there were analyzes of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Ultraviolet (UV), as well as were performed measurements of pH and conductivity in both groups. With the data obtained, we performed a statistical analysis by means of the SPSS statistical software. Results: There were differences in the spectra of FTIR and UV as well as an increase in pH values between the test group and the control group. Conclusion: Through the p-value found, it was concluded that there are molecular differences statistically significant between the ATM and its control group, shown through the spectroscopies, as well as a greater tendency to alkalinization of the group that was treated magnetically, which raises the importance of further studies in order to converge scientific results in favor of this that seems to be a promising area of new discoveries...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} an adipocyte-like cell line, the 3 T 3 -L 1 fatty fibroblasts, to compare acute and chronic effects of autoantibodies {{directed}} against the insulin receptor. Acute exposure of the cells in tissue culture to the antibodies resulted in a blockade of insulin binding and stimulation of 2 -deoxy-glucose transport and glucose oxidation. Maximal acute effects were reached within 30 - 120 min. Subsequently, the stimulatory response decayed and, after 6 hr in the continuous presence of the antibodies, basal glucose metabolism {{had returned to the}} level observed with unexposed cells and a state of severe insulin resistance prevailed. In contrast to the decay of <b>bioresponse,</b> no change in insulin binding was detectable over the same time period. The mechanism of desensitization seemed to involve events early after insulin binding to receptor because cells exposed to antibody for prolonged periods of time, although unresponsive to insulin and antireceptor antibodies, responded normally to both spermine and vitamin K 5, agents that stimulate glucose metabolism independently of the insulin receptor. These data suggest that prolonged or continuous occupancy of the insulin receptor by a ligand, in this case antireceptor antibodies, does not produce a continuous biological response. Instead, there is desensitization at some early step in the pathway for insulin action. These observations have important implications with respect to the mechanism of insulin action and to other situations in which there is long-term exposure of cells to antibodies that react with membrane components...|$|E

Nevertheless, in the recent years these natural and semisynthetic macromolecules have been addressed for new challenging applications as functional materials for innovative formulations.

These polymers display, in fact, high biocompatibility and biodegradability, multiple insertion points and biological properties that can be advantageously exploited in drug delivery. In particular, the multifunctional structure of these polymers are anchoring points for conjugation of several anticancer drugs, which usually suffer of poor physicochemical, biopharmaceutical and therapeutic properties that limit their therapeutic performance and proper use in anticancer treatment.

40|$|Progression of {{prostate}} cancer {{is believed to be}} dependent on angiogenesis induced by tumor cells. 3, 3 ¶-Diindolylmethane (DIM) has been shown to repress neovascularization in a Matrigel plug assay and inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary tube formation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. However, the molecular mechanism, by which DIM inhibits angiogenesis and invasion, has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we sought to explore the molecular mechanism by which DIM inhibits angiogenesis and invasion, specifically by investigating the role of angiogenic factors secreted by prostate cancer cells which control all steps of angiogenesis. We found that <b>BioResponse</b> DIM (B-DIM), a formulated DIM with higher bioavailability, inhibited angiogenesis and invasion by reducing the bioavailability of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via repressing extracellular matrix–degrading proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), in human prostate cancer cells and reduced vascularity (angiogenesis) in vivo using Matrigel plug assay. We also found that B-DIM treatment inhibited DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), which is known to mediate the expression of many NF-KB downstream target genes, including VEGF, IL- 8, uPA, and MMP- 9, all of which are involved in angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Our data suggest that inhibition of NF-KB DNA binding activity by B-DIM contributes to the regulated bioavailability of VEGF by MMP- 9 and uPA and, in turn, inhibits invasion and angiogenesis, which could be mechanistically linked with the antitumor activity of B-DIM as observed previously by our laboratory in a prostate cancer animal model.

IL- 1 β and TNF- α were chosen because of their critical importance during the host response to local inflammatory stimuli. Qualitatively similar two- to threefold inhibition of osteocalcin synthesis by IL- 1 β and TNF- α were observed in all three postconfluent bone-forming model systems. Because of the readily measurable concentrations of osteocalcin produced in our culture protocol, {{it was not necessary}} to enhance osteoblastic synthesis of osteocalcin by supplementation with 1, 25 (OH) 2 -vitamin D 3, a treatment which exerts pleiotropic effects on osteoblasts. Under the constraints of our protocol, where alkaline phosphatase and mineralization were already elevated at the 14 -day onset of treatment, neither of these phenotypic properties was sensitive to a three-day cytokine exposure. Differences were noted in proliferation, where only TNF- α stimulated DNA synthesis in ROB cells, while both cytokines stimulated MG- 63 cells. IL- 1 β and TNF- α failed to alter ROS 17 / 2. 8 DNA synthesis except at the highest doses (25 pM IL- 1 β and l nM TNF- α) where inhibition was observed. These results further support the view that cytokine-mediated osteoblastic regulation can be relatively selective...|$|E
40|$|Background: Haploinsufficiency may {{contribute}} to the development of breast cancer among women with a BRCA 1 mutation. Thus, interventions that enhance BRCA 1 expression may represent avenues for prevention. Studies have shown that 3, 30 -diindolylmethane (DIM) can upregulate BRCA 1 expression in breast cancer cells. This has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Methods: We conducted a study to evaluate the ability of oral DIM to upregulate BRCA 1 mRNA expression in white blood cells. A total of 18 women were enroled in the study, including 13 BRCA 1 mutation carriers who received 300 mg per day of Rx Balance <b>BioResponse</b> DIM for 4 – 6 weeks (intervention group) and 5 BRCA 1 mutation carriers who did not take DIM (control group). BRCA 1 mRNA expression was assessed at baseline and at 4 – 6 weeks by real-time, quantitative PCR and the relative change in BRCA 1 mRNA expression (that is, 2 DDCT) was calculated. Results: The relative change in BRCA 1 mRNA expression among women in the intervention group achieved borderline significance (P paired t-test 0. 05). In the intervention group, BRCA 1 mRNA expression increased in 10 of the participants, decreased in 2 and remained unchanged in 1 of the participants following DIM intervention (P sign test 0. 02). On average, women in the intervention group experienced a 34 % increase in BRCA 1 mRNA expression (range 24 to 194 %). There was no significant difference in the relative change in BRCA 1 mRNA expression among women in the control group (P paired t-test 0. 45). Conclusions: Under the tested conditions, oral DIM was associated with an increase in BRCA 1 mRNA expression in women with a BRCA 1 mutation. The possibility of mitigating the effect of an inherited deleterious BRCA 1 mutation by increasing the physiologi...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cervical {{screening}} identifies {{many women}} with low-grade abnormalities. In vitro and in vivo {{studies have shown}} that diindolylmethane (DIM) could potentially halt (cervical) carcinogenesis. We report on a randomised controlled trial of the effect of DIM in women with low-grade cervical cytological abnormalities. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic double-blind, randomised controlled trial of 150 mg DIM (from <b>BioResponse</b> DIM) or placebo daily for 6 months in women with newly diagnosed, low-grade cytological abnormalities. Randomisation was in the ratio 2 (DIM) to 1 (placebo). All women were invited for colposcopy at 6 months with biopsy of any abnormality. RESULTS: Of the 551 randomised women available for analysis, 9 % on DIM and 12 % on placebo had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia- 2 (CIN 2) or worse after 6 -month supplementation (risk ratio (RR) 0. 7 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 4 – 1. 2)), whereas 4. 6 % and 5. 1 %, respectively, had CIN 3 or worse (RR 0. 9 (95 % CI: 0. 4 – 2. 0)). A total of 27. 3 % of women on DIM and 34. 3 % on placebo had no sign of disease (negative cytology, colposcopy and human papilloma virus (HPV) tests) at 6 months (RR 0. 8 (95 % CI: 0. 6 – 1. 0)). Of those HPV-positive at baseline, 69 % (114 out of 166) of the DIM group were positive at 6 months compared with 61 % (43 out of 71) of the placebo group: RR 1. 1 (95 % CI: 0. 9 – 1. 4). Diindolylmethane supplementation was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that short-term DIM supplementation (150 mg day 1) is well tolerated, but is unlikely to have a...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{appreciation}} of the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in numerous bioregulatory pathways has not only opened up new therapeutic avenues for organic nitrates and other NO donors but also led to an increased use of such compounds in pharmacological studies. By definition, all NO donors produce NO-related activity when applied to biological systems and are thus principally suited to either mimic an endogenous NO-related response or substitute for an endogenous NO deficiency. However, the pathways leading to enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic formation of NO differ greatly among individual compound classes, as do their chemical reactivities and kinetics of NO release. Moreover, since the reaction of NO with oxygen {{is a function of}} its concentration, the same absolute amounts of NO generated over different periods of time may lead to substantially different rates of NOx formation and, consequently, to varying extents of side reactions, such as nitration and/or nitrosation of biomolecules. Matters are further complicated by compound-specific formation of by-products, which may arise during decomposition or metabolism, sometimes in amounts far exceeding those of NO. The term "NO donor" implies that the compound releases the active mediator, NO. Ultimately, this may be true for many different chemical classes of compound, since the principal NO-related species generated may be converted to NO, if not directly released as such. However, in a biological system, the redox form of nitrogen monoxide (NO+, NO. or NO-) that is actually released makes a substantial difference to the NO donor's reactivity towards other biomolecules, the profile of by-products, and the <b>bioresponse.</b> Such considerations are likely to account for much of the discrepancy in experimental results obtained using the same cell or tissue preparation but different NO mimetics. Thus, compound selection is not a trivial issue and the investigator {{should be aware of the}} key properties and differences between various NO donor classes in order to avoid misinterpretation of experimental results...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} P 2 O 5 substitution by B 2 O 3 in the (50 − x) P 2 O 5 · 20 CaO· 20 SrO· 10 Na 2 O·x B 2 O 3 glass system (x from 0 to 5 mol%) on the thermal and structural properties and also on the glass reactivity in simulated body fluid. The goal is to develop new glass candidates for biomedical glass fibers. The addition of B 2 O 3 {{at the expense of}} P 2 O 5 increases the refractive index of the glass and also the thermal stability of the glass indicating that these glasses are promising glasses for fiber drawing. Thus, within such glass composition, the core of a core–clad fiber has a larger concentration of B 2 O 3 than the clad of the fiber to enable the light to propagate inside the core. All the investigated glasses form a calcium phosphate layer at their surface when immersed in simulated body fluid. It was found that small addition of B 2 O 3 (1. 25 mol%) leads to a decrease in the initial dissolution rate and a delayed layer formation. However, with increasing B 2 O 3 content, the chemical durability decreased slightly but was higher than for the B-free glass. In addition, formation of the calcium phosphate layer was further delayed. This suggests that small contents of B 2 O 3 led to formation of P–O–B bonds and only few BO 4 units, increasing the chemical durability. At higher B 2 O 3 contents, the amount of BO 4 units increases which makes the glass network slightly more prone to be hydrolyzed. Thus, formation of BO 4 units induced by the addition of B 2 O 3 at the expense of P 2 O 5 reduces the reactivity of the glass in SBF. Borophosphate fibers were successfully drawn from preform. As expected from the <b>bioresponse</b> of the bulk glasses in simulated body fluid, the reduction in the intensity of the light transmitted is less and slower in a borophosphate fiber than in a phosphate fiber upon immersio...|$|E
40|$|The active form {{of vitamin}} D is the steroid hormone 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D₃ [1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃]. Central to the {{mechanism}} of action of 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ is its specific, high affinity intracellular receptor. This research focused on the participation of this receptor in the biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology of the vitamin D regulatory system. The effects of 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ on the differentiation of hematopoietic cells were investigated using the cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL- 60, as a model. It was observed that 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ induced macrophage differentiation in HL- 60 cells and that a direct biochemical correlation existed between 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptor saturation and a 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃-stimulated <b>bioresponse.</b> These data implicate 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ as a natural cell differentiating agent and the 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptor as the mediator of this hormone's action. Since the most fundamental level of control occurs by the regulation of gene expression, studies were undertaken to define the transcriptional control by 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ over a known vitamin D-regulated endpoint protein. This work resulted in the molecular cloning of cDNAs to two avian intestinal calcium binding proteins, vitamin D-dependent calcium binding protein and a novel calmodulin-like protein. To gain further insight {{into the role of}} the 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptor as a transcriptional regulator, avian and mammalian 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptor mRNAs were characterized extensively by the techniques of in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. These mRNAs were then utilized to construct cDNA libraries from which avian and human intestinal 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptor cDNAs were isolated and their identity verified by hybrid-selected translation, sequencing, and Northern analysis. It was concluded that demonstrated 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ receptors are polypeptides of 52 - 60 kDa whose activity is regulated by 1, 25 (OH) ₂D₃ at both an mRNA and posttranslational level. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of receptor mRNA included a highly conserved cysteine, lysine, and arginine rich region that is homologous to other steroid receptors and the oncogene product v- erbA. Thus, the vitamin D receptor to be a specific trans -acting factor, modulating the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D including calcium homeostasis, and cellular differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic micro and {{nanomaterials}} {{have gained}} interest {{by the research}} community during last decade. They have contributed to improved performance {{in the fields of}} catalysis, biomedicine, energy and electronics. Amongst these ceramic materials, nanofibers have shown good potential; their large aspect ratio enhances several material properties. This PhD thesis focuses on the development of novel functional ceramic fibers and nanochannels. Different materials were fabricated, characterized and tested in different applications. The ceramic nanofibers and nanochannels have been fabricated by combining two techniques: electrospinning and sol-gel processing. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the influence of the fabrication process of different ceramic nanofibers on their properties, and subsequently to explore their potential in different fields of application. In {{order to be able to}} tune the materials’ microstructure and properties, the process of preparing ceramic nanofibers by electrospinning was studied. The role of the solution properties on the process was thoroughly investigated as it controls most of the process and determines the feasibility of producing fibers. It was demonstrated that the fiber diameter, morphology and alignment can be modified. The possibility of preparing nanotubes is also shown. Such understanding was essential to design materials in order to enhance their performance in different fields of application. A flexible ceramic consisting of a 3 % Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia non-woven mat of fibers was designed to be used as scaffold for bone regeneration. Although that ceramic material is inherently rigid and bioinhert, it was proven that it can be turned into flexible and offered an improved <b>bioresponse</b> towards osteogenesis when shaped into nanofibers. Similarly, the possibility of shaping β tri calcium phosphate, a well-known bioactive material for bone regeneration into nanofibers, has been demonstrated. The final grain size in the resulting nanofibers was smaller than reported elsewhere, which is thought to be caused by the fibrous morphology. Ceramic nanofibers also showed potential to be applied in the field of electronics. The fabrication of aligned ZnO nanofibers, and the semiconducting and photoelectric properties were studied in field effect transistor and UV detector applications. It was proven that electrospinning can be used for rapid fabrication of large area electronic devices. A novel method to fabricate porous ceramics with controlled catalyst deposition is also presented. Polymer nanofibers were used to template ceramic materials and form nanochannels. 3 % Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia / Ni cermet was chosen a model material to be used in the field of solid oxide fuel cells. Nevertheless, the same method can be extended to other fields. In conclusion, it can be stated that ceramic nanofibers offer a promising alternative in different fields of application. However, the scaling and commercialization still remains a challenge...|$|E
40|$|Most {{existing}} HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems {{control a}} {{spatial and temporal}} average level of environmental variable(s) (e. g., temperature, humidity and gas concentration, ) based upon feedback of inside environmental variable(s) measured at a single position in the whole room. Such control systems make use of set-points of these inside-environmental-variables that are assumed to be; (1), homogeneous inside the whole space of the indoor environment; (2), optimal for a defined theoretical population average for the considered species of occupants. However, in reality, such environmental variables are never perfectly mixed but rather revealing a three-dimensional gradient due to the spatially and temporally heterogeneous heat and mass transfer phenomena inside the ventilated structures. Furthermore, living organisms (human, animal, plant or biological product) they are Complex, Individually different, Time-Varying and Dynamic CITD systems. Consequently they are responding in individually different ways to changes in surrounding environmental variables rather than the average organism concept due to several exogenous and endogenous variables, which also influence the bioresponses of these organisms. Every living organism reacts to itsown individual micro-environment, which {{is defined as the}} collection of all environmental variables that reach the individual living organism. The micro-environment around the living organism is considered as a well-mixed-zone, which can be defined as the maximal 3 D zone of improved mixing with acceptable low spatial gradients in heat and mass variables (micro-environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, ). A first part of this work focused on active control of the well-mixed-zone of temperature in a ventilated structure. The Data-Based Mechanistic approach was used to model the dynamic spatial temperature distribution of well-mixed-zone in a ventilated airspace to changes in the heat supply (control input). Dynamic response of indoor temperature to varying heat supply could be explained by a second-order transfer function model with a high coefficient of determination (R 2 T > 0. 99), a low Young Identification Criterion (YIC A second part of this thesis focused on using the measured bioresponses of living organism to control the micro-environmentaround them. The bioresponses of individual living organisms to changes in their micro-environmental variables (mainly temperature) were modelled using the DBM approach (Chapters 4 and 5). The dynamic thermal bioresponses (eggshell temperature) of incubated chicken embryos were modelled from embryonic day 8 till embryonic day 19 to step changes in their ambient air temperature. The incubated-embryo system was proposed in the present work to represent the incubated embryo and its surrounding micro-environment. It was shown that a first-order transfer function model was suitable (coefficient of determination, R 2 T > 0. 98 and Young Identification Criterion, YIC The dynamic behavioural <b>bioresponse</b> (activity and position) of 7 days old broiler chickens in a ventilated chamber were modelled to stepwise changes in inlet temperature and ventilation rate(Chapter 5). A first-ordertransfer function model structure was suitable (coefficient of determination, R 2 T > 0. 89 and Young Identification Criterion, YIC 36 oC), which indicated a behavioural response to reduce their heat stress by moving to the zones of high air velocity to increase the convictive heat losses. It was possible to control the activity level and position of a group of chickens by changing their micro-environmental conditions (local temperature and air velocity). However, and surprisingly, by applying such control approach on the individual level {{it was found that the}} birds were tending to respond as one group instead of responding individually. Thus, we cansay that the social effect of the group, flock behaviour, was more dominating than the micro-environmental effect on choosing their position inthe room. A novel non-contact and motion tolerant technique was proposed and implemented in this thesis (Chapter 6) for real-time monitoringof embryo heart rate and vasodilatation and vasoconstriction in incubated eggs. Using a microscope camera (with 640 × 480 resolution) videos ofthe eggs vascular structure were recorded with 10 frame per second from embryonic day 13 till embryonic day 19. Using image processing technique different embryogenic motions were captured in a form of time series of dynamic activity index. The measured heart rate of the chicken embryowas within the range (252 - 295 bpm) during the measurement period (between embryonic days 13 and 19). The cardiogenic signals were identified using signal processing techniques to calculate the heart rate of the embryo.
