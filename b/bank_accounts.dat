With the mandate increasing account ownership {{by as much as}} 29 percent for less educated families with children, it provides an exogenous increase in account ownership to examine the causal effect of <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> ownership on access to credit, purchase of household durable goods, vehicle ownership, vehicle purchase, and accumulation of financial assets. When a less educated family becomes an owner of a <b>bank</b> <b>account,</b> I find a 71 percentage point increase in the probability of owning a credit card, an increase of 1. 4 household durable goods, and no change in vehicle ownership or purchase. Although I find that <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> ownership does not affect the mean level of financial assets, I do find evidence suggestive of an increase in {{the top half of the}} financial asset distribution which indicates that there may be heterogeneity in the savings response to owning a <b>bank</b> <b>account.</b> Overall, my findings suggest that the most important benefit of owning a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> is access to credit and requiring lower income families to own a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> will not reverse their low average savings levels in the short run...|$|R

Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
