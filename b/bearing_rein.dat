5000|$|The term <b>bearing</b> <b>rein</b> {{is derived}} from the {{definition}} of [...] "bearing" [...] which means [...] "the manner in which one bears or conducts one's self; mien; behavior; carriage." [...] The reference suggested that high head carriage was a sign of nobility or pride. However, 19th century critics of the <b>bearing</b> <b>rein</b> applied a pejorative meaning to the word, meaning [...] "patient endurance; suffering without complaint". Modern harness trainers prefer the more accurate terminology [...] "overcheck" [...] and [...] "check rein".|$|E
50|$|Lady W - Wife of Lord W. Demands that Beauty and Ginger wear <b>bearing</b> <b>reins</b> to {{hold their}} heads up high. When York tries to comply with Lady W's order Ginger lashes out, kicking {{everything}} around her.|$|R
50|$|Riders were {{required}} to wear informal uniform if they were military officers, or black or pink coats with silk hats if they were civilians. Horses had to be ridden in a double bridle, and martingales and <b>bearing</b> <b>reins</b> were prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|Beauty and Ginger {{are taken}} to Earlshall Park, home of the Lord and Lady of Wexmire, and Joe bids a tearful goodbye to Beauty. Beauty and Ginger are paired up to pull Lady Wexmire's carriage, but she demands that the horses wear uncomfortable <b>bearing</b> <b>reins</b> to raise their heads high, which angers Ginger. When the next day Lady Wexmire orders the horse's heads be {{strapped}} up even further, Ginger breaks away from the carriage in a rage. Lady Wexmire never calls for Ginger to pull her carriages again.|$|R
50|$|The harness saddle {{supports}} {{the weight of}} the shafts or pole, and in a two-wheeled vehicle, also supports part of the vehicle's weight. In addition, it offers a base for fittings such as terrets and a point of attachment for a <b>bearing</b> <b>rein.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{overcheck}} or <b>bearing</b> <b>rein</b> shares some {{function with}} side reins, draw reins, and the de Gogue, {{and has the}} opposite function to a chambon and martingale. It can {{be attached to the}} same bit as the reins, or to a second, separate bit.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bearing</b> <b>rein,</b> {{known today}} as an {{overcheck}} or a checkrein, {{is a piece of}} horse tack that runs from a point on the horse's back, over the head, to a bit. It is used to prevent the horse from lowering its head beyond a fixed point. A variation called a side check passes beside the ears through loops {{at the top of the}} bridle cheekpieces.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the book}} is now {{considered}} a children's classic, Sewell originally wrote it for those who worked with horses. She said [...] "a special aim was to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses". In many respects the book {{can be read as}} a guide to horse husbandry, stable management and humane training practices for colts. [...] It is considered to have had an effect on reducing cruelty to horses; for example, the use of <b>bearing</b> <b>reins,</b> which are particularly painful for a horse, was one of the practices highlighted in the novel, and in the years after the book's release the reins became less popular and fell out of favour.|$|R
5000|$|Dressage {{was held}} {{over two days}} due to {{the large number of}} entries. The test was now {{required}} to be held in a 20x60 meter arena, and a time limit was instituted (10 minute 30 seconds maximum). Riders had to demonstrate the walk, the [...] "ordinary" [...] (working) trot both rising and sitting, the [...] "slow" [...] (collected) trot, the extended trot, the [...] "ordinary" [...] and extended canter. They also had to show small circles, the halt, reinback, and counter-canter. There was new rule this year that required a double bridle but would not allow martingales, bandages, or <b>bearing</b> <b>reins.</b> Riders could now wear hunt caps in addition to silk hats.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{improper}} use and overuse created chronic {{problems with the}} spine and back {{that in some cases}} made certain horses useless as working animals. The fashion extremes of the 18th and 19th centuries at times tightened a <b>bearing</b> <b>rein</b> to the degree that it made breathing difficult. This is touched on in the novel Black Beauty. The [...] "Anti-Bearing Rein Association" [...] was formed to try and stop the practice of using such reins. About that time, the cause was also taken up by the Canadian Society of Cruelty to Animals ...|$|E
5000|$|Overcheck, {{also called}} a <b>bearing</b> <b>rein</b> or [...] "check rein," [...] is a {{specialty}} rein {{that runs from}} a snaffle bit, past the crownpiece, along {{the crest of the}} neck, and attaches to the front of a harness on a driving horse. It prevents the horse from dropping its head too low. Overchecks are also sometimes used on riding horses, especially ponies, to keep them from grazing while being ridden by a small child who may lack the physical strength or skill to raise the animal's head up.|$|E
50|$|A chambon {{prevents}} the horse from raising its head beyond a fixed point. Raising the head causes {{the length of}} the chambon along the cheekpieces to shorten and thus puts reciprocal pressure on the horse's mouth and on the horse's poll. Horses generally dislike pressure behind the poll and learn to release the pressure by lowering their head, and when in motion, this encourages the horse to relax its back and bring its hindquarters further under its body, thus encouraging collection.The chambon has the opposite function to an overcheck or <b>bearing</b> <b>rein,</b> which is used to raise the horse's head.|$|E
