5|$|The {{signature}} {{issue of}} the session, however, was Fields' request for the <b>bond</b> <b>issue.</b> He engaged in a debate with opponents of the issue that was published in Bingham's Courier-Journal {{as well as the}} Louisville Herald and Louisville Post, two papers owned by James B. Brown. Ultimately, the issue was approved by the General Assembly, which was considered a major victory for Fields. Still, the <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> had to be approved by the state's electorate. The Courier-Journal continued the fight against the issue, while Desha Breckinridge's Lexington Herald came out in favor of it. Fields spent ten weeks criss-crossing the state speaking in favor of the <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> but on election day, it was rejected by a margin of 90,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|All of SR 198 {{was added}} to the state highway system in the three bond issues floated to pay for the {{construction}} of the system. The first <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> approved by the state's voters in 1910, included the road from Visalia west to Hanford, connecting the two county seats with the central northsouth highway (Route 4, now SR 99). As part of the 1916 <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> the route was extended west from Hanford through Coalinga to the coast trunk highway (Route 2, now US 101) near San Lucas, and assigned it the Route 10 designation. The third <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> passed in 1919, included a further extension east from Visalia to Sequoia National Park. The entire length of Route 10 was marked as Sign Route 198 in 1934, and this number was adopted legislatively in the 1964 renumbering. The portion east of Interstate 5 near Coalinga {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959, and parts of it have been built as such. The construction of the freeway east of Visalia to Road 192 was approved in January 1961, with the remainder of the freeway unplanned at that time as contingent on the routing of SR 65. The projected cost in 1958 of the entire freeway east of Visalia was $13million ($ in today's dollars) and was scheduled to be completed by 1964. The freeway through Visalia was completed by 1965, with an expressway connecting it to US 99. Also completed was the expressway heading west out of Hanford, with part of it access-controlled west of Lemoore.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> to benefit the state parks, which had poor lodging and few amenities. Combs combined the <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposed}} <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> {{went ahead}} in July 2006. Arsenal issued £210million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 basis points over government bonds and £50million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, asset-backed <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately £20million a year. In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development – {{one of the main}} sources of income to reduce the stadium debt – was now debt free and making revenue.|$|E

5|$|A $2.5 million <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> {{passed in}} 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of Lake Shore Drive were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake Shore Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E
5|$|After a 1994 {{plan was}} {{approved}} and a <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, {{which resulted in}} the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999.

To provide ammunition, Governor Morton established a state-owned arsenal at Indianapolis. Congress passed legislation to establish a permanent federal arsenal at Indianapolis in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{completed}} its main line into California in 1909. This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy, {{but to the}} west it reached Oroville and Marysville via the Feather River Canyon. While building the railroad, the Utah Construction Company had created a dirt road through the canyon to assist with construction; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year-round route between Oroville and Quincy (the existing route over the ridges was closed {{for at least four}} months each winter). The first state highway <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> passed by the state's voters in 1910, included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy. Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed the Feather River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913, but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved. After much debate, the state legislative road committee included the statement that this route would follow the Feather River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue; instead of keeping it as Route 30, the Highway Commission changed the designation to an extension of the short Richvale-Oroville (now SR 162) Route 21, which was also part of the first <b>bond</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

5|$|Undaunted by {{the failure}} of the <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> Fields {{returned}} to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system. The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature, including the increased gas tax and several bills to reorganize state government. The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in the reorganization. Under Fields, the state implemented the first phase of desegregation busing.|$|E
5|$|When the Department of Engineering {{laid out}} the initial state highway system after the state's voters {{approved}} a <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> {{to pay for it}} in 1910, they included Route5, connecting Santa Cruz and Oakland with Stockton via Altamont Pass. San Joaquin County paved the portion near Tracy with asphalt with their own <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> passed in 1909, and the state later resurfaced it with concrete. In addition, the new concrete road bypassed Banta, which the old county road had passed through via Banta Road, F Street, and Grant Line Road. Otherwise, the road was relatively direct, coming down from Altamont Pass onto Grant Line Road, following Byron Highway into Tracy, and leaving east and northeasterly on 11th Street to the San Joaquin River at the Mossdale Crossing. The Lincoln Highway Association chose this route in 1913 for their transcontinental highway, where it remained until the Carquinez Bridge opened in 1927, creating a shorter route via Vallejo. In 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials designated the Stockton-Bay Area route as US48, which was absorbed by an extension of US50 by the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} housing projects, a 1955 urban renewal <b>bond</b> <b>issue</b> totaled more than $110 million. The bonds {{provided}} funds to purchase land to build three expressways into downtown St. Louis, which later became Interstate 64, Interstate 70, and Interstate 44. In 1967, the highway-only Poplar Street Bridge opened to move traffic {{from all three}} expressways over the Mississippi River. The openings of the Arch in 1965 and the bridge in 1967 were accompanied by {{the opening of a}} new stadium for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals moved into Busch Memorial Stadium early in the 1966 season. Construction of the stadium required the demolition of Chinatown, St. Louis, ending the decades-old presence of a Chinese immigrant community.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} downturn was beginning in Canada by 1958. Because {{of tax cuts}} instituted the previous year, the budget presented by the government predicted a small deficit for 1957–58, and a large one, $648million, for the following year. Minister of Finance Fleming and Bank of Canada Governor James Coyne proposed that the wartime Victory <b>Bond</b> <b>issue,</b> which constituted two-thirds of the national debt and which was due to be redeemed by 1967, be refinanced to a longer term. After considerable indecision on Diefenbaker's part, a nationwide campaign took place, and 90% of the bonds were converted. However, this transaction led {{to an increase in}} the money supply, which in future years would hamper the government's efforts to respond to unemployment.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{construction}} of concrete roads, started by a 1913 <b>bond</b> <b>issue,</b> Orange County paved the county road through Laguna Canyon, connecting State Highway Route 2 (the forerunner of U.S. Hwy. 101 and I-5) at Irvine with Laguna Beach, by 1917. The road {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933 as Route 185, an unsigned designation. The entire route was added to the new California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959; the planned upgrade had already been named the Laguna Freeway by the California Highway Commission on November 26, 1957. The highway received a sign route numberState Route 133in the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
