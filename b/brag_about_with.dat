There were politically active groups in New York City, but Kramer notes the culture on Fire Island was so different that they would often make fun of political activists: [...] "It was not chic. It was not something you could <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> <b>with</b> your friends... Guys marching down Fifth Avenue was a whole other world. The whole gestalt of Fire Island was about beauty and looks and golden men." ...|$|E

He taught newly released French soldiers the [...] "evils" [...] of the Communards as the government prepared for a battle. Starting on May 21 and continuing through May 28, soldiers chased the National Guard members who sided with the Communards through the streets. Around 18,000 Parisians were killed, 25,000 were imprisoned, and thousands more were later executed.

50|$|Rita Schiano's novel, Painting the Invisible Man, was {{influenced}} by the 1976 murder of her father. Like Anna Matteo, the character in the story, Schiano was researching the archives of her hometown newspaper for a client when she made a keying error that led to the discovery of thirty-seven articles from the 1990s referencing her father, murdered in 1976. One such headline mentioned FBI surveillance tapes of a man <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> getting away <b>with</b> murder twenty years before. Written as a contemporary historical fiction rather than as a memoir, Schiano confronted intensely challenging and personal issues and created a compelling story. It was published September 2007 by The Reed Edwards Company.|$|R

She actively follows American popular culture through the television and satellite. She believes American soldiers appear like Justin Timberlake. Romanska states that she describes violent events and possibilities [...] "matter-of-factly, so used to the twisted reality around her that she appears unaware of its horror." [...] Romanska states that {{it is common for}} survivors of traumatic events to feel a sense of numbness. The girl describes the death of her grandparents; they were unwilling to answer the door and did not speak English, and a tank killed them afterwards. The girl can distinguish types of weapons from hearing them fired. Romanska stated, [...] "She is proud of this skill and <b>brags</b> <b>about</b> it <b>with</b> a blasé attitude, on the same emotional scale with which she chats about Justin Timberlake and Oprah".|$|R

He indicated that Bahrain is ready to develop relations in other fields as well. The king reportedly gave orders that official statements don't use phrases such as [...] "enemy" [...] and [...] "Zionist entity" [...] when referring to Israel anymore.

2500|$|Contimporanul went {{bankrupt}} in 1932, {{by which time}} Vinea had by then replaced the retiring Cocea as editor of Facla, and was writing for the minor political newspaper Progresul Social. He was either using his own name or resorting to familiar pen names: [...] "B. Iova", [...] "Dr. Caligari", [...] "Aladin". The newspaper politics changed to reflect the PNȚ line. Vinea renounced his republicanism and paid homage to the returnee King Carol II. For a while in 1929 and 1930, Vinea was in France on an extended trip, and later <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> making friends <b>with</b> F. Scott Fitzgerald. During his leave of absence, he assigned Olimpia Iovanaki as manager of Facla and its dwindling finances; Lucian Boz was the literary columnist.|$|R

After he breaks up with all three girls, they agree that breaking his heart is the ideal revenge. They then enlist Kate to be the heartbreaker.|$|R
50|$|While Jean Rouch let his African {{subjects}} {{present their}} own story, {{a number of}} his editing decisions remain controversial. He was accused of exploiting them and holding them under a microscope through his condescending camera lens.Furthermore, some of his collaborators found him too dictatorial in the editing process, in antithesis to his very open attitude while capturing footage. The editing decisions themselves also proved quite controversial. For instance, in the scene where Edward G. Robinson <b>brags</b> <b>about</b> his conquests <b>with</b> white women in Europe to Élite, the film cuts to shots of the sterns of ships registered in the ports that he name-checks (such as Oslo), corresponding to the shipments of sacks that they have just loaded in their menial jobs, suggesting that the character is being untruthful.|$|R

50|$|In January 2014, Hope tells Brady that John {{discovered}} that he is not, after all, the son of Colleen Brady and Santo DiMera. The orphanage where he was supposedly reared misled a desperate Colleen into believing that John was her son, when in reality the real Ryan Brady had died. Hence, John's origins are once more in doubt. In 2014, concerned about Brady's drug use and behavior with Theresa Donovan, John Black returned to Salem. After Theresa <b>brags</b> <b>about</b> eloping <b>with</b> a drunk Brady in Las Vegas, John let Theresa {{know that he had}} just recorded their conversation that would insure her arrest. Theresa panics and attacks John with a fireplace poker, sending him into a coma and deletes John's recording. After another brief absence in late 2014 in order to take care of Basic Black business in Europe, a hopeful John returns to Salem to work on salvaging his relationship with Marlena. In early 2015, Police Commissioner Abe Carver asks John to rejoin the Salem Police Department. With Marlena's counsel and blessing, John takes the job despite a not-so-veiled threat from Stefano DiMera.|$|R

40|$|People often <b>brag</b> <b>about,</b> or advertise, {{their good}} deeds to others. Seven studies {{investigate}} how <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that <b>bragging</b> conveys information <b>about</b> an actor's good deeds, {{leading to an}} attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocialbehavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help - and often hurts - when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketingproducts have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, {{the authors argue that}} <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic considerations inherent in signaling altruism...|$|R
