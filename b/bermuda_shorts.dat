The police, including a Criminal Investigation Department team, conducted an intensive search for the girl, and police officers carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds. Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library, a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons, distributed over 70,000 leaflets appealing for information. Two Singaporeans offered rewards of S$10,000 and S$5,000 for finding Huang Na, while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip-offs. The search even extended to Malaysia, with volunteers putting up posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bermuda</b> <b>Shorts</b> Day (BSD) is {{an annual}} end-of-term {{tradition}} for the University of Calgary, usually celebrated around {{the close of}} winter semester every April. As the name suggests, students traditionally wear <b>Bermuda</b> <b>shorts.</b> Recent trends however have seen the rise of bright-neon and floral attire instead of the short formal trouser. The event is notorious for turning the campus for one day only, into a giant festival of alcohol consumption and day-party concerts. This cornerstone event of student life however had more modest origins.|$|E

25|$|Police {{organisation}} {{and uniform}} history has varied throughout the British Overseas Territories. Uniforms have {{often had to}} be adapted to local climates. The Bermuda Police Service has followed the trends of UK police forces in its dress, having adopted dark blue tunics, trousers, and helmets at its inception. After the appointment of Police Commissioner Colin Coxall, in 1995 (formerly of the Metropolitan Police), the four-pocket jackets and helmets were reserved for ceremonial or public relations occasions, with more comfortable bomber jackets and woollen pullovers adopted. In the Bermuda Police, only officers wear white shirts, with sergeants and constables wearing light blue ones. During the summer months, the long trousers are replaced with <b>Bermuda</b> <b>shorts.</b> The traditional image of a Bermuda policeman {{in the minds of}} summer visitors is helmeted, with knee socks and shorts. During, and for a short time after, the Second World War, influenced by the large numbers of military personnel on the island, the Bermuda Police took to wearing military-style khaki shorts and shirts during the summer months, but this fad quickly passed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, arts student Alan Arthur was {{ridiculed}} for wearing shorts in public, an apparent uncommon occurrence for men during the time. In the following year, on Thursday, 31 March 1960, Arthur who was the inaugural Associate-Editor for the newly created student-run newspaper the Gauntlet at the time, took to the campus advertisement board and wrote in chalk, words of {{what would become the}} start of a campus tradition. It is hotly contested what the original words were exactly, but one variant goes that Arthur wrote [...] "Tomorrow is <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Shorts</b> Day. Everyone wear Bermuda Shorts." [...] Arthur has stated that he wrote the now immortal words, in part to the arrival of warm spring weather, in jest as a light-hearted April Fools joke, and as an unlikely way to reduce stigma around men donning short-cut trousers. The famed arts alumnus, Maurice Yacowar – who strangely enough, was The Gauntlet's inaugural Editor-in-Chief at the time – was a contemporary and personal friend of Arthur. Yacowar recalls that many individuals of the UAC's 250 student population stayed true to Arthur's announcement, and wore <b>Bermuda</b> <b>shorts</b> that April Fools of 1960. The first BSD, according to Arthur and Yacowar, was a more innocent affair, featuring a highly competitive marbles tournament.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground: Evidence {{suggests}} that {{higher levels of}} vitamin D and calcium are associated with greater lung function and that vitamin D is inversely associated with atopic sensitisation. It is unknown whether the associations of vitamin D and calcium with lung function are independent of each other or mediated by atopic sensitisation. Objective: To study the associations of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] and ionised calcium levels with lung function and specific allergen sensitisation in adolescents (12 - 19 years) and adults (20 - 59 years) and to assess whether the associations with lung function are due to altered atopic sensitisation. Methods: Cross-sectional {{analysis of the data}} from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Results: 25 (OH) D levels were positively associated with forced vital capacity in adolescents [0. 035 (95 %CI: 0. 007 - 0. 064) standard deviations;SD in model adjusted for multiple confounders]. This association and the previously reported association between higher serum levels of 25 (OH) D and better lung function in adults were independent of serum calcium levels, which were not associated with lung function. In adults, calcium was associated with sensitisation to grass allergens [OR per SD, 1. 17 (1. 03 - 1. 32), 1. 15 (1. 01 - 1. 31) and 1. 18 (1. 06 - 1. 32) for white oak, <b>Bermuda</b> grass and <b>short</b> ragweed, respectively] and peanut OR 1. 21 (95 %CI 1. 02 - 1. 43) after adjusting for age, gender and race/ethnicity, but these associations attenuated towards the null after adjusting for additional confounders. The associations were independent of 25 (OH) D levels, which were not associated with allergen sensitisation. Conclusions: Circulating levels of 25 (OH) D are positively associated with lung function and this {{does not appear to be}} driven by allergen sensitisation or influenced by calcium levels...|$|R
