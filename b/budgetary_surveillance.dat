The options conside-red are: (i) A federal budget with unemployment and corporate taxes shifted to euro-area level; (ii) a support scheme based on deviations from potential output; (iii) an insurance scheme via which governments would issue bonds indexed to GDP, and (iv) a scheme in which access to jointly guaranteed borrowing is combi-ned with gradual withdrawal of fiscal sovereignty. • Our comparison is based on strong assumptions.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the government sector gained prominence after the World War II as the Keynesian theory attributed the government sector key importance in battling economic cycle and the post-war reconstruction and development involved state interventions on a large scale. In 1990 s a strength-ened interest in the government sector was triggered {{by the need to}} coordinate fiscal policies and closely monitor fiscal health in the countries forming the Economic and Monetary Union. Finally, {{in the context of the}} recent global economic crisis, the government sector returned to the centre of the economic policy debate as fiscal policy was used as a main tool to fight the economic recession and subsequently sustainability of government finances became a pressing issue for many countries around the Globe. Increasing importance of the fiscal analysis and fiscal policymaking always generated and continues to generate demand for appropriate statistical data. The international statistical standards played a key role in meeting these requirements. This dissertation offers a comprehensive historical overview, a comparative analysis and evaluation of main internationally recognised statistical standards dealing with the government sector produced by the United Nations, the OECD, the European Communities (Eurostat), the IMF and the European Central Bank. It covers a period since the first international guidelines in late 1940 s up to present. It analyses evolution of the statistical treatment of the government sector including its historical roots and gradual revisions and extensions to reflect changing needs and shifts in economic environment. The study compares individual standards with each other and across time and points out differences in basic definitions, concepts and classifications, the institutional coverage of the government sector, structure of government accounts and balancing items, integration of flow accounts with balance sheets and consolidation of transactions or stocks. The dissertation shows that the international statistical standards were successful in offering common statistical guidance, recommendations and best practices. The international organizations have proven to be well suited to deliver widely acknowledged standards. Their cooperation with national statistical agencies and engagement of the most competent experts in the field contributed to building credibility of these statistical systems, if properly applied. The comparative analysis also demonstrates a clear long-term effort of the international statistical community to enhance international harmonization. The application of the international statistical standards also improved quality and availability of government statistics as individual countries are in principle bound [...] through their memberships in the international organizations [...] to compile agreed data on the basis of a common methodology. This was in particular the case for EU countries for which provision of statistical data according to a given standard is legally binding, as the data are relevant for <b>budgetary</b> and <b>surveillance</b> procedures. As a special case, the history since early 1990 s and current situation of statistics on the government sector in the Czech Republic is presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} first five years of {{experience}} with the working of the EMU framework for fiscal policy in EMU. It is argued that the balance with the fiscal framework of EMU so far is mixed. The EMU framework has contributed to avoid large fiscal imbalances in EU Member States and has evolved continuously to deal with a number of budgetary challenges connected to the conduct of fiscal policy and the assessment of budgetary developments in the short, medium and long run. However, problems with the implementations of the rules have emerged, and the ownership of the framework should be re-established. We argue in favour of further improvements within the framework of the Treaty along the following directions:Â increased focus on debt and sustainability; better account of country-specific factors in the definition of medium-term targets; better enforcement of the rules; improved implementation of the excessive deficit procedure; greater account of the Lisbon goals in applying the EMU framework for economic policy co-ordination and <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance.</b> EMU, Economic and monetary union, automatic stabilisation, <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance,</b> fiscal sustainability, Flores, Giudice, Turrini...|$|E
40|$|Real‐time {{estimates}} of potential output {{are used for}} the calculation of the cyclically adjusted budget balance, {{one of the main}} indicators in the assessment of the fiscal performance of EU member states. The estimation of potential output involves a decomposition of actual output into a cyclical and a structural component based on arbitrary assumptions about the statistical properties of the two unobserved components. With a very high degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be temporary, as are the ensuing changes in the budget deficit. Conversely, with a low degree of smoothing, variations in GDP are mostly taken to be permanent, leading to different policy conclusions. Our paper examines whether and how different potential output estimates would have supported different decisions in the EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance</b> in terms of both timing and substance. The results show that only a very high degree of smoothing of potential output would significantly reduce the reliability of the surveillance indicators. We conclude that a higher degree of smoothing compared with current practice would not be harmful for EU fiscal surveillance, while it could contribute to more cautious policies by signalling larger and longer periods of economic ‘good times’. potential output, cyclical adjustment, EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance,</b> Stability and Growth Pact, Excessive Deficit Procedure, safety margin, minimum benchmark, fiscal surveillance indicators,...|$|E
40|$|In {{the decades}} ahead, {{the size and}} age {{structure}} of the European population will change dramatically. These demographic changes will obviously {{have a significant impact}} on society. Economic growth is expected to slow down following the reduction in the population of working age. In addition, there will be strong upward pressure on public expenditure on pensions, health care and long-term care for the elderly. It is in that context that questions arise regarding the long-term sustainability of public finances. The article aims to explain the challenges inherent in population ageing for public finances, and how the authorities can respond with an appropriate fiscal policy. After a succinct account of some of the most striking demographic trends, the estimates of the budgetary costs of ageing are presented. Next is explained what is meant by sustainable public finances and how that concept can be made operational. The sustainability of public finances is a key element in the process of <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance</b> organised at the European Union level. In Belgium, it is also a key aspect addressed by the “Public Sector Borrowing Requirement” section of the High Council of Finance in its periodic opinions.

The paper evaluates the impact of the crisis on EU countries? current as well as future MTOs through the channels of higher public debt, lower growth potential, and higher cost of ageing. On the basis of alternative scenarios for macroeconomic and budgetary conditions as of 2012 -when the next revision of MTOs is scheduled-, the paper concludes that prospective MTOs would be more stringent than the current ones. Therefore, a path for gradual fiscal tightening is already embedded into the European fiscal framework and should be considered when discussing exit strategies. Finally, an alternative indicator linking MTOs to the current fiscal and financial imbalances is presented.

As the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) had failed to adequately ensure the <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance</b> required under the EU treaties, it was revised and reinforced again in 2010 and 2011, and in addition supplemented by a new procedure designed to prevent macroeconomic imbalances. Moreover, a number of “financial assistance facilities” were created or expanded for EU or euro area countries to support them in managing crises that might result in contagion effects. The emerging difficulties of Greece created a need to ensure previously nonexistent crisis financing for euro area countries. In March 2009, the funding capacity of the EU’s balance of payments facility was raised to EUR 50 billion. Measures taken since May 2010 include the extension of bilateral loans to Greece and the creation of further financing mechanisms: the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF: EUR 440 billion), the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM: EUR 60 billion) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM: EUR 500 billion). With these mechanisms, the EU has built a framework for providing regional financial support alongside funding provided by the IMF at the global level. EU, financial crisis, crisis financing...|$|E

Bearing in mind that the government balance for the new Member States was – 5. 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003, the required reduction of fiscal deficits will not be easy. This has been acknowledged by the Commission, which has argued that the need to reach and maintain sound budgetary positions will require an appropriate time path between the necessary consolidation and the appropriate fiscal stance supporting the transition.

As a consequence, most European countries are developing specific provisions for public investment within the EU’s framework for <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The relevance of public infrastructure spending as a strategy to promote economic development has been well acknowledged among economists through times although there is not general consensus about whether and how public capital affects the economy: most economists agree on the positive impact of public investment on output and productivity, but results are not very strong and depend quite crucially on the analytical methodologies employed. In general, there is not a clear evidence in favour of public rather than private capital accumulation. Our research addresses such issues for the Italian case. We aim at investigating the role played by public and private capital in the Italian economy {{over the last two decades}} by means of a cointegrated VAR approach involving a common trend analysis. Our findings tend to reduce emphasis about the positive role of public capital; following a neoclassical growth model in a learning by doing framework, our empirical analysis highlights the strength of private capital in spreading out technical progress and fostering the growth process.

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognised that fiscal rules and independent fiscal institutions other than governments and parliaments {{can make a}} major contribution to sound fiscal policy. The main arguments put forward by the specialist literature on political economy in favour of such rules and institutions are the tendency shown by governments to record excessive budget deficits (deficit bias) and {{the characteristics of a}} monetary union. Such rules and institutions should restore the balance in the incentives of politicians, impose limits on the fiscal policy pursued and introduce fiscal coordination mechanisms. Fiscal rules can be extremely useful within the scope of a sound fiscal policy. There are clear indications that such rules can facilitate the maintenance of budget discipline and encourage consolidation efforts, where necessary. In order to attain that objective, however, it is essential for the fiscal rules to conform to the principal properties inherent in any ideal fiscal rule. Certain current or former fiscal rules applied in Belgium are strictly complied with, whereas in other cases there appears to be virtually no connection between the rule and what actually happens. There is therefore still room for improvement in some of Belgium’s fiscal rules. Independent fiscal institutions can also {{play a key role in}} fiscal policy. For instance, making such institutions responsible for the economic growth forecasts used in drawing up the government budget is an effective way of curbing excess optimism in those forecasts. Moreover, institutions issuing normative budgetary recommendations have fostered fiscal discipline in the countries where such institutions exist. Belgian independent fiscal institutions – namely the National Accounts Institute and the “Public Sector Borrowing Requirements” Section of the High Council of Finance – are often cited as good examples. fiscal rules, independent fiscal institutions, <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance...</b>|$|E

In particular, within the six pack, the Council Directive 2011 / 85 /EU underlines that the regular availability of timely and reliable fiscal data is the key to proper and well timed monitoring, which in turn allows prompt action in the event of unexpected budgetary developments; therefore, became necessary understand what kind of relationship exists between data derived from national systems of public accounting and statistical data In the last years, public debate in this regard has focused on the possibility to give ESA statistical information directly through the national accounting system or by a reconciliation from the accounting system data to statistical data. In Italy, through the law 196 / 2009 on public accounting and finance, that reformed public finances and accounting rules, the government aims to improve the link between public administrations accounting and ESA information.

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) was founded in 1997 to strengthen the <b>budgetary</b> <b>surveillance</b> of countries within the EMU. It consisted of two Council regulations and a Council resolution. In 2005 the SGP was reformed and from that point a lot clearer to interpret. For example, it had been hard to interpret the importance of the Other Relevant Factors (ORF) and which to include in the decision making of an excessive deficit with the unreformed SGP but after 2005 there were clear guidelines to follow. The same year as the reformation the Commission filed a report regarding Italy, the state had a deficit above the 3 % reference value and might have an excessive deficit. The Commission found that the deficit was neither temporary nor exceptional which suggested that the deficit criterion of the SGP was not fulfilled. They also found that the debt ratio was not sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace and thereby they did not fulfil the debt criterion. The Commission was of the opinion that there existed an excessive deficit in Italy. The Council was of the same opinion and gave Italy strong recommendations to follow for a correction of the excessive deficit. In 2006 and 2008, two follow-up reports about action taken by Italy for the correction was sent from the Commission to the Council. The first one found that there was no meaning to continue the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) and the second one, sent in 2008, was about an abrogation of the decision of the existence of an excessive deficit in 2005. The Council also carried this out. No {{more than a year after}} the abrogation a new process started and Italy was once again found with an excessive deficit. The EDP was anew in full action. In a report in 2010 the Commission found that Italy had under the circumstances, amongst other the widely spread economic downturn, taken the adequate action for a correction of the excessive deficit within its time limit. The Council once again agreed and no further steps of the EDP were taken at this stage. Italy has, under the entire time period presented in this paper, failed to reach the debt and deficit criteria and have been acted on in accordance with the SGP. The changes or clarifications if you rather call it that, of the SGP has been of major help to the Commission and Council in their opinions, decisions and recommendations regarding the existence of an excessive deficit and its correction. Without the changes, the outcome for Italy might have been different...|$|E
