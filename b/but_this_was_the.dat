5|$|In 1980, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} consisting of Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore, most of it traveled with the iron as it sank into Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth {{at the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first hard evidence of an impact.|$|E

5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher.

5|$|Reig {{believed}} Herrerasaurus was {{an early}} example of a carnosaur, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified Herrerasaurus as a prosauropod. In 1972, Peter Galton classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond Saurischia. Later, using cladistic analysis, some researchers put Herrerasaurus and Staurikosaurus {{at the base of}} the dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet responded {{rapidly to}} this threat, and in November 1807 the fourth rate ship HMS Glatton and several smaller craft were blockading Corfu, seizing several French and Italian {{reinforcement}} convoys. Encouraged {{by the success}} of the blockade, small British raiders began entering the Adriatic independently, to prey on French convoys along the Italian coast. One of the first British operations in the region was the seizure of the small Dalmatian Island of Lissa, for use as a safe harbour deep in nominally French-controlled waters. The largely uninhabited island was rapidly developed into an effective naval base with the construction of a town and harbour at Port St. George. During 1807, British ships stationed in the Adriatic were relatively small and their impact was consequently minor. British raiders also limited their attacks on the Illyrian coast to purely military objectives {{in order to maintain the}} support of the local population, who supplied the British cruisers with food, water and naval stores. The French Mediterranean Fleet, led by Admiral Ganteaume made a foray to Corfu in February 1808 that the British blockading squadron was powerless to stop, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only attempt by the French to send ships of the line to the region and the fleet had returned to Toulon by mid-March.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Stó:lō girls {{went through}} puberty rites {{at the time}} of their first menstruation. A {{pubescent}} girl would be brought to a pit lined with cedar boughs and told to remain there during daylight hours, leaving only to eat and sleep. Women would bring her fir boughs and instruct her to pick out the needles one at a time, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only work she would be allowed to do; other women would feed and wash the girl until her first menstrual period was over. This custom was practiced widely, at least until youth were sent to residential schools.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s {{were the}} most {{successful}} period for Zambian cricket. The country became a favoured destination for English sides. Gloucestershire toured in 1971, Glamorgan in 1972, the MCC in 1974 and Warwickshire in 1977. However, in the early 1980s the government began to invest less money in sport and with athletics and soccer being of more interest, cricket was a low priority. A combined Minor Counties side toured in 1982, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last match played by the national side until the mid-1990s, though some Zambian players did play {{as part of the}} East African cricket team and East and Central African cricket team.|$|E

25|$|How to Train Your Dragon was {{composer}} John Powell's sixth {{collaboration with}} DreamWorks Animation.

Zimmer had long praised Powell's abilities, and on many occasions, asserted {{that he was the}} superior composer between them, thus firmly supporting Powell's first solo animation effort. For the score, Powell utilized many Celtic influences, employing instruments like the fiddle, bagpipes, dulcimer, pennywhistle, and even a harpsichord.|$|E

25|$|After her construction, Eastland was {{discovered}} to have design flaws, making her susceptible to listing. The ship was top-heavy, which became evident when passengers congregated en masse {{on the upper}} decks. During July 1903, a case of overcrowding caused Eastland to list with water flowing {{up one of the}} ship's gangplanks. The situation was quickly rectified, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first of several incidents. Later in the same month, the stern of the ship was damaged when she was backed into the tugboat George W. Gardner. During August 1906, another incident of listing occurred which resulted in the filing of complaints against the Chicago-South Haven Line which had purchased the ship earlier that year.|$|E
25|$|The Karnataka State Industrial Security Force (KISF) is {{responsible}} for security on the Namma Metro. Bangalore Police conducted detailed mock drills at metro stations {{for the first time}} on 25 March 2017. Police officials stated that the drill was to assess readiness to deal with situations such as hoax bomb calls, terrorist infiltration or attacks. Sniffer dogs, bomb detection and disposal squad, anti-sabotage squad and Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) were involved in the drill. Police had previously conducted basic mock drills, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first one aimed toward dealing with specific threats. The chosen day was a Saturday, when crowds are usually larger, in order to make the drill more challenging for officers. The BMRCL has not informed of the drill in advance.|$|E
25|$|South Africa named an {{unchanged}} side, {{boosted by}} {{the confidence of}} the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated second time around. Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best of a bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have some confidence with the bat, having had very little success in his recent county appearances. But overall, it was a disappointing effort from England, but they did respond with 3 wickets before the close of play to leave South Africa on 101/3.|$|E
