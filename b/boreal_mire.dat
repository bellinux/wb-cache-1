30|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} in the subarctic, nutrient limited mire complex Lakkasuo in central Finland (61 ° 47 ′N 24 ° 18 ′E; 150  m.a.s.l.). Lakkasuo is a well-studied <b>boreal</b> <b>mire</b> complex, with an annual N input via rainwater of 0.40  g N m− 2  year− 1 (Laine 2004). Sphagnum mosses were collected in September 2014 from oligotrophic and mesotrophic fens and a rainwater-fed bog within the same peatland basin (Additional file 1 : Table S 1). The mesotrophic fen site dominated by Sphagnum subsecundum (site A) was a wet fen system, whereas mesotrophic fen site B with Sphagnum obtusum was drier. The oligotrophic fen site was naturally divided in two patches where Sphagnum fallax (site C) and Sphagnum papillosum (site D), respectively, were dominant. The rainwater-fed bog site was dominated by Sphagnum majus (site E). See Additional file 1 : Table S 2 for a full overview of the site vegetation index.|$|E

On the minerotrophic fen site, the number of forest species declined and the cover of Eriophorum vaginatum increased five-fold, reaching over 50 % cover in three years. On the ombrotrophic bog site, the terrestrial lichens disappeared, while the cover of Empetrum nigrum, Calluna vulgaris, E. vaginatum, and Sphagnum balticum increased.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of uranium and thorium in ten partly nested streams in the boreal forest region were monitored over a two-year period. Considerable spatiotemporal variations were observed, {{with little or}} no correlation between streams. The export of both uranium and thorium varied substantially between the subcatchments, ranging from 1. 7 to 30 g km − 2 a − 1 for uranium and from 3. 2 to 24 g km − 2 a − 1 for thorium. Airborne gamma spectrometry was used to measure the {{concentrations of}} uranium and thorium in surface soils throughout the catchment, but could not explain the variability in the export. Instead, the extent of lakes and mires within each subcatchment was found to be a stronger predictor for the transport of uranium and thorium. The results indicate that there is a predictable and systematic accumulation of both uranium and thorium in <b>boreal</b> <b>mires.</b> Approximately 65 – 80 % of uranium and 55 – 65 % of thorium entering a mire is estimated to be retained in the peat. Overall, accumulation in mires and other types of wetlands is estimated to decrease the fluxes of uranium and thorium from the boreal forest landscape by 30 – 40 %. The atmospheric deposition of uranium and thorium was also quantified and its contribution to boreal streams was found to be low compared to weathering...|$|R

The main emphasis is on the hydromorphology, flora and vegetation, but the bird fauna and conservational aspects are also included. The regionality of the vegetation is stressed (5 zones/belts and 5 sections have been mapped). Nine main mire localities that will be visited during the excursion are also described. Rørmyra (locality l), Kaldvassmyra (2) and Toppmyr/Røkmyr (9) are southern <b>boreal</b> <b>mires</b> with raised bog units. They represent three different (oceanic) sections. Tufsingdeltaet (3 S,to rmyra (6) and Bakkedalen (8) are middleboreal mires representing some of the most continental areas in Norway (localities 5 and 6, the slightly continental section) and the most oceanic areas (locality 8, the highly oceanic section). Typical mire units are flark fens and sting mixed mires (5), flat fens (6) and blanket bogs (8). The final localities, Upper Forra (3), Sølendet (4) and Haukskardmyrin (7), are mainly of northern boreal type but in quite different sections. Sloping fens dominate localities 3 and 4, palsa mires (the southernmost in Fennoscandia) are typical for locality 7.

40|$|SummaryAccurate {{quantification}} of dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) in surface and soil pore waters is crucial for understanding changes in water resources {{under the influence of}} climate and land use changes. Sampling and laboratory analysis of DOC content at a sufficient temporal frequency are especially difficult to achieve for natural DOC sources like the extensive boreal and arctic mire landscapes due to their remoteness. Therefore, the goals of this paper are (1) to investigate the performance of a portable, high-resolution ultraviolet–visible light spectroscopic method for determining the DOC content of surface and soil pore water samples from a <b>boreal</b> <b>mire</b> complex and (2) to compare the spectroscopic method with other DOC measurement techniques, e. g., the wet heated persulfate oxidation method and a laboratory, expulsion-based spectrophotometric method and (3) to assess different multivariate models that relate absorbance measurements with DOC contents. The study indicates that high-resolution spectroscopic measurements provide a simple, robust and non-destructive method for measuring DOC content. These measurements are of short duration (< 1 min) and the sample analysis is portable, rendering this method particularly advantageous for in situ investigations at remote field locations. The study also demonstrates that if absorbances at specific wavelengths are used as proxies for DOC concentration, it is recommended to create site-specific calibration models that include more than one wavelength to achieve the optimal accuracy of the proxy-based DOC quantification...|$|E
40|$|Mires {{surface energy}} and water budgets govern the {{conditions}} for climatic, hydrological, ecological and carbon balance processes. The components {{of the water and}} surface energy budgets were quantified over two growing seasons for an open <b>boreal</b> <b>mire.</b> The measurements of fluxes were complemented with data on the spatial variation of water content and temperature in different micro-relief elements (hummocks and hollows). Since measurements on mires are scarce, special investigations of aerodynamic properties were done as well as a calibration of TDR function for peat. The partitioning of available energy at the surface depended mainly on air temperature and relative humidity. There was a trend of falling Bowen ratio both during the day and during the season from May (monthly value 0. 9) to September (0. 6). The bulk surface resistance (rs) to evapotranspiration was considerable and varied little (mean rs = 160 s m- 1). The cause of its relatively large value could be found in a great aerodynamic resistance within the canopy layer, and the peat wetness variation influenced little. In the scale of the whole mire, the water storage were similar over the central, open areas. On a smaller scale, the presence of a pronounced micro-topography caused a variation of the surface wetness. This was also reflected in the spatial variation of soil temperatures. The heat storage in hummock was largely influenced by lateral heat fluxes. There were considerable effects of peat elasticity and approximately 40 % of the changes in water storage was caused by swelling/shrinking of the whole peat mound. This effect should be incorporated in future models of mire-water dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{analyzes}} the different modes {{of variation in}} methane fluxes from different microsites of a <b>boreal</b> <b>mire.</b> The results {{emphasize the importance of}} microsite characteristics, water table and vegetation cover for methane fluxes. Water level affects the moisture and oxygen profiles in peat matrix which are reflected to methane production and oxidation rates and the corresponding microbial populations. Vascular plants promote methane production by providing substrates in the form of root exudates and fine root litter, enhance methane oxidation by transporting oxygen to water saturated peat layers and accelerate methane transport by liberating methane from peat to the atmosphere via the aerenchymous tissue. The model presented in this study connects the methane fluxes to the seasonal photosynthetic cycle of plants at the microsite level while the thermal and hydrological conditions in peat are used as an operational framework. Overall, the model dynamically combines the microbial processes in peat to changing environmental factors in the level of peatland ecosystem. Sensitivity analysis of the model reveals the importance of substrate supply to methane fluxes. Furthermore, the model outcome is sensitive to increased capability of the vascular plants to transport oxygen downwards. Lack of oxygen and partly methane keep methane oxidation at a very low level. Any changes in model parameters or environmental conditions that compensate for these lacks have a remarkable decreasing effect on simulated flux. Simulated methane flux decreases considerably if the duration of simulated dry period increases, threshold for a dramatic change lying between 4 and 6 weeks of drought. Increase in air temperature enhances methane flux especially if the effect of increased tempe [...] ...|$|E

How {{the climate change}} with increasing temperatures will affect the soil carbon storage represents uncertainty of the predictions in the climate change ecosystem feedback mechanisms. In this study the temperature impact on the decomposition of the large carbon pools in peatlands was investigated. Peat cores from different microtopographic units in a <b>boreal</b> oligotrophic minerogenic <b>mire</b> in northern Sweden were collected from in three depths (5 - 10, 10 - 15 and 15 - 20 centimeters below the surface). The samples were incubated at four temperatures: 4, 9, 14 and 19 °C and the heterotrophic respiration (CO 2 - production) was measured hourly or 37 days. Unexpectedly, basal respiration did not show any correlation with temperature. However, the exponential increase in respiration (µ) was correlated with temperature: i. e.  giving Q 10 values between 2 (SE +/- 0. 36) and 5 (SE +/- 1. 05).

This was done on experimental plots at a <b>boreal,</b> low sedge <b>mire</b> where the effect of long-term addition of SO 4 22 on peat pore water MeHg concentrations was observed weekly throughout the snow-free portion of 1999. The additions of SO 4 22 started in 1995. The seasonal mean of the pore water MeHg concentrations on the plots with 17 kg ha 21 yr 21 of sulphur (S) addition (1. 360. 08 ng L 21, SE; n = 44) was significantly (p, 0. 0001) higher than the mean MeHg concentration on the plots with 3 kg ha 21 yr 21 of ambient S deposition (0. 660. 02 ng L 21, SE; n = 44). The temporal variation in pore water MeHg concentrations during the snow free season was larger in the S-addition plots, with an amplitude of. 2 ng L 21 compared to +/ 20. 5 ng L 21 in the ambient S deposition plots. The concentrations of pore water MeHg in the S-addition plots were positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 21; p = 0. 001) to the groundwater level, with the lowest concentrations of MeHg during the period with the lowest groundwater levels.

40|$|Abstract In this thesis, I {{studied the}} {{patterns}} in the assemblage composition {{as well as the}} biogeography and ecology of spring macroinvertebrates and bryophytes in Finland. My main objectives were to assess the importance environmental variables to macroinvertebrate and bryophyte assemblage composition in springs at the level of multiple spatial scales. In addition, I assessed the importance of springs in the <b>boreal</b> <b>mire</b> landscape, and sought the ecological and environmental determinants of a key species in boreal springs. In a large-scale study, I also examined the concordance between macroinvertebrates and bryophytes across boreal ecoregions, and assessed how macroinvertebrate assemblage variation corresponds to terrestrially-based ecoregions. Locally, spring macroinvertebrate assemblage structure displays high variation between different kinds of mesohabitats within springs, highlighting the importance of careful sampling of all habitat types in spring surveys. Helocrenes and other aquatic-terrestrial ecotone habitats harbour the highest species diversity and most spring-dependent species among spring habitat types. Further, spring-influenced mire patches were shown to have distinct cranefly assemblages in the mire landscape and to harbour higher cranefly diversity than mire types with lower trophic status, emphasising the importance of springs for mire biodiversity. Regionally, a red-listed spring-dependent caddisfly species appeared to be a surrogate for a high spring conservation value, indicating high overall species diversity and the occurrence of additional red-listed species. On a large geographical scale, intersecting the boreal ecoregions, a pattern of gradual change of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition from south to north was detected, largely corresponding to terrestrially-derived ecoregions. However, the physical attributes of springs also need {{to be taken into account}} in bioassessment studies. Macroinvertebrate assemblage variation also correlated with physical habitat-scale variables, but not with changes in water chemistry. In contrast, spring bryophyte assemblages showed a distinct response to variation in water chemistry, but not to variation in physical habitat characteristics. Bryophytes and insect assemblages were concordant with each other on the large geographical scale, although the concordance was rather weak. Because of their different kind of responses to the physical and chemical variables, insects and bryophytes of springs are poor surrogates for each other in boreal springs...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic systems {{worldwide}} receive {{large amounts}} of organic carbon from terrestrial sources. This ‘allochthonous’ organic carbon (AlloOC) affects critical {{physical and chemical properties}} of freshwater ecosystems, with consequences for food web structures and exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere. In the boreal region, loadings of AlloOC are particularly high due to leaching from huge organic deposits in <b>boreal</b> forest, <b>mire</b> and tundra soils. A main process of AlloOC turnover in aquatic systems is its use by heterotrophic bacteria. Applying a bioassay approach, I measured the respiration and growth (production) of bacteria in northern Sweden, in streams and lakes almost totally dominated by AlloOC. The objective was to elucidate how variations in AlloOC source, age, composition and concentration impact on its use by aquatic bacteria, and how AlloOC properties, in turn, are regulated by landscape composition and by hydrology. The bacterial respiration (30 - 309 µg C L- 1 d- 1) was roughly proportional to the concentration of AlloOC (7 - 47 mg C L- 1), but not significantly related to AlloOC source or character. Bacterial production (4 - 94 µg C L- 1 d- 1), on the other hand, was coupled to the AlloOC character, rather than concentration. A strong coupling to AlloOC character was also found for bacterial growth efficiency (0. 06 - 0. 51), i. e. production per unit of assimilated carbon. Bacterial production and growth efficiency increased with rising concentrations of low molecular weight AlloOC (carboxylic acids, free amino acids and simple carbohydrates). While the total AlloOC concentrations generally were the highest in mire-dominated catchments, low molecular weight AlloOC concentrations were much higher in forested catchments, compared to mire-dominated. These patterns were reflected in a strong landscape control of aquatic bacterial metabolism. Moreover, high flow episodes increased the export of organic carbon from forests, in relation to the export from mires, stimulating the bacterial production and growth efficiency in streams with mixed (forest and mire) catchments. The potential of AlloOC to support efficient bacterial growth decreased on time-scales of weeks to months, as the AlloOC was aged in laboratory or lake in situ conditions. To conclude, landscape, hydrology and conditions which determine AlloOC age have large influence on bacterial metabolism in boreal aquatic systems. Considering the role of bacteria in heterotrophic food chains, these factors can have spin-off effects on the structure and function of boreal aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} patterns and controls of the seasonal and inter-annual variations in energy fluxes (i. e., sensible heat, H, and latent heat, lambda E) and partitioning {{of the water}} budget (i. e., precipitation, P; evapotranspiration, ET; discharge, Q; and soil water storage, Delta S) over five years (2001 - 2005) in a boreal oligotrophic fen in northern Sweden based on continuous eddy covariance, water table level (WTL), and weir measurements. For the growing season (May 1 to September 31), the 5 year averages (+/- standard deviation) of the midday (10 : 00 to 14 : 00 h) Bowen ratio (beta, i. e., H/lambda E) was 0. 86 +/- 0. 08. Seasonal and inter-annual variability of beta was mainly driven by lambda E which itself was strongly controlled by both weather (i. e., vapor pressure deficit, D, and net radiation, R-n) and physiological parameters (i. e., surface resistance). During the growing season, surface resistance largely exceeded aerodynamic resistance, which together with low mean values of the actual ET to potential ET ratio (0. 55 +/- 0. 05) and Priestley-Taylor alpha (0. 89) suggests significant physiological constrains on ET in this well-watered fen. Among the water budget components, the inter-annual variability of ET was lower (199 to 298 mm) compared to Q (225 to 752 mm), with each accounting on average for 34 and 65 % of the ecosystem water loss, respectively. The fraction of P expended into ET was negatively correlated to P and positively to R-n. Although a decrease in WTL caused a reduction of the surface conductance, the overall effect of WTL on ET was limited. Non-growing season (October 1 to April 30) fluxes of H, lambda E, and Q were significant representing on average - 67 %, 13 %, and 61 %, respectively, of their growing season sums (negative sign indicates opposite flux direction between the two seasons). Overall, {{our findings suggest that}} plant functional type composition, P and R-n dynamics (i. e., amount and timing) were the major controls on the partitioning of the mire energy and water budgets. This has important implications for the regional climate as well as for ecosystem development, nutrient, and carbon dynamics. Citation: Peichl, M., J. Sagerfors, A. Lindroth, I. Buffam, A. Grelle, L.

40|$|Unraveling the {{potentially}} shifting controls over microbial activity among habitats and across seasonal transitions {{is critical for}} understanding how freshwater ecosystems influence broader elemental cycles, and how these systems may respond to global changes. We used nutrient-diffusing substrates to investigate seasonal patterns and constraints on microbial activity of biofilms in streams draining distinct landscape features of the <b>boreal</b> biome (forests, <b>mires,</b> and lakes). Microbial respiration (MR) largely mirrored spatial and temporal variation in water temperature. However, limitation by labile carbon (C) was a constraint to microbial activity during ice-covered periods, when MR of control nutrient-diffusing substrates fell below rates predicted from stream temperature alone. Variation in C limitation among the study streams was reflective of putative organic C availability, with C limitation of biofilms weakest in the dissolved organic C (DOC) -rich, mire-outlet stream and greatest in the relatively DOC-poor, forest stream. Incidences of nutrient limitation were only observed during warmer months. Our study illustrates how variation in processes mediated by heterotrophic biofilms and seasonal shifts in resource limitation can emerge in a stream network draining a heterogeneous landscape. In addition, our results show that, for {{a large portion of}} the year, heterotrophic processes in boreal streams can be strongly limited by the availability of labile C, despite high DOC concentrations. Metabolic constraints to dissolved organic matter processing at near-freezing temperatures, coupled with hydrological controls over the delivery of more labile organic resources to streams (e. g., soil freezing and flooding), have potentially strong influences on the productivity of boreal streams.

40|$|Based on {{theories}} of mire development {{and responses to}} a changing climate, the current role of mires as a net carbon sink has been questioned. A rigorous evaluation of the current net C-exchange in mires requires measurements of all relevant fluxes. Estimates of annual total carbon budgets in mires are still very limited. Here, we present a full carbon budget over 2 years for a <b>boreal</b> minerogenic oligotrophic <b>mire</b> in northern Sweden (64 degrees 11 'N, 19 degrees 33 'E). Data on the following fluxes were collected: land-atmosphere CO 2 exchange (continuous Eddy covariance measurements) and CH 4 exchange (static chambers during the snow free period); TOC (total organic carbon) in precipitation; loss of TOC, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH 4 through stream water runoff (continuous discharge measurements and regular C-concentration measurements). The mire constituted a net sink of 27 +/- 3. 4 (+/- SD) g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2004 and 20 +/- 3. 4 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2005. This could be partitioned into an annual surface-atmosphere CO 2 net uptake of 55 +/- 1. 9 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2004 and 48 +/- 1. 6 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2005. The annual NEE was further separated into a net uptake season, with an uptake of 92 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2004 and 86 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2005, and a net loss season {{with a loss of}} 37 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2004 and 38 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) during 2005. Of the annual net CO 2 -C uptake, 37 % and 31 % was lost through runoff (with runoff TOC > DIC >> CH 4) and 16 % and 29 % through methane emission during 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Before applying fertilizer, variability of soil fertility was not significantly correlated with the flux of Carbon dioxide, so the difference of Carbon dioxide flux based on distance sampling can be caused by root distribution factor.   After fertilizer application, variability of Carbon dioxide flux under the oil palm tree were beside affected by differences in root distribution, was also greatly influenced by fertilization.

40|$|Boreal peatlands are {{important}} long-term sinks of atmospheric carbon {{and in the}} same time the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere. A changing climate as well as deposition of anthropogenically derived pollutants, such as nitrogen and sulfur, has the potential to affect the processes that control the carbon exchange in peatlands. Many of the biogeochemical responses to changed environmental conditions, such as changed plant community composition, are slow and therefore long-term studies are required. In this thesis I have investigated the long-term effects of nitrogen addition, sulfur addition and greenhouse enclosures on carbon exchange by using a field manipulation experiment in a <b>boreal</b> minerogenic, oligotrophic <b>mire</b> after 10 - 12 years of treatment. Treatment effects on CH 4 emissions, gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were estimated from 1 - 2 seasons of chamber flux measurements. Treatment effects on potential CH 4 production and oxidation were estimated in incubations of peat from different depth intervals. The effect of nitrogen deposition on carbon accumulation was evaluated in peat cores at different depth intervals. The long-term nitrogen additions have: shifted plant community composition from being dominated by Sphagnum to being dominated by sedges and dwarf shrubs; changed mire surface microtopography so that mean water table is closer to the surface in plots with high nitrogen; increased CH 4 production and emission; increased Reco slightly but have not affected GPP or NEE; reduced the peat height increment, but increased both peat bulk density and carbon content, leading to an unchanged carbon accumulation. The long-term sulfur additions have not reduced CH 4 emissions, only slightly reduced CH 4 production and did not have any effect on the CO 2 carbon exchange. The greenhouse treatment, manifested in increased air and soil temperatures, reduced both CH 4 emissions and CH 4 production by approximately 30 %, decreased Reco slightly, but had no effect on either GPP or NEE. Many of these results oppose to earlier findings, and this suggests that long-term field manipulations {{are important}} when evaluating effects with a long time constant...|$|R
