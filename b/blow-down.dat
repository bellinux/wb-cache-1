40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the pattern of}} large forest disturbances or <b>blow-downs</b> apparently caused by severe storms in a mostly unmanaged portion of the Brazilian Amazon using 27 Landsat images and daily precipitation estimates from NOAA satellite data. For each Landsat a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was applied. Based on SMA, we detected and mapped 279 patches (from 5 ha to 2, 223 ha) characteristic of <b>blow-downs.</b> A total of 21, 931 ha of forest were disturbed. We found {{a strong correlation between}} occurrence of <b>blow-downs</b> and frequency of heavy rainfall (Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank, r 2 = 0. 84, p 3 ̆c 0. 0003). The recurrence intervals of large disturbances were estimated to be 90, 000 yr for the eastern Amazon and 27, 000 yr for the western Amazon. This suggests that weather patterns affect the frequency of large forest disturbances that may produce different rates of forest turnover in the eastern and western Amazon basin...|$|R
50|$|Where treefall gaps {{are usually}} formed by falling trees or {{branches}} due to old age or disease, large-scale <b>blow-downs</b> {{are caused by}} squall lines, which generate heavy rain and strong winds. Some studies have measured the downburst speed of these winds to be between 26 and 41 m/s, which is enough force to cause large-scale <b>blow-downs.</b> Studies have shown that small-scale disturbances, such as treefall gaps forming after tree deaths, have a higher reoccurrence rate than do large-scale disturbances, such as <b>blow-downs.</b> Due {{to the fact that}} small-scale disturbances are more frequent, they account for about 88% of carbon emissions from the Amazon and for more biomass loss then do large-scale disturbances. These small disturbances add carbon into the environment and back into the carbon cycle; however, it is not a significant amount when compared to how much carbon is being sequestered in the above ground biomass. Because of this, the Amazon {{is considered to be a}} carbon sink.|$|R

60|$|I did not {{understand}} till long afterwards, when I had watched the fawns many times, how important is this latter suggestion. One who follows a frightened deer and sees or hears him go bounding off at breakneck pace over loose rocks and broken trees and tangled underbrush; rising swift {{on one side of}} a windfall without knowing what lies on the other side till he is already falling; driving like an arrow over ground where you must follow like a snail, lest you wrench a foot or break an ankle,--finds himself asking with unanswered wonder how any deer can live half a season in the wilderness without breaking all his legs. And when you run upon a deer at night and hear him go smashing off in the darkness at the same reckless speed, over a tangled <b>blow-down,</b> perhaps, through which you can barely force your way by daylight, then you realize suddenly that the most wonderful part of a deer's education shows itself, not in keen eyes or trumpet ears, or in his finely trained nose, more sensitive a hundred times than any barometer, but in his forgotten feet, which seem to have eyes and nerves and brains packed into their hard shells instead of the senseless matter you see there.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a Morse-like theory {{in order to}} {{decompose}} birational maps and morphisms of smooth projective varieties defined over a field of characteristic zero into more elementary steps which are locally étale isomorphic to equivariant flips, blow-ups and <b>blow-downs</b> of toric varieties. A {{crucial role in the}} considerations is played by K^*-actions where K is the base field. This paper serves as a basis for proving the weak factorization conjecture on factorization of birational maps in characteristic zero into blow-ups and <b>blow-downs.</b> This is carried out in two subsequent papers, one by the author (Combinatorial structures on toroidal varieties: a proof of the weak Factorization Theorem) and one joint with Abramovich, Karu and Matsuki (Torification and factorization of birational maps). In the last paper, the ideas of the present paper are discussed using geometric invariant theory. Comment: 23 page...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Weak {{factorization}} theorem", proved by Abramovich, Karu, Matsuki, and Włodarczyk (2002), {{says that}} any birational map between two smooth complex projective varieties can be decomposed into finitely many blow-ups or <b>blow-downs</b> of smooth subvarieties.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to give basic tools for the {{classification}} of nonsingular toric Fano varieties by means of the notions of primitive collections and primitive relations due to Batyrev. By using them we can easily deal with equivariant blow-ups and <b>blow-downs,</b> and get an easy criterion to determine whether a given nonsingular toric variety is a Fano variety or not. As applications of these results, we get a toric version of a theorem of Mori, and can classify, in principle, all nonsingular toric Fano varieties obtained from a given nonsingular toric Fano variety by finite successions of equivariant blow-ups and <b>blow-downs</b> through nonsingular toric Fano varieties. Especially, we get a new method for the classification of nonsingular toric Fano varieties of dimension at most four. These methods are extended to the case of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties endowed with natural resolutions of singularities. Especially, we easily get a new method for the classification of Gorenstein toric Fano surfaces. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Sentinel {{cases of}} {{lymphocytic}} bronchiolitis in flock production and coating operations triggered a five-plant study of airborne respirable dust and fiber exposures and health symptoms. Methods Job histories from 219 current workers {{were linked to}} a job-exposure matrix derived from personal exposure measurements of respirable dust and fibers. Univariate group comparisons and multivariate modeling tested for relations between indices of cumulative and current exposure, and respiratory and systemic symptom outcomes. Results Respiratory symptoms and repeated flu-like illnesses were associated with use of compressed air to clear equipment (<b>blow-downs)</b> and with respirable dust exposure (current and cumulative) after controlling for smoking. <b>Blow-downs</b> had an equal or greater effect than smoking status on most symptoms. Conclusions Eliminating compressed air cleaning, engineering control of dust exposure, and respirators are needed to limit exposures to particulates.
