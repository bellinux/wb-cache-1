40|$|The readout of transition-edge sensor (TES) <b>bolometers</b> {{with a large}} {{multiplexing}} {{factor is}} key {{for the next generation}} Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiment, Polarbear- 2, having 7, 588 TES <b>bolometers.</b> To enable the large arrays, we have been developing a readout system with a multiplexing factor of 40 in the frequency domain. Extending that architecture to 40 <b>bolometers</b> requires an increase in the bandwidth of the SQUID electronics above 4 MHz. This paper focuses on cryogenic readout and shows how it affects cross talk and the responsivity of the TES <b>bolometers.</b> A series resistance, such as equivalent series resistance (ESR) of capacitors for LC filters, leads to non-linear response of the <b>bolometers.</b> A wiring inductance modulates a voltage across the <b>bolometers</b> and causes cross talk. They should be controlled well to reduce systematic errors in CMB observations. We have been developing a cryogenic readout with a low series impedance and have tuned <b>bolometers</b> {{in the middle of their}} transition at a high frequency (> 3 MHz) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} and optimization of composite submillimeter wave <b>bolometers</b> {{with metal}} film absorbing elements and doped Ge thermometers are described. Performance characteristics are given for 4 x 4 -mm <b>bolometers</b> designed for operation at both He- 4 and He- 3 temperatures. The performance expected from such <b>bolometers</b> {{when they are}} optimized for various values of background loading is calculated.

25|$|A third space mission, the ESA (European Space Agency) Planck Surveyor, was {{launched}} in May 2009 and performed an even more detailed investigation until it was shut down in October 2013. Planck employs both HEMT radiometers and <b>bolometer</b> technology and will measure the CMB at a smaller scale than WMAP. Its detectors were trialled in the Antarctic Viper telescope as ACBAR (Arcminute Cosmology <b>Bolometer</b> Array Receiver) experiment—which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date—and in the Archeops balloon telescope.|$|E
25|$|During July and August, two new <b>bolometer</b> sites {{commenced}} operations near Algeciras and Ceuta. These sites detected Operation Pedestal, {{a convoy}} bound for Malta, {{during the second}} week of August 1942 and Axis air, sea and submarine attacks led to many losses. Following this engagement, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee again considered countermeasures against the <b>bolometer</b> sites; the Governor of Gibraltar and Special Operations Executive proposed direct attacks on the facilities {{and the head of the}} Royal Navy advocated jamming them. During a meeting held on 25 August, the Chiefs of Staff decided to make another diplomatic protest, which was formally lodged with the Spanish Government in October.|$|E

40|$|International audienceScintillating <b>bolometers</b> are {{particle}} detectors {{with a high}} particle {{discrimination power}} with many applications in nuclear and particle physics. This discrimination power {{is based on the}} different scintillation yield for different particles, and is strongly dependent on the target used. At the very low temperatures required for the operation of the <b>bolometers,</b> very few data about the scintillation yields are available. In this paper we present estimates of absolute light yields and energy partition among heat, light and trapping channels in Sapphire (AlO) and BGO (BiGeO) scintillating <b>bolometers</b> operated at 20  mK. The estimate relies on the observed negative correlation between the light and heat signals produced by γ-ray absorption in scintillating <b>bolometers</b> and on the study of the x-ray stimulated luminescence properties of BGO at temperatures down to 77 K...|$|R
25|$|This protest did {{not lead}} to the closure of the {{stations}} and it is likely that they {{played a role in the}} Axis response to the Allied Operation Torch landings in North Africa in November 1942. The sites were not the only source of intelligence used to direct air attacks on Allied convoys, as the German Air Force conducted a daily reconnaissance flight over Gibraltar from September. The <b>bolometer</b> sites were dismantled during late 1942 and on 29 December that year, after the Spanish Government directed Canaris to cease intelligence activities in Spain to avoid giving the Allies a pretext to invade the country. German observation posts continued to be maintained in the Gibraltar area, though the German agents were gradually replaced with citizens of other countries and the sites declined in effectiveness. An attempt to reactivate the <b>bolometer</b> sites was made in mid-1943 but abandoned by July.|$|E

40|$|Figures {{of merit}} {{condensing}} the performance parameters of radiation sensors such as responsivity, noise equivalent power, and time constant {{in a single}} number can be useful for rating {{the performance of a}} particular sensor in comparison to other ones or to fundamental performance limits. The classification system and the figures of merit of radiation sensors introduced by R. C. Jones are revisited for thermal radiation sensors with the focus on thermopiles and <b>bolometers.</b> As a result it is stated that radiation thermopiles and <b>bolometers</b> should be classified differently: type III detectors for thermopiles vs. type II detectors for <b>bolometers.</b> Modified figures of merit are suggested and relations between them given. The figures of merit are applied in an overview on state-of-the-art thermopiles and <b>bolometers</b> operated at room temperature...|$|R

500|$|Thallium(I) sulfide's {{electrical}} conductivity changes with exposure to infrared light therefore making this compound useful in photoresistors. Thallium selenide {{has been used}} in a <b>bolometer</b> for infrared detection. Doping selenium semiconductors with thallium improves their performance, thus it is used in trace amounts in selenium rectifiers. Another application of thallium doping is the sodium iodide crystals in gamma radiation detection devices. In these, the sodium iodide crystals are doped {{with a small amount of}} thallium to improve their [...] efficiency as scintillation generators. Some of the electrodes in dissolved oxygen analyzers contain thallium.|$|E
500|$|Scientific Detective Monthly (also {{known as}} Amazing Detective Tales and Amazing Detective Stories) was a pulp {{magazine}} which published fifteen issues beginning in January 1930. [...] It was launched by Hugo Gernsback {{as part of}} his second venture into science fiction magazine publishing, and was intended to focus on detective and mystery stories with a scientific element. [...] Many of the stories involved contemporary science without any imaginative elements—for example, a [...] story in the first issue turned on the use of a <b>bolometer</b> to detect a black girl blushing—but there were also one or two science fiction stories in every issue.|$|E
500|$|The {{stories in}} Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories, {{but they were}} only {{occasionally}} science fiction, as {{in many cases the}} science appearing in the stories already had practical applications. In the first issue, for example, [...] "The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond", by Arthur B. Reeve, mentions unusual science, but the mystery is solved by use of a <b>bolometer</b> to detect a blush on the face of a black girl. [...] The murderer in [...] "The Campus Murder Mystery", by Ralph W. Wilkins, freezes the body to conceal the manner of death; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue. The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is [...] "The Perfect Counterfeit" [...] by Captain S.P. Meek, in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money. [...] Van Dine's Philo Vance novel, The Bishop Murder Case, began serialization in the first issue, which probably assisted sales, since the hardcover edition of the novel, which had appeared only a few months previously, had sold well. [...] It was not science fiction, however, and throughout the magazine's run, only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction. [...] Mike Ashley, a historian of the field, suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science: most of Scientific Detective Monthlys contents were gadget stories, of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time. [...] The cover for the first issue, by Jno Ruger, showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect.|$|E

To explore the use of ADR in this manner, a portable instrument {{that has been used}} successfully for ground-based astronomical observations was constructed. By employing chromic potassium sulfate as a paramagnetic cooling material, <b>bolometers</b> were cooled to temperatures of 0. 1 K with a cryogenic hold time of greater than nine hours...|$|R

The <b>bolometers</b> were made of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -. (YBCO) thin films deposited on -oriented and 10 x 10 x 1 - 0. 5 mm 3 sized single crystal MgO substrates by using DC inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering (ICMS) technique with 200 nm thickness. The thin films were characterized in detail by employing structural (XRD, SEM, EDX, and AFM), magnetic (. -T) and electrical (R-T) measurements. We have investigated effects of temperature and modulation frequency on the magnitude and phase of the infrared response of the {{both large and small}} area <b>bolometers.</b> Dependence of the phase and magnitude of the response of MgO substrate YBCO edge transition <b>bolometers</b> to a near infrared radiation on the superconducting transition width has also been investigated in this work. We have observed that the superconductivity transition width has major effects on the response of the <b>bolometers</b> such as; on a dip of the phase of the response versus modulation frequency curve around 1 Hz, the rate of decrease of the magnitude of the response, and dependence of the phase of the response on temperature at mid-range modulation frequencies. Wavelength dependence of the photoresponse of YBCO edge transition <b>bolometers</b> has been studied. It was observed that the optical response of the devices was almost independent of the wavelength of incident light from 0. 4. m to 0. 73. m. Here we present the analysis and the possible mechanisms that can affect the response of the <b>bolometers</b> in the superconducting transition region...|$|R
50|$|While <b>bolometers</b> {{can be used}} {{to measure}} {{radiation}} of any frequency, for most wavelength ranges there are other methods of detection that are more sensitive. For sub-millimeter wavelengths (from around 200 µm to 1 mm wavelength, also known as the far-infrared or terahertz), <b>bolometers</b> are among the most sensitive available detectors, and are therefore used for astronomy at these wavelengths. To achieve the best sensitivity, they must be cooled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero (typically from 50 millikelvins to 300 mK). Notable examples of <b>bolometers</b> employed in submillimeter astronomy include the Herschel Space Observatory, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).|$|R
