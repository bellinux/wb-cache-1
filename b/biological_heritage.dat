25|$|Very {{generally}} speaking ethno-racial relations {{can be arranged}} on an axis between the two extremes of European and Amerindian cultural and <b>biological</b> <b>heritage,</b> this is a remnant of the colonial Spanish caste system which categorized individuals according to their perceived level of biological mixture between the two groups. Additionally the presence of considerable portions of the population with partly African and Asian heritage further complicates the situation. Even though it still arranges persons along the line between indigenous and European, in practice the classificatory system is no longer biologically based, but rather mixes socio-cultural traits with phenotypical traits, and classification is largely fluid, allowing individuals to move between categories and define their ethnic and racial identities situationally.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how a select group of adults of African-American/Euro-American {{heritage}} came to choose or develop a sense of racial identity. The seven participants were women and men who ranged in age from twenty-one to fifty-nine, and who had chosen Black, White, or Mixed racial identities. Utilizing in-depth phenomenological interviewing, participants were asked how their life experiences had led them to choose a particular racial identity, how they experienced the world in light of their chosen identity, and the meaning which they made of their choice of identity given their actual <b>biological</b> racial <b>heritage.</b> ^ The data was presented as in-depth profiles taken from transcripts of the interviews for each participant. In addition, themes which emerged when participants were compared within and across chosen racial identity groups, gender groups, and age groups were highlighted. The factors which were seen as having the most influence on choice of racial identity were past and current cultural affiliations, early experiences and socialization, and physical appearance. Additional factors which played a lesser role in racial identity development included the nature and extent of individual political experiences or orientation, the nature of social values within a given historical period, the <b>biological</b> racial <b>heritage</b> of the individual, and a participant 2 ̆ 7 s sense of spirituality and connection to other social identities such as gender, religion, age, and ethnic identity. An individual 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of him or herself in relation to race and racism as outlined in existing racial identity development literature was described as another factor which could be utilized to understand choice of racial identity. Each of these individual factors was defined and arranged into a conceptual framework. The interconnections between some of the factors, such as culture and early socialization, were also explored. ^ The experiences of participants were compared with the processes of identity development outlined in select works on Black, White, and Bi-racial populations. The dissertation also presented a number of recommendations for individuals who worked with bi-racial people. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction All {{existing}} {{intelligent systems}} share a similar <b>biological</b> and evolutionary <b>heritage.</b> Based on {{the conviction that}} cognition is computation, artificial intelligence researchers are investigating computational models {{as a means of}} discovering properties shared by all intelligent systems. One property that has been proposed as central to intelligence is the ability to construct and manipulate symbol structures. If intelligence may be described completely in terms of symbol processing, then cognitive science need not be concerned with the particular physical implementation details of either artificial or biological examples; neuroscience would no longer be part of cognitive science. On the other hand, if important aspects of intelligence evade symbolic explanation, it may prove necessary to consider phenomena below the symbol level. The connectionist approach to artificial intelligence is founded on the conviction that the structure of the brain critically constrai...|$|R

40|$|The studied {{region is}} {{situated}} in the Aveiro district, about 50 km SW of Oporto (northern Portugal) and has a rich geological, <b>biological</b> and cultural <b>heritage.</b> The Arouca Geopark was formally established there in late 2007, {{under the auspices of}} Arouca’s Municipal Chamber, to reunite 36 geosites from which some of them involve remarkable Ordovician and Silurian rocks and fossils. Outcrops of both periods belong to the Valongo- Tamames syncline of the Central Iberian Zone. Lower Palaeozoic rocks around the Canelas Slate Quarry are of special interest, leading {{to the creation of a}} geotouristic route visiting three Ordovician units (Santa Justa quartzites, Valongo shales and Sobrido quartzite plus glaciomarine diamictites) and one Silurian (graptolitic black shales), as well as a Roman gold mine dug in the Lower Ordovician quartzites. However, the most outstanding geosite is the quarry itself, where Middle Ordovician giant trilobites (up to 70 cm in size) and trilobite clusters (up to thousands of specimens) occur in large slabs of slate and are recovered during the exploitation. The Geological Interpretation Centre of Canelas, located near the quarry and open since 2006, is one of the main tourist attractions of the Arouca Geopark, created to preserve and disseminate knowledge about trilobites and the Ordovician world, and having received more than 10, 000 visitors in its first 17 month...|$|R

The governments, including the Romanian, have started to react when devastating environmental changes have become ever more obvious. However, the discrepancy between what should be done to protect the capacity of planet to ensure living conditions and that what was achieved in practice is on the rise. In our country the phenomenon of environment degradation with all the concern displayed and the financial effort accomplished, obviously insufficient, tends to magnify, especially in the last period as a result of intensification of polluant industrial activity.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the research findings on public education for heritage conservation. The research aims {{to determine the}} level of awareness and understanding on geopark and heritage conservation {{from the perspectives of}} the various stakeholders. The data gathered from the study serves as important baseline information in preparing tools and mechanism for public education as well as educational tools and programmes to promote understanding and awareness among the various stakeholders of geopark. This research also seeks to summarise various approaches to non-formal education and awareness programmes from local community. The sample comprises various stakeholders, namely the local authorities, hoteliers and resort managers, tourist operators and tourists, local community, students and teachers. The findings of the study indicate relatively low levels of awareness and understanding among the stakeholders mainly regarding the geopark concept, heritage conservation and role of Langkawi geopark in the local community socioeconomic development activities. Thus, effective and innovative development tools and public educational mechanisms are crucial to address the findings of this study. The development of tools and mechanisms for public education must give emphasis to: 1) level of understanding of the targeted group in developing content; 2) inculcation of shared values particularly those that bring benefits to regional sustainable development and community livelihood; 3) conservation of geological, <b>biological</b> and cultural <b>heritage</b> should initially be separately taught, but eventually, these components must be taught in an integrated manner; 4) introduction of tourism-based products related to geopark; and 5) education on geopark in schools should be systematically planned and implemented. Suffice to say that the development of the approaches and strategies for effective public education must give priority to the needs, interest and abilities of the target groups i. e. the stakeholders for optimal effectiveness of public education programmes. ...|$|R
