5|$|Norway {{prohibited}} {{nuclear warheads}} {{to be stored}} on its soil, preventing <b>Banak</b> from serving in a role {{as a base for}} US nuclear-armed bombers. NATO's military interest for <b>Banak</b> peaked during the late 1960s. Increased range of Soviet aircraft during the 1970s diminished the need for troops in Finnmark; combined with Norwegian tension and nuclear policies, this caused the United States to favor Vestfjorden and Troms over <b>Banak</b> as the primary areas of defense.|$|E
5|$|Station Group <b>Banak,</b> {{formerly}} <b>Banak</b> Air Station, {{comprises the}} airfield's military activity. It is organizationally part of Bodø Main Air Station. The 330 Squadron has a detachment at <b>Banak,</b> {{which is responsible}} for operating the Westland Sea King for search and rescue missions in the Barents Sea. The air station is regularly visited by the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon for use in the shooting range at Halkavarre. The Garrison of Porsanger is located close to Lakselv.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1985 an F-16B {{with two}} {{people on board}} {{experienced}} control problems north of <b>Banak.</b> The pilot ejected and survived while an officer died.|$|E
500|$|The {{responsibility}} for <b>Banak's</b> Sea Kings originally included Svalbard. After a 1992 sinking, the government decided to instead lease a Super Puma helicopter for Svalbard, removing the archipelago from <b>Banak's</b> portfolio. <b>Banak's</b> runway was extended in 1992 and 1993, including widening to [...] and receiving new runway lighting. The {{range of the}} Sea Kings is in part determined by their radio range. Until 1998, some long-range missions with Sea Kings were flown with assistance of P-3 Orion aircraft to serve as radio relays, at one point allowing for a record [...] mission. The air station was in 1998 converted to a station group under Bodø Main Air Station.|$|R
5|$|The dwindling {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused NATO to shift to the flexible response strategy. This increased the importance of <b>Banak,</b> {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that <b>Banak</b> be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that <b>Banak</b> should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, in case of a Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E
5|$|By 1959 the United States was {{concerned}} that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new discussion about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. <b>Banak</b> was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway. The main advantage of Alta {{was that it would}} be better suited for civilian traffic. The government and Parliament approved construction of <b>Banak</b> in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at <b>Banak</b> returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main concern was {{that they could not}} reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of <b>Banak,</b> partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also to serve {{as a part of the}} nuclear program. NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for <b>Banak.</b> The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
5|$|Interest in <b>Banak</b> {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and <b>Banak.</b> Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June 2005 an ICP Savannah micro {{aircraft}} crashed only a {{few minutes}} after its departure from <b>Banak,</b> with two flight instructors on board. Both instructors were killed in the accident.|$|E
5|$|Since 1970, the 332 Squadron {{and later}} the 334 Squadron and 336 Squadron have {{operated}} regular training missions out of <b>Banak</b> with fighter aircraft. In 1969 Parliament decided to establish a search and rescue squadron. Ten Sea King helicopters were bought by the Ministry of Justice in December 1970 and the 330 Squadron was re-enacted on 25 May 1973. <b>Banak</b> {{was one of four}} original stations for the helicopters, the others being Bodø, Ørland and Sola. The first major mission was on 7 April 1974, when thirteen fishermen were rescued when the trawler Longvabakk sank in the Oksefjorden at Cape Nordkinn.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe is {{the main}} airline {{operating}} at <b>Banak,</b> with daily flights to Alta and Tromsø using Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft. During the Weekdays, Norwegian Air Shuttle operates a twice-weekly service to Oslo using their Boeing 737 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Lakselv Airport, <b>Banak</b> is {{the main}} airport serving central Finnmark, with its {{catchment}} areas including the municipalities of Porsanger, Karasjok and Lebesby. Widerøe is the primary airline operating at the airport, with daily flights to Alta and Tromsø using Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft. In 2011, the airport had 63,537 passengers. It is classified as an international airport.|$|E
5|$|The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons {{based at}} Bodø {{regularly}} use <b>Banak</b> both for monitoring and training. Fighter aircraft {{can reach the}} Norway–Russia border in about ten minutes, while helicopters can reach the border in thirty minutes. The primary use for fighters is training is Halkkavarre Shooting Range.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 the Norwegian Air Force {{took control}} over the {{airfield}} and commenced reconstruction. That year, the air force operated a service from Bardufoss Air Station via <b>Banak</b> to Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, with correspondence to Oslo at Bardufoss. The service lasted only the one season. Later the runway was used to serve air ambulances. During the late 1940s, part of the wooden runway was removed and used for other construction projects.|$|E
5|$|NATO's {{proposal}} for an investment program {{was approved by}} the Norwegian Government on 7 December 1959 and by the North Atlantic Council on 1 June 1960. Parliament passed the plans on 5 August. Construction was carried out simultaneously at <b>Banak,</b> Alta Airport and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which would combined give Finnmark three primary airports. All three airports opened on 4 May 1963.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Norwegian Air Force {{took control}} over the {{airfield}} in 1945 and started reconstruction. In 1945, the air force operated scheduled flights from Bardufoss Air Station via <b>Banak</b> to Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen; at Bardufoss a corresponding flight was offered to Oslo. The service lasted only the one season. Later the runway was used to serve air ambulances. During the late 1940s, part of the wooden runway was removed and used for other construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Three {{airports}} {{were opened}} in Finnmark in 1963, all served by SAS: Alta Airport, Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen and Lakselv Airport, <b>Banak.</b> The following year, SAS also started flights to Tromsø Airport. In 1966, Lufthansa started flights to Hamburg, and later also introduced services to Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Munich. During the 1960s, SAS introduced Caravelles {{on most of}} the domestic routes.|$|E
5|$|An {{airport at}} Lakselv was first {{proposed}} out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, {{there was a}} fear that Norway could be occupied by foreign powers {{to take advantage of}} the country's strategic position. The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, a triangular runway was built at <b>Banak.</b>|$|E
5|$|Construction {{was carried}} out {{simultaneously}} at <b>Banak,</b> Alta Airport and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports. All three airports opened on 4 May 1963, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Services were at first operated by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). At first the airline used 56-passenger Convair CV-440 Metropolitan aircraft, which flew flights south to Oslo in combination with flights to Alta and Kirkenes—from 1964 also to Tromsø. The general route scheme of flying multi-legged flights from Oslo to Finnmark would remain until 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} reorganizing {{the search}} and rescue services, and looked into moving the 330 Squadron from <b>Banak</b> to Hammerfest Airport. The rationale was the proximity to Hammerfest Hospital and a typical 40-minute shorter flight time to the coast. However, such a location would give longer travel time to the inner parts of Finnmark. The plans were hindered by opposition from the Air Force, {{as they would have}} to establish a military station at Hammerfest. The Norwegian Armed Forces announced in 2007 that they would carry out a major restructuring and decrease of activity in Finnmark, with the long-term plan to close the Garrison of Porsanger.|$|E

Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, which allowed triangular runway to be built <b>Banak</b> the following year. It was used by a detachment of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} in Elvebakken was somewhat controversial in Alta, {{especially as the}} airport would be located {{so close to the}} town center, potentially causing noise pollution. An alternative at Sokkelma was considered, but this was discarded because the surrounding mountains prevented good landing conditions. The decision to build Alta Airport was made in 1961, followed by additional expropriation of land. Construction was carried out simultaneously with that of <b>Banak</b> and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, which combined would give Finnmark three primary airports.|$|E
5|$|The 330 Squadron has a {{detachment}} {{with two}} Westland Sea King Mk 43B helicopters at <b>Banak.</b> They {{are part of}} the Norwegian Air Ambulance service, organized by the four regional health authorities. Medical personnel is provided by Finnmark Hospital Trust, while the remaining personnel are military. The detachment flew 271 missions and 854 hours in 2009. The Sea Kings' primary role is for search and rescue (SAR) mission, with a portfolio of northern Troms, Finnmark and the Barents Sea. In SAR missions, the squadron operates under the management of the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway located in Bodø. The detachment's secondary responsibility is as an air ambulance, under management of Hammerfest Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Ministry of Justice owns 12 Mk43B Sea Kings {{which are}} {{operated}} by the Royal Norwegian Air Forces's 330 Squadron. The aircraft are used for SAR and air ambulance missions and are {{under the command of}} the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Southern Norway and Northern Norway. Introduced in May 1973, they were originally stationed at Bodø Main Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Sola Air Station and Station Group <b>Banak.</b> In 1997, the squadron conducted 237 SAR and 747 air ambulance missions. From 1995 to 1998, one helicopter was stationed at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and since 1999, one has been stationed at Rygge Air Station. Florø Airport became a station for one helicopter from 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} with triangular runways in 1938. It {{was taken over}} by the Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden runways. It {{was taken over by}} the NoRAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. It opened in 1963 and was largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Scandinavian Airlines operated out of the airport to the other primary airports in Finnmark and to Tromsø and Oslo. The runway was extended in 1968. From 1990, flights were taken over by SAS Commuter and the direct flights to Oslo were halted. From the mid-1990s there have been occasional charter flights out of <b>Banak.</b> Widerøe took over SAS' services in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was first}} built with triangular runways in 1938. It {{was taken over}} by the Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden runways. <b>Banak</b> {{was taken over by}} the RNoAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. Plans for re-opening emerged in 1955, but uncertainty regarding its value in a war caused a prolonged debate about financing. The air station was largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and was opened on 4 May 1963, along with a civilian terminal. During the Cold War, Norway did not allow allies peacetime use of the airfield. The runway was extended in 1968 and the 330 Squadron was established in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The main route at Hammerfest is Widerøe's {{service to}} Tromsø, which is {{operated}} {{up to eight}} times per day using Dash 8-100/200 aircraft. Widerøe also operates flights eastwards to other communities in Finnmark on public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Two helicopter operators have bases at the airport: Bristow Norway, which operates two Eurocopter EC225 Super Pumas, and CHC Helikopter Service, which operates a Sikorsky S-92. Both companies operate flights to offshore installations. One of the Super Pumas is used for search and rescue operations for the petroleum industry and when the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Westland Sea Kings based at Station Group <b>Banak</b> are not available, for instance if they are on another mission or the aircraft are being maintained.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War, Norway {{enforced}} {{a policy}} to disallow allied aircraft to operate further north than Bardufoss and Andøya, {{in an effort to}} minimize tension with the Soviet Union. Specifically, allied aircraft were not permitted to operate east of the 24th meridian east, which was just west of <b>Banak,</b> thus hindering use of the airfield. This was motivated in part to not unnecessarily provoke the Soviet Union, with which Norway shared a land border, and in part because increased allied military presence could decrease the popular support for NATO membership. The restrictions were strengthened following the 1960 U-2 incident, in which a US spy aircraft en route to Bodø was shot down over Soviet territory. During the mid-1960s, NATO unsuccessfully attempted to convince Norwegian authorities to move the allied operational border from the 24th to the 27th meridian east.|$|E
5|$|All SAS Commuter {{services}} in Northern Norway were {{taken over by}} Widerøe in October 2002. Norwegian Air Shuttle took over the routes to Alta and Tromsø from 1 April 2003, but already {{by the start of}} operations announced they would retire their fleet of Fokker 50 aircraft, resign from short-haul routes and become a low-cost airline. Widerøe won the subsequent tender and started operating to Lakselv from 1 January 2004. SAS Braathens introduced low-frequency summer services from Oslo from 2006, which was kept for three seasons. SAS cited too low ridership from foreign tourists as the reason for the closure. Widerøe took over SAS Ground Services' operations at <b>Banak</b> in 2008. Norwegian introduced a new summer seasonal route from Oslo to Lakselv from 2011. Outgoing charter services started in 2012 to Burgas and Antalya. Scandinavian Airlines operated one charter flight from Tokyo and back in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{traveling}} from Western to Northern Norway had to transfer from Braathens SAFE to SAS in Trondheim. Both airlines {{saw this as}} a strategic opportunity to get routes in each other's territories. On 31 August 1960, Braathens SAFE applied for an extension of its Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim route onwards to Bodø Airport and Bardufoss Airport. The two airports had been served by SAS from Oslo via Trondheim. SAS presented estimates that between 2.5 and 6.1 passengers transferred at Trondheim each day. Braathens SAFE later proposed that they could fly directly from Bergen and Ålesund to Bodø and Bardufoss, but Braathens SAFE's application {{was rejected by the}} ministry. All concessions ended on 31 March 1961, and the ministry extended them all one year. Three new airports, Alta Airport, Lakselv Airport, <b>Banak</b> and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, were about to open and the ministry wanted to award new concessions that included these airports. Braathens SAFE applied to operate to all the airports in Northern Norway, but the contract was awarded to SAS. The latter also applied to operate a route from Northern Norway via Trondheim, Ålesund and Bergen to Stavanger, while Braathens SAFE in 1964 again applied for an extension of the West Coast route to Northern Norway. This was moderated to a direct route from Tromsø Airport to Bergen, which SAS received permission for on 4 March 1965.|$|E
25|$|The 330 Sqn was {{assigned}} the SAR task and was headquartered at Bodø Main Air Station, with a wing at each location. The A-flight was at Bodø, the B-flight at <b>Banak,</b> the C-flight at Ørland and the D-flight at Sola. Of ten aircraft, two were stationed at each base {{and two were}} {{at any given time}} in for overhaul. The flights were re-designated as detachments from 1980. The squadron was officially reactivated on 25 April 1973. The flights at Sola and Bodø were operative 1 May and the other two on 1 August. The first major was on 7 April 1974, when the <b>Banak</b> flight saved 13 lives off the trawler Longvabakk in Oksfjorden.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs {{appointed}} a commission which in 1986 recommended {{that a national}} state-funded helicopter ambulance service be established. Tromsø was selected as one of eight bases. Along with Brønnøysund Airport, {{it was one of}} only two such bases in Northern Norway. However, it was flanked by the 330 Squadron's Westland Sea King bases at Bodø and <b>Banak.</b>|$|E
25|$|SAS' {{traditional}} route {{model in}} Northern Norway consisted of operating DC-9s and later McDonnell Douglas MD-80s to Tromsø Airport and then continuing onwards {{to a combination}} of Alta Airport; Lakselv Airport, <b>Banak</b> and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. SAS was flying what they considered local routes with DC-9s, others were flown at high costs by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada Dash 7s.|$|E
25|$|On 11 December 2012, a Westland Sea King from No. 330 Squadron RNoAF {{experienced}} undisclosed {{technical issues}} {{and made an}} emergency landing on Mount Divgagáisá. The landing caused parts of the landing gear to break. The Sea King was prepared by removing rotor blades and fuel before it was air lifted to <b>Banak</b> Air Station by a Russian Mil Mi-26 on 23 December 2012.|$|E
25|$|Honningsvåg {{is served}} by Widerøe, which {{operates}} 39-seat Dash 8-100 aircraft to other communities in Finnmark and to Tromsø. The routes are operated as public service obligations financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport served 13,487 passengers, 2,274 aircraft movements and handled 55 tonnes of cargo in 2014. For flights to Oslo, Honningsvåg falls within the catchment area of Alta Airport and Lakselv Airport, <b>Banak.</b> The driving time from Honningsvåg to Lakselv is {{two and a half}} hours.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{started with}} two new {{commercial}} services from 2 April 2001, to better utilize their aircraft. The first was an onward connection from Vardø to Alta Airport, {{the second was}} an thrice-weekly international service from Kirkenes to Murmansk Airport. The route connected with flights at Kirkenes onwards to Tromsø, Alta and Oslo. From July Finnair started a thrice-weekly service from Helsinki via Rovaniemi to Lakselv. Arctic Air joined forces through establishing a feeder service to Lakselv Airport, <b>Banak</b> from Vardø, corresponding with the Finnair flights.|$|E
