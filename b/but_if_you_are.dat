500|$|Alex Trickett of BBC Sport gave it 85% and stated, [...] "If {{you like}} pure {{simulation}} stick with world number one Tiger Woods, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{ready for a}} wackier round of golf, let your favourite Italian plumber come to the fore." [...] Likewise, Marc Saltzman of The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it four stars out of five and stated that, [...] "One of the game's greatest assets is its intuitive control scheme. Novice and seasoned players {{will be able to}} pick up and play with little trouble. There are customizable options for manual or automatic swing modes." [...] However, the only negative review came from Alex Porter of Maxim, who gave it a score of four out of ten, saying, [...] "Golfing game standards like club selection, power meter, and control of backspins and topspins satisfy, but the sometimes-clunky controls and confusing camera perspectives will leave you teed-off." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith. Jenner said that [...] "Jugband Blues", along with two others that Syd wrote around this time, ("Scream Thy Last Scream" [...] and [...] "Vegetable Man") were [...] "amazing songs." [...] When {{compared}} to [...] "Bike" [...] and [...] "The Scarecrow", Jenner said [...] "You think, 'Well, OK, those are all right, but these are powerful disturbing art.' I wouldn't want anyone {{to have to go}} as mad and disturbed as Syd did to get that, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to go that disturbed give me something like that. That's great art." [...] Jenner had also called [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] "an extraordinary song, the ultimate self-diagnosis on a state of schizophrenia, [...] the portrait of a nervous breakdown." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, CNN {{correspondent}} Wolf Blitzer interviewed Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran’s Permanent Representative to the IAEA, who said, {{in regards}} to whether {{there should be a}} state of Israel, [...] "I think I’ve already answered to you. If Israel is a synonym and will give the indication of Zionism mentality, no. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to conclude that we have said the people there have to be removed or we [...] they have to be massacred or so, this is fabricated, unfortunate selective approach to what the mentality and policy of Islamic Republic of Iran is." ...|$|E

A plaque on her house in Wrzeszcz, a borough of Gdańsk, has recently been dedicated and the city of Gdynia named an intersection after her. Michael Szporer, Professor of Communications at University of Maryland wrote about her: [...] "Her life was very much like Poland's, never nothing, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not afraid to speak up for yourself and care for others, just look what you can become, Pani Ania, a worthier role model than most, because an honest one.

By November 2009, Little, Brown and Company had purchased the North American rights to the series. The series will have some overlap with his previous series, A Series of Unfortunate Events, but will not involve its protagonists, the Baudelaire orphans. Daniel Handler, the author behind the Snicket pen name, clarified that the series [...] "is mostly an entirely new story. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a close reader of the series you will see some overlap. There will be something for people who are hungry for that sort of thing." [...] He reiterated: [...] "It does have some overlap with the series, but it's not a continuation." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} polarizing reviews. Rock Sound {{gave the}} album an 8/10 rating, remarking that [...] "It {{may not be}} perfect, but Korn have thrown caution to the wind and set out an impressive template for a future sound, for a band doing that nearly 20 years into their career, they deserve your respect". They do note however that the album sounds [...] "a little formulaic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] at times. Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> willing to have your brain assaulted from every direction by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline". Allmusic gave the album 4/5 saying that [...] "despite all the electronics, there’s no mistaking The Path of Totality as a Korn album...and one of their better ones to boot".|$|E
2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, I think you should go to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not gone the way I had hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|In {{attempting}} to give precise figures, some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated {{the number of}} murders by this order from 1865 to 1875; {{but no one can}} go through the evidence without being convinced that a great many men were killed to satisfy the vengeful spirit of the Molly Maguires. Some of the victims were men so useful, so conspicuous, and so beloved in their communities that their assassinations caused a profound and enduring impression. In some cases, so Dewees (who has written a very useful story) asserts, robbery was added to murder: superintendents, who were carrying the money for the monthly pay of the miners and laborers, were waylaid as they drove along some lonely road in the desolate country. While the murders were numerous, still more numerous were the threats of murder and warnings to leave the country written on a sheet of paper with a rude picture of a coffin or a pistol and sometimes both. One notice read: [...] "Mr. John Taylor-We will give you one week to go, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> alive on next Saturday you will die." [...] Another, to three bosses, charged with [...] "cheating thy men" [...] had a picture of three pistols and a coffin and on the coffin was written, [...] "This is your home." [...] In other mining districts and in manufacturing localities, during strikes and times of turbulence similar warnings have been common and have been laughed at by mining bosses, superintendents, and proprietors; but, in the anthracite region between 1865 and 1876 the bravest of men could not forget how many of his fellows had been shot and suppress a feeling of uneasiness when he found such a missive on his doorstep or posted up on the door of his office at the mine. Many a superintendent and mining boss left his house in the morning with his hand on his revolver, wondering if he would ever see wife and children again.|$|E
