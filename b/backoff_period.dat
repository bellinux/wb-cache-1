40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is the {{state-of-the-art}} technology to perform distributed {{processing of data}} and form a synergy to accomplish intended functions. It has evolved from WLAN, WMAN and WMN to leverage the advantage of micro-processing, mobility and ubiquity to perform tasks such as accessibility to hard-reach area, deployment in extreme conditions, collection of data in geographically diversified fields and so on, whereas other types of wireless network have got constraints. In a distributed node structure like WSN, one of the pivotal concerns of exchanging data {{is the ability to}} streamline data access in between the nodes when all the nodes demand for share of channel and avoid bottleneck and high-latency as much as possible. If the radio channel itself is spectrum constrained e. g. single-channel radio, the nodes must operate in a fashion to minimize the collision of accessing shared channel. This issue severely affects the network throughput when packets of different classes (e. g. audio, video, general data, network status and so on) are handled. In this scenario, random channel access mechanism enables the allocation of radio channel to the nodes and streamline the packet transfer. Existing random channel access mechanism makes the sender node to wait for a random period out of predefined waiting time window which is called <b>backoff</b> <b>period,</b> before acquiring the channel and avoid collision. But, this mechanism implements uniform distribution of selecting this random waiting time out of the <b>backoff</b> <b>period.</b> This causes the overlap of the selected time and results in collision.

This method segments the whole <b>backoff</b> <b>period</b> in small time slots and augments the probability of sending data in a time slot following an exponential pattern as each of the previous time slots go silent (i. e. none of the senders contending does access the channel). This method gives fine grained control of the channel access and allows the mechanism to reflect Quality of Service (QoS) as the probability of accessing the channel can be optimized by custom parameters.

In the ith slot, the recipient with the ith smallest queue length sends the ACK. This order can be calculated from the queue length matrix stored at each station.

Basically, whenever a node receives a request (Algorithm 2), it checks whether that request marks the reception of a new flow at the node. If so, it postpones the transmission for a random timer (<b>backoff</b> <b>period).</b> If during this backoff the node receives a new request from this flow, possibly from another ascendant node, the node agglutinates both requests in a single request avoiding multiple transmissions.

40|$|Channel Access (EDCA) in IEEE 802. 11 e are {{contention-based}} {{access mechanism}} in wireless LAN. Both DCF and EDCA reduce collisions based on inter-frame space (IFS) and backoff mechanisms. However, collisions are unavoidable {{even with the}} two mechanisms. Especially, in the EDCA, collisions can be classified into interclass and intra-class collision. To eliminate interclass collision in wireless LAN, we propose an interclass collision protection (ICP) scheme by employing collision protection period (CPP) after backoff. Different number of backoff time-slots is inserted to each class. Higher class stations are allowed to transmit before lower class stations end <b>backoff</b> <b>period.</b> Analysis is performed with one dimensional discrete-time markov chain for the EDCA and proposed ICP-based EDCA. Collision probability and throughput of each channel access is examined. Throughput increase is more than doubled with reduced collision probability when the system is saturated...|$|E
30|$|The {{basic access}} method shows a maximum {{throughput}} operational point {{close to the}} 14 [*]Mbps. These values represent an improved saturation throughput of 2 [*]Mbps (17 %) {{with respect to the}} collision avoidance mode. However, for higher offered loads, the throughput of the basic access model decreases asymptotically to a stable value of approximately 8.5 [*]Mbps, which is below the saturation throughput of the collision avoidance access mode. The main reason for this performance is that the probability of collision increases with the offered traffic load. Therefore, the longer duration of collisions in the basic access mode yields lower throughput when compared to the collision avoidance mode where collisions are confined to control packets (RTS packets). On the other hand, DQMAN reaches the saturation conditions at an approximate traffic load of 17.8 [*]Mbps and it remains stable at this value for higher traffic loads. This represents an improvement of 30 % and 50 % with respect to the peak of throughput attained by the collision avoidance and basic access modes of the standard, respectively. However, under heavy traffic conditions, DQMAN outperforms any of the two access modes of the standard in at least 85 %. The reason for this improved performance of DQMAN resides in the fact that it eliminates <b>backoff</b> <b>periods</b> devoted to the transmission of data and collision of data packets are completely avoided. Note that in DQMAN contention-based access is confined to the clustering phases.|$|R
30|$|In such conditions, {{the use of}} the {{contention}} access period (CAP) is required, where channel accesses in the uplink are coordinated by a slotted carrier sense multiple access mechanism with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). Nevertheless, it has already been proved that the CSMA/CA mechanism, used within the CAP, has a significant negative impact on the overall energy consumption, as the traffic load in the network steadily increases [19 – 21]. In [19], the authors suggested that physical level improvements, such as energy-aware radio activation policies, should be combined with other MAC optimizations to allow for more energy-efficient wireless networks. Thus, the appraisal of other existing MAC protocols in terms of effective energy per information bit introduces important challenges in BSNs. This is the reason why we here introduce energy-aware radio activation policies into a high-performance MAC protocol different from CSMA/CA, while analyzing and evaluating its energy-saving performance in BSNs. In the literature, it is already possible to find some research work on reducing the power consumption of the standard de facto 802.15. 4 MAC in BSN scenarios [6, 7]. The Body Sensor Network MAC (BSN-MAC) is based on 802.15. 4 MAC supporting both star and peer-to-peer network topologies. The authors in [6, 7] concentrate also on a 1 -hop star-based topology, since in their analyzed BSN, the number of sensors is limited and an external mobile device, such as PDA or cell phone, acts as a BAN coordinator. However, the promising accomplishment of the DQBAN protocol in terms of quality of service under healthcare requirements in hospital settings [2], evokes the idea to further explore and analyze the energy-efficiency of this family of DQ-MAC protocols (i.e., [2, 15 – 18]) in general BSN scenarios. In [15 – 18], DQ-MAC favorable behavior (especially versus CSMA/CA) is achieved thanks to the inherent protocol performance at eliminating collisions in data transmissions and minimizing the overhead of contention procedures (i.e., carrier sensing and <b>backoff</b> <b>periods).</b> Based on that, we propose here a novel DQ-MAC energy-efficiency theoretical analysis for non-saturation conditions and evaluate its performance in front of 802.15. 4 MAC and BSN-MAC in BSN scenarios, bearing medical applications in mind. Please note that in order to cope with healthcare stringent requirements of quality of service, the same authors introduced new cross-layer fuzzy-logic scheduling techniques into the here proposed DQ-MAC protocol and evaluate its performance in terms of reliability and maximum latency in different hospital settings [2]. The results proved to show the suitability of the here presented DQ-MAC protocol in more specific healthcare BSN scenarios.|$|R
30|$|In this work, {{we assume}} that the {{physical}} and the medium access control (MAC) layers of every node adhere to the IEEE 802.11 b standard [16]. In this section, we first recall the basic features of this standard. Due to the broadcast nature of the communications, the contention channel is managed through the basic access (BA) mechanism, the operational principle of which can be briefly described as follows. When a node has a frame ready to be transmitted, it checks if the channel remains idle {{for a period of time}} at least longer than a distributed interframe space (DIFS): if this is the case, the node is free to immediately transmit. On the opposite, if the wireless medium is busy, the node defers its transmission until the medium remains idle for a whole DIFS without interruption. In the latter case, once the DIFS has elapsed, the node generates a random <b>backoff</b> <b>period,</b> which corresponds to an additional waiting time before transmitting (pre-backoff). The node transmits when the backoff time has elapsed. At each transmission act, the backoff time is uniformly chosen in the range [0, cw - 1], where cw is the current backoff window size, that is constant and equal to the minimum value defined by the standard, denoted as CWmin, and corresponding to 32. The <b>backoff</b> <b>period</b> is slotted and the duration of the backoff, expressed in terms of number of backoff slots, is denoted as backoff counter (BC). This number is decremented as long as the medium is sensed idle, and it is frozen when a transmission is detected on the channel (this is an instance of a collision avoidance mechanism). Decrementing restarts when the medium is sensed idle again for more than a DIFS. At the end of every packet transmission, the node is forced to enter a post-backoff phase that coincides with the subsequent pre-backoff if the node has another packet in the transmission queue.|$|E
30|$|Collisions {{not only}} waste the {{bandwidth}} {{of the network}} but also the energy consumption of the individual devices (receivers and transmitters). Collision detection is not a wise solution in WSNs, where not many devices possess the necessary ability. Packet collision may happen due to hidden and exposed terminal problems. In the AEH-MAC, nodes dynamically adjust their sleep time and transmit at different times to avoid the collision. If multiple neighbour nodes transmit simultaneously, {{there is a chance}} that a collision may occur; therefore, before sending a packet, each node executes a random backoff to avoid the collision. During the <b>backoff</b> <b>period,</b> if a sender detects transmission from another node, it stops its transmission. The sender enters into the sleep state and retries in the subsequently contention period. The AEH-MAC detects a collision through beacon by measuring the power level of the channel. If it detects a single packet header, the receiver rebroadcasts a beacon to notify the sender and requests for retransmission of the data packets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Ultra {{wide band}} (UWB) ad-hoc {{networks}} have attracted much research attention in recent years. This paper proposes and investigates a new distributed cooperative routing strategy that forwards data via a multi-hop route {{with the best}} instantaneous quality among available routes in UWB ad-hoc networks. The new method combines the physical and mediumaccess-control (MAC) layer mechanisms to identify the best route in a cooperative and distributed way. Using {{an example of a}} two-hop relay network where data from a source node can be forwarded by several possible relays to the destination node, we study two related issues. First, to support the cooperative and distributed routing, we devise a new, efficient estimation algorithm for received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is used to determine UWB link/route quality. The estimation method is {{based on the fact that}} UWB links often adopt pulse position modulation (PPM) for transmissions, and in that context the transfered data in the received signal can be simplified as onedimension binary phase shift keying (BPSK) data over a complex, i. e. two-dimension, noise channel. The algorithm is unbiased and its estimation errors are lower than existing algorithms. Second, a distributed cooperative routing scheme is proposed. Each relay node uses the carrier sensing with deterministic <b>backoff</b> <b>period</b> as the MAC protocol. The <b>backoff</b> <b>period</b> is chosen by each relay such that the higher the quality of the associated source-relay-destination route, the shorter is the backoff time. Combining this with carrier sensing, the route with the best instantaneous quality is used for data forwarding. To avoid hidden-terminal problems among relays, the scheme also requires the destination node to send a quick acknowledgment to the relays upon receiving the forwarded data. Simulation results show that even without any feedback about the relay-destination link quality from the destination node to relays and using only its statistical characteristics, the proposed scheme still has 3 dB improvement in performance as compared to a random route selection. When having 1 -bit feedback, the proposed scheme can achieve full diversity and the overall performance is only 2 dB lower than that with true relay-destination link quality. I...|$|E

A stochastic model is developed to obtain the optimal maximum CW that can be integrated in an amended CSMA/CA protocol to maximise the single-hop throughput among adjacent vehicles.

30|$|In {{spite of}} these efforts, dense {{networks}} still pose significant challenges to network configuration mechanisms. This {{is due to the}} fact that at one time there might be several nodes trying to join the network. Furthermore, several nodes may simultaneously reply to join requests issued by a newly arriving node. As previously mentioned, arising conflicts during the setup phase can be resolved by means of the widely known CSMA/CA protocol. In fact, this mechanism has been included in the specifications of IEEE 802.15. 4. However, WSNs require protocols that are fast, easy to implement, and flexible enough to be used without modifications across different scenarios. CSMA/CA, on the other hand, does not meet these requirements mainly due to the fact that its performance has a strong dependence on its configuration parameters. For instance, it can be tuned to save energy by limiting its <b>backoff</b> <b>period,</b> but this policy will also lead to a large number of collisions in dense networks. If the backoff window is allowed to grow, this policy will lead to long idle times and energy waste. Besides, channel access is not guaranteed.|$|E

The base station can serve {{two or more}} users in one frame simultaneously, which can improve MAC-layer efficiency by reducing the transmission time for preamble and frame headers, and the random <b>backoff</b> <b>period</b> for successive frame transmissions. This fact enables us to design a more QoS-aware scheduler from the MAC layer. In this paper, we first formulate the scheduling problem with frame aggregation into a knapsack problem that is shown NP hard. Then we propose a simple approximation algorithm (LUUF) based on the unit urgency concept. Our analysis shows that the complexity of LUUF is O(n log n) and it achieves an approximation ratio of F'/F-max. We then show that in practice the complexity can be further reduced to O(n) and the approximation ratio can be made very near to 1, which makes LUUF a promising candidate for wireless systems that support frame aggregation. We also conduct simulations comparing LUUF with the widely used Round-Robin scheduler and find that LUUF can significantly {{improve the quality of}} service for various numbers of users and different maximum aggregation frame sizes.

40|$|Although {{there are}} various Medium Access Control (MAC) {{protocols}} proposed for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), there is no protocol accepted as a standard specific to it. This paper deals with completing the design of our previously proposed MAC for WSN by proposing a channel access mechanism (CAM). The CAM is based on developing a backoff mechanism which mainly differentiates nodes’ backoffs depending on their different identification numbers, and it employs a performance tuning parameter for reaching a required performance objective. The probability distribution of the <b>backoff</b> <b>period</b> is constructed and Markov chain modeling is used to analyze and evaluate the CAM against the IEEE 802. 15. 4 slotted CSMA/CA based on single- and multihop communication {{with respect to the}} reliability, the average delay, the power consumption, and the throughput. The analysis reveals that the required performance of CAM against the IEEE slotted CSMA/CA can be obtained by choosing the maximum backoff stages number and the tuning parameter value and that CAM performs better than the IEEE with larger nodes number. The multihop scenario results in a good end-to-end performance of CAM with respect to the reliability and delay becomes better with lengthier paths at the expense of increasing the energy consumption...|$|E
