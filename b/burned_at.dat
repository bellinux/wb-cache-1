5|$|Adi Da {{published}} his fourth book, titled Garbage and the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John. It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures {{and activities of}} this period. It quickly sold out its first print run, and a second was sent to bookstores. However, due to the controversial nature of its contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> Adi Da's behest.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 271 people on board the aircraft, two employees at a nearby repair garage were killed and two more severely <b>burned.</b> <b>At</b> 273 victims, this was the deadliest accident in US aviation history. The crash scene is a field northwest of the intersection of Touhy Avenue (Illinois Route 72) and Mount Prospect Road {{on the border of}} the suburbs of Des Plaines and Mount Prospect, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before being <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake. His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.|$|E

5|$|Henry VI of England {{was less}} than a year old but his unclesled by Henry V's brother John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedfordcontinued the war. There were more victories, {{including}} the Battle of Verneuil, but it was impossible to maintain campaigning at this level. Joan of Arc's involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake. The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful Fabian tactics of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it {{was announced}} that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.|$|E
5|$|The Hussite Wars, {{also known}} as the Hussite Crusade, {{involved}} military action against the Bohemian Reformation in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the followers of early Czech church reformer Jan Hus, who was <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake in 1415. Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431. These expeditions forced the Hussite forces, who disagreed on many doctrinal points, to unite to drive out the invaders. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise Compacts of Basel by the Church and the Hussites.|$|E

Fleeing civilians accompanied Houston's army turning north at the Navidad River as they crossed to {{the east side of the}} Colorado River at Burnam's Crossing. The ferry and trading post, as well as the family home of Jesse Burnam, were all <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> Houston's orders on March 17 to prevent Santa Anna's army from making the same crossing.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of Joan of Arc have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that Joan of Arc was not actually <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; that she was not a true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of Joan of Arc is actually a myth. None of these claims are widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|Achieving her {{objective}} was, however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared to accept}} reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as he was to be <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E

5|$|Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by {{theological}} controversies, some {{of which}} turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity {{should have access to}} the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.|$|E
5|$|Between 05:00 and 05:30 on 20 September, {{the leading}} troop of the Gloucester Hussars, after riding more than , arrived at Nazareth with swords drawn. They {{captured}} many prisoners at the Hotel Germania and {{a mass of}} documents were found in houses nearby. Meanwhile, the bulk of Yilderim Army Group's records were being <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the Monastery of Casa Nuova. The commander of 13th Cavalry Brigade requested {{the assistance of the}} 14th Cavalry Brigade through 5th Cavalry Division's headquarters at 06:50. He reported the 13th Cavalry Brigade had captured many prisoners and material but that Liman von Sanders had left the evening before. The 14th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division) was unable to assist the attack on Nazareth. The brigade had captured 1,200 prisoners during their advance southwards to capture Afulah where they joined the leading troops of the 10th Cavalry Brigade (4th Cavalry Division).|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E

5|$|Fury, Javier and his witchbreed {{launch a}} {{successful}} attack on Count Doom's fortress. The Four of the Fantastick are freed, and Doom is horribly scarred {{by what he}} believes is the Templar's treasure; in fact, Donal's walking stick is the true treasure, and using it Donal becomes the Norse god Thor. Having nowhere else to go, the ship of fugitives heads for the New World. In Spain, Enrique, the Inquisitor who has killed so many witchbreed, is exposed as a witchbreed himself and sentenced to be <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake with his young acolytes, Petros and Sister Wanda. Enrique breaks their bonds and they escape on a ship of their own, also bound for America.|$|E
5|$|However, the crowned Charles VII's advisors {{convince}} the King {{not to send}} the promised reinforcements to Joan at the pivotal Siege of Paris. Joan of Arc retreats to the Castle at Compiègne where the English and Burgundian troops lay siege. Trapped outside {{the safety of the}} Castle, Joan is captured by the Burgundians, trailed by the English as a heretic, and <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake. The final campaign mission, the Battle of Castillon, has one of Joan's most trusted Lieutenant's muster a huge force of vengeful French troops, and utterly destroy the English and Burgundian forces around and in Castillon, ending the Hundred Years' War and expelling the English from France, spare Calais.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

5|$|The French commander—Destremau—had {{ordered the}} coal piles <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of}} the action and now smoke began {{billowing}} over the town. Zélée and Walkure were sighted and fired upon by the Germans. The French had begun to scuttle their vessels when the action had begun, but both were still afloat when Scharnhorst and Gneisenau began firing upon them and finished the two ships off. By now, most of the Papeete's inhabitants had fled and the town had caught fire from the German shelling, with two blocks of Papeete set alight. With the coal piles destroyed and the threat of mines in the harbor, von Spee saw no meaningful purpose in making a landing. Accordingly, the German admiral withdrew his ships from Papeete's harbor by 11:00. After leaving Papeete, the ships steamed out towards Nuku Hiva to meet Nürnberg, Titania, and colliers waiting there.|$|E
5|$|Around 1498, Josquin {{most likely}} re-entered {{the service of}} the Sforza family, on the {{evidence}} of a pair of letters between the Gonzaga and Sforza families. He probably did not stay in Milan long, for in 1499 Louis XII captured Milan in his invasion of northern Italy and imprisoned Josquin's former employers. Around this time Josquin most likely returned to France, although documented details of his career {{around the turn of the}} 16th century are lacking. Prior to departing Italy he most likely wrote one of his most famous secular compositions, the frottola El grillo (the Cricket), as well as In te Domine speravi ("I have placed my hope in you, Lord"), based on Psalm 30. The latter composition may have been a veiled reference to the religious reformer Girolamo Savonarola, who had been <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> the stake in Florence in 1498, and for whom Josquin seems to have had a special reverence; the text was the Dominican friar's favorite psalm, a meditation on which he left incomplete in prison prior to his execution.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{built their}} cities with Neolithic technology; they built their {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was <b>burned</b> <b>at</b> high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E
