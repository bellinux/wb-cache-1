50|$|The <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink</b> or {{broadhead}} skink (Plestiodon laticeps) is {{species of}} lizard, endemic to the southeastern United States.|$|E
50|$|The Great Plains skink, {{together}} with the <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink,</b> is the largest skink of the genus Plestiodon. It reaches a length of 9 to 13 cm from snout to vent (SVL) or up to nearly 34 cm total length (including the tail).|$|E
50|$|These skinks (along {{with the}} similar Plestiodon fasciatus) are {{sometimes}} wrongly {{thought to be}} venomous. <b>Broad-headed</b> <b>skinks</b> are nonvenomous.|$|R
50|$|<b>Broad-headed</b> <b>skinks</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in the southeastern states of the United States, from the East Coast to Kansas and eastern Texas and from Ohio to the Gulf Coast.|$|R
50|$|<b>Broad-headed</b> <b>skinks</b> are {{the most}} {{arboreal}} of the North American Plestiodon. They forage on the ground, but also easily and often climb trees for shelter, to sleep, or to search for food.|$|R
50|$|America's largest {{freshwater}} turtle, {{the alligator}} snapping turtle, shares the habitat with its cousin, the common snapping turtle. The green American chameleon also {{lives in the}} wetlands, along with the lizard-like tiger salamander, which is an amphibian. Other examples of reptiles in Louisiana are the gopher tortoise, razor-backed musk turtle, <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink,</b> coal skink and the slender glass lizard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink</b> {{gets its}} name from the wide jaws, giving the head a {{triangular}} appearance. Adult males are brown or olive brown in color and have bright orange heads during the mating season in spring. Females have five light stripes running down the back and the tail, similar to the Five-lined Skink. Juveniles are dark brown or black and also striped and have blue tails.|$|E
5000|$|The American {{alligator}} {{lives in}} every coastal state between North Carolina and Texas, while the less widespread American crocodile is only found in southern Florida. The {{alligator snapping turtle}} and more than forty other species of turtle {{are found in the}} swampland of the southern U.S. The coypu is an intrusive species which also thrives in the swamp areas. Some of the other species thriving in the southern wetlands include the Carolina anole, razor-backed musk turtle, <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink,</b> and the coal skink.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife include alligators, sea turtles, Florida gopher tortoises, West Indian manatees, white-tailed deer, river otters, marsh rabbits, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, Virginia opossums, eastern gray squirrels, eastern garter snakes, Carolina anoles, <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skinks,</b> pileated woodpeckers, {{northern}} cardinals, bald eagles, barred owls, peregrine falcons, painted buntings, and Florida scrub jays.|$|R
50|$|The park's {{combination}} of freshwater swamp and upland, {{as well as}} its location between northern and southern physiographic regions, allows for a great diversity of plant and animal life. Notable plant species include flowering dogwood and mountain laurel in the spring, bald cypress, tupelo, yellow pond lily, and loblolly pine. Animals observed include northern river otters, muskrat, prothonotary warblers, pileated woodpeckers, bald eagles, northern water snakes, and <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skinks</b> as well as over 50 species of fish, including largemouth bass and chain pickerel.|$|R
40|$|Diet {{selection}} {{among several}} prey types {{present in a}} dense aggregation, permitting a predator to become satiated without changing patches, may be important for predators that can eat many small prey items in a single bout. Choice in this scenario differs from that in optimal foraging models for sequential diet choice model and simultaneous choice models when travel time between patches is needed. Furthermore, satiation and depletion effects may be important in dense prey aggregations. We predicted that in dense prey aggregations, predators should eat the most profitable prey first, switching to smaller prey as larger ones become depleted and predators become satiated, and that prey below some minimum profitability should be rejected. When large numbers of prey of varying sizes were presented simultaneously, <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skinks</b> (Eumeces laticeps) preferentially consumed large crickets, ate some medium-sized crickets late in ingestion sequences, but ate no small crickets. Prey depletion, with selection of the currently most profitable prey type, appears to account for much of observed prey switching, and satiation may contribute. When four crickets of each of four sizes were presented, lizards ate largest first, then medium-sized. Some then ate small crickets, but none ate very small crickets. These observations and exclusion of small crickets from the diet by many lizards when larger ones were unavailable support the predictions. In tests with three sizes of juvenile mice presented singly, the smallest were attacked at shortest latency and eaten, medium-sized mice were attacked at greater latency but could not be subdued, and large mice were not attacked. These data suggest that as prey become too large to subdue and eat readily, profitability declines until they are excluded from the diet. Unsuccessful attacks on medium-sized mice suggest that lizards had to learn their own capabilities {{with respect to a}} novel prey type...|$|R
50|$|Nine snake {{species are}} found in this arid environment, the plains hog-nosed snake, western coachwhip, bullsnake, longnose snake, plains {{blackhead}} snake, blackneck garter snake, plains garter snake, lined snake, and prairie rattlesnake. The <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink,</b> prairie racerunner, red-lipped plateau lizard, northern earless lizard, eastern collared lizard, and Texas horned lizard are also indigenous to the area. Two types of turtle, the ornate box turtle and the yellow mud turtle {{have been found in}} the Black Mesa preserve. Only one frog is found in this desert habitat, the American bullfrog, but there are six other species of amphibians; the Great Plains narrowmouth toad, New Mexico spadefoot, plains spadefoot, Woodhouse's toad, red-spotted toad, and the western green toad, all toads.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{reptiles}} {{are less}} abundant and diverse than amphibians, {{a number of}} snakes are conspicuous members of the fauna. One of the largest is the non-venomous black rat snake (...) , while the common garter snake (...) is among the smallest but most abundant. The American copperhead (...) and the timber rattler (...) are venomous pit vipers. There are few lizards, but the <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink</b> (...) , at up to 13 in in length, and an excellent climber and swimmer, {{is one of the}} largest and most spectacular in appearance and action. The most common turtle is the eastern box turtle (...) , which is found in both upland and lowland forests in the central and southern Appalachians. Prominent among aquatic species is the large common snapping turtle (...) , which occurs throughout the Appalachians.|$|E
5000|$|The American {{five-lined skink}} is small to medium-sized, growing to about 12.5 to 21.5 cm total length. Young five-lined skinks are dark brown to black with five {{distinctive}} white to yellowish stripes {{running along the}} body and a bright blue tail. The blue color fades to light blue with age, and the stripes also may slowly disappear. The dark brown color fades, too, and older individuals are often uniformly brownish. The southeastern five-lined skink, P. inexpectatus, of the Southeastern United States {{is very similar to}} this species and there is some overlap in range. The two species can be distinguished by their scales. [...] The <b>broad-headed</b> <b>skink,</b> P. laticeps, is similar, and may be difficult to distinguish from P. fasciatus. The former species usually lacks the two enlarged postlabial scales characteristic of P. fasciatus. Adult male broad-headed skinks, with their large size and swollen red head, are readily distinguished from P. fasciatus.|$|E
