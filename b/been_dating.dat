5|$|The {{production}} {{also suffered}} from financial problems, and Asif exceeded the budget {{on a number}} of occasions. The final budget of the film is a subject of debate. Some sources state that Mughal-e-Azam cost 10.5 million to produce (about US$2 million at the time), while others claim that it cost 15million, about $3 million. This made Mughal-e-Azam the most expensive Indian film of the period. A number of estimates put the film's inflation-adjusted budget at 500 million to 2billion. The budget situation strained the relationship between Asif and Pallonji, while the production also faced troubled relationships among other crew members; differences crept up between Asif and Kumar when the former married the latter's sister. Another source of trouble was the romantic relationship and ultimate break-up of Kumar and Madhubala, who had <b>been</b> <b>dating</b> for nine years.|$|E

Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which have agreed to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess of flu medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben.

5|$|The season {{introduces}} Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in {{the year}} 2030 as he sits his daughter and son down {{to tell them the}} story of how he met their mother.

Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin to believe that she broke up with him.
