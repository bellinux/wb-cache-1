5|$|The Act {{prevents}} even hereditary {{peers who}} {{are the first to}} hold their titles from sitting automatically in the House of Lords. The Government did agree, however, to give life peerages (the titles of which are indicated in parentheses) to four such new hereditary peers: Toby Low, 1st <b>Baron</b> Aldington (<b>Baron</b> Low), Frederick Erroll, 1st <b>Baron</b> Erroll of Hale (<b>Baron</b> Erroll of Kilmun), Francis Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford, 1st <b>Baron</b> Pakenham (<b>Baron</b> Pakenham of Cowley) and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon (<b>Baron</b> Armstrong-Jones). Additionally, life peerages were created for former Leaders of the House of Lords: John Ganzoni, 2nd <b>Baron</b> Belstead (<b>Baron</b> Ganzoni), Peter Carington, 6th <b>Baron</b> Carrington (<b>Baron</b> Carington of Upton), Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne (<b>Baron</b> Gascoyne-Cecil), George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe (<b>Baron</b> Jellicoe of Southampton), Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd <b>Baron</b> Shepherd (<b>Baron</b> Shepherd of Spalding) and David Hennessy, 3rd <b>Baron</b> Windlesham (<b>Baron</b> Hennessy).|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} <b>Baron</b> sat {{to hear a}} case, with {{convention}} insisting on a maximum of four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one <b>Baron</b> was ill or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when <b>Baron</b> Sotherton was ill, and in 1708, when <b>Baron</b> Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief <b>Baron</b> of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth <b>Baron</b> was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth judge {{was added to the}} Court of Common Pleas and King's Bench. The First <b>Baron</b> was the Chief <b>Baron</b> of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he {{was the head of the}} court. When he was also absent the Second <b>Baron</b> took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth <b>Baron</b> was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges' seniority. Unlike in the Court of King's Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each <b>Baron</b> had an equal vote in decisions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the <b>Baron</b> appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of <b>Baron</b> Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the <b>Baron</b> as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the <b>Baron</b> for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the <b>Baron</b> a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré <b>Baron</b> became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet Union, Soyuzmultfilm {{released}} a 16-minute stop-motion animation Adventures of <b>Baron</b> Munchausen in 1967, directed by Anatoly Karanovich.

The French animator Jean Image filmed The Fabulous Adventures of the Legendary <b>Baron</b> Munchausen in 1979, and followed it with a 1984 sequel, Moon Madness. Oleg Yankovsky appeared as the <b>Baron</b> in the 1980 Russian television film That Same Munchausen, directed by Mark Zakharov from Grigori Gorin's play.

2500|$|The {{manner of}} {{summoning}} <b>barons</b> to the Council was {{influential in the}} development of the Peerage. Ecclesiastical dignitaries and the greater <b>barons</b> were summoned by a writ of summons issued directly from the King, while lesser <b>barons</b> were summoned through the local sheriffs. Such a system existed as early as 1164, when Henry II withheld a personal summons to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, after engaging with him in a conflict with over the rights of the Church, instead subjecting him to a summons through a sheriff. For the rest of the twelfth century, the dividing line between <b>barons</b> summoned by writs personally addressed to them and <b>barons</b> summoned through the sheriffs became well-defined, but the Crown sometimes arbitrarily subjected the greater <b>barons</b> to summons through sheriffs. In the Magna Carta, King John declared, [...] "we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater <b>barons,</b> severally by our letters." [...] He also agreed that the lesser <b>barons</b> would be [...] "summoned generally, through our sheriffs and bailiffs." ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Barons</b> of the Cinque Ports {{also participated}} in the ceremony. Formerly, the <b>barons</b> were {{the members of the}} House of Commons {{representing}} the Cinque Ports of Hastings, New Romney, Hythe, Dover and Sandwich. Reforms in the 19thcentury, however, integrated the Cinque Ports into a regular constituency system applied throughout the nation. At later coronations, <b>barons</b> were specially designated from among the city councillors for the specific purpose of attending coronations. Originally, the <b>barons</b> were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey. The last time the <b>barons</b> performed such a task was at the coronation of GeorgeIV in 1821. The <b>barons</b> did not return for the coronations of WilliamIV (who insisted on a simpler, cheaper ceremonial) and Victoria. At coronations since Victoria's, the <b>barons</b> have attended the ceremony, but they have not carried canopies.|$|R
50|$|Scottish <b>Barons</b> rank below Lords of Parliament, and {{although}} considered noble, their titles are incorporeal hereditaments. At one time feudal <b>barons</b> did sit in parliament.
