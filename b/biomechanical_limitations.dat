40|$|Aquatic poikilothermic animals {{must either}} cope with or {{compensate}} for the mismatch in oxygen supply and demand present at high temperatures. Oxygen limited thermal tolerance explains how aerobic scope is limited by insufficient oxygen supply and sets the performance window in animals. This work explores the effects of temperature on the different components of the oxygen delivery system, in both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions to determine if supplying more oxygen to the system mitigates the effects of temperature effects on the cardiorespiratory system and extends oxygen limited thermal tolerance to higher temperatures. The effect of temperature and oxygen condition was measured on both the whole organism and system level. Critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were established in both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions {{to determine if the}} mismatch in oxygen supply and demand could be mitigated by supplying more oxygen to the system. (CTmax) was higher in hyperoxia than normoxia indicating failure was not related to a specific temperature. Ventilatory measurements were made through the development of a novel high speed video microscopy method to measure ventilatory volumes in small aquatic crustaceans. Temperature had a significant effect on all ventilatory parameters measured including scaphognathite stroke volume, ventilatory rate, and ventilation volume. Hypometabolism and hypoventilation were observed in the hyperoxic condition compared to the normoxic condition. This may be a mechanism to save the cost of energy expended for ventilation. Cardiac parameters including heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were also measured using high speed video microscopy. Heart rate exhibited a temperature dependent tachycardia as did increase in cardiac output, but stroke volume was temperature insensitive. There was a significant effect of oxygen condition on stroke volume with a higher stroke volume in hyperoxia. Analysis of pressure data for time in cardiac cycle points to a <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitation</b> leading to cardiac failure. Cardiac measurements were expanded using integrated micropressure signals and high speed video microscopy to measure intracardiac pressure and cardiac volumes respectively to generate pressure-area loops. The change in pressure (∆ P) is reduced at high temperatures in hyperoxia compared to normoxia leading to a reduction in stroke and cardiac work in hyperoxia. This reduction in cardiac work leads to cardiac failure at higher temperatures in hyperoxia than normoxia. This data also provides further support of a <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitation</b> of diastolic filling time leading to cardiac failure at high temperatures...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Augmentation {{cystoplasty}} (AC) with autogenous ileum {{remains the}} current gold standard surgical treatment for many patients with end-stage bladder disease. However, {{the presence of}} mucus-secreting epithelium within the bladder is associated with debilitating long-term complications. Currently, decellularised biological materials derived from porcine extracellular matrix (ECM) are under investigation as potential augmentation scaffolds. Important <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> of ECMs are decreased bladder capacity and poor compliance after implantation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present ex vivo study a novel concept was investigated where a two-fold increase in ECM scaffold surface-area relative to the resected ileal segment was compared in ovine bladder models after AC. Results showed that bladder capacity increased by 40 ± 4 % and 37 ± 11 % at 10 mmHg and compliance by 40. 4 ± 4 % and 39. 7 ± 6 % (ΔP = 0 - 10 mmHg) after AC with ileum and porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) respectively (p 0. 05).

40|$|Sound {{localization}} studies {{over the}} past century have predominantly been concerned with directional accuracy for far-field sources. Few studies have examined the condition of near-field sources and distance perception. The current study concerns localization and pointing accuracy by examining source positions in the peripersonal space, specifically those associated with a typical tabletop surface. Accuracy is studied with respect to the reporting hand (dominant or secondary) for auditory sources. Results show no effect on the reporting hand with azimuthal errors increasing equally for the most extreme source positions. Distance errors show a consistent compression towards the center of the reporting area. A second evaluation is carried out comparing auditory and visual stimuli to examine any bias in reporting protocol or biomechanical difficulties. No common bias error was observed between auditory and visual stimuli indicating that reporting errors were not due to <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> in the pointing task. A final evaluation compares real auditory sources and anechoic condition virtual sources created using binaural rendering. Results showed increased azimuthal errors, with virtual source positions being consistently overestimated to more lateral positions, while no significant distance perception was observed, indicating a deficiency in the binaural rendering condition relative to the real stimuli situation. Various potential reasons for this discrepancy are discussed with several proposals for improving distance perception in peripersonal virtual environments...|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the changes associated with age in gait characteristics and dynamic weight bearing pattern of sound and prosthetic limb of persons with unilateral amputation. Participant: two groups of seven young (24 ± 3. 8 years) and seven elderly unilateral amputee (71 ± 6 years) were selected for this study. Setting: both groups walked at their self selected speed over a 20 second duration plane surface walk way in trans-tibial prosthesis with PTB socket and SACH foot. The raw data of force and EMG sensors of gait analyzer were filtered, processed and analyzed with help of ‘matlab 7. 0. A blue tooth enabled heart rate telemetry system was used for calculating gait efficiency in terms of physiological cost index (PCI). Results: {{significant differences were found}} in stride duration, (p= 0. 003), step duration sound limb (p< 0. 002), stance duration sound limb (p= 0. 002), stance duration prosthetic limb (p= 0. 006) and cadence (p= 0. 001 < 0. 05), however no difference was found in EMG pattern of vastus lateralis between the two groups. The dynamic weight distribution showed more normalized load on anterior parts of heel and minimum load at calcaneal max in elderly group. The results of vertical ground reaction force found the prosthetic side of elderly group takes more weight than young group during loading response. In comparison, PCI was observed to be greater in case of elderly group.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{posterior}} vitreous chamber {{shape in}} myopia {{to that in}} emmetropia. METHODS: Both eyes of 55 adult subjects were studied, 27 with emmetropia (mean spherical error [MSE] ≥ - 0. 55; <+ 0. 75 D; mean + 0. 09 ± 0. 36 D) and 28 with myopia (MSE - 5. 87 ± 2. 31 D). Cycloplegic refraction was measured with a Shin Nippon autorefractor and anterior chamber depth and axial length with a Zeiss IOLMaster. Posterior vitreous chamber shapes were determined from T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (3. 0 -T) using procedures previously reported by our laboratory. Three-dimensional surface model coordinates were assigned to nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior quadrants and plotted in two dimensions to illustrate the composite shape of respective quadrants posterior to the second nodal point. Spherical analogues of chamber shape were constructed to compare relative sphericity between refractive groups and quadrants. RESULTS: Differences in shape occurred in the region posterior to points of maximum globe width and were thus in general accord with an equatorial model of myopic expansion. Shape in emmetropia is categorized distinctly as that of an oblate ellipse and in myopia as an oblate ellipse of significantly less degree such that it approximates to a sphere. There was concordance between shape and retinotopic projection of respective quadrants into right, left, superior, and inferior visual fields. CONCLUSIONS: Prolate ellipse posterior chamber shapes were rarely found in myopia, and we propose that spherical shape in myopia may constitute a <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitation</b> on further axial elongation. Synchronization of quadrant shapes with retinotopic projection suggests that binocular growth is coordinated by processes that operate beyond the optic chiasm...|$|R
40|$|Five normal {{subjects}} {{were tested in}} a simulated grasping task. A cylindrical container filled with water {{was placed on the}} center of a horizontal monitor screen. Subjects used a precision grip formed by the thumb and index finger of their right hand. After a preliminary run during which the container was present, it was replaced by an image of the upper surface of the cylinder appearing on the horizontal computer screen on which the real cylinder was placed during the preliminary run. In each trial the image was marked with two contact points which defined an opposition axis in various orientations with respect to the frontal plane. The subjects’ task consisted, once shown a stimulus, of judging as quickly as possible whether the previously experienced action of grasping the container full of water and pouring the water out would be easy, difficult or impossible with the fingers placed according to the opposition axis indicated on the circle. Response times were found to be longer for the grasps judged to be more difficult due to the orientation and position of the opposition axis. In a control experiment, three subjects actually performed the grasps with different orientations and positions of the opposition axis.

40|$|We tested whether human {{postural}} responses can {{be described}} in terms of feedback control gains, and whether these gains are scaled by the central nervous system to accommodate biomechanical constraints. A feedback control model can describe postural responses {{for a wide range of}} perturbations, but biomechanical constraints—such as on the torque that can be exerted on the ground—make a single set of feedback gains inappropriate for all perturbations. To observe how postural responses change with perturbation magnitude, we applied fast, backward perturbations of magnitudes 3 – 15  cm to 13 healthy young volunteers (4 men, 9  women, aged 20 – 32  years). We used a 3 -segment, sagittal-plane biomechanical model and a linear state feedback controller to reproduce the observed postural responses. Optimization was used to identify the best-fit feedback control gains for each trial. Results showed that trajectories of joint angles and joint torques were scaled with perturbation magnitude. This scaling occurred gradually, rather than abruptly changing at magnitudes where biomechanical constraints became active. Feedback gains were found to fit reasonably well with data (R 2 = 0. 92) and to be multivariate and heterogenic in character, meaning that the torque produced at any joint is generally a function of motions not only at the same joint, but other joints as well. Hip gains increased and ankle gains decreased nearly linearly with perturbation magnitude, in accordance with <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> on ground reaction torque. These results indicate that postural adjustments {{can be described}} as a single feedback control scheme, with scalable heterogenic gains that are adjusted according to biomechanical constraints...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to motor execution problems, children with hemiplegia have motor planning deficits, which {{may stem from}} poor motor imagery ability. This study aimed to provide {{a greater understanding of}} motor imagery ability in children with hemiplegia using the hand rotation task. Three groups of children, aged 8 – 12 years, participated: right hemiplegia (R-HEMI; N = 21), left hemiplegia (L-HEMI; N = 19) and comparisons (N = 21). All groups conformed to <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> of the task, supporting the use of motor imagery, and all showed the expected response-time trade-off for angle. The general slowing of responses in the HEMI groups did not reach significance compared to their peers. The L-HEMI group were less accurate than the comparison group while the R-HEMI group were more variable in their performance. These results appeared to be linked to functional level. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite, children were classified as low or normal functioning – of the seven classified as low function, six were in the L-HEMI group. Accuracy was lower in the low function subgroup, but this failed to reach significance with an adjusted critical value. However, there was a strong correlation between function level and mean accuracy. This indicates that motor imagery performance may be more closely linked to function level than to the neural hemisphere that has been damaged in cases of congenital hemiplegia. Function level may be linked to the site or extent of neural damage or the level of cortical reorganisation experienced and more attention should be paid to neural factors in future research. ...|$|E

Eight BKA children and eight AB children paired for gender, age, weight and height participated in our study. One-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were performed on peaks of angular excursion, moment, and power at the hip, knee, and ankle to compare motor strategies between the BKA and AB groups. The main results of our experiment showed that even if BKA and AB children did the task with almost the same kinematics, the kinetic data revealed completely different mechanisms of the two groups to achieve the SIP task, and BKA children had a symmetrical interlimb strategy. SIP, a simple task compared to gait at the level of neuro-musculoskeletal demands, could thus offer a transition task to physical therapists for below-knee recently-amputated children...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic brain {{injuries}} (TBI) while playing sports {{are a major}} concern {{for the general public}} today. Recently, studies have shown that repetitive subconcussive hits can lead to neurological disorders. In order to prevent the athletes from suffering traumatic {{brain injuries}}, many organizations related to contact based sports and the military employ commercialized head impact telemetry systems. However, a majority of the commercialized systems is event based which only collects the linear acceleration that exceeds a certain threshold. To accurately record and utilize the data from the impact telemetry system, it is necessary to record all the linear and angular acceleration over time to analyze {{the relationship between the two}} data sets. Thus, the Purdue Neurotrauma Group (PNG) members have developed a biomechanical telemetry system for collecting continual data from the accelerometer and gyroscope. PNG’s system is not only capable of storing and monitoring events that exceed a certain threshold, but also capable of storing real-time data that may not meet a given threshold. ^ This study is focused on improving the hardware platform of the existing PNG’s telemetry systems.

40|$|Animals use honest {{signals to}} assess the quality of {{competitors}} during aggressive interactions. Current theory predicts that honest signals should be costly to produce and thus reveal {{some aspects of the}} phenotypic or genetic quality of the sender. In songbirds, research indicates that biomechanical constraints make the production of some acoustic features costly. Furthermore, recent studies have found that vocal features are related to genetic diversity. We linked these two lines of research by evaluating if constrained acoustic features reveal male genetic diversity during aggressive interactions in ocellated antbirds (Phaenostictus mcleannani). We recorded the aggressive vocalizations of radiotagged males at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, and found significant variation in the highest frequency produced among individuals. Moreover, we detected a negative relationship between the frequency of the highest pitched note and vocalization duration, suggesting that high pitched notes might constrain the duration of vocalizations through <b>biomechanical</b> and/or energetic <b>limitations.</b> When we experimentally exposed wild radiotagged males to simulated acoustic challenges, the birds increased the pitch of their vocalization. We also found that individuals with higher genetic diversity (as measured by zygosity across 9 microsatellite loci) produced notes of higher pitch during aggressive interactions.

40|$|Although {{field of}} view (FOV) is a {{commonly}} used evaluation parameter with digital human models, minimal research has involved modeling how eye motion (relative to the head and body) affects the FOV and posture of a digital human striving to see a particular target. Few models incorporate independent eye movement {{and the effects of}} obstacles, with the ability to predict human posture realistically. This work presents two new and critical components for simulating how vision affects human posture: 1) inclusion of eye movement and 2) visual obstacle avoidance. This work is conducted using Santos™, a real-time predictive physics-based virtual human with a high number of degrees-of-freedom. With optimization-based posture prediction, joint angles serve as design variables used to minimize various human performance measures that provide objective functions, subject to constraints that represent <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> and task characteristics. Vision-based objective functions and constraints are developed and easily implemented in order to accurately predict postures. First, two new degrees of freedom were added to the Santos™ model, representing vertical and horizontal movement of the eyes. Then, functions for eye movement relative to the head and body were developed based on experimental data. The new vision-based objective function expanded on the current vision model by incorporating these new functions. Additionally, a vision-based obstacle avoidance constraint was added in order to predict postures that incorporate the tendency to look around obstacles that may be in one’s line of site. Although vision alone does not govern one’s posture, when combined with other performance measures, more realistic predicted postures incorporating vision were obtained. Initial subjective validation suggests the predicted postures are accurate and realistic. The consequent capabilities have proven extremely useful for ergonomic studies and analyses of automotive cab scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Surgical repair for end stage bladder disease often utilises vascularised, autogenous, mucus-secreting {{gastrointestinal}} {{tissue to}} either replace the diseased organ or to augment inadequate bladder tissue. Postoperatively, the compliance of the bowel is often sufficient {{to restore the}} basic shape, structure and function of the urinary bladder, however lifelong postoperative complications are common. Comorbidities that result from interposition of intestinal tissue are classified as metabolic or neuromechanical and their incidence approaches 100 %. The debilitating comorbidities and inherent limitations associated with these urological procedures may be mitigated by the availability of alternative, readily available, animal derived extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds. ECMs are decellularised, biocompatible, biodegradable biomaterials usually derived from porcine organs. This thesis aims to investigate the potential for replacing and augmenting defective bladder tissue with a biocompatible, porcine derived ECM scaffold in place of autogenous gastrointestinal tissue. In this thesis I found that ECM scaffolds possess important <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> for bladder reconstructive purposes. Implantation of ECM into ovine bladder models resulted in significant decreases in bladder capacity and compliance. Therefore, a novel ‘surface-area’ was developed to prevent these biomechanical complications from occurring. After applying this concept to bladder models, results demonstrated that an increase in ECM scaffold surface-area relative to the resected segment of gastrointestinal tissue leads to improved capacity and compliance values after bladder augmentation. The biological properties of two different FDA approved ECM scaffolds were also investigated with particular emphasis on their urological regenerative potential. Findings demonstrated that porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) demonstrates significantly greater regenerative potential for bladder tissue compared to porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS). However, exposure of both ECM scaffolds to a simulated in vivo urine environment significantly impaired their ability to induce effective urothelial regeneration. This {{led to the development}} of an in vitro bladder bioreactor that mimicked the urinary bladder’s physiological environment. The bioreactor facilitated the growth of a stratified urothelium on the ECM’s surface and therefore protected the scaffold against the cytotoxic effects of urine prior to in vivo implantation. Findings from this thesis may have important clinical implications as metabolic, infective and malignant complications precipitated by autogenous mucus-secreting epithelium are avoided with porcine ECM scaffolds...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the role of diet in the {{extinction}} of Australia's iconic marsupial carnivore, the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) in Tasmania. Herein, we present two novel techniques to address fundamental questions regarding their maximum prey size and potential competition with sympatric predators. Three-dimensional computer models of the thylacine skull {{were used to assess}} their <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> in prey size within a comparative context. This included living relatives from the family Dasyuiridae as well as a recently recovered fossil, Nimbacinus dickoni, from the family Thylacindae. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) of tissues from thylacine and potential prey species were used to assess the thylacine’s dietary composition. Furthermore, we integrate historical and recent marsupial carnivore stable isotope data to assess long-term changes in the ecosystem in response to multiple human impacts following European settlement. Our biomechanical findings support the notion that solitary thylacines were limited to hunting prey weighing less than their body mass. This concurs with our stable isotope results, which suggest medium-sized mammals were a major element of thylacine subsistence in Tasmania. Prey species may have included the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii). These species fall within the expected size range of prey needed to sustain this large carnivore. Competition among thylacines and sympatric marsupial carnivores in Tasmania was suggested by similarities in their prey size and trophic niche. If interspecific competition had been a major limiting factor for the small thylacine population, encounters with smaller predators were possibly reduced by occupying different habitats, as indicated by differences in predator δ 13 C values. The century-long change in Tasmanian devil and spotted-tailed quoll δ 13 C values suggests a change in vegetation in the areas typically inhabited by these species, or more likely indicates the movement of these top predators away from traditional open grassland, mosaic habitats to more densely forested habitats due to habitat loss and fragmentation. These species also displayed temporal changes in their δ 15 N values, which may be attributed changing prey availability or changes in the source nitrogen {{at the base of the}} food. This thesis provides a framework to test the resilience of marsupial carnivores to anthropogenic impacts in light of their biological traits and may be used to improve the conservation of large predators...|$|E

PURPOSE: To assess whether <b>biomechanical</b> and/or device <b>limitations</b> cause this phenomenon and the feasibility of generating oxygen uptake (. VO 2) prediction equations from the combined use of accelerometry and heart rate during walking and running. METHODS: Sixteen endurance-trained subjects completed two exercise tests on a treadmill. The first was a continuous incremental test to volitional exhaustion to determine ventilatory threshold and peak. VO 2. The second was a discontinuous incremental exercise test while walking (3, 5, and 7 km. h(- 1)) and running (8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 km. h(- 1), or until volitional exhaustion). Subjects completed 3 min of exercise at each speed, followed by 3 - 5 min of recovery. Activity counts from uni- and triaxial accelerometers, heart rate, and gas exchange were measured throughout exercise. RESULTS: All accelerometer outputs rose linearly with speed during walking. During running, uniaxial accelerometer outputs plateaued, whereas triaxial output rose linearly with speed {{up to and including}} 20 km. h(- 1). Prediction of. VO 2 during walking and running using heart rate (R 2 = 0. 42 and 0. 59, respectively), accelerometer counts (R 2 = 0. 48 - 0. 83 and 0. 76, respectively), the combined methodologies (R 2 = 0. 54 - 0. 85 and 0. 80, respectively), and the combined methodologies calibrated with individual data (R 2 = 0. 99 - 1. 00 and 0. 99, respectively) was completed by linear regression. CONCLUSIONS: Uni- and triaxial accelerometer outputs have a linear relationship with speed during walking. During running, uniaxial accelerometer outputs plateau because of the biomechanics of running, whereas triaxial accelerometer output has a linear relationship. The combined methodologies predict.

40|$|Zeni, Jr., Joseph A. Total joint arthroplasties {{are common}} and {{effective}} orthopeadic surgery. Patients often experience significant reduction {{of pain and}} improvement of perception of function after the surgery. However, patients continue to exhibit <b>biomechanical</b> abnormalities, functional <b>limitations,</b> decreased performance, and reduced activity level compared to older adults without joint pathology. The overall purpose of this dissertation was to identify optimal rehabilitation strategies to improve outcomes of patients following total joint arthroplasty surgery. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was performed to understand optimal rehabilitation treatments for patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Four categories of postoperative treatment strategies were discussed: 1) strengthening exercises; 2) aquatic therapy; 3) balance training; and 4) clinical environment. A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial was performed to understand {{the effectiveness of a}} progressive strengthening rehabilitation protocol to restore normal physical function after TKA. Data from a control group of older adults without knee pathology were used to build normality intervals for several outcome measures. The proportion of patients after TKA that met a normality cut-off was then compared between a group of patients who underwent progressive strengthening and standard of care rehabilitation. A longitudinal study was conducted to understand the recovery of patients in the first 12 months after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Recovery was evaluated using a comprehensive set of outcomes, including self-reported measures of function, impairment based, performance based, and biomechanical measures. Predictors of performance at 12 months were also evaluated to understand impairments associated with optimal recovery. The feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a behavioral and exercise intervention for patients 3 to 9 months following THA was then evaluated. The intervention included meetings with a health coach to discuss healthy lifestyle habit, barriers to exercise, and strategies to stay engaged in physical activity. Additionally, patients took part in 18 supervised exercise sessions over the course of six weeks that included two aerobic and one strengthening component. Feasibility was evaluated in terms of session attendance and occurrence of adverse effects (i. e., joint pain, swelling, and tenderness) occurrence. Preliminary effectiveness was evaluated using a comprehensive set of outcomes, including self-reported measures of function and physical activities, impairment based, performance based, and biomechanical measures. The information obtained in this dissertation further support the importance of progressive strengthening and functional training following TKA. These exercises should be progressed as subjects meet clinical milestones to maintain appropriate intensity. A greater proportion of patients enrolled in a progressive strengthening rehabilitation protocol reached a level of physical function similar to healthy older adults. Therefore, this type of protocol may be more effective compared to standard rehabilitation protocols. The recovery of patients after THA is not optimal in terms of functional and biomechanical outcomes. Important weakness of hip abductor strength persisted 12 month after surgery. While biomechanical abnormality in the sagittal plane appear to resolve after surgery, excessive trunk lean and pelvis drop angle persist up to 12 months following the surgery. An aerobic and strengthening intervention is feasible and well tolerated in patients at least 3 months following THA. The intervention is effective in improving physical activity and may promote return to higher level of recreational and sport activities. Although hip abductor strength increased {{at the end of the}} intervention, weakness in the surgical side persisted compared to the non-surgical side. Biomechanical changes were more variable between subjects. Trend toward greater hip flexion angle and internal flexion moment were seen, and may suggest better dynamic hip joint function. Ph. D.

Ten young male caucasian subjects (mean V 0 ₂ max. 60, 0 ml. kg⁻¹. min⁻¹ ± 7, 9) were randomly exposed to treadmill runs at each of four relative intensities, namely 55 %, 65 %, 75 % and 85 % of V 0 ₂ maximum, with the instruction to run to the point of subjective discomfort at which they were no longer willing to continue. Physiological measures of oxygen consumption (V 0 ₂), heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (R), minute ventilation volume (Vi), breathing frequency (Vf), tidal volume (Vt) and psychological measures of Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE), Perceived Thermal Comfo·rt (PTC), Perceived Pain and Perceived Fatigue were recorded throughout the protocol. The relative intensity was held constant by slight decreases in treadmill speed as subjects fatigued, and through feedback from an on-line oxygen consumption computer-aided data acquisition system. Significant increases in both physiological and psychological measures occurred with increases in relative intensity (p< 0, 05). HR and Vf increased overtime (p< 0, 05) whilst Rand Vt decreased over time (p < 0, 05). All psychological ratings increased in intensity over time (p < 0, 05). Mean endurance times to exhaustion were 243 minutes ± 70 at 55 % relative intensity, 159 minutes ± 37 at 65 %, 96 minutes ± 25 at 75 % and 23 minutes +- 8 at 85 %, being within the range reported by earlier researchers. A regression equation for prediction of endurance time given a known relative intensity was developed for this sample: % V 0 ₂ max. = 117, 8 + (- 10, 6 x LN (time)) (where r = - 0, 91) Convergence rankings indicate the greater contribution of local factors in the overall gestalt of perce ived exertion, pain and fatigue, with <b>biomechanical</b> <b>limitations</b> to prolonged work (running) strongly implicated. High intercorrelations between psychological rating scales suggest the use of the scale considered most applicable to the task at hand and the psychological response measure required. A coefficient of multiple correlation of 0, 94 established the close interrelationship amongst the physiological and psychological parameters measured. Pre- and post-test Fatigue Cluster Analysis questionnaires indicated that the most important clusters contributing toward the sensation of fatigue and subsequent decision to cease activity were Task Aversion and General Fatigue (r = 0, 96), followed by Leg Fatigue and Thirst. Motivation, the task at hand and an attainable goal appear to be important considerations in prolonged work performance. Relative intenSity appears a valid tool for use in prolonged work studies due to its high predictive capacity for endurance performance times (r=- 0, 91). It is concluded that workloads cons iderably below 55 % of maximal aerobic capacity are indicated as acceptable workloads for an 8 hour working day.
