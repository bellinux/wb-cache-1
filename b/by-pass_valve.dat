40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in which a DAF engine was equipped with a two-stage turbocharging system. Objectives were to investigate an engine concept with very high BMEP (25 - 30 bars), maintaining acceptable emissions and fuel consumption, while concentrating on the control system and transient performance. Two-stage turbocharging has several advantages compared with single stage turbocharging. Two-stage turbocharging enables high specific power levels across a broad speed range. In addition transient behaviour of a two-stage turbocharged engine is improved because of the combination of a small (and fast) High Pressure turbocharger and a larger Low Pressure turbocharger. Especially at high intake manifold pressures (pressure ratio > 3. 5) the overall efficiency of two-stage turbocharging is better than with single state turbocharging. The two-stage system on the engine that was tested consists of two parallel Low Pressure turbochargers, a High Pressure turbocharger with controlled <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> and a cooler behind the High Pressure compressor. With this configuration BSFC was optimised, while maintaining EURO III emission levels. Also transient tests were carried out, whereby the transient behaviour was compared with that of the current DAF engine. In the development of the control algorithms for the <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> simulatons were used with a complete engine model built in Matrixx. These simulations were also used to estimate transient performance of the engine concept, prior to the test program. In addition the engine model was used to analyse the measured data, and to understand several transient effects that play a role. The results show that two-stage turbocharging is an effective way to increase specific power output while maintaining acceptable fuel consumption and transient performance...|$|E

Furthermore, the effects of a <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> installed between intercooler and intake manifold, was investigated in order to optimize the emission levels. Effects of oxydation catalysts, especially on unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acetic acid were investigated.

40|$|In {{regulated}} two-stage sequential turbocharging systems, a smaller, {{high pressure}} (HP), and a larger, low pressure (LP), turbocharger are sequentially positioned {{to recover the}} energy available in the exhaust gases and deliver acceptable level of boost to the intake of an internal combustion engine. Due to the different sizes of the turbochargers, <b>by-pass</b> <b>valves</b> are placed in the system to control operations. Due to the turbocharging system layout, {{it is clear that}} the air pressurized by the LP compressor enters nonuniformly the HP compressor. This is caused by the rotating radial compressor and the interconnecting bends which cause swirl and velocity to scatter, respectively. Furthermore, the heat transfer in the two turbochargers may have an effect on the apparent efficiencies. For these reasons, the standard mapping approach for turbochargers is not able to take into account the effect of non-uniform flow and heat transfer. In this paper, a novel approach for mapping the two-stage turbocharging system is proposed and performed into a monodimensional simulation code. Although, flow non-uniformity and turbochargers heat transfer effects on the performance of the turbocharging system are not considered, at this present time, the study centralizes on the investigation and the validation of the mapping approach. In fact, a two-stage sequential turbocharging system has been considered for the study and a simulation code to investigate the mapping technique has been implemented...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of two stage serial turbochargers {{in combination with}} internal combustion engines can improve the overall efficiency of powertrain systems. In conjunction {{with the increase of}} engine volumetric efficiency, two stage boosting technologies are capable of increasing torque and pedal response of small displacement engines. In two stage serial turbocharges, a high pressure (HP) and a low pressure (LP) turbocharger are connected by a series of ducts. The former can increase charge pressure for low air mass flow typical of low engine speed. The latter has a bigger size and can cooperate with higher mass flows. In serial configuration, turbochargers are packaged {{in a way that the}} exhaust gases access the LP turbine after exiting the HP turbine. On the induction side, fresh air is compressed sequentially by LP and HP compressors. <b>By-pass</b> <b>valves</b> and waste-gated turbines are often included in two stage boosting systems in order to regulate turbochargers operations. One-dimensional modelling approaches are considered for investigating the integration of boosting systems with internal combustion engines. In this scenario, turbocharger behaviour are input in the powertrain models through previously measured compressor and turbine maps in turbocharger gas stands. However, this procedure does not capture all the effects that occur on engine application such as heat transfer, friction and flow motion that influence the turbochargers operations. This is of particular importance for two stage serial turbochargers where the LP compressor may induce a swirling motion to the flow at the entry of the HP compressor. In addition, flow non-uniformities caused by bends between the two compressors can make the HP compressor perform differently. In this paper, a review of the available literature containing approaches to quantify the effects of heat transfer on turbocharger efficiency and the flow influence in the prediction of two stage serial turbochargers performance is explored...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advances in surgical technology {{in the last two decades}} of the twentieth century is represented by the introduction of the laparoscopic technique. Using the laparoscopic approach the patient is operated through keyhole incisions as opposed to long, traumatic incisions over the thoracic or abdominal cavity. Many open procedures, such as those for gallbladder disorders, groin hernia repair and anti-reflux surgery of the stomach have been replaced by minimally-invasive procedures, whose advantages include shorter postoperative hospitalization, less pain, and a faster return to normal activity. Although improvements continue to be made in laparoscopic surgery, surgeons are generally still faced with particular drawbacks of this technique. Robotic surgery and computer-enhanced surgery may revolutionize these techniques by restoring most of the advantages of open surgery but in the context of minimally-invasive procedures. For example, cardiac surgery has entered a new era since robotic surgery appeared a part of certain <b>by-pass</b> and <b>valve</b> surgery.

40|$|The {{operating}} temperature of a loop heat pipe (LHP) {{is governed by}} the saturation temperature of its compensation chamber (CC); the latter is in turn determined by the balance among the heat leak from the evaporator to the CC, the amount of subcooling carried by the liquid returning to the CC, {{and the amount of}} heat exchanged between the CC and ambient.

Troubleshooting: Whole entire factors were investigated from process condition change, piping layout, separating drum size and valve design. Very viscous and sticky heavy hydrocarbon called `Green Oil? was found at the valves & cylinder could cause valve late closing and consequential excessive impact stress during valve closing. Increased colder spill-back by-pass flow could cool down gas after separator drum made easy formation of heavy hydrocarbon condensate. Moreover liquid condensate could exist as slug at low point of suction manifold piping directly connected to compressor suction. Valve dynamics and pulsation after revamp was acceptable but plate type valve seemed to be not good choice under service including sticky liquid showing bouncing at edge of plate during late closing.

40|$|The {{nature of}} digital {{hydraulic}} systems may cause severe fluid-borne noise problems {{because of the}} pulsed nature of the flow. An effective method to reduce the noise that does not impair the system performance and efficiency is needed. This article reports on initial investigations of an active valve for pressure pulsation attenuation in switched inertance hydraulic systems (SIHS) based on in-series and by-pass structures. The in-series structure represents a valve arranged in line between the SIHS and the load providing a controlled pulsating pressure drop, whilst for the <b>by-pass</b> structure the <b>valve</b> was arranged in parallel with the load providing a controlled pulsating bleed-off flow.

We included the patients underwent aortic valve surgery (replacement or another procedure) with or without CABG from January 2007 to January 2013. The population of 330 patients is divided into two groups: Group I included 81 patients combined surgery; Group II included 249 patients with isolated aortic valve surgery. In the early results we referred hospital mortality and perioperative complications. The follow-up time is from 2 to 73 months for 303 cases that were discharged from hospital. The long-term results were evaluated in terms of mean survival,quality of life and prosthetic-related complications. Results: The hospital mortality was 3. 6 % in general. The hospital mortality: group I is 4. 9 % and group II is 3. 2 %. The difference is not statistically significant. Low cardiac output, conduction disturbances, stroke, pulmonary complications, renal complications, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, wound infections, ventricular arrhythmias are respectively 14. 8 % vs. 9. 6 %, 3. 7 % vs. 6. 9 %, 3. 7 % vs. 0. 4 %, 9. 9 % vs. 2. 8 %, 3. 7 % vs. 1. 2 %, 6. 3 % vs. 2. 0 %, 14. 8 % vs. 19. 7 %, 11. 3 % vs. 1. 6 %, 6. 2 % vs. 5. 6 % respectively for the group I and II.

40|$|As {{the space}} {{business}} is shifting from pure performances to affordability {{a renewed interest}} is growing about hybrid rocket propulsion. Hybrid rocket motors are attractive for their inherent advantages like simplicity, reliability, safety and reduced costs. Moreover hybrid motors are easy to throttle and thus they are ideal candidate when soft-landing or energy management capabilities are required. This thesis is mainly involved with a theoretical/numerical study of hybrid transient behavior. The study of transient behavior {{is a very important}} aspect in the development of affordable, efficient, stable hybrid motors, particularly when throttling and controllability is concerned. Moreover transient behavior is important also for motors that work at a fixed operating point, not only in the prediction of ignition and shutdown phases but particularly in the analysis of instabilities. The prediction and reduction of instabilities are one of the main challenge in hybrid propulsion (as in general in all rocket motors). The aim of this doctoral thesis is to investigate and simulate hybrid rocket transient behavior through the development of a numerical code. The numerical code is composed by several independent parts coupled together, each one referring to a different subsystem of the hybrid rocket motor. Due to budget and time constraints it has not been possible to perform a dedicated experimental activity for this thesis. However the numerical results have been compared with experimental data obtained from literature, from CISAS partners (like NAMMO), and from other CISAS experimental activities performed both before and during this doctoral period. Each subsystem of the hybrid propulsion unit and its related codes are described in a different chapter. In the first chapter hybrid boundary layer steady combustion is introduced together with a discussion about the effect of steady hybrid regression physics on the shift of motor operating parameters with time. In the second chapter typical necessary or intentional transient events occurring during the operation of a hybrid rocket (ignition, throttling and shutdown) are classified and described. With chapter 3 begins the description of the several sub-models defining hybrid rocket transient behavior. In this chapter the attention is focused on the numerical modeling of the solid grain thermal behavior. The main object of this work is to determine the response of the solid fuel to variations of the heat flux on the surface. A 1 D numerical model of transient grain thermal response has been developed with this goal. The model is based on the work performed by Karabeyoglu and solves the temperature profile in the direction normal to the surface. In the first paragraph a model suited for classical polymeric fuels is developed. In the second paragraph the grain model is coupled with the boundary layer response in order to investigate typical hybrid low frequency instabilities. In the third paragraph a version of the original grain model suited for liquefying propellants is developed. In fact recently a new class of fast burning fuels has been discovered at Stanford University. These fuels form a liquid layer on the melting surface during combustion, hence the term 'liquefying fuels'. Entrainment of droplets from the liquid-gas interface creates the desired high regression rate by increasing the rate of fuel mass transfer. Several researchers included people at CISAS have experimental confirmed that paraffin-based fuels burn at surface regression rates 3 to 4 times that of conventional hybrid fuels. Others following studies showed with the use of visualization experiments the presences of waves on the liquid surfaces and droplets entrained by the gas flow, confirming original theoretical predictions. The third paragraph is divided in three parts. In the first part the model developed to predict the regression rate and the thermal profile inside a paraffin fuel is presented. The second part deals with the phenomenology of supercritical entrainment. Finally the third part discusses the problem of the closure of the equations {{to take into account the}} space-time variability of the entrainment phenomenon. In chapter 4 the attention is focused on the gas dynamic inside the hybrid combustion chamber. For this purpose two time-varying numerical models are developed. The aim of these unsteady codes is to determine the transient behavior of the main parameters of the hybrid rocket motor. The combustion chamber model represents the core of the hybrid rocket motor simulation. In fact the combustion chamber model gives directly the main parameter of a propulsion system, that is, motor thrust. The sub-models presented in the previous and the next chapters define the input parameters for the combustion chamber model. In fact the grain model of chapter 3 determine the fuel mass flow while the tank and feed lines model of chapter 5 gives the oxidizer mass flow. In the first part of this chapter a global 0 D time-varying numerical model of the combustion chamber is developed. The code is then coupled with the grain model described in the previous chapter to account for the transient fuel production. It follows a brief discussion about the main hybrid rocket motor characteristic times and their relative values. In the second part a 1 D time-varying numerical model of the combustion chamber is developed. The unsteady 1 D code is able to simulate all the features of the 0 D code. It should add the acoustic response of the system and the spatial variation of the fluid-dynamic unknowns along the flow direction, increasing the accuracy of the results at the expense of an higher computational effort. Chapter 5 end the description of the several sub-models of the hybrid rocket propulsion system. Together with chapter 3 and 4 it composes the code describing hybrid rocket transient behavior. In this chapter the attention is focused on the numerical modeling of the oxidizer path. This includes the sub-systems ahead of the combustion chamber like the pressurization system, the main tank and the feed lines. Moreover it considers also the injector elements and some aspects of droplets vaporization and atomization in the combustion chamber. This work is complementary to the one described in chapter 3, defining the input parameters for the core of the code, that is the chamber gas-dynamic model shown in chapter 4. The main object of this work is to determine how the feed system affects the performance parameters of the hybrid motor with time. For this purpose the prediction of several unknowns like the oxidizer mass flow, tank pressure and the amount of residual gases is obtained through the modeling of the principal subsystem behavior. Moreover the full transient coupling between the feed system and the combustion chamber is also investigated. This chapter is divided in three parts. The topic of the first paragraph regards the main tank and the pressurization system. After a brief description of the main alternatives the discussion goes on with the numerical modeling of the typical solutions adopted for hybrid rockets (i. e. pressure-regulated, blowdown and self-press). First of all a numerical model of a pressure fed tank is developed. The code is able to predict several parameters like masses, densities, temperatures and pressures of the gas in the ullage volume and in the pressurant tank, the pressurant mass flow and the filling level of the tank. The model takes into account several aspects like heat losses, liquid oxidizer evaporation, eventual gas phase combustion of the pressurant gas, the use of <b>by-pass</b> and digital <b>valves.</b> Later a numerical model of a self pressurized tank is developed. The code is able to determine the oxidizer mass, temperature, pressure, density and the vapor/liquid volume/mass fractions during the discharge. The numerical results are compared with experimental hot tests performed at CISAS. The second paragraph takes into account the full transient coupling between the feed system and the combustion chamber. The main challenge is to determine the instantaneous liquid mass flow and the relation between the liquid oxidizer and the gaseous oxidizer that takes part in the hybrid motor combustion processes (i. e. droplets vaporization). In this way it is possible to simulate feed system coupled instabilities. The third paragraph deals with the prediction of the mass flow through the injector elements. In particular the behavior of self-pressurized systems is investigated. In this case the chamber pressure is below the vapor pressure of the liquid inside the tank. Consequently cavitation and flashing occur inside the injector elements. This kind of two-phase flow with vaporization involves several important modeling issues. Different models are compared with cold-flow tests performed at CISAS in order to check the accuracy of their predictions. In chapter 6 some advanced techniques developed to increase the regression rate and combustion efficiency of hybrid rockets are investigated with a particular focus on their influence on the transient behavior of the motor, particularly regarding combustion instabilities. The two methods studied in this thesis are the use of a diaphragm in the midst of the grain and the use of a swirling oxidizer injection. The reason for this choice is related to the fact that both solutions have been tested (among others) at CISAS and look very promising with respect to the overcoming of historical hybrid weaknesses. Even if working in very different ways both methods induce a strong increase of the turbulence level and mixing of the reactants in the combustion chamber, promoting a more complete combustion and an higher heat flux on the grain surface. Beside improving significantly hybrid performances this two techniques can affect the stability behavior of an hybrid motor directly (i. e. modifying the flowfield in the chamber) and indirectly (e. g. reducing the chamber length due to increased regression rate). In the final chapter a summary of the activities carried out and the results achieved is given...|$|R
40|$|The {{continually}} growing demands {{over the}} quality of the environment, followed by the progressive legislation aimed at controlling pollutants, have created a need for a further development of the engine design and the exhaust gas after treatment systems as well. In order to achieve extensive reduction of the pollutants and appropriate engine performance, an optimization of an ethanol fueled version of the Volvo TD 73 diesel engine was performed based on a computerized analysis of measured engine parameters. A back pressure regulator (ATR) is mounted on the turbocharger outlet; therefore the engine was forced to work against a back pressure, particularly at light loads where the emission levels are expected to be undesirable. Hence, by reducing air intake, an increase of cylinder gas temperature was certainly expected and a continuous decline in emissions with increase of back pressure was obtained. Furthermore, the effect of a <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> installed between intercooler and intake manifold, on emission levels were investigated and optimized. Oxidation catalysts effects on regulated emissions, especially unburned fuel, carbon monoxide and unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were investigated. In correlation with the back pressure regulator, a promoting faster catalyst Warm-up was achieved, and their conversion efficiencies were improved. In order to gain more extensive information to base specification of the engine emissions and catalyst selection, different test cycles such as European R 49 - 13 mode, steady state adoption of the Braunschweig cycle, 24 specific steps cycle, as well as conditioning, activating and transient cycles were used. As a result it has been found that the performance of ethanol engine version was mentained and the significant emissions, well below the goal, were achieve...|$|E
