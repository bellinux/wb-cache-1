In this episode, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) is sentenced to death after inadvertently <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on an alien planet. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) must deal with the powerful and mysterious protector of the planet while deliberating whether to violate the Prime Directive to save Wesley's life.|$|E
5|$|His derision {{of working}} class British Labour {{politicians}} also caused problems. When, in January 1966, three visiting Labour MPs were manhandled, kicked and punched {{while attempting to}} address 400 supporters of the Rhodesian Front, Van der Byl blamed the three for refusing an offer from his Ministry to co-ordinate the visit, and pointed {{out that they were}} <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> which required government permission for any political meeting of more than 12 people.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the Far East and took up teaching responsibilities at the Korean Pedagogical Institute in Vladivostok until all ethnic Koreans were forcibly moved to Central Asia, and the Institute along with Cho were relocated to Kzyl-Orda, Kazakh SSR in 1937. The following year Cho went to Moscow and tried to enroll at the Moscow Literature University, only to find himself arrested on the spot for <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> confining Koreans to Central Asia. He then {{returned to}} the Institute in Kzyl-Orda and worked there until 1941. In the late 1930s, Cho married Kim Hae-sŏn. The two had a son, Yurii Cho, born in 1939.|$|E

5|$|In late May 2007, 20th Century Fox {{struck a}} deal with the Franklin Mint to promote the movie by {{altering}} 40,000 U.S. quarters and releasing them into circulation. All of the altered quarters were minted in 2005 and honor the state of California as part of the 50 State Quarters program created by the U.S. Mint. The altered quarters feature the Silver Surfer on the reverse along with a URL to the movie's official website. Once the U.S. Mint became aware of the promotion, it notified the studio and the Franklin Mint that it was <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by turning government-issued currency into private advertising. The federal mint did not indicate whether a penalty would be effected.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in this reign in 1530, that Henry VIII conferred on the College {{one of its most}} {{important}} duties for almost a century, the heraldic visitation. The provincial Kings of Arms were commissioned under a royal warrant to enter all houses and churches and given authority to deface and destroy all arms unlawfully used by any knight, esquire, or gentleman. Around the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries this duty became even more necessary as the monasteries were previously repositories of local genealogical records. From then on, all genealogical records and the duty of recording them was subsumed by the College. These visitations were serious affairs, and many individuals were charged and heavily fined for <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of arms. Hundreds of these visitations were carried out well into the 17th century; the last was in 1686.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1975 crisis, the Governor-General's {{power to}} dismiss a Prime Minister against the incumbent's will under Section 64 of the Constitution {{had never been}} exercised. Twice since Federation, {{conflicts}} between state premiers and state governors, who perform analogous functions to the Prime Minister and Governor-General respectively, at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier William Holman was expelled from the Australian Labor Party for supporting conscription. He managed {{to hold on to}} power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the lower house of the state legislature by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course was unfair to Labor, Holman had him replaced. In 1932 the New South Wales Labor Premier, Jack Lang, refused to pay moneys owing to the Federal government, which froze the state's bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, Sir Philip Game, wrote to Lang, warning him that ministers were <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> and that if they continued, he would have to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and Game dismissed his government and commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Bertram Stevens, to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.|$|E

25|$|Retailers in Canada may refuse bank notes without <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> According {{to legal}} guidelines, {{the method of}} payment has to be {{mutually}} agreed upon by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them {{at risk of being}} counterfeit victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.|$|E
25|$|The church recognizes and officially welcomes {{gays and}} lesbians as members under {{condition}} that they attempt to live the church's moral code. The church teaches that homosexual feelings, as distinct from behavior, may sometimes seem to be inborn, and that although these feelings are sometimes unwanted, they {{can and should be}} controlled. The church's law of chastity forbids homosexual sex in all contexts. Consistently <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of chastity may result in excommunication. Nevertheless, Latter-day Saints who identify themselves as gay or lesbian may remain in good standing in the church, without ramification, if they abstain from homosexual relations.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutionality}} of anti-miscegenation laws was {{upheld by the}} U.S. Supreme Court in the 1883 case Pace v. Alabama (106 U.S. 583). The Supreme Court ruled that the Alabama anti-miscegenation statute did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. According to the court, both races were treated equally, because whites and blacks were punished in equal measure for <b>breaking</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> against interracial marriage and interracial sex. This judgment was overturned in 1967 in the Loving v. Virginia case, where the Supreme Court declared anti-miscegenation laws {{a violation of the}} Fourteenth Amendment and therefore unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|The BCTF {{began an}} illegal strike on October 7, 2005.

The BCTF, however, maintained that under the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the non-binding decisions of the United Nations International Labour Organization, education is not an essential service and it had the right to political protest.|$|E
