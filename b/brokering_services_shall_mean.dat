40|$|Executive summary Digital Government {{strategies}} are being rolled out in many Australian and international jurisdictions, ushering in a fundamentally {{different approach to}} the design and delivery of public sector services. Digital Government makes digital services (usually delivered through internet and mobile channels) the default delivery channels {{for the majority of}} services, and places them at the centre of innovating, designing and operating government services. Public sector or independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> are increasingly important to delivering and designing these <b>services.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>brokers</b> are organisations or businesses that enable customers to interact with other organisations through easy-to-use and seamless interfaces. In the digital realm, a public sector <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> example is one that provides a customer-focussed portal, such as the Federal Department of Human Services’ MyGov website. Independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> from the private or community sectors can also provide greater service choice and innovation in how people interact with governments. Models for independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> include Digital Mailboxes and Personal Safeboxes (eg Australia Post); public transport information <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> (eg TripView, Tripgo and Google Transit), taxation <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> (eg Xero and MYOB Online), community <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> (eg HubCare) and access <b>brokers</b> for government <b>services</b> (eg public libraries, online access centres, etc) to assist those unable to access digital services. It is likely that the ambitious goals for large-scale adoption of digital government will only be achieved if governments encourage the involvement of independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> to complement the role of public sector <b>service</b> <b>brokers.</b> However, there is currently little guidance on best practice models for agencies seeking to collaborate with independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> or the other way around. This report addresses this critical knowledge gap by providing a practical guide to the <b>service</b> <b>broker</b> model. It explains the different roles of public sector and independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> and provides case studies of <b>service</b> <b>broker</b> models. This will help to inform digital government strategies and policies to encourage the development of public sector and independent <b>service</b> <b>brokers.</b> It also considers how the emergence of a marketplace of <b>service</b> <b>brokers</b> will raise important issues such as how customer data is managed and protected, identity assured and how research and analysis of the data generated by these digital services can help inform better public policies and service improvement...|$|R

40|$|We address {{supporting}} unanticipated {{users and}} uses of limited information resources (sensors, databases, weapons - any resource intrinsically tied to digital information) {{in a timely}} and efficient fashion. Platform-centric systems often preclude users and uses not identified when the system was developed and deployed. Net-centric approaches, however, can address these problems by allowing services and information to be discovered and accessed at run-time. We have developed a resource <b>brokering</b> <b>service</b> that uses net-centric principles and semantic metadata to enable multi-domain information and resource sharing and support for unanticipated users and uses. The resource <b>brokering</b> <b>service</b> uses federated <b>brokering</b> agents and a modular software component framework for dynamically composing and tasking heterogeneous resources including sensors, data feeds, processors, archived data, networks, and even analysts into resilient, mission-oriented workflows. The resource <b>brokering</b> <b>service</b> is applicable to multiple sense-decide-act military domains including missile defense, space situation awareness, ISR, border protection, and cyber defense.

40|$|The growing {{popularity}} of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems cannot be overlooked due to their wide range of application areas. However, some RFID applications face security and privacy threats due to the exposure of tags over wider distances. There are security methods but these can lack security and scalability when authenticating RF tags in MORIS (Multi Organizational RFID System). RFID systems operating within a single domain have only security and privacy issues due to the security method on tags, but in a multi-organizational system there are even more security and privacy issues in the system architecture rather than just in the security method on tag side. In this paper, we have designed a <b>broker</b> <b>service</b> to EPC (Electronic Product Code) system architecture for secure and confidential data management of the RFID data events. Secure and confidential authentication <b>broker</b> <b>service</b> is an extension to the EPC network architecture for a MORIS.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{insurance}} {{industry has been}} going through turbulent {{times in the last}} couple of years. The mature industry, vanilla products, small margins, legislation and fierce competition have taken its toll. Mergers, take-overs, joint ventures and partnerships are all strategic alliances to stay competitive in a market where only the strongest will survive. However, organisations also constantly need to take a critical look at the way they conduct their core business in a quest to gain competitive advantage. Sustainable competitive advantage may be achieved through innovation, value chain improvement, lower costs than rivals, or, as research would have it, through the establishing of a learning organisation. One of the distribution channels within Sanlam namely Sanlam <b>Broker</b> <b>Services</b> has been selected as part of this research to achieve the objective of this script. A group of its external partners or clients, ABSA Private Bank wealth planners were also part of this study to gain an understanding of a learning organisation from an external perspective. 'This study will focus briefly on the 2007 strategy for Sanlam <b>Broker</b> <b>Services</b> North and its concentration on "business building". A literature review was conducted to provide an appropriate theoretical framework on which to base the practical considerations forming the basis of the study. This study revealed the success factors and elements critical in the creation of a learning organisation. This was followed by an empirical study of the state of competitive advantage and a learning organisation within Sanlam <b>Broker</b> <b>Services</b> North. The Sanlam Broker consultants in Sanlam <b>Broker</b> <b>Services</b> North as well as their clients, the ABSA wealth planners in the ABSA Private Bank Northern region were interviewed. 'The objective was to achieve both an external and an internal perspective on all the issues. This was followed by an analysis of the findings of the empirical research compared to the findings of the literature research. Logical conclusions were drawn from the research and literature in an effort to reach the objectives and ancillary objectives of the script. The findings were summarised and a possible action plan for the implementation of a learning organisation was presented to the executive management of Sanlam <b>Broker</b> <b>Services</b> North.
