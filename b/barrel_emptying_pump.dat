50|$|Patented by August Schuler, the Reform pistol {{featured}} a vertical row of barrels that advanced upwards with each shot exposing the fired chamber. As the lower barrel fired, a gas hole between the <b>barrels</b> pressurized the <b>empty</b> <b>barrel</b> enough to eject the case rearward. An extended spur on the hammer prevented the spent case from hitting the firer in the face. The final case required manual extraction.|$|R

40|$|In the oil {{production}} process, some oil pumps {{exist in the}} light load running and <b>empty</b> <b>pumping</b> problems, which result in the waste of electric energy. In order to realize the oil pumping energy saving optimal control by adopting oil pumping start-stop intermittent control scheme, an intelligent energy saving optimal control system based on genetic algorithm and wavelet neural network is proposed in this paper. The Morlet wavelet is adopted as the activation function of neural network and builds the wavelet neural networkandthe structure and parameters of the wavelet neural network which are chromosome encoded, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the connection weights and the scale parameters {{in order to improve}} the generalization ability and the approximation ability of neural networks. The parameters of effective oil pumping energy saving optimal control are measured using multisensors. The system is used in the {{oil production}} plant; the test data show that the oil pumping energy conservation effect is obvious...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the cargo}} transported by Mighty Servant 3 are oil {{platforms}} and drilling industry related gear. When loading its mammoth burdens, it takes on thousands of gallons of water into ballast tanks, which causes the cargo deck to submerge.

5000|$|Glenfiddich, a Speyside {{distillery}} in Scotland has a 15-year-old whisky {{that uses}} a vatting process similar to the solera. The whisky is labelled as their [...] "15 year old single malt Scotch Whisky". For Scotch whisky, the stated age must refer to the youngest of whisky's components. <b>Barrels</b> are <b>emptied</b> into the solera vat and mixed. Then whisky is drawn from the vat to be bottled, with the vat never being more than half emptied. Since the process began in 1998, the vat has never been emptied.|$|R

50|$|Gose was delivered, still {{actively}} fermenting, in barrels to the Schänken. Casks {{were stored}} in the cellar with the tap bung closed but the shive hole left open, so that the still-active yeast could escape. When fermentation had slowed {{to a point where}} no yeast were emerging, the gose was ready to bottle. The <b>barrel</b> was <b>emptied</b> into a tank, whence it was filled into traditional long-necked bottles. These were not closed with a cap or cork, but with a plug of yeast (flor) which naturally rose up the neck as the secondary fermentation continued.|$|R
2500|$|Numbers of Lee–Enfield rifles were {{converted}} to [...]22 calibre training rifles, in order to teach cadets and new recruits the various aspects of shooting, firearms safety, and marksmanship at a markedly reduced cost per round. Initially, rifles {{were converted}} from obsolete Magazine Lee–Metford and Magazine Lee–Enfield rifles but from the First World War onwards SMLE rifles were used instead. These were known as [...]22 Pattern 1914 Short Rifles during The First World War and Rifle, No. 2 Mk. IV from 1921 onwards. They were generally single-shot affairs, originally using Morris tubes chambered for cheap [...]22L cartridge and some larger types, circa 1907. Some were later modified with special adaptors to enable magazine loading. In 1914, Enfield produced complete [...]22 barrels and bolts specifically for converting [...]303 units, and these soon became the most common conversion. A five-round [...]22 cal 'Parker-Hiscock' magazine was also developed and in service for {{a relatively short period}} during the later period of the First World War, but was subsequently withdrawn from issue due to reliability problems with its quite complicated loading and feeding mechanism. No. 2 Mk.
