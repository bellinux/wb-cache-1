40|$|New S-N-t {{surface model}} is {{proposed}} for depicting corrosion fatigue behaviour and novel formulae are derived {{to estimate the}} parameters of proposed model by best fitting from a minimal experimental dataset of corrosion fatigue tests. From the Palmgren–Miner rule, a cumulative damage model for the alternation between corrosion and fatigue is developed to evaluate calendar life of metallic structural component. Corrosion tests are conducted on unnotched and notched specimens from LD 10 CS aluminium alloy and 15 CrMnMoVA alloy steel in artificial corrosion environments. Fatigue tests are also performed on corroded specimens subjected to constant amplitude loading and the interaction mechanisms between corrosion and fatigue are deduced from fractographic studies. The applicability of the new models has been shown for experimental datasets for depicting corrosion fatigue behaviour and for evaluating calendar life of motor <b>brace</b> <b>rod</b> in helicopter. <br/...|$|E

25|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage of two main frames – one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (alclad) – to take the loads from the wing spars and six more alclad frames; and alclad skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and alclad ribs, with diagonal <b>rods</b> <b>bracing</b> the wings internally. Alclad sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the upper fuselage.|$|R
30|$|Even if a union {{seems to}} be obtained, a refracture within {{the first couple of}} years is not uncommon, as was {{observed}} in five out of ten patients (50  %) who had a healed tibia after the initial treatment. The refracture-free interval was, on average, 6.1  years. One adult patient even sustained a refracture after 18 years, suggesting that, even after remodelling and reaching skeletal maturity, bone of normal quality cannot be guaranteed. This might be an argument for protective <b>bracing</b> or prophylactic <b>rodding</b> of the tibia. Novel insights in cellular pathways showed that a mutation in the NF- 1 gene results in a loss of neurofibromin activity, which disturbs the osteoblast activity [17]. This may suggest that NF patients are more prone to late refracture. This is consistent with some reports in the literature [18, 19, 20], although some studies suggest that NF has no influence on the final outcome [21, 22, 23]. In the present study, four out of five patients who sustained a refracture were NF negative.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{scoliosis}} {{was discovered}} by Hippocrates, physicians and orthopedic surgeons have sought {{to find a cure}} for the condition. In the mid-twentieth century, modern medicine and treatment made it possible to decrease the progression of scoliosis within patients and alleviate the pain they experienced. This {{was the result of the}} progression of scoliosis screenings and treatment. New ways were developed to treat scoliosis because the condition was increasingly understood among medical professionals and orthopedic surgeons. These treatments such as <b>bracing</b> and <b>rod</b> insertion into the spine were made possible at the turn of the twentieth century. During this time, many schools subjected their students to physical examinations and posture tests. It was believed that students suffered from negative effects such as poor posture due to hunching over desks for hours in the classroom. Although these screenings were not intended to detect spinal curvature, physicians diagnosed many students with scoliosis. Scoliosis was considered a disease-based condition during the mid-twentieth century caused by tuberculosis or poliomyelitis. These diseases responsible for causing spinal deformities were successfully managed throughout the 1960s due to the distribution of vaccines and antibiotics. Despite the successful management of diseases causing spinal deformity, many patients suffered from scoliosis with no known cause. The unknown cause was eventually determined to be idiopathic scoliosis. Alfred Shands Jr., an orthopedic surgeon, discovered that two percent of patients had non-disease related scoliosis. Idiopathic scoliosis, also known as the [...] "cancer of orthopedic surgery", was determined to be dangerous because there was no current treatment. The condition needed to be detected in patients promptly so treatment could be developed in time to halt its progression. As a result, schools made it mandatory for students to have screenings for scoliosis. Early on, set symptoms could be recognized among the students being tested from ages five to eighteen, but subsequent studies never confirmed them for this age-range. To begin the screenings, children would have their shoulder height, leg length and spinal curvature measurements taken while partially clothed. This was followed with the forward-bend test and bodily comparisons to wall charts that were printed reproductions of the ideal human posture. Unfortunately, these screenings were not always accurate and many students were misdiagnosed because poor posture could often be mistaken for scoliosis. One of the first treatments designed was the Milwaukee brace, a rigid contraption of metal rods attached to a plastic or leather girdle, designed to straighten the spine. As a result of the constant pressure the brace inflicted on a patients' spine, it was particularly painful and inconvenient to wear due to physical limits it imposed. Wearing the brace was known to cause jaw pain, skin irritation, muscle pain and low self-esteem among patients. The 'Harrington rod' technique was the second major treatment for scoliosis to emerge and became the first significant surgical procedure to manipulate spinal positioning. This treatment was initially developed to treat paralytic scoliosis that resulted from the polio epidemic of the 1950s. The Milwaukee brace was the only nonoperative and noninvasive alternative to surgery at the time to provide postoperative correction to polio patients. A curve exceeding sixty degrees required the Harrington rod technique, otherwise the Milwaukee brace was recommended. However, Canadian physician, Elizabeth Wyne, observed that fifty percent of patients wearing the Milwaukee brace still required surgery later in life. Surgery may straighten the spine however it does not necessarily eradicate a patient of all the pain they suffer from due to scoliosis. Individuals who undergo surgery are left with scars and often have a lack of feeling in their backs to the invasive nature of this treatment. Despite the advancements of scoliosis treatments, yet to be determined is a cure that is reliable, risk-free and that results in few or no consequences for patients.|$|R

40|$|The {{public and}} {{construction}} industry professionals {{are becoming increasingly}} aware of the environmental damage buildings can cause. As a result the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly building materials and techniques is increasing. Straw bale construction is one such technique. ModCell panels are an innovative way of using straw bales in a prefabricated wall system. As ModCell panels are prefabricated the normal risks associated with straw bale construction (fire, straw getting wet during construction, unfamiliar material) are removed from the building site. The panels consist of a timber frame, <b>braced</b> with steel <b>rods,</b> in-filled with straw bales and the surfaces are then rendered with a lime render. To date ModCell panels {{have been used for}} cladding on framed buildings. However, they are now being developed for low rise domestic load-bearing applications and in order to achieve this sufficient racking shear resistance is required. Previous testing has shown that the corner joints in the panel’s timber frame are a weak point. This first aim of this thesis is to improve the racking shear resistance of ModCell panels through a series of experimental laboratory based tests {{so that they can be}} used for load-bearing applications. This thesis also aims to develop a computer model of load-bearing ModCell panels in order to further understand their structural behaviour and assist with future design and development. Different designs of frame corner joints were tested in order to find the most suitable type of joint. Screw connected joints proved to be the strongest and were twice as stiff as the other joint designs tested. Full scale panel racking shear tests were undertaken to assess the overall performance of the panels when using the screw connected joints and establish if they are suitable for load-bearing construction. Both solid panels and panels with window openings were tested. Two types of bracing were used in the test panels, either corner bracing or cross bracing. The corner braced panels were over twice as stiff as panels tested during a previous research project. The corner braced panels were also stiffer than the cross braced panels at the serviceability deflection limit of the panels height/ 500, and was sufficiently stiff to resist the required in plane loading under serviceability conditions. The computer model was developed alongside the structural testing. The model was developed using the Robot Millennium software package and modelled all elements of the panels apart from the straw. It was verified against the laboratory test results and found to be accurate within the serviceability deflection limit of height/ 500. Once material failure occurred in the actual panels the model’s accuracy was reduced as it does not include material failure criteria. The model was then used to undertake a parametric analysis. From this analysis it was found that all the elements modelled have an effect on the stiffness of ModCell panels. Changing the render thickness was found to make the greatest difference on the overall stiffness of the panels. Gusset plate and glued and screwed joint designs were also modelled to find their effect on panel stiffness. From all of the results of this analysis an improved panel was designed and when modelled was 20 % stiffer than the original panel...|$|R
