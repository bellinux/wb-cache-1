5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of <b>bimetallism,</b> were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E
5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore <b>bimetallism.</b> The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international <b>bimetallism</b> influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Many state {{conventions}} elected delegates {{pledged to}} support <b>bimetallism</b> {{in the party}} platform. Gold Democrats were successful in a few states in the Northeast, but had little luck elsewhere. Speakers in some states cursed Cleveland; the South Carolina convention denounced him. Cleveland issued a statement urging Democratic voters to support gold—the next convention to be held, in Illinois, unanimously supported silver; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland's 1892 nomination. Gold and silver factions in some states, such as Bryan's Nebraska, sent rival delegations to the convention.|$|E
5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring <b>bimetallism,</b> had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that <b>bimetallism</b> (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified the debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Support for <b>bimetallism</b> {{grew in the}} 1870s, and {{resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.|$|E
5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for <b>bimetallism.</b> The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
25|$|In 1800 the Banque de France, {{a federal}} {{establishment}} {{with a private}} board of executives, was created and commissioned to produce the national currency. In 1803, the Franc germinal (named after the month Germinal in the revolutionary calendar) was established, creating a gold franc containing 290.034mg of fine gold. From this point, gold and silver-based units circulated interchangeably {{on the basis of}} a 1:15.5 ratio between the values of the two metals (<b>bimetallism)</b> until 1864, when all silver coins except the 5-franc piece were debased from 90% to 83.5% silver without the weights changing.|$|E
25|$|After Republican Rutherford B. Hayes won the 1876 presidential election, he {{appointed}} Schurz as his Secretary of the Interior. Schurz {{sought to make}} civil service hires based on merit rather than political connections and helped prevent {{the transfer of the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs to the War Department. Schurz moved to New York City after Hayes left office in 1881 and briefly served as the editor of the New York Evening Post and The Nation, and later became the editorial writer for Harper's Weekly. He remained active and politics and led the Mugwump movement, which opposed James G. Blaine in the 1884 presidential election. Schurz opposed William Jennings Bryan's <b>bimetallism</b> in the 1896 presidential election but supported Bryan's anti-imperalist campaign in the 1900 presidential election. Schurz died in New York City in 1906.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} both {{silver and gold}} were {{considered}} legal tender, and accepted by governments for taxes. However, the instability in the ratio between the two grew {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with the increase both in supply of these metals, particularly silver, and of trade. This is called <b>bimetallism</b> and the attempt to create a bimetallic standard where both gold and silver backed currency remained in circulation occupied the efforts of inflationists. Governments at this point could use currency as an instrument of policy, printing paper currency such as the United States Greenback, to pay for military expenditures. They could also set the terms at which they would redeem notes for specie, by limiting the amount of purchase, or the minimum amount that could be redeemed.|$|E
500|$|Before the Republican convention, McKinley {{had been}} a [...] "straddle bug" [...] on the {{currency}} question, favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing <b>bimetallism</b> by international agreement. In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for <b>bimetallism</b> by international agreement. Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, {{to walk out of}} the convention. However, compared with the Democrats, Republican divisions on the issue were small, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates.|$|E
500|$|Tillman sought {{election}} {{to a second}} two-year term in 1892, presenting himself as a reforming alternative to the Conservatives. In the campaign, Tillman was {{a strong supporter of}} free silver or <b>bimetallism,</b> making silver legal tender at the historic ratio to gold of 16:1. Such a policy would inflate the currency, and Tillman felt that {{would make it easier for}} the farmer to repay debts. The rhetoric of free silver suited Tillman as well, as he could make himself appear the champion of the farmer against the powerful interests that had committed the [...] "Crime of '73" [...] (as silver supporters termed the act ending <b>bimetallism</b> in the United States).|$|E
500|$|As an economist, Walker debunked the wage-fund {{doctrine}} {{and engaged in}} a prominent scholarly debate with Henry George on land, rent, and taxes. Walker argued in support of <b>bimetallism</b> and although he was an opponent of the nascent socialist movement, he argued that obligations existed between the employer and the employed. [...] He published his International <b>Bimetallism</b> {{at the height of}} the 1896 presidential election campaign in which economic issues were prominent. Walker was a prolific writer, authoring ten books on political economy and military history. In recognition of his contributions to economic theory, beginning in 1947, the American Economic Association recognized the lifetime achievement of an individual economist with a [...] "Francis A. Walker Medal".|$|E
500|$|The Coinage Act of 1873 {{eliminated}} the standard silver dollar. It also repealed the statutory provisions allowing silver bullion {{to be presented}} to the Mint and returned in the form of circulating money. In passing the Coinage Act, Congress eliminated <b>bimetallism.</b> [...] During the economic chaos of the Panic of 1873, the price of silver dropped significantly, but the Mint would accept none for striking into legal tender. Silver producers complained, and many Americans came to believe that only through <b>bimetallism</b> could the nation achieve and maintain prosperity. They called for the return to pre-1873 laws, which would require the Mint to take all the silver offered it and return it, struck into silver dollars. This would inflate the money supply, and, adherents argued, increase the nation's prosperity. Critics contended that the inflation which would follow the introduction of such a policy would harm workers, whose wages would not rise as fast as prices would, and the operation of Gresham's law would drive gold from circulation, effectively placing the United States on a silver standard.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{continued}} {{to work for a}} strong dollar, signing into law the Coinage Act of 1873, which effectively ended the legal basis for <b>bimetallism</b> (the use of both silver and gold as money), establishing the gold standard in practice. The Coinage Act discontinued the standard silver dollar and established the gold dollar as the sole monetary standard; the result was deflation. Silverites who wanted more money in circulation to raise prices farmers received denounced the move as the [...] "Crime of 1873", claiming the deflation made debts more burdensome for farmers.|$|E
500|$|The Coinage Act of 1873 or Mint Act of 1873, 17 Stat. 424, was {{a general}} {{revision}} of the laws relating to the Mint of the United States. [...] In abolishing the right of holders of silver bullion to have their metal struck into fully legal tender dollar coins, it ended <b>bimetallism</b> in the United States, placing the nation firmly on the gold standard. [...] Because of this, the act became contentious in later years, and was denounced by people who wanted inflation as the [...] "Crime of '73".|$|E
500|$|The Cross of Gold {{speech was}} {{delivered}} by William Jennings Bryan, a former United States Representative from Nebraska, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on July 9, 1896. In the address, Bryan supported <b>bimetallism</b> or [...] "free silver", which he believed {{would bring the}} nation prosperity. He decried the gold standard, concluding the speech, [...] "you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold". Bryan's address helped catapult him to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination; it {{is considered one of}} the greatest political speeches in American history.|$|E
500|$|The public {{sympathized with}} McKinley for his {{financial}} trouble, {{and he was}} easily re-elected as governor in late 1893. At that time, the United States, for all practical purposes, was on the gold standard. Many Democrats, and some Republicans, felt that the gold standard limited economic growth, and supported <b>bimetallism,</b> making silver legal tender, {{as it had been}} until the passage of the Coinage Act of 1873. Doing so would likely be inflationary, permitting holders of silver to deposit bullion at the mints, and receive payment for about twice the silver's 1896 market value. Many farmers, faced with the long decline in agricultural prices that persisted through {{the first half of the}} 1890s, felt that <b>bimetallism</b> would expand the money supply and make it easier to pay their debts. Cleveland was a firm supporter of the gold standard, and believed the massive amounts of silver-backed currency issued pursuant to the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 had helped crash the economy. In 1893 he forced through the act's repeal, outraging western Democrats such as Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan. The Democratic Congress in 1894 passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff, significantly lowering many rates from the McKinley Tariff of 1890. The economy did not improve in 1894, and other Cleveland actions, such as federal intervention to halt the Pullman strike, further split his party, ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Hanna's {{efforts on}} his behalf, Ohio Senator John Sherman failed {{to gain the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1884 and 1888. [...] With Sherman becoming {{too old to be}} considered a contender, Hanna worked to elect McKinley. [...] In 1895, Hanna left his business career to devote himself full-time to McKinley's campaign for president. [...] Hanna paid all expenses to get McKinley the nomination the following year, although he was in any event the frontrunner. The Democrats nominated former Nebraska Congressman William Jennings Bryan, who ran on a <b>bimetallism,</b> or [...] "Free Silver", platform. [...] Hanna's fundraising broke records, and once initial public enthusiasm for Bryan and his program subsided, McKinley was comfortably elected.|$|E
500|$|Hanna quickly {{realized}} that the currency issue struck an emotional chord in many Americans, and decided on a campaign to persuade the voter that [...] "sound money", the gold standard unless modified by international agreement, was much preferable to <b>bimetallism.</b> Such propaganda would not be cheap, as {{before the age of}} television and radio, the most effective way of reaching the electorate was through the written word, and through public speakers who would address meetings on behalf of the candidate. This would take money, and Hanna undertook to secure it from his corporate connections. As Hanna began his fundraising efforts in late July, the Populists met in St. Louis. Faced with splitting the silver vote, they chose to endorse Bryan, beginning their dissolution as a party.|$|E
500|$|Karl Rove saw {{several reasons}} for McKinley's triumph. [...] McKinley campaigned on big issues, the tariff and sound money. The {{candidate}} went after Bryan's strongest issue, silver, arguing that <b>bimetallism</b> would harm Americans and hit the working class hardest. McKinley's theme {{was that it was}} morally wrong to debase the currency; he linked his stand for sound money with the tariff and with patriotism, appealing to crucial voter blocs who gave McKinley the biggest victory in a presidential election since Grant in 1872. He reached out to immigrants and urban factory workers, recognizing their importance in a changing America. And to implement these strategies, McKinley, with Hanna's aid, created a larger, more organized campaign structure than had previously been seen in presidential campaigns.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in March 1876, former {{newspaper}} editor George Weston published letters asserting that <b>bimetallism</b> was {{mandated by the}} Constitution, and questioning how the Coinage Act had passed. [...] Sympathetic newspapers began {{to suggest that the}} legislation had been enacted through corruption for the benefit of wealthy capitalists. On August 5, 1876, Missouri Congressman Richard P. Bland (soon to be known as [...] "Silver Dick") told the House of Representatives, [...] "The act of February 12, 1873 was a fraud, because its title gave no clue to the real intent of the act. [...] The record shows that the act was stealthily passed, without reconsideration and without debate." [...] In 1878, Congressman Kelley, who had introduced the bill into the House, stated, [...] "I was ignorant of the fact it would demonetize the silver dollar".|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of the currency had been a major political issue since the mid-1870s. [...] Advocates of free silver (or <b>bimetallism)</b> wanted the government to accept all silver bullion presented to it and to return it, struck into coin, at the historic value ratio between gold and silver of 16 to 1. [...] This would restore a practice abolished in 1873. [...] A free silver policy would inflate the currency, as the silver in a dollar coin was worth just over half the face value/ Someone who presented ten dollars in silver bullion would receive back almost twice that in silver coin. [...] Advocates believed these proposals would lead to prosperity, while opponents warned that varying from the gold standard (which the United States had, effectively, used since 1873) would cause problems in international trade.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the leaders}} of the silver {{movement}} was Illinois Governor Altgeld; a native of Germany, he was constitutionally barred from the presidency by his foreign birth. Going into the convention, the two leading candidates for the nomination were former Congressman Bland, who had originated the Bland-Allison Act, and former Iowa Governor Horace Boies, with Bland considered the frontrunner. These were the only two candidates to put together organizations to try to secure delegate votes, though both efforts were cash-starved. [...] Both men had electoral problems: Bland at age 61 was seen by some as a man whose time had passed; Boies was a former Republican who had once decried <b>bimetallism.</b> There were a large number of potential candidates seen as having less support; these included Vice President Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, Senator Teller, and Bryan.|$|E
500|$|When, {{several years}} after its passage, the 1873 law became a {{political}} issue, some {{of those involved in}} enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end <b>bimetallism</b> in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that [...] "in 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard... hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a double [...] standard.|$|E
500|$|Bryan often {{spoke on}} the issue of the currency. [...] The {{economic}} Panic of 1893 had left the nation in a deep recession, which still persisted in early 1896. [...] Bryan and many other Democrats believed the economic malaise could be remedied through a return to <b>bimetallism,</b> or free silver—a policy they believed would inflate the currency and make it easier for debtors to repay loans. [...] Bryan went to the Democratic convention in Chicago as an undeclared candidate, whom the press had given only a small chance of becoming the Democratic nominee. [...] His 'Cross of Gold' speech, given to conclude the debate on the party platform, immediately transformed him into a favorite for the nomination, and he won it the next day. The Democrats nominated Arthur Sewall, a wealthy Maine banker and shipbuilder, for vice president. [...] The left-wing Populist Party (which had hoped to nominate the only silver-supporting candidate) endorsed Bryan for president, but found Sewall unacceptable, substituting Thomas E. Watson of Georgia.|$|E
500|$|By 1869, the Mint Act of 1837 {{was deemed}} outdated, and Treasury Secretary George Boutwell had Deputy Comptroller of the Currency John Jay Knox {{undertake}} {{a draft of}} a revised law, which was introduced into Congress by Ohio Senator John Sherman. Due to {{the high price of}} silver, little of that metal was presented at the Mint, but Knox and others foresaw that development of the Comstock Lode and other rich silver-mining areas would lower the price, causing large quantities of silver dollars to be struck and the gold standard to be endangered. During the almost three years the bill was pending before Congress, it was rarely mentioned that it would end <b>bimetallism,</b> though this was not concealed. [...] Congressmen instead debated other provisions. [...] The legislation, in addition to ending the production of the silver dollar, abolished three low-denomination coins. The bill became the Act of February 12, 1873, with the signature of President Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E
500|$|The Mint Act of 1792 {{established}} the Mint of the United States. [...] The Mint, {{in its first}} decades, only coined gold and silver in response to deposits of that metal by citizens, returning the bullion to the depositor {{in the form of}} coins. [...] Either gold or silver could be presented for conversion into currency, as both metals were a legal tender, a dollar was equal to both a legally defined weight of silver, and another legally defined quantity of gold. [...] Having a currency be defined in terms of two different metals is called <b>bimetallism.</b> Such a system may experience instability as the price of gold and silver on the world market changes, and this took place in the first decades after 1792, as the relative values of gold and silver in Europe changed. At that time, gold or silver U.S. coins were rarely seen in the nation, as they were heavily exported because of such shifts—most pieces in circulation were foreign in origin.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{published}} International <b>Bimetallism</b> in 1896 roundly critiquing the demonetization {{of silver}} out of political {{pressure and the}} impact of this change on prices and profits as well as worker employment and wages. Walker's reputation and position on the issue isolated him among public figures and made him a target in the press. The book was published {{in the midst of the}} 1896 presidential election pitting populist [...] "silver" [...] candidate William Jennings Bryan against the capitalist [...] "gold" [...] candidate William McKinley and the competing interpretations of the nation's leading economist's stance on the issue became a political football during the campaign. The presidential candidate and economist were not close allies as Walker advocated a double standard by all leading financial nations while Bryan argued for the United States' unilateral shift to a silver standard. The rift was heightened by the east-west divide on the issue as well as Walker's general distaste for political populism; Walker's position was supported by conservative bankers and statesmen like Henry Lee Higginson, George F. Hoar, John M. Forbes, and Henry Cabot Lodge.|$|E
500|$|Within a few years, {{the idea}} that the {{omission}} of the silver dollar from the Coinage Act had not been with intent to place the United States on the gold standard became the establishment position. [...] Part of this was in reaction against the conspiracy theories that were circulating about the [...] "Crime of '73", as advocates of <b>bimetallism</b> called the act. This was accepted by many historians well into the 20th century. Neil Carothers, in his 1930 history of small-denomination U.S. currency, wrote that [...] "many others have demonstrated {{that this was not a}} corrupt or surreptitious action by the enemies of silver. The elimination of the standard silver dollar was simply in the interests of clarifying the coinage law... Not one party to the passage of the law of 1873 recognized the significance of the abolition of the legally existing double standard." [...] According to historian Allen Weinstein, [...] "Silver's demonetization, according to the traditional account, came as an unplanned if fortunate by-product of a complex and largely technical revision of the mint laws in the Coinage Act of 1873." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1893, <b>bimetallism</b> {{had been}} {{just one of many}} {{proposals}} by Populists and others. [...] As the economic downturn continued, free silver advocates blamed its continuation on the repeal of the silver purchase act, and the issue of silver became more prominent. [...] Free silver especially resonated among farmers in the South and West, as well as miners. [...] June 1894 marked the publication of William H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School. [...] The book, composed of accounts of (fictitious) lectures on the silver issue given by an adolescent named Coin to Chicago audiences, became an immense bestseller. [...] The book included (as foils to the title character) many of Chicago's most prominent men of business; some, such as banker and future Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage, issued denials that they had participated in any such lectures. [...] This popular treatment of the currency issue was highly influential. [...] A Missourian, Ezra Peters, wrote to Illinois Senator John M. Palmer, [...] "Coins [...] Financial School is raising h— in this neck of the woods. [...] If those in favor of honest money don't do something to offset its influence the country is going to the dogs." [...] A Minnesota correspondent wrote in Outlook magazine: [...] "high school boys are about equally divided between silver and baseball, with a decided leaning toward the former".|$|E
500|$|An ongoing {{dispute between}} the U.S. and Britain was over the {{practice}} of pelagic sealing, that is, the capture of seals offshore of Alaska. The U.S. considered them American resources; the Canadians (Britain was still responsible for that dominion's foreign policy) contended that the mammals were being taken on the high seas, free to all. Soon after Hay's arrival, McKinley sent former Secretary of State John W. Foster to London to negotiate the issue. Foster quickly issued an accusatory note to the British that was printed in the newspapers. Although Hay was successful in getting Lord Salisbury, then both Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, {{to agree to a}} conference to decide the matter, the British withdrew when the U.S. also invited Russia and Japan, rendering the conference ineffective. Another issue on which no agreement was reached was that of bimetallism: McKinley had promised silver-leaning Republicans to seek an international agreement varying the price ratio between silver and gold to allow for free coinage of silver, and Hay was instructed to seek British participation. [...] The British would only join if the Indian colonial government (on a silver standard until 1893) was willing; this did not occur, and coupled with an improving economic situation that decreased support for <b>bimetallism</b> in the United States, no agreement was reached.|$|E
500|$|In January 1791, at {{the request}} of Congress, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton issued a report on the currency. [...] At the time, there was no mint in the United States; foreign coins were used. Hamilton {{proposed}} a monetary system based on <b>bimetallism,</b> in which the new currency would be equal to a given amount of gold, or a larger amount of silver; at the time a given weight of gold was worth about 15 times as much as the same amount of silver. Although Hamilton understood that adjustment might be needed from time to time as precious metal prices fluctuated, he believed that if the nation's unit of value were defined only by one of the two precious metals used for coins, the other would descend to the status of mere merchandise, unusable as a store of value. He also proposed the establishment of a mint, at which citizens could present gold or silver, and receive it back, struck into money. On April 2, 1792, Congress passed the Mint Act of 1792. This legislation defined a unit of value for the new nation, to be known as a dollar. The new unit of currency was defined to be equal to [...] of gold, or alternatively, [...] of silver, establishing a ratio of value between gold and silver of 15:1. The legislation also established the Mint of the United States.|$|E
500|$|Sherman {{introduced}} the bill on April 28, 1870, {{and it was}} referred to the Senate Finance Committee, {{of which he was}} chairman. He did not seek its passage in that session of Congress, as lawmakers were busy with other financial legislation. The bill attracted next to no newspaper attention throughout the period of almost three years it was under consideration, though monetary experts and others watched its progress closely. On January 9, 1871, Sherman brought the bill to the Senate floor for debate. [...] That it abolished the silver dollar, and thus <b>bimetallism,</b> was not discussed, as senators focused on the omission of the coinage charge (the fee for the Mint's services in converting bullion to money). [...] This was of importance to the Senate—especially members from the Far West—because it affected what mining companies and refiners (an important economic interest) could get for their product. Sherman offered an amendment to retain the coinage charge, but it was attacked by Western senators as an unjust tax on miners and refiners of gold, and the amendment was defeated, 26–23. On January 10, the bill passed the Senate, 36–14, with Sherman voting against his own bill. It was then sent to the House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures from which it was briefly brought forth on February 25 by Pennsylvania's William D. Kelley, the chairman, before being recommitted to committee. The bill was not considered by the House during the remainder of the 41st Congress, which expired on March 3, 1871, and the Senate-passed bill died with it.|$|E
500|$|The 1873 act {{eliminated}} the provisions allowing depositors of silver bullion {{to have their}} metal struck into standard silver dollars; they could now only receive Trade dollars, which were not legal tender beyond $5. [...] As the price of silver then was about $1.30 per ounce, there was no outcry from silver producers. [...] Beginning in 1874, however, the price dropped; silver would not again sell for $1.2929 or more {{on the open market}} in the United States until 1963. [...] Advocates of silver both sought a market for the commodity and believed that [...] "free silver" [...] or <b>bimetallism</b> would boost the economy and make it easy for farmers to repay debts. [...] Many in Congress agreed, and the first battle over the issue resulted in a partial victory for silver forces, as the 1878 Bland–Allison Act required the Mint to purchase large quantities of silver on the open market and strike the bullion into dollar coins. [...] The Mint did so, using a new design by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, which {{came to be known as}} the Morgan dollar. [...] The issue of what monetary standard would be used occupied the nation for the rest of the 19th century, becoming most acute in the 1896 presidential election. [...] In that election, [...] the unsuccessful Democratic candidate, William Jennings Bryan, campaigned on [...] "free silver", having electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech, decrying the gold standard. [...] The issue was settled for the time by the Gold Standard Act of 1900, making that standard the law of the land.|$|E
