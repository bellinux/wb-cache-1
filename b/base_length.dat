40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the criteria on which public service employees would prefer their annual pay increase to be based. Two major variables of preference for pay increase based on merit and preference for pay increase <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service were examined. Also, demographic variables of age, sex, educational qualification, length of service, job level, and union membership were investigated. Two departments; the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and Public Trust were chosen for their accessibilty. Data collection involved a self-administered questionnaire. 67 valid responses (39 males and 28 females) were used in the survey. The data was analysed using the SPSSX computer program. The findings indicated that employees prefered their annual pay increases to be <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service than merit. However, some employees rated both criteria highly. With the exception of educational qualification where school certificate holders prefered merit pay to pay increases <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service, there was no relationship between demographic variables and expressed preference for merit pay or pay increases <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service. It was concluded that public service employees surveyed still wanted traditional annual pay increases <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service to continue. However, the near equal distribution of frequencies between preference for merit pay and pay increases <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service suggest that employees may want both systems to operate. This would mean that the Public service may have use both merit pay and pay increases <b>based</b> on <b>length</b> of service to motivate the employees...|$|R

500|$|The holotype {{specimen}} MOR 485 {{was collected}} by Hostetter and Ray Rogers from the Landslide Butte Field Area about [...] northwest of Cut Bank. In 1995 Sampson {{described it as}} the partial skull of an adult animal including the nasal and supraorbital (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the parietal bones. Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right squamosal bone, the left squamosal, both maxillae, both lacrimal bones, both quadrate bones, both palatine bones, the braincase and the basioccipital bone. In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported {{that as part of}} the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4. A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon Bone Bed site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010. Two other specimens were collected on the Black Tail Creek, [...] to the south of Cut Bank and referred to Achelousaurus by Sampson in 1995. Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, sacrum and a femur. It also includes lower jaws, catalogued as MOR 591-7-15-89-1. Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, only lacking the braincase and occipital region. MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a skull <b>base</b> <b>length</b> of about [...] Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult. The skull only consists of the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the surangulars and articulars. A fifth specimen is MOR 456.1, a subadult. None of the specimens were of an advanced individual age. According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the Achelousaurus finds represented single individuals, not bone beds.|$|E

2500|$|The {{proportionality}} of {{angular momentum}} {{to the area}} swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from S to the object, are equivalent to the radius , and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of velocity [...] Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula , the product [...] and therefore the product [...] are constant: if [...] and the <b>base</b> <b>length</b> are decreased, [...] and height must increase proportionally.

2500|$|Vertical based {{rangefinder}}s, {{where the}} known <b>base</b> <b>length</b> is {{the height of}} the rangefinder from sea level, were first used at Viapori in the 1880s. Vertical based rangefinders required only one instrument, but they were susceptible to interference from vibration caused by firing of the guns. Vertical based rangefinders also required a substantially high measurement site that was a problem on the low islands. To measure distance with reasonable accuracy to a target [...] away the rangefinder had to be at least 10 fathoms (...) and preferably 20 fathoms (...) high - often impossible to achieve. Measurement sites had usually the rangefinder on a stone or masonry column [...] high lying on a granite foundation. The measurement pavilions had simple wooden walls and sheet metal roof protecting them from the elements and were [...] in size. Vertical rangefinders were no longer used on the new forts built on the outer islands.|$|E

Known as nTri bAw nfrf ra ("Divine is Neferefre's Power"), the complex is located directly south-west of the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai and west of the Pyramid of Khentkaus II, and situated {{at the southern end}} of the necropolis, becoming the farthest into the desert of all pyramids of Abusir.

2500|$|In any case, much of {{the armor}} {{was made up of}} small ossicles, bony round scutes with a {{diameter}} of less than five millimetres, of which often hundreds have been found with a single specimen. If the armor was configured in an identical way to that of Scolosaurus, many of these small ossicles had fused into a kind of pavement, forming transverse bands on the body. The banded arrangement is thought to have permitted some freedom of movement. Four of these bands might have been present on the anterior half of the tail, three on the pelvis, perhaps fused into a single [...] "sacral shield", and four across the front part of the torso. Inset in these bands were horizontal rows of larger oval, flat or keeled, scutes. Types of large scutes varied by body region. It might be that the scutes on the shoulder, near the midline of the body, were largest and tallest; ROM 1930 includes some osteoderms with a <b>base</b> <b>length</b> of fifteen centimeters. Little is known about the armor of the limbs. Large keeled plates were present on the upper arms as shown by specimen TMP 1997.132.01 conserving a round osteoderm near the humerus with a diameter of twenty centimeters and narrower spikes associated with the lower arm. The neck was protected by two bone rings, open at the underside, that are called [...] "cervical half-rings". Earlier seen as a fusion of osteoderms, this was doubted by Arbour et al. in 2013, who pointed out that they formed a lower layer, possibly consisting of ossified cartilage, as indicated by a smooth surface and a woven bone texture. Each half-ring is constructed out of six rectangular concave plates, three per side. Each plate has a large keeled osteoderm on top, often not fused with it. With Euoplocephalus, these neck osteoderms do not have smaller osteoderms at their bases, and their keels do not overhang their posterior edges.|$|E
