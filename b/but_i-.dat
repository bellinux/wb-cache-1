However, development of resistance to bortezomib may pose a challenge to effective anticancer therapy. Therefore, characterization of cellular mechanisms involved in bortezomib resistance and development of effective strategies to overcome this resistance represent important steps in the advancement of bortezomib-mediated cancer therapy. Results: The present study reports the development of I- 45 -BTZ-R, a bortezomib-resistant cell line, from the bortezomib-sensitive mesothelioma cell line I- 45. I- 45 -BTZ-R cells showed no cross-resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin, 5 -fluorouracil, and doxorubicin. Moreover, the bortezomib-adapted I- 45 -BTZ-R cells had decreased growth kinemics and did not over express proteasome subunit β 5 (PSMB 5) as compared to parental I- 45 cells.

Protein and {{nucleic acid}} {{synthesis}} in two mutants of Escherichia coli with temperature-sensitive aminoacyl ribonucleic acid synthetases. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 706 – 711. 1965. —Two temperature-sensitive mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated which grow almost normally at 30 C {{and fail to}} grow at 37 C. One (I- 9) was derived from a strain with stringent amino acid control of ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis; the other (IV- 4) was derived from a strain with relaxed amino acid control of RNA synthesis. When cultures of these mutants growing at 30 C were shifted to 37 C, IV- 4 synthesized RNA preferentially to protein <b>but</b> <b>I-</b> 9 did not. Cell-free extracts of both mutants and their parent strains were examined {{for their ability to}} catalyze adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -dependent attachment of amino acids to soluble RNA (sRNA). These measurements indicated that I- 9 possesses a temperature-sensitive valyl sRNA synthetase, and that IV- 4 possesses a temperature-sensitive phenylalanyl sRNA synthetase. The behavior of these mutants suggests that amino acids permit RNA synthesis in stringent strains only after activation or attachment to sRNA, that relaxed strains can overproduce RNA without a complete array of fully functioning aminoacyl sRNA synthetases, and that these enzymes are obligatory for the biosynthesis of proteins...|$|E
40|$|The mannose {{receptor}} mediates {{the transport}} of high-mannose glycoproteins from the cell surface to lysosomes in macrophages. The binding of ligand to the receptor is dependent on both pH and Ca 2 +. Upon internalization, ligands enter an acidic pre-lysosomal compartment where receptor-ligand dissociation takes place. Acidification is driven by an endosomal proton pump and anion transport is coupled to this acidification step. A permeabilized-cell assay {{has been designed to}} characterize the ionic requirements for receptor-ligand dissociation in endosomes. The plasma membrane of macrophages has been permeabilized selectively with digitonin without affecting endosomal membranes. Receptor-ligand dissociation in permeabilized cells required ATP and was blocked by proton ionophores. Di-isothiocyanostilbene-disulphonic acid and N-ethylmaleimide also blocked dissociation, but mitochondrial ATPase inhibitors and vanadate were ineffective. To explore the nature of the anion requirement for acidification, the ability of different anions to compensate for Cl- was tested. For the halide series, Br- was as equally effective as Cl- in supporting receptor-ligand dissociation, <b>but</b> <b>I-</b> was inhibitory. Citrate and gluconate were only partially effective, while SO 4 (2 -), NO 3 - and PO 4 (2 -) blocked dissociation. Addition of Ca 2 + to permeabilized-cell preparations impaired ATP-dependent dissociation without affecting endosome acidification. These results suggest that the endosomal membrane has a Ca 2 + conductance that would permit the rapid efflux of Ca 2 + from endosomes during acidification, and this would appear to be a necessary step for efficient sorting of Ca 2 +-dependent receptors from their ligands...|$|E

The viral RNA is replicated via RNA-dependent RNA synthesis, which {{is thought to}} be mediated by host DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II (pol II). The precise mechanism of HDV RNA replication using RNA as a template remains to be elucidated, although it is clear that HDAg is involved. We demonstrate here that both SP 1 -activated and basal pol II transcription are inhibited by HDAg. This inhibitory effect of HDAg was observedin vivoin transient cotransfection assays as well asin vitroin HeLa nuclear extracts with purified, recombinant HDAg. Thein vitroinhibition of pol II transcription could be reversed with excess HeLa nuclear extracts. Furthermore, HDAg specifically inhibited pol II-mediated transcription <b>but</b> not pol <b>I-</b> or pol III-mediated transcription. These results provide support for the model in which HDAg participates in a complex with host cell pol II transcription factors to mediate pol II-dependent HDV RNA replication, concomitantly inhibiting cellular pol II transcription...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the structural chemistry of silver(I) coordination complexes. The main discussion is on the halide complexes (F-, Cl-, Br-, <b>I-)</b> <b>but</b> included are also the pseudo-halides (CN-, SCN-) and the classical non-coordinating anions (NO 3 -, ClO 4 -, BF 4 -, PF 6 -) and oxy-anions (NO 3 -, H 3 CCO 2 -, F 3 CCO 2 -, F 3 CSO 3 -, etc.). The main focus is on complexes of these silver(I) salts with phosphine ligands, but where relevant the chemistry of other donor ligands is also reviewed. Coordination complexes of silver(I) halides show a rich variation of structural types. The type of structure depends on the stoichiometry of the ligand to silver in the reaction mixture, as well as reaction conditions.

The direct involvement of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has not, however, been investigated. We compared the transport of I- 125 -T- 3 in MDCKII cells that had been transfected with mdr 1 cDNA (MDCKII-MDR) versus wild-type MDCKII cells (MDCKII), and examined the effect of conventional (verapamil and nitrendipine) and specific MDR inhibitors (VX 853 and VX 710) on I- 125 -T- 3 efflux. We confirmed by Western blotting the enhanced expression of P-gp in MDCKII-MDR cells. The calculated rate of I- 125 -T- 3 efflux from MDCKII-MDR cells (around 0. 30 /min) was increased twofold compared with MDCKII cells (around 0. 15 /min). Overall, cellular accumulation of I- 125 -T- 3 was reduced by 26 % in MDCKII-MDR cells compared with MDCKII cells, probably reflecting enhanced export of T- 3 from MDCKII-MDR cells rather than reduced cellular uptake, as P-gp typically exports substances from cells. Verapamil lowered the rate of I- 125 -T- 3 efflux from both MDCKII and MDCKII-MDR cells by 42 % and 66 % respectively, while nitrendipine reduced I- 125 -T- 3 efflux rate by 36 % and 48 % respectively, suggesting that both substances inhibited other cellular T- 3 transporters in addition to P-gp. The specific MDR inhibitors VX 853 and VX 710 had no effect of I- 125 -T- 3 efflux rate from wild-type MDCKII cells <b>but</b> reduced <b>I-</b> 125 -T- 3 export in MDCKII-MDR cells by 50 % and 53 % respectively.

40|$|At the Peruvian {{convergent}} margin, {{two distinct}} pore fluid regimes are recognized from {{differences in their}} Cl- concentrations. The slope pore fluids are characterized by low Cl- concentrations, but elevated Br- and I- concentrations due to biogenic production. The shelf pore fluids exhibit elevated Cl- and Br- concentrations due to diffusive mixing with an evaporitic brine. In the slope pore fluids, the Br-, I-, and NH 4 + concentrations are elevated following bacterial decomposition of organic matter, <b>but</b> the <b>I-</b> concentrations are in excess of those expected based on mass balance calculations using NH 4 + and Br- concentrations. The slope sediment organic matter, which is enriched in iodine from oxidationreduction processes at the oxygenated sediment-water interface, is responsible for this enrichment. The increases in dissolved I- and the I- enrichments relative to NH 4 + and Br- correlate well with sedimentation rates because of differential trapping following regeneration. The pore-fluid I-/Br- ratios suggest that membrane ion fiitration {{is not a major}} cause of the decreases in Cl- concentrations. Other possible sources for low Cl- water, including meteoric water, clathrate dissociation, and/or mineral dehydration reactions, imply that the diluting component of the slope low-Cl- fluids has flowed at least 1 km through the sediment. The low bottom-water oxygenation in the shelf is responsible for the low (if any) enrichment of iodine in the shelf sediments. Fluctuations in bottom-water oxygen concentrations in the past, however, may be responsible for the observed variations in the sediment I/Br ratios. Comparison of Na+/Cl- and Br-/Cl- molar ratios in the pore fluids shows that the shelf high-Cl- fluid formed from mixing with a brine that formed from seawater concentrated by twelve to nineteen times and probably was modified by halite dissolution. This dense brine, located below the sediment sections drilled, appears to have flowed a distance > 500 km through the sediment...|$|R

We established that I- 12 CMS(2) has a genetically distinct cytoplasm, but its mitochondrial genome {{is very similar to}} I- 12 CMS(3). Male fertility was assessed in F 1 hybrids produced with a common pollen parent. Fertility in the F 1 's carrying the I- 12 CMS(3) cytoplasm exceeded that of the F 1 's with the I- 12 CMS(2) cytoplasm. Organization of the I- 12 CMS(2) and I- 12 CMS(3) mitochondrial genomes were compared based on their physical maps. Mitochondrial genomes of the two strains were largely collinear, except for a large deletion in the noncoding region of I- 12 CMS(2). Because a mitochondrial orf 129 in the I- 12 CMS(3) cytoplasm is associated with a male sterility phenotype and preservation of orf 129 was evident in I- 12 CMS(2), I- 12 CMS(2) orf 129 was investigated in detail. I- 12 CMS(2) plants contained three to five times more ORF 129 protein than did I- 12 CMS(3) plants. A single nucleotide substitution, present in the putative promoter region of orf 129, appeared to be responsible for the differential accumulation of orf 129 transcript.

Uptake of I- 125 -T- 3, I- 125 -T- 4 and I- 125 -rT(3) was saturable and stereospecific, but not specific for T- 3, T- 4 and rT(3), as unlabelled L-stereoisomers of the thyroid hormones inhibited uptake {{of each of the}} radiolabelled hormones. Efflux of I- 125 -T- 3 was also saturable and stereospecific and was inhibited by T- 4 and rT(3). Efflux of I- 125 -T- 4 or I- 125 -rT(3) was, in contrast, not significantly inhibited by any of the unlabelled thyroid hormones tested. A range of compounds known to interfere with receptor-mediated thyroid hormone uptake in cells inhibited uptake of I- 125 -T- 3 and <b>I-</b> 125 -rT(3), <b>but</b> not <b>I-</b> 125 -T- 4. We conclude that in JAR cells uptake and efflux of I- 125 -T- 3 are mediated by saturable and stereospecific membrane transport processes. In contrast, the uptake, but not the efflux, of I- 125 -T- 4 and I- 125 -rT(3) is saturable and stereospecific, indicating that uptake and efflux of T- 4 and rT(3) in JAR cells occur by different mechanisms. These results suggest that in JAR cells thyroid hormones may be transported by at least two types of transporters: a low affinity iodothyronine transporter (Michaelis constant, K-m, around 1 mu M) which interacts with T- 3, T- 4 and rT(3), but not amino acids, and an amino acid transporter which takes up T- 3, but not T- 4 or rT(3). Efflux of T- 4 and rT(3) appears to occur by passive diffusion in these cells...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating their function. In this study the G-protein-coupled receptor phosphatase (GRP) capable of dephosphorylating G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-phosphorylated receptors is described. The GRP activity of bovine brain is a latent oligomeric form of protein phosphatase type 2 A (PP- 2 A) exclusively associated with the particulate fraction. GRP activity is observed only when assayed in the presence of protamine or when phosphatase-containing fractions are subjected to freeze/thaw treatment under reducing conditions.

Solubilization of the membrane-associated GRP followed by gel filtration in the absence of detergent yields a 150 -kDa peak of latent receptor phosphatase activity.

We found that DCs matured with LPS {{in the presence of}} ICOS-Fc (mDCs(ICOS)) produced greater amounts of IL- 23 and IL- 10, and promoted a higher secretion of IL- 17 A and IL- 17 F in MLCs than did those DCs matured with LPS alone (mDCs). Moreover, mDCs(ICOS) pulsed with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin Ag during the maturation phase were better stimulators of Ag-specific MHC class <b>I-,</b> <b>but</b> not class II-restricted T cells than mDCs. This was probably due to promotion of cross-presentation because it was not detected when the Flu-MA(58 - 66) Ag was directly loaded on already matured DCs and mDCs(ICOS). Finally, ICOS-Fc inhibited the adhesion of both immature DCs and mDCs to vascular and lymphoid endothelial cells, their migratory activity, and the expression of the Rac- 1 activator β-Pix involved in cell motility. These data suggest that B 7 h stimulation modulates DC function with effects on their maturation and recruitment into tissues.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} electron {{transport system}} (ETS) {{is responsible for}} setting and maintaining both the energy and redox charges throughout the cell. Reversible phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins, particularly via the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) /cyclic AMP (cAMP) /Protein kinase A (PKA) axis, has recently been revealed as a potential mechanism regulating the ETS. However, the governance of cAMP/PKA signaling and its implications on ETS function are incompletely understood. In contrast to prior reports using exogenous bicarbonate, we provide evidence that endogenous CO 2 produced by increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux is insufficient to increase mitochondrial cAMP levels, and that exogenous addition of membrane permeant 8 Br-cAMP does not enhance mitochondrial respiratory capacity. We also report important non-specific effects of commonly used inhibitors of sAC which preclude their use in studies of mitochondrial function. In isolated liver mitochondria, inhibition of PKA reduces complex <b>I-,</b> <b>but</b> not complex II-supported respiratory capacity. In permeabilized myofibers, inhibition of PKA lowers both the Km and Vmax for complex I-supported respiration as well as succinate-supported H 2 O 2 emitting potential.

The resting potential of the normal fiber decreases linearly with increase of logarithm of [K+]out and the decrement for a tenfold increase in [K+]out is 58 mv when the product, [K+]o,,ut[Cl-]out, is kept constant. It also decreases with decreasing [K+]i, but is always less than expected theoretically. The deviation becomes larger as [K+]i, increases and the resting potential finally starts to decrease with increasing [K+]i n for [K+]i,> 250 mm. When the internal K+ concentration is decreased the overshoot of the spike potential increases and {{the time course of}} the spike potential becomes more prolonged. In substituting for the internal K+, Na+ and sucrose affect the resting and spike potentials similarly. Some organic cations (guanidine, choline, tris, and TMA) behave like sucrose while some other organic cations (TEA, TPA, and TBA) have a specific effect and prolong the spike potential if they are applied intracellularly or extracellularly. In all cases the active membrane potential increases linearly with the logarithm of [Ca++]out/[K+]i n and the increment is about 29 mv for tenfold increase in this ratio.

Materials and methods Twenty patients with clinical suspicion of recurrent DTC <b>but</b> negative posttreatment <b>I-</b> 131 -whole body scans were included in the study. Both C- 11 -Met PET and F- 18 +DG PET were performed within 1 week. PET images were analyzed by two independent and blinded physicians using visual and standardized uptake value analysis. PET results were also correlated with radiologic and/or cytological investigations. Results Thirteen patients showed concordant findings on both PET scans: six patients showed uptake and in seven no uptake was observed. In six of the seven patients without Met and FDG uptake, additional MRI and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of the lymph nodes revealed inconclusive or negative results. Six patients showed discordant findings on the PET scans: in three patients uptake was only observed on the Met PET, confirmed by MRI in one. In three patients lesions were seen on the FDG PET, confirmed by computed tomography or ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology. However, those lesions were not compatible with the lesions seen on the Met PET. In general, FDG uptake appeared to be higher than Met uptake, but was not significant (P= 0. 075). Conclusion This study shows that imaging using radiolabeled amino acids is feasible in DTC. For now, C- 11 -Met PET has not proven to be superior to F- 18 -FDG PET in the detection of recurrent disease in DTC. Complementary uptake of Met and FDG has, however, been observed, which has to be further clarified and long-term follow-up is needed to define the true clinical value of the C- 11 -Met PET, and possible other amino acids tracers...|$|R

Dramatic changes in land use and land cover have occurred with loss of forest and cropland to urban use. In particular, low-density urban use, which includes largely residential use, has increased by over 119 % between 1973 and 1997. These land use and land cover changes have drastically altered the land surface characteristics. An analysis of Landsat images revealed an increase in surface temperature {{and a decline in}} NDVI from 1973 to 1997. These changes have forced the development of a significant urban heat island effect and an increase in ground level ozone production to such an extent, that Atlanta has violated EPA's ozone level standard in recent years. The urban heat island initiated precipitation events that were identified between 1996 and 2000 tended to occur near high-density urban areas <b>but</b> outside the <b>I-</b> 285 loop that traverses around the Central Business District, i. e. not in the inner city area, but some in close proximity to the highways. The health implications were investigated by comparing the spatial patterns of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, the two ingredients that form ozone by reacting with sunlight, with those of rates of cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory diseases. A clear core-periphery pattern was revealed for both VOC and NOx emissions, but the spatial pattern was more random in the cases of rates of cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory diseases. Clearly, factors other than ozone pollution were involved in explaining the rates of these diseases. Further research is therefore needed to understand the health geography and its relationship to land use and land cover change as well as urban heat island effect.

Methods: Twenty patients with a suspected brain tumor were investigated by 18 F-FET PET, I- 123 -IMT SPECT, and MRI within 3 wk. Region-of-interest analyses were performed on coregistered PET/ SPECT/MRI images and the tumor-to-brain ratio (TBR), muscle-to-brain ratio (MBR), cerebellum-to-brain ratio (CerBR), and sinus-to-brain ratio (SBR) were calculated. In addition, the presence of tumor and the discrimination of anatomic structures on 18 F-FET PET and I- 123 -IMT SPECT images were visually determined by 3 observers who were unaware of clinical data. Results: The TBR of F- 18 -FET and I- 123 -IMT uptake in cerebral tumors showed a highly significant correlation (r = 0. 96; P < 0. 001). In the visual analysis for the presence or absence of tumors, no differences for I- 123 -IMT SPECT and F- 18 -FET PET were found in 19 of 20 patients; in one patient a low-grade glioma was only identified on 18 F-FET PET images <b>but</b> not on <b>I-</b> 123 -IMT SPECT images. The contrast between tumor and normal brain was significantly higher in F- 18 -FET PET (TBR, 2. 0 +/- 0. 9) than in I- 123 -IMT SPECT (TBR, 1. 5 +/- 0. 5). The discrimination of anatomic structures yielded a significantly better score on 18 F-FET PET images (rating score, 2. 6 +/- 0. 9) compared with I- 123 -IMT SPECT images (rating score, 1. 7 +/- 0. 9). The uptake of 18 F-FET in the muscles was significantly higher compared with I- 123 -IMT (MBR F- 18 -FET, 1. 4 +/- 0. 3; MBR I- 123 -IMT, 0. 6 +/- 0. 2; P < 0. 001) and F- 18 -FET demonstrated a significantly higher bloodpool radioactivity than I- 123 -IMT (SBR F- 18 -FET, 1. 3 +/- 0. 2; SBR I- 123 -IMT, 0. 8 +/- 0. 2; P < 0. 001). Conclusion: The significant correlation of the TBRs of F- 18 -FET and I- 123 -IMT indicates that clinical experiences of brain tumor diagnostics with I- 123 -IMT SPECT might be valid for 18 F-FET PET although substantial differences of the physiologic behavior were identified in extra-cerebral tissue. As F- 18 -FET PET allows improved discrimination of anatomic structures and the tumor-to-brain contrast was significantly superior compared with I- 123 -IMT SPECT scans, the results are encouraging for further evaluation of F- 18 -FET for imaging brain tumors...|$|R
