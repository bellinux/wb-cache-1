Emotional or aesthetic responses to art have previously been viewed as <b>basic</b> <b>stimulus</b> response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally. Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.

[...] Instead, brain regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.|$|E

We found that learning is specific within basic visual dimensions: orientation, size and position.

Furthermore, rotation of either target or distractors alone greatly increases threshold. Learning is not transferred to reduced-size stimuli. Position specificity near fixation may be finer than 0. 7 deg. On the other hand, learning transfers to the untrained eye, to expanded images, to mirror image transformations and to homologous positions across the midline (near fixation).

The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess morphine effects on extracellular atrioventricular (AV) node field potential pattern and ventricular rhythm of isolated rabbit heart during experimental atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods: Effects of different concentrations of morphine (10, 20, 50 and 100 Î¼M) were assessed by applying <b>basic</b> <b>stimuli</b> protocols involving Wenckebach, recovery, zone of concealment and concealed conduction parameters during experimental atrial fibrillation in isolated rabbit heart. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare the groups. Results: Morphine significantly suppressed basic parameters of AV node. Morphine (100 Î¼M) significantly increased wenckebach index (153. 6 Â± 3. 9 to 169. 8 Â± 2. 9 ms) and functional refractory period (156. 9 Â± 3. 0 to 176. 4 Â± 3. 5 ms) (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The present results showed that morphine has concentration-dependent effects on AV node electrophysiological properties. Morphine at low concentrations can decrease nodal conduction and refractoriness of AV node, but in high concentrations causes increased nodal conduction without concealed conduction changes.
