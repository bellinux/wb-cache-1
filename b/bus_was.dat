5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} competition in Dunbartonshire following deregulation, Kelvin decided to introduce additional fleetnames to its vehicles to establish local identities. From April 1987 onwards Dumbarton BUS appeared on vehicles operating in Dumbarton and Loch Lomondside. In October Kirkie <b>BUS</b> <b>was</b> introduced onto Kirkintilloch-based vehicles and Cumbernauld's Buses onto vehicles stationed in that town.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{offers a}} number of public {{services}} related to the network's public affairs programming. C-SPAN Classroom, a free membership service for teachers, began in July 1987 and offers help using C-SPAN resources for classes or research. The C-SPAN School Bus, introduced in November 1993, traveled around the U.S. educating the public about government and politics using C-SPAN resources, {{and served as a}} mobile television studio. The bus also recorded video footage of the places that it visited. A second <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN Digital <b>Bus</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN's enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.|$|E

5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> hit by a semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E

5|$|In January 1983, Consolidated Rail Corporation {{handed over}} {{operation}} of the commuter railroads to New Jersey Transit Rail Operations. On September 20, 2002, {{as part of the}} Montclair Connection, merging the Montclair Branch and Boonton Line, the Arlington station in Kearny was closed, resulting in the lack of a station in Kearny. As a result, a rail shuttle <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> created by the town of Kearny to bus passengers from Arlington station up to Kingsland via Route 76 bus route, giving rail passenger service to New York Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal. Shuttle buses were aligned at that time with the 5:02 AM, 6:03 PM and 7:08 PM. Services were adjusted for the timetable services on September 30, 2002.|$|E
5|$|NC98 <b>Bus.</b> <b>was</b> first created {{running along}} Wait Avenue through Downtown and met NC98 at the US1A roundabout. This was a {{renumbering}} of NC98 {{as the first}} sections of the Wake Forest bypass were put into place. As NC98 was expanded to US1, NC98 Bus. expanded to cover all of the previous NC98 routing east of US1 and west of Jones Dairy Road. In September 2010 the third segment of NC98 was opened from US1 to Thompson Mill Road with the old routing between Thompson Mill Road and Fawn Drive being torn up and replaced with new routing which became NC98 Business.|$|E

5|$|The club {{performed}} the pre-game festivities {{for the final}} game of the 1984 World Series at Tiger Stadium, but their performance was overshadowed by scenes of violence and rioting after the game. Their tour <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> set upon by rioters, who vandalised it, while the singers fled to safety. A more favourable appearance occurred the following year when, under the direction of Patrick Gardner, the club undertook a 36-day tour across Europe, which culminated in another appearance at Llangollen, where they placed third.|$|E
5|$|The old US 1 Alt. in Trenton is now {{signed by}} the New Jersey Department of Transportation as part of US 1 Bus., despite not being officially {{recognized}} as such. Signage in Pennsylvania no longer exists; most of the former US 1 Alternate {{is now part of}} Pennsylvania Route 32 (PA 32). US 1 Alt. was created in 1953 after US 1 was moved to a freeway between Morrisville and the Brunswick Circle. By the 1980s, when the Trenton Freeway was extended to its current terminus, US 1 <b>Bus.</b> <b>was</b> created onto its current alignment and US 1 Alt. was removed through Trenton and Morrisville.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} reconstructed {{in the early}} 2000s, undergoing a $50 million overhaul to connect the subway station to the new AirTrain JFK. The project was designed by STV Group and financed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. During {{the reconstruction of the}} station, the original subway platforms were demolished and temporary platforms were erected in the center trackways while the new platforms and mezzanine were built. During off-peak hours, trains utilized a single track. The AirTrain structure around the station was completed in 2001, and the AirTrain station opened on December 17, 2003, at which time the shuttle <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> discontinued. The transfer was popular, with 4 million people transferring between the subway and the AirTrain from 2003 to 2007. The AirTrain was designed with the same track height and track gauge as those of the subway, to facilitate a future extension of the subway over the AirTrain system.|$|E
5|$|A North Indian shopkeeper {{was killed}} in Bhandup, Mumbai after he refused to shut down his shop when MNS activists protesting Raj's arrest forced him to do so. Four persons were killed and another seriously injured in a village near Kalyan. Deputy {{commissioner}} of police (rural) Sanjay Shintre said two North Indians, {{a member of the}} Agri community and an MNS worker were killed in a clash between the two communities in Pisavali, 10km from Kalyan. Earlier, curfew had been imposed in the entire Kalyan area. The situation in Kalyan worsened in the evening as Raj was driven there to a police station lock-up where he was to spend the night before being presented in a court on 22 October. Five outdoor broadcast vans belonging to media houses were damaged by MNS supporters. A cameraman from ETV was injured and had to be admitted to a private hospital. One Kalyan-Dombivli municipal transport <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> set on fire while five bikes were reduced to ashes. Transport services across Kalyan were paralysed. A jewellery shop was also ransacked by MNS supporters. In all one hundred and twenty-five cases of arson, rioting and stonepelting were registered across the state, including in Pune and Marathwada, by early evening, and 2,085 people were arrested, state director general of police A N Roy said.|$|E

5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched down near the rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In December 1952, the Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge and its {{approaches}} opened, {{which included}} the Trenton Freeway between the Delaware River and the Brunswick Circle. US 1 was rerouted onto the new bridge and the Trenton Freeway. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering that occurred a month later, the Route 26 and Route 27 designations were removed through Trenton. In addition, US 1 Alt. was designated onto the former US 1 in Morrisville and Trenton, running from US 1 on {{the western end of}} Morrisville and over the Lower Trenton Bridge into Trenton, where it continued northeast to US 1 at the Brunswick Circle. By the 1980s, an extension of the Trenton Freeway had been completed to Lawrence Township. US 1 was rerouted to this freeway and US 1 <b>Bus.</b> <b>was</b> designated onto the former US 1 between the freeway’s north end and the interchange at Strawberry Street. The US 1 Alt. designation through Trenton and Morrisville was officially removed. Most of the route in Trenton is now only officially a part of US 206, despite being signed as US 1 Bus. The former US 1 Alt. in Morrisville became State Route 2060 from the Lower Trenton Bridge to PA 32 and a southern extension of PA 32 south of there.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
