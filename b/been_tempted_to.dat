5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely to be a threat, as demonstrated by the attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E

Some logical positivists (and some would say Wittgenstein, or Wilfrid Sellars) held that people start with beliefs only about the external world. (Arguably, Friedrich Schelling and Emmanuel Levinas held that people start with beliefs only about other people.) It is not possible, on Davidson's view, for a person to have only one of the three kinds of mental content; anyone who has beliefs of one of the kinds must have beliefs of the other two kinds.|$|E
25|$|Sedgwick withdrew {{across the}} Rappahannock at Banks's Ford during the pre-dawn hours of May 5. When {{he learned that}} Sedgwick had retreated back over the river, Hooker felt {{he was out of}} options to save the campaign. He called a council of war and asked his corps commanders to vote about whether to stay and fight or to withdraw. Although a {{majority}} voted to fight, Hooker had had enough, and on the night of May 5–6, he withdrew back across the river at U.S. Ford. It was a difficult operation. Hooker and the artillery crossed first, followed by the infantry beginning at 6 a.m. on May 6. Meade's V Corps served as the rear guard. Rains caused the river to rise and threatened to break the pontoon bridges. Couch was in command on the south bank after Hooker departed, but he was left with explicit orders not to continue the battle, which he had <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> do. The surprise withdrawal frustrated Lee's plan for one final attack against Chancellorsville. He had issued orders for his artillery to bombard the Union line in preparation for another assault, but {{by the time they were}} ready Hooker and his men were gone.|$|E

Others likened Bogdan-Pitești to the Renaissance writer and notorious blackmailer Pietro Aretino (Zambaccian stresses that, unlike Aretino, Bogdan-Pitești never duped his artists). Comarnescu proposed that Bogdan-Pitești and the equally controversial Arghezi were better understood through the logic of Hinduism ("the ancient Indian ethics"): [...] "good and evil are not opposed, but collocated, combined, {{in a state of}} confusion". Taking in view Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's preference for orality, his shady political connections, and his mostly informal channels of influence, Cernat concluded that, [...] "the necessary changes having been made", one could compare Bogdan-Pitești with Nae Ionescu, a philosopher and far right activist whose career spanned the interwar period, and who had also debuted as a Symbolist.|$|E

500|$|Several modern {{scholars}} have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> make identification between the Pharnavaz {{of the medieval}} Georgian tradition and the Pharasmanes of the Greco-Roman historian Arrian, a 2nd-century AD author of The Anabasis of Alexander. Arrian recounts that [...] "Pharasmanes (Фαρασμάνης), king of the Chorasmians", visited Alexander the Great with 1500 horseman, and pledged his support should Alexander desire to campaign to the Euxine lands and subdue Colchians, whom Pharasmanes names as his neighbors. Apart from the similarity {{of the names of}} Pharasmanes and Pharnavaz (both names are apparently based on the same root, the Iranian farnah), {{it is interesting to note}} that the king of Chorasmia in Central Asia reports Colchis (today’s western Georgia, i.e., the western neighbor of ancient Kartli/Iberia) to be a neighboring country. Some Georgian {{scholars have}} suggested that the Greek copyists of [...] Arrian might have confused Chorasmia with Cholarzene (Chorzene), a Classical rendering of the southwest Georgian marchlands (the medieval Tao-Klarjeti), which indeed bordered with Colchis and Pontus.|$|E
500|$|While professing that Anarky was the {{character}} {{for whom he}} was proudest, and that {{the character}}'s narratives were among his best achievements {{for the amount of}} reaction they generated among readers, the character was also a source of some regret for Grant. Reflecting on his early secret plan to transform Lonnie Machin into a new Robin, Grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of Tim Drake, he occasionally experiences [...] "twinges of regret that Anarky wasn’t chosen as the new sidekick for comics' greatest hero." [...] Grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of Anarky following his termination from DC Comics, and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of Anarky and other characters he had come to care about. He often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or, as he felt, were mismanaged. Grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of Anarky, [...] "if you create something that's close to your heart and you don't own it, 'Oh woe is me!'" [...] In 2011, DC Comics initiated a special DC Retroactive series of comics, exploring different periods in the publication history of popular characters. Both Grant and Breyfogle were invited to participate, and collaborated to reproduce a story in the style of their classic Batman: Shadow of the Bat series. Grant chose to author a story featuring the Ventriloquist. However, he had <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> author a story featuring Anarky, only reconsidering the idea on the basis that his disassociation from the character had left him unfamiliar with what had become of Anarky's canonical status at the time.|$|E

500|$|The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) made {{representations}} to {{the inquiry}} that [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] could potentially {{have had an}} adverse effect on the inquest on the same grounds that Howe had attempted to delay the broadcast. The first was that the programme might have been seen {{by members of the}} inquest jury, and could thus have caused them to reach a conclusion on the shootings before hearing the evidence at the inquest. Considering this submission, the report agreed with the opinions of lawyers consulted by Thames and the IBA that [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] was safe to be broadcast on 28 April 1988. The report considered that Thames withheld distribution of [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] from Gibraltar and Spain specifically to address such concerns, though it was widely discussed in British newspapers (which are widely sold in the territory) and extracts later became available in Gibraltar. The report concluded it was foreseeable that the content of [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] would become known in Gibraltar, but that it would not have prejudiced potential jurors as, in the authors' opinion, the programme raised one possibility, but did not seek to present it as the only possible version of events. The second was that the programme might have contaminated the evidence presented at the inquest, as witnesses might have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> give false or embellished accounts for the television. The report dismissed this concern; the authors believed that all the eyewitnesses gave honest accounts of what they believed they saw, and pointed out that three had given statements to the Gibraltar Police and two had been interviewed by Gibraltarian and British newspapers prior to being interviewed for [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E
500|$|... "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics, {{many of whom}} praised the song's gospel influence as well as Carey's vocal range. Following the mixed reception to the song's parent album, Music Box, [...] "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] was deemed a strong contrast to the album's pop influence. Critics agreed that through lowering Carey's vocal bombast, the album suffered due to lowered passion and energy levels. The song however, was considered the only standout from the album, altering heavily from the pop oriented formula of Music Box. J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun wrote [...] "Where another singer might have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> turn [...] "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] into a full-blown sanctified sing-out, Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff use the gospel harmonies on the chorus as contrast for Carey's pop soul vocal." [...] A writer from Portland Press Herald called the song one of Carey's [...] "original classics", and felt it earned a place on her compilation album #1's, even though it did not top the Billboard Hot 100. In an article from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, a writer commented that Carey's vocal range in the song sounds as if it's from a [...] "glass-shattering dimension" [...] and complimented her incorporation of the gospel genre and church choir into the song's climax. Christopher John Farley from Time described the song as [...] "gospel flavored" [...] and wrote [...] "'Anytime You Need a Friend' demonstrates Carey's vocal power, although too fleetingly." [...] While calling it [...] "undeniably strong", David Browne from Entertainment Weekly gave the song a mixed review, writing [...] "'Anytime You Need a Friend' feature gospel-inflected choirs seemingly intended to demonstrate that Carey has soul — which she doesn't — but they're beautifully arranged, and they serve as a nice counterpoint to Carey's own lapses into show-offy vocal gymnastics." [...] Suraya Attas from The Straits Times described Carey's voice as husky, and felt it [...] "exploited her vocal range to the fullest." [...] In 2003, The Daily Record named [...] "Anytime You Need a Friend" [...] one of the [...] "World's Greatest First Dance Songs." [...] USA Today critic John T. Jones called the song [...] "inspirational", while a writer from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution branded it [...] "the center of the album."

2500|$|On the surface, the {{two main}} {{characters}} have little in common. As O'Brian wrote in The Ionian Mission, [...] "Although (they) were almost as unlike as men could be, unlike in nationality, religion, education, size, shape, profession, habit of mind, they were united in a deep love for music, and many and many an evening had they played together, violin answering cello or both singing together far into the night." [...] This musical connection began in the first paragraph of the first book in the series, when the two characters meet at a concert. They also share a delight in puns and dry witticisms, and particularly memorable wordplay is sometimes repeated in subsequent novels in the series, years later in book-time. One character in the novel, Sir Joseph Blaine, saw the two friends as romantics, in his remarks on Maturin in HMS Surprise Chapter 4: [...] "As I was saying, strong; but not without his weaknesses. He was blaming his particular friend for romantic notions the other day - the friend who is to marry the daughter of that woman we saw just now - and if I {{had not been so}} shocked by his condition, I should have <b>been</b> <b>tempted</b> <b>to</b> laugh.
