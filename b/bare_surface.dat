40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} {{differences in}} the frictional behavior between initially <b>bare</b> rock <b>surfaces</b> of serpentinite and powdered serpentinite (“gouge”) at subseismic to seismic slip rates, we conducted single-velocity step and multiple-velocity step friction experiments on an antigorite-rich and lizardite-rich serpentinite at slip rates (V) from 0. 003 m/s to 6. 5 m/s, sliding displacements up to 1. 6 m, and normal stresses (σn) up to 22 MPa for gouge and 97 MPa for <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Nominal steady state friction values (μnss) in gouge at V= 1 m/s are larger than in <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> for all σn tested and demonstrate a strong σn dependence; μnss decreased from 0. 51 at 4. 0 MPa to 0. 39 at 22. 4 MPa. Conversely, μnss values for <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> remained ~ 0. 1 with increasing σn and V. Additionally, the velocity {{at the onset of}} frictional weakening and the amount of slip prior to weakening were orders of magnitude larger in gouge than in <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Extrapolation of the normal stress dependence for μnss suggests that the behavior of antigorite gouge approaches that of <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> at σn ≥ 60 MPa. X-ray diffraction revealed dehydration reaction products in samples that frictionally weakened. Microstructural analysis revealed highly localized slip zones with melt-like textures in some cases gouge experiments and in all <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> experiments for V ≥ 1 m/s. One-dimensional thermalmodeling indicates that flash heating causes frictional weakening in both <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> and gouge. Friction values for gouge decrease at higher velocities and after longer displacements than <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> because strain is more distributed. 1...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} recently regarding the interpretation f measurements from scratched electrodes. In this work, {{a discussion of}} the various effects of ohmic drop on <b>bared</b> <b>surface</b> measurements is presented. Experiments were conducted in which the interaction between the surrounding filmed <b>surface</b> and the <b>bared</b> <b>surface</b> was studied. The experimental variables investigated were the ratio of the filmed to bare areas (AdAb) and the solution conductivity. The results indicate that a large ohmic drop in the solution can cause the surrounding filmed surface to affect he measurement. In all cases, the effect is a decrease in the peak current measured. In some cases, the ohmic drop can also cause a spreading of the current ransient. These results how that the use of as small a bared area as possible is the most effective means to reduce the errors associated with ohmic drop.

This study is aimed at examining sediment yield responses to rainfall on different surfaces in Obudu, Cross River State, Nigeria. Data were collected on rainfall amount, intensity, duration and sediment loss from three run off plots on natural vegetation <b>surface,</b> mulched and <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The data collected were analyzed using Pearson’s moment correlation and multiple regression statistical techniques. The results revealed that rainfall amount correlated positively with sediment loss on vegetated, mulched and <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> with r-values of 0. 58 (p< 0. 01), 0. 57 (p< 0. 01) and 0. 95 (p< 0. 01) respectively. Rainfall intensity correlated positively with sediment yield on the vegetated, mulched and <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> with r-values of 0. 75 (p< 0. 01), 0. 65 (p< 0. 01) and 0. 60 (p< 0. 01) respectively.

In a mass of stratified, slightly agglutinated sand, which in some places covers up {{the lower half of}} the seaward escarpment of the plain, the included shells appeared to be in exactly the same proportional numbers with those on the beach. On one side of a steep-sided ravine, cutting through the plain behind Herradura Bay, I observed a narrow strip of stratified sand, containing similar shells in similar proportional numbers; a section of the ravine is represented in Diagram 8, which serves also to show the general composition of the plain.

There were no degrees which could break my fall from happiness to misery; it was as the stroke of lightning--sudden and entire.[23] Alas! I now met frowns where before I had been welcomed only with smiles: he, my beloved father, shunned me, and either treated me with harshness or a more heart-breaking coldness.

60|$|But {{let us be}} just to our friends. A {{large part}} is also due to the industrious earth-worm, whose place in nature Darwin first taught us to {{estimate}} at its proper worth. For there is much detritus and much first-rate soil even on hills not covered by glaciers. Some of this takes its origin, it is true, from disintegration by wind or rain, but much more {{is caused by the}} earth-worm in person. That friend of humanity, so little recognized in his true light, has a habit of drawing down leaves into his subterranean nest, and there eating them up, so as to convert their remains into vegetable mould in the form of worm-casts. This mould, the most precious of soils, gets dissolved again by the rain, and carried off in solution by the streams to the sea or the lowlands, where it helps to form the future cultivable area. At the same time the earthworms secrete an acid, which acts upon the <b>bare</b> <b>surface</b> of rock beneath, and helps to disintegrate it in preparation for plant life in unfavourable places. It is probable that we owe almost more on the whole to these unknown but conscientious and industrious annelids than even to those 'mills of God' the glaciers, of which the American poet justly observes that though they grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly small.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the surface}} force balance (SFB), we {{recorded}} the changes with {{time of the}} adhesion, normal, and shear interactions between a monolayer of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on mica and a <b>bare</b> mica <b>surface</b> across surfactant-free water. In this asymmetric case, the bare mica acts a stable probe of the interactions between the two surfaces as the CTAB-coated one undergoes changes with time. As previously demonstrated, when a CTAB monolayer on mica is immersed in water, it reorganized to form bilayer patches, exposing the <b>bare</b> mica <b>surface,</b> followed by a gradual release of free surfactants to the bulk. We probe how this degradation with time affects both the normal force vs distance interaction profiles, and adhesion between the CTAB-coated <b>surface</b> and a <b>bare</b> mica <b>surface.</b> We demonstrate that the CTAB layer leads {{to a reduction in}} the sliding friction relative to that between <b>bare</b> mica <b>surfaces,</b> which is reversed only at advanced degradation levels, whereupon an abrupt increase in the friction occurs. This change is ascribed to adhesion between exposed <b>bare</b> mica <b>surfaces,</b> which sets on when the density of CTAB patches is low. The reproducibility of the normal force profiles and of adhesion forces on sequential approaches at the same contact spot indicates that there is no substantial transfer of materials between the surfaces while they are in adhesive contact...|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} birds which {{live on the}} ground, {{everyone}} admits that they are coloured so as to imitate the surrounding surface. How {{difficult it is to}} see a partridge, snipe, woodcock, certain plovers, larks, and nightjars when crouched on the ground. Animals inhabiting deserts offer the most striking instances, for the <b>bare</b> <b>surface</b> affords no concealment, and all the smaller quadrupeds, reptiles, and birds depend for safety on their colours. As Mr. Tristram has remarked,[279] in regard to the inhabitants of the Sahara, all are protected by their “isabelline or sand-colour.” Calling to my recollection the desert-birds which I had seen in South America, as well as most of the ground-birds in Great Britain, it appeared to me that both sexes in such cases are generally coloured nearly alike. Accordingly I applied to Mr. Tristram, with respect to the birds of the Sahara, and he has kindly given me the following information. There are twenty-six species, belonging to fifteen genera, which manifestly have had their plumage coloured in a protective manner; and this colouring is all the more striking, as with most of these birds it is different from that of their congeners. Both sexes of thirteen out of the twenty-six species are coloured in the same manner; but these belong to genera in which this rule commonly prevails, so that they tell us nothing about the protective colours being the same in both sexes of desert-birds. Of the other thirteen species, three belong to genera in which the sexes usually differ from each other, yet they have the sexes alike. In the remaining ten species, the male differs from the female; but the difference is confined chiefly to the under surface of the plumage, which is concealed when the bird crouches on the ground; the head and back being of the same sand-coloured hue in both sexes. So that in these ten species the upper surfaces of both sexes have been acted on and rendered alike, through natural selection, for the sake of protection; whilst the lower surfaces of the males alone have been diversified through sexual selection, for the sake of ornament. Here, as both sexes are equally well protected, we clearly see that the females have not been prevented through natural selection from inheriting the colours of their male parents: we must look to the law of sexually limited transmission, as before explained.|$|E
60|$|Knowing {{from the}} {{researches}} of Professor E. Forbes, that molluscous animals chiefly abound within {{a depth of}} 100 fathoms and under, and bearing in mind how many thousand miles of both coasts of South America have been upraised within the recent period by a slow, long-continued, intermittent movement,- -seeing the diversity in nature of the shores {{and the number of}} shells now living on them,--seeing also that the sea off Patagonia and off many parts of Chile, was during the tertiary period highly favourable to the accumulation of sediment,--the absence of extensive deposits including recent shells over these vast spaces of coast is highly remarkable. The conchiferous calcareous beds at Coquimbo, and at a few isolated points northward, offer the most marked exception to this statement; for these beds are from twenty to thirty feet in thickness, and they stretch for some miles along shore, attaining, however, only a very trifling breadth. At Valdivia there is some sandstone with imperfect casts of shells, which POSSIBLY may belong to the recent period: parts of the boulder formation and the shingle-beds on the lower plains of Patagonia probably belong to this same period, but neither are fossiliferous: it also so happens that the great Pampean formation does not include, {{with the exception of the}} Azara, any mollusca. There cannot be the smallest doubt that the upraised shells along the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific, whether lying on the <b>bare</b> <b>surface,</b> or embedded in mould or in sand-hillocks, will in the course of ages be destroyed by alluvial action: this probably will be the case even with the calcareous beds of Coquimbo, so liable to dissolution by rain-water. If we take into consideration the probability of oscillations of level and the consequent action of the tidal-waves at different heights, their destruction will appear almost certain. Looking to an epoch as far distant in futurity as we now are from the past Miocene period, there seems to me scarcely a chance, under existing conditions, of the numerous shells now living in those zones of depths most fertile in life, and found exclusively on the western and south-eastern coasts of South America, being preserved to this imaginary distant epoch. A whole conchological series will in time be swept away, with no memorials of their existence preserved in the earth's crust.|$|E
6000|$|If we suppose an atoll {{to subside}} at an {{extremely}} slow rate, {{it is difficult}} to follow out the complex results. The living corals would grow up on the outer margin; and likewise probably in the gullies and deeper parts of the <b>bare</b> <b>surface</b> of the annular reef; the water would encroach on the islets, but the accumulation of fresh detritus might possibly prevent their entire submergence. After a subsidence of this very slow nature, the surface of the annular reef sloping gently into the lagoon, would probably become united with the irregular reefs and banks of sand, which line the shores of most lagoons. Should, however, the atoll be carried down by a more rapid movement, the whole surface of the annular reef, where there was a foundation of solid matter, would be favourably circumstanced for the fresh growth of coral; but as the corals grew upwards on its exterior margin, and the waves broke heavily on this part, the increase of the massive polypifers on the inner side would be checked from the want of water. Consequently, the exterior parts would first reach the surface, and the new annular reef thus formed on the old one, would have its summit inclined inwards, and be terminated by a subaqueous wall, formed by the upward growth of the coral (before being much checked), from the inner edge of the solid parts of the old reef. The inner portion of the new reef, from not having grown to the surface, would be covered by the waters of the lagoon. Should a subsidence of the same kind be repeated, the corals would again grow up in a wall, from all the solid parts of the resunken reef, and, therefore, not from within the sandy shores of the lagoon; and the inner part of the new annular reef would, from being as before checked in its upward growth, be of less height than the exterior parts, and therefore would not reach the surface of the lagoon. In this case the shores of the lagoon would be surrounded by two inclined ledges, one beneath the other, and both abruptly terminated by subaqueous cliffs. (According to Mr. Couthouy (page 26) the external reef round many atolls descends by a succession of ledges or terraces. He attempts, I doubt whether successfully, to explain this structure somewhat {{in the same manner as}} I have attempted, with respect to the internal ledges round the lagoons of some atolls. More facts are wanted regarding the nature both of the interior and exterior step-like ledges: are all the ledges, or only the upper ones, covered with living coral? If they are all covered, are the kinds different on the ledges according to the depth? Do the interior and exterior ledges occur together in the same atolls; if so, what is their total width, and is the intervening surface-reef narrow, etc.?) ...|$|E
30|$|The present paper {{explored}} how {{changes in}} the contact area S will lead to {{changes in the}} stiffness κ for a frictional interface composed of nominally <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> (Section ‘Relationship between κ and S’). However, many fault zones contain granular fault gouge. Boring cores of natural faults show ultra cataclasite layers of centimeters to meters in thickness (e.g., Chester et al. 2005; 2006). This may bring other possible micromechanics responsible for changes in κ: changes of the networks of force chains in a granular layer. This has been studied both experimentally and theoretically, and the amplitude of the transmitted waves has been shown to significantly decrease {{at the onset of the}} precursory slip leading up to failure (e.g., Yoshioka and Sakaguchi 2006). This micromechanics can be analogous {{to changes in the}} contact number and the contact area between <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces</b> but not directly dependent on the characteristic contact scale. For a fault zone containing a compliant gouge layer, the net interface stiffness becomes smaller (Schoenberg 1980) leading to a lower ffld, which would augment our optimism.|$|R

For the estimation of surface parameters, a new hybrid surface scattering model has been developed which is based on the polarization dependence of SNR {{and its impact on the}} observed coherences. We show that the model is invertible and allows us to recover surface roughness and moisture estimates from the ratios of measured InSAR coherence. Further, the hybrid model is used for a study of sensitivity analysis. Lastly, we show validation results from experimental Pol-InSAR data from the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur Luft-und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center (DLR)) E-SAR system at L-band.

60|$|A lime-kiln {{formerly}} {{stood in}} a grass-field near Leith Hill Place in Surrey, and was pulled down 35 years before my visit; all the loose rubbish had been carted away, excepting three large stones of quartzose sandstone, which it was thought might hereafter be of some use. An old workman remembered {{that they had been}} left on a <b>bare</b> <b>surface</b> of broken bricks and mortar, close to the foundations of the kiln; but the whole surrounding surface is now covered with turf and mould. The two largest of these stones had never since been moved; nor could this easily have been done, as, when I had them removed, it was the work of two men with levers. One of these stones, and not the largest, was 64 inches long, 17 inches broad, and from 9 to 10 inches in thickness. Its lower surface was somewhat protuberant in the middle; and this part still rested on broken bricks and mortar, showing the truth of the old workman's account. Beneath the brick rubbish the natural sandy soil, full of fragments of sandstone was found; and this could have yielded very little, if at all, to the weight of the stone, as might have been expected if the sub-soil had been clay. The surface of the field, for a distance of about 9 inches round the stone, gradually sloped up to it, and close to the stone stood in most places about 4 inches above the surrounding ground. The base of the stone was buried from 1 to 2 inches beneath the general level, and the upper surface projected about 8 inches above this level, or about 4 inches above the sloping border of turf. After the removal of the stone it became evident that one of its pointed ends must at first have stood clear above the ground by some inches, but its upper surface was now on a level with the surrounding turf. When the stone was removed, an exact cast of its lower side, forming a shallow crateriform hollow, was left, the inner surface of which consisted of fine black mould, excepting where the more protuberant parts rested on the brick-rubbish. A transverse section of this stone, together with its bed, drawn from measurements made after it had been displaced, is here given on a scale of 0.5 inch to a foot (Fig. 6). The turf-covered border which sloped up to the stone, consisted of fine vegetable mould, in one part 7 inches in thickness. This evidently consisted of worm-castings, several of which had been recently ejected. The whole stone had sunk in the thirty-five years, as far as I could judge, about 1.5 inch; and this must have been due to the brick-rubbish beneath the more protuberant parts having been undermined by worms. At this rate the upper surface of the stone, if it had been left undisturbed, would have sunk to the general level of the field in 247 years; but before this could have occurred, some earth would have been washed down by heavy rain from the castings on the raised border of turf over the upper surface of the stone.|$|E

This paper, therefore, describes qualitative apparatus that provide valuable insights into corrosion processes without attempting to determine optical constants or exact measures of film thickness. A description is given of measurements of the repassivation kinetics of <b>bare</b> <b>surfaces,</b> changes in the passive film prior to brackdown and changes in a crevices that lead to crevice corrosion...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{technique}} was described {{to study the}} repassivation of <b>bare</b> metal <b>surfaces.</b> The advantage of this approach over other techniques is {{the ease with which}} multiple repassivation events can be studied. The repassivation rate of aluminum was found to depend on the anion in solution. Repassivation rates are higher for aluminum in phosphate and sulfate solutions compared to borate. It is possible that borate may interact more strongly than sulfate or phosphate on the <b>bare</b> aluminum <b>surface</b> blocking the diffusion of oxygen or changing the rate of repassivation...|$|R
