No one will mistake the episode {{for one of the}} series' greats, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> characters start to resemble the ones we'd come to know later. In addition, it tosses out just enough humor to make it enjoyable." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying, [...] "It's a pretty funny episode– my main criticism is just that at this point, Kramer isn't integrated at all into the stories, rather he just comes by and dispenses weird dialog for a couple minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Supergirl" [...] {{received}} {{average to}} mixed reception from contemporary critics. Heather Phares of Allmusic said, [...] "That feeling of familiarity {{extends to the}} songs that haven't appeared anywhere else.

[...] Warren Truitt of About.com agreed but stated, [...] " [...] {{may be a little}} cookie-cutter, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly compared the song's style to that of Kelly Clarkson. While reviewing a concert before the release of the soundtrack, Peter Larsen of The Orange County Register predicted it would be released as a single and become popular with children, yet [...] "saturate [...] ears for a month or two".|$|E

[...] Leeds manager Don Revie was disappointed to lose, but praised his players' efforts in defeat: [...] "There's {{no doubt about}} it, the better side won, <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> lads played their guts out for me. He admitted it was disappointing to finish second in both the League and FA Cup: [...] "It's a bit disappointing to finish second in both Cup and League, but {{we have had a}} wonderful first season back in Division One, and I am very pleased with the team."

500|$|Retrospectively, the 32X {{is widely}} criticized {{as having been}} under-supported and a poor idea {{in the wake of}} the release of the Sega Saturn. [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X [...] "tainted just about {{everything}} it touched." [...] GamesRadar also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that [...] "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> idea was the right one." ...|$|E
500|$|Journalists have {{described}} [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for The Denver Post, said only a cartoon {{could get away}} with [...] "such pointed satire" [...] of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode. She compared it to the [...] "counter-cultural posture" [...] television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid-1970s: [...] "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. , it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> time is prime." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote: [...] "The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes a step closer to the foreground during this episode." [...] Al Jean, current show runner of The Simpsons, has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are libertarian. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.|$|E

2500|$|Hannah Montana 3 {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic, {{spoke of the}} album negatively, even more than Hannah Montana 2 and [...] On the review, Phares complains that the albums have not grown since the commence of the franchise by stating: [...] "Miley Cyrus was 13 {{years old when she}} started performing as Hannah Montana, but by the time Hannah Montana 3 was released, she was nearly 17. That's a pretty big span of time in a teenager's life, but you'd never know it from listening to these songs." [...] Another point which was brought by the reviewer was that the alteration from [...] "fizzy pop" [...] to [...] "searching ballads" [...] was too sudden. She described [...] "Ice Cream Freeze (Let's Chill)" [...] as [...] "extremely similar" [...] to Cyrus's own [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] which wasn't received well by critics and others were too [...] "equally cookie-cutter". To AllMusic the nadir of the album is [...] "Just a Girl". She mentioned [...] "the only thing worse than a big star singing about how fame has damaged her is a big child star singing about how fame has damaged her." [...] Overall she said: [...] "Hannah Montana 3 seems to give fans exactly what they want, but the calculation behind this music overwhelms the fun that used to be in it." [...] Warren Truit of About.com, looked at the album also from [...] "a preteen's point of view" [...] and taking into account that the songs are not supposed to represent her real life. Truit compared [...] "It's All Right Here" [...] and [...] "He Could Be the One" [...] to Shania Twain. He said the songs were a mix of Gwen Stefani, Joan Jett and Avril Lavigne with [...] "fizzy Radio Disney pop rock". They also felt [...] "Ice Cream Freeze" [...] was just as [...] "goofy" [...] as [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". As a summary he commented: [...] "When it comes down to it, the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack is harmless, poppy fun for preteen music fans. The tunes on the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack may be a little cookie-cutter, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods, unlike the Jonas Brothers' recent genre-jumping mishmash disaster Lines, Vines and Trying Times. Hannah Montana devotees will absolutely love the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack, and parents can actually tolerate most of the songs on the album."
