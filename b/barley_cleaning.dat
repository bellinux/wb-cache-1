50|$|The aim of <b>barley</b> <b>cleaning</b> is {{to remove}} foreign matter (straw, chaff, dust and thin corns) found in the {{incoming}} grain, leaving only the grain most likely to produce a good malt. Magnets are used to remove metals from the grain, in turn reducing the possibility of sparks, {{which could lead to}} a dust explosion. Rotating and shaking sieves are used to remove unwanted foreign matter either larger (straw and un-threshed ears) or smaller (sand and thin corns) than the normal barley grain. During the sieving process an aspiration system removes the dust and chaff. De-stoners or shaking screens are used to separate small stones from the barley. The stones, which are more dense than the barley, move out the top of the machine and the cleaned barley exits at the bottom. Half corn separators may be used to remove broken kernels. Half kernels need to be removed as only the one half will germinate and produce enzymes. At the end of the cleaning process the grain is weighed to determine the cleaning losses (the difference between the weight of grain received and the weight of the grain after cleaning) and it is transferred to a silo for storage.|$|E
