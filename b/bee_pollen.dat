500|$|Honey bee {{products}} are used medicinally in apitherapy across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, {{despite the fact}} that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal. [...] They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is honey. It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns, and as an eye poultice to treat infection. Honey is taken for digestive problems and as a general health restorative. It is taken hot to treat colds, cough, throat infections, laryngitis, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. Apitoxin (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, polyneuritis, and asthma. [...] Propolis, a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by menopausal women because of its high hormone content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Royal jelly is used to treat anaemia, gastrointestinal ulcers, arteriosclerosis, hypo- and hypertension, and inhibition of sexual libido. [...] Finally Bee bread, or <b>bee</b> <b>pollen,</b> is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections. One of the major peptides in bee venom, Melittin, has the potential to treat inflammation in sufferers of Rheumatoid arthritis and Multiple sclerosis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> {{has been}} touted by {{herbalists}} {{as a treatment}} for a variety of medical conditions but there is scientific controversy with some saying it does not have any health benefits whilst others claiming it does. Nonetheless there seems to remain the potential risks of consuming <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> that include contamination by fungal mycotoxins, pesticides or toxic metals. [...] <b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> is safe for short term use, but for those with pollen allergies, allergic reactions may occur (shortness of breath, hives, swelling, and anaphylaxis). [...] <b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> is not safe for pregnant women and should not be used during breastfeeding. [...] The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the use of some <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> products because they are adulterated with unapproved drugs including sibutramine and phenolphthalein.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> is {{the pollen}} ball {{that has been}} packed by worker honeybees into pellets. Bee bread is also the <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> with added honey and bee {{secretions}} and stored in brood cells, chambers of honeybees or of wood and mud created by female ground-nesting (such as the Leafcutting Bee) bees. With the Leafcutting Bee, when the pollen ball is complete, a single female lays an egg {{on top of the}} pollen ball, and seals the brood cell. Pollen balls are harvested as food for humans. <b>Bee</b> <b>pollen</b> is sometimes referred to as ambrosia., whereas with honey bees, the thing {{to keep in mind is}} that the forager bees that gather pollen do not eat it themselves, since when they transition to foraging, they stop producing the proteolytic enzymes necessary to digest it. So the foragers unload the pollen they’ve gathered directly into open cells located at the interface between the brood and stored honey, creating a typical band of what is called beebread - the substance which is the main food source for honey bee larvae and workers.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{honey and}} propolis, other {{well-known}} honey bee {{products that are}} gathered rather than secreted (i.e., in contrast to royal jelly and beeswax), the exact chemical composition depends on the plants the worker bees gather the pollen from, and can vary from hour to hour, day to day, week to week, colony to colony, even in the same apiary, with no two samples of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> exactly identical. Accordingly, chemical and nutritional analyses of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> apply only to the specific samples being tested, and cannot be extrapolated to samples gathered in other places or other times. Although there is no specific chemical composition, the average composition {{is said to be}} 40-60% simple sugars (fructose and glucose), 20-60% proteins, 3% minerals and vitamins, 1-32% fatty acids, and 5% diverse other components. [...] A study of <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> samples showed that they may contain 188 kinds of fungi and 29 kinds of bacteria.Despite this microbial diversity, stored pollen (also called bee bread) is a preservation environment similar to honey, and contains consistently low microbial biomass.|$|E

50|$|Sen. Harkin {{had become}} {{convinced}} his allergies were cured by taking <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> pills, and was urged {{to make the}} spending by two of his influential constituents. Bedell, {{a longtime friend of}} Sen. Harkin, was {{a former member of the}} United States House of Representatives who believed that alternative medicine had twice cured him of diseases after mainstream medicine had failed, claiming that cow's milk colostrum cured his Lyme disease, and an herbal derivative from camphor had prevented post surgical recurrence of his prostate cancer. Wiewel was a promoter of unproven cancer treatments involving a mixture of blood sera that the Food and Drug Administration had banned from being imported. Both Bedell and Wiewel became members of the advisory panel for the OAM. The company that sold the <b>bee</b> <b>pollen</b> was later fined by the Federal Trade Commission for making false health claims about their bee-pollen products reversing the aging process, curing allergies, and helping with weight loss.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{pathogenicity}} of A. flavus on alkali bee larvae was studied using sample {{materials from}} three nesting sites of these soil inhabiting bees along the Oregon-Washington state line. Soil saprophytes {{of the biosphere}} of the alkali bee were also studied. Field observations and direction of soil cores from bee beds provided a basis for estimates of A. flavus disease at the three sites. Fungi, including A. flavus and soil saprophytes were isolated from: soil samples, the surface of adult alkali <b>bees,</b> <b>pollen</b> balls, and larval feces. In vitro disease induction experiments were carried out comparing uninoculated larvae and larvae surface inoculated with conidia of A. flavus. The tests were conducted at five levels of relative humidity within each of three temperature treatments. Field observations and soil cores revealed A. flavus as the pre-dominante fungus pathogen {{in two of the}} three sites studied. One site was free of the pathogen. Studies of soil dilution plates and fungal isolations from adult <b>bees,</b> <b>pollen</b> balls, and larval feces disclosed propagules of A. flavus in the biosphere of the bees in two of the three beds. Saprophytic fungi of the biosphere did not vary significantly over a three year period. These fungi provided a useful index of soil contamination of adult <b>bees,</b> <b>pollen</b> balls, and larval feces. Studies of the effect of relative humidity and temperature on disease induction in larvae surface inoculated with A. flavus conidia revealed that temperatures of 25 ° to 30 °C and relative-humidities from 90 to 100 percent favored disease development while lower temperatures and/or lower humidities inhibited disease induction. The increased incidence of A. flavus disease of larvae during the spring and summer is considered to result from increasing soil temperatures and relative humidities within the brood cells, Conversely, a reduced incidence of disease during the fall and winter results from lower temperatures. Higher incidence of A. flavus disease in one of the beds (the Garbe bed) was attributed to its age and higher bee population. Soil cores taken from the Garbe bed to establish the Harris bed account for the prevalence of disease in the latter. The lack of A. flavus disease in the Wallace-Key bed was not clear, but its younger age and lower population density offer a partial explanation. Control of A. flavus within the nesting site might logically aim at elimination of the fungus from the soil. Sub-irrigation of the beds with fungicide is one possible approach...|$|R

5000|$|Joseph M. Jacobs was {{appointed}} the first {{director of the}} OAM in 1992.

[...] Finally, in 1994, Harkin appeared on television with cancer patients who blamed Jacobs for blocking their access to antineoplastons, leading Jacobs to resign from the OAM in frustration.
