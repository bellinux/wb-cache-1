500|$|For {{an upright}} bicycle on dry asphalt with {{excellent}} <b>brakes,</b> <b>pitching</b> {{will probably be}} the limiting factor. The combined center of mass of a typical upright bicycle and rider will be about [...] back from the front wheel contact patch and [...] above, allowing a maximum deceleration of 0.5g (5m/s2 or 16ft/s2). If the rider modulates the <b>brakes</b> properly, however, <b>pitching</b> can be avoided. If the rider moves his weight back and down, even larger decelerations are possible.|$|R
50|$|For {{an upright}} bicycle on dry asphalt with {{excellent}} <b>brakes,</b> <b>pitching</b> {{will probably be}} the limiting factor. The combined center of mass of a typical upright bicycle and rider will be about 60 cm back from the front wheel contact patch and 120 cm above, allowing a maximum deceleration of 0.5 g (5 m/s2 or 16 ft/s2). If the rider modulates the <b>brakes</b> properly, however, <b>pitching</b> can be avoided. If the rider moves his weight back and down, even larger decelerations are possible.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{of these}} options had their problems—there {{was always a}} chance of {{striking}} part of the fuselage when bailing out, {{and a number of}} pilots had been killed in this way. Ditching the Hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a water <b>brake,</b> <b>pitching</b> the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water, while also acting as a very efficient scoop, helping to flood the Hurricane so that a quick exit was necessary before the aircraft sank. Then the pilot had to be picked up by a ship. More than 80 modifications were needed to convert a Hurricane into a Sea Hurricane, including new radios to conform with those used by the Fleet Air Arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour. They were informally known as [...] "Hurricats".|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} by {{controlling}} the throttle, <b>brake</b> and <b>pitch</b> of a monster truck as they proceed through a level. The original Nitro received mixed reviews from critics. The PC version holds a 54% score at aggregate website GameRankings. Monster Trucks Nitro 2 received higher scores in general, and currently has an aggregate score of 80/100 at Metacritic.|$|R
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to place}} the front brake lever on the left in right-side-driving countries, and vice versa, because the hand on the side nearer {{the centre of the}} road is more commonly used for hand signals, and the rear <b>brake</b> can not <b>pitch</b> the bicyclist forward.|$|R
50|$|Supercross: Control your {{motorcycle}} {{by holding}} the remote horizontally. The 2 button acts as gas, and the 1 button is <b>brakes.</b> Control the <b>pitch</b> of your bike by tilting the remote forward or back, to minimize your speed loss when landing jumps. You can execute tricks when jumping by waggling the remote.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} six races of the season, the car proved {{extremely}} promising. The problems of <b>braking</b> and <b>pitch</b> sensitivity with the previous year's Ligier JS43 had been largely solved, and this, allied with Panis' skill and the durability of the Bridgestones, enabled the French driver to finish fifth in Australia, third in Brazil, fourth in Monaco and then second in Spain, just six seconds behind eventual World Champion Jacques Villeneuve. These results put him third in the Drivers' Championship, and after the Spanish Grand Prix Villeneuve said that he regarded Panis {{as one of his}} main threats {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Considering the {{instability}} of the direction dynamics of tank vehicle system under braking maneuver, the longitudinal equivalent model of liquid was formulated with consideration of both the steady-state and the transient state dynamics of the liquid. The Matlab/simulink program of the liquid was built and was combined with the vehicle model in Trucksim software to simulate and analyze {{the motion of the}} liquid cargo centroid and its dynamical effects on the vehicle under braking maneuver. It is observed that the liquid cargo slosh motion in tank vehicles has significant influences on <b>braking</b> performance, <b>pitch</b> motion and perpendicular motion of the vehicle. The results of this paper have significant help for studies on dynamics of vehicle tankers under braking maneuver and ensurement of braking stability and security...|$|R
50|$|The Windstar vertical-axis turbine is a lift-type {{device with}} {{straight}} blades attached {{at each end}} to a central rotating shaft. Windstar turbines were invented by Robert Nason Thomas and developed by Wind Harvest International, Inc., formerly the Wind Harvest Company, based in Point Reyes, California. Windstar turbines are operated as Linear Array Vortex Turbine Systems (LAVTS). Each rotor unit has a dual braking system of pneumatic disc <b>brakes</b> and blade <b>pitch.</b> All Windstar models use off-the-shelf generators, gearboxes, bearings and other components.|$|R
50|$|Normal {{service was}} resumed {{in the next}} race in Britain, with Häkkinen on pole ahead of Schumacher and Coulthard. Häkkinen started well, but Schumacher started badly and was passed by Coulthard and Irvine. He {{immediately}} tried to pass Irvine at Stowe, but a <b>brake</b> failure <b>pitched</b> him onto the wall at 200 mph. Although the car absorbed most of the impact, Schumacher was left with a broken leg. In fact, {{he did not know}} the race had already been stopped because Alex Zanardi had stalled. The race was restarted, and Schumacher's grid slot was empty. Häkkinen converted his pole into a lead, ahead of Irvine and Coulthard. Häkkinen pulled away from Irvine, and looked set to win until a wheel fell off his car. He pitted and rejoined, but retired soon after because it was too dangerous to continue. This gave the lead to Coulthard who had jumped Irvine in the stops. Coulthard went on to take a home victory, ahead of Irvine and Ralf Schumacher.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} problems which affect electric vehicle performance is the power density of their energy storage systems (energy density is a contributing factor too). Batteries and supercapacitors especially have relatively low energy densities compared to liquid fuels such as gasoline. Associated increases in mass can result in slower acceleration when compared to a gasoline-powered vehicle with similar power and weight characteristics. Increased mass can also increase <b>braking</b> distances and <b>pitching.</b> Offsetting these disadvantages is the benefit that batteries in an electric dragster can be evenly placed along the floor to keep the centre of mass low.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{transmission}} error between the driving and driven gears originating because of manufacturing error ormisalignment in the gearbox assembly causesnoise andvibrationsduring {{the functioning of}} the gearbox. This research article discusses a novel method to prevent tooth damage in the helical gear due to {{transmission error}} by providing tip relief on the gear tooth and introducing a combination of epi-cycloid and involute profiles called composite profile for the gear tooth. Analysis is carried out using finite-element analysis package for the existing involute aswell as themodified composite helical gear pair to evaluate the performance. The study reveals that themodified design (tip relief with composite profile) is superior to the existing involute gear for windmill applications because the wind turbine generators are subjected to fluctuating wind force, sudden grid drops, failure of <b>pitching,</b> <b>braking,</b> etc...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley Unitary Plan wind tunnel to determine the aerodynamic loads and the static longitudinal and lateral stability of a 0. 05 -scale model of the XSM- 64 A Navaho missile and booster and its various components. Tests were conducted through a Mach number range of 1. 77 to 3. 51 with a corresponding Reynolds number range of 2. 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 2. 9 x 10 (exp 6). Results are presented for an angle-of-attack range of - 8 deg to 4 deg for the missile-booster combination and - 10 deg to 10 deg for the missile-alone configuration. Tests for both configurations were conducted through an angle-of-sideslip range of - 8 deg to 8 deg. Also presented are some effects on the model characteristics of the deflection of various components including canard, tip aileron, vertical stabilizer, speed <b>brakes,</b> and booster <b>pitch</b> and yaw thrust chambers. The various components on which loads were measured include the wing, tip aileron, rudder, booster, booster separating surface, booster fin, and booster yaw and pitch thrust chambers. These data are presented without analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of brake forces between {{front and rear}} axles of a vehicle is typically specified such that {{the same level of}} brake force coefficient is imposed at both front and rear wheels. This condition is known as ‘ideal’ distribution and it is required to deliver the maximum vehicle deceleration and minimum braking distance. For subcritical braking conditions, the deceleration demand may be delivered by different distributions between front and rear brak- ing forces. In this research we show how to obtain the optimal distribution which minimises the pitch angle of a vehicle and hence enhances driver subjective feel during braking. A vehi- cle model including suspension geometry features is adopted. The problem of the minimum <b>pitch</b> <b>brake</b> distribution for a varying deceleration level demand is solved by means of a model predictive control technique. To address the problem of the undesirable pitch rebound caused by a full-stop of the vehicle, a second controller is designed and implemented independently from the braking distribution in use. An extended Kalman filter is designed for state esti- mation and implemented in a high fidelity environment together with the model predictive control strategy. The proposed solution is compared with the reference ‘ideal’ distribution as well as another previous feed-forward solution...|$|R
