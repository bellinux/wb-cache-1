5|$|Tests for thrombophilia include {{complete}} {{blood count}} (with examination of the blood film), prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombodynamics test, thrombin time and reptilase time, lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibody, anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 antibody, activated protein C resistance, fibrinogen tests, factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation, and basal homocysteine levels. Testing may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> extensive depending on clinical judgement and abnormalities detected on initial evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, but could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates scattered over large geographical areas, {{and to maintain}} proper control of all their possessions {{it was important to}} physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the marshal. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, and may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start}} of the Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms.|$|E

Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a black root and white blossoms. Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E

25|$|The system {{provides}} sounds {{not found in}} the known Elven languages of the First Age, but perhaps it was designed for notating a variety of languages. However, the consonants seem to <b>be,</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> the same found in Welsh phonology, a theory supported by the fact that Tolkien was heavily influenced by Welsh when creating Elven languages.|$|E
25|$|While {{expression}} {{levels as}} the gene level can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> accurately depicted by second generation sequencing, transcript level information {{is still an}} important challenge. As a consequence, the role of alternative splicing in molecular biology remains largely elusive. Third generation sequencing technologies hold promising prospects in resolving this issue by enabling sequencing of mRNA molecules at their full lengths.|$|E

25|$|When {{employers}} in any profession consider hiring a college graduate, {{they are looking}} for evidence of critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills, teamworking skills, information literacy, ethical judgment, decision-making skills, communication skills (using both text and speech), problem solving skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences. However, most employers consider the average graduate to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> deficient in all of these areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{literature}} discussed so far can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> {{regarded as}} the common heritage of both Bangladesh and West Bengal. Since the partition of Bengal in 1947, {{the east and west}} parts of Bengal have also developed their own distinctive literatures. For example, the Naxalite movement has influenced much of West Bengal's literature, whereas the Liberation War has had a similarly profound impact on Bangladeshi literature.|$|E
25|$|Gay tourism or LGBT {{tourism is}} a form of niche tourism marketed to gay, lesbian, {{bisexual}} and transgender (LGBT) people. They are usually open about their sexual orientation and gender identity but may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> open when traveling; for instance they may be closeted at home or if they have come out, may be more discreet in areas known for violence against LGBT people.|$|E

25|$|Wages {{depends on}} the employer, the state, {{involved}} unions and the role and/or additional tasks. Nowadays, pay level could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> {{compared with that of}} a basic nurse. A typical average pay for a paramedic varies around €2000-€2600 per month (before taxes) for up to 48 hours per week. Additional income can be gained for shift work and assuming additional tasks. Usually, pay level ascends with seniority and experience.|$|E
25|$|Clinical Nurse Manager/ Nurse Lead – A {{nurse who}} is {{responsible}} for an entire directorate/department (i.e. Surgical, Medical Diagnostic & Imaging etc.) or at least more than one ward, {{is often referred to as}} a clinical nurse manager. Depending on both the inclination of the NHS Trust and themselves, they may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> involved in actual clinical nursing or management on a clinical level. These nurses attract band 8a (or occasionally 8b/8c) under Agenda for Change.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{irritation}} was the regional assemblies, {{which had been}} organized on an interim basis pending further constitutional discussions. The opposition, which was strong in Ashanti and the north, proposed significant powers for the assemblies; the CPP wanted them to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> advisory. In 1959, Nkrumah used his majority in the parliament to push through the Constitutional Amendment Act, which abolished the assemblies and allowed the parliament to amend the constitution with a simple majority.|$|E
