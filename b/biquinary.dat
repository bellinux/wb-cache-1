500|$|Counting in Khmer {{is based}} on a <b>biquinary</b> system (the numbers from 6 to 9 have the form [...] "five one", [...] "five two", etc.) However, the words for {{multiples}} of ten from 30 to 90 are not related to the basic Khmer numbers, but are probably borrowed from Thai. The Khmer script has its own versions of the Arabic numerals.|$|E
50|$|Most {{versions}} of the abacus use a <b>biquinary</b> system to simulate a decimal system for ease of calculation. Urnfield culture numerals and some tally mark systems are also <b>biquinary.</b> Units of currencies are commonly partially or wholly <b>biquinary.</b>|$|E

50|$|A decimal {{system with}} 2 and 5 as a sub-bases is called <b>biquinary,</b> and {{is found in}} Wolof and Khmer. Roman numerals are a <b>biquinary</b> system. The numbers 1, 5, 10, and 50 are written as I, V, X, and L respectively. Eight is VIII and seventy is LXX.|$|E
50|$|Ojibwe {{numbers are}} {{classified}} as a <b>biquinary</b> base-10 system.|$|E
50|$|Several human languages, {{most notably}} Khmer and Wolof, also use <b>biquinary</b> systems. For example, the Khmer word for 6, pram muoy, {{literally}} means five plus one.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{the main}} usage of base 5 is as a <b>biquinary</b> system, which is decimal using five as a {{sub-base}}. Another {{example of a}} sub-base system, is sexagesimal, base 60, which used 10 as a sub-base.|$|E

50|$|In March 1902 Yazu {{applied for}} a patent on his {{mechanical}} calculator, called theYazu Arithmometer. It was a gear type calculator with a single cylinder and 22 gears,capable of arithmetic calculations up to 16 digits, with automatic carry and end of calculation functions. A special feature was that it accepted input in the <b>biquinary</b> number system familiar to users of the soroban (Japanese abacus).|$|E
50|$|Generally, each digit is sent as a {{group of}} four bits having the place values 1, 2, 4, and 5. This could be {{considered}} a form of <b>biquinary</b> code. The thousands digit is sent using binary-coded decimal, but with the 1 bit moved {{to the end of the}} group. Except for the 1 bit in the thousands digit, all bits are sent in order from least to most significant. An entire transmission uses twenty bits.|$|E

50|$|The Year of the Ox is {{denoted by}} the Earthly Branch {{character}} ä¸‘. In the Vietnamese zodiac, the water buffalo occupies {{the position of}} the Ox. The 12 animal years vary according to a <b>biquinary</b> year change cycle, which varies according to the 5 elemental changes as well as varying by the 2 yin and yang states. The 1961 - 1962 Year of the Ox is a Yin Metal Ox Year: as the cycle repeats itself every 60 years, so is the 2021 - 2022 Year.|$|E
50|$|Rod Numerals is {{the only}} numeric system that uses {{different}} placement combination of a single symbol to convey any number or fraction in the Decimal System. For numbers in the units place, every vertical rod represent 1. Two vertical rods represent 2, and so on, until 5 vertical rods, which represents 5. For number between 6 and 9, a <b>biquinary</b> system is used, in which a horizontal bar {{on top of the}} vertical bars represent 5. The first row are the number 1 to 9 in rod numerals, and the second row is the same numbers in horizontal form.|$|E
5000|$|... Friden and Monroe calculators used a <b>biquinary</b> {{variant of}} this mechanism. Both {{were made in}} large numbers; Monroe started early in the 20th century; Friden in the 1930s. (The Marchant used a radically {{different}} and unique mechanism.) The variant mechanism worked with digits from 1 through 4 {{as shown in the}} animation; digits larger than 4 engaged a five-tooth gear as well as the teeth of the Leibniz wheel. This made it unnecessary for the sliding gear to travel longer distances for the higher-number digits. Otherwise, pressing a 5..9 key would require either a longer stroke (as in a Comptometer) or excessive force combined with a gently sloping cam surface.|$|E
