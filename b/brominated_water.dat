Development of a rapid field test is needed capable of determining if field supplies of water are safe to drink by the warfighter during a military operation. The present {{study sought to}} assess the effectiveness of handheld assays (HHAs) in detecting ricin and Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB) in water. Performance of HHAs was evaluated in formulated tap water with and without chlorine, reverse osmosis water (RO) with chlorine, and RO with bromine. Each matrix was prepared, spiked with ricin or SEB at multiple concentrations, and then loaded onto HHAs. HHAs were allowed to develop and then read visually. Limits of detection (LOD) were determined for all HHAs in each water type. Both ricin and SEB were detected by HHAs in formulated tap water at or below the suggested health effect levels of 455 ng/mL and 4. 55 ng/mL, respectively. However, in brominated or chlorinated waters, LODs for SEB increased to approximately 2, 500 ng/mL. LODs for ricin increased in chlorinated water, but still remained below the suggested health effect level. In <b>brominated</b> <b>water,</b> the LOD for ricin increased to approximately 2, 500 ng/mL. In conclusion, th...|$|E
30|$|Other swimming-related dermatoses may {{be caused}} by {{irritants}} or allergies. Goggles are often an offending agent, caused by reaction to the foam, rubber, or plastic lining [80]. A short course of medium-potency topical steroid or an oral steroid burst for swimmers with severe symptoms may be used [74]. Chlorinated or <b>brominated</b> pool <b>water</b> may cause an allergic or irritant contact dermatitis. This can be treated by attempting to avoid the chemical irritant or by typical contact dermatitis care (i.e., moisturizers, topical corticosteroids).|$|R
40|$|Water {{utilities}} {{have experienced}} increasing pressure to minimise {{the formation of}} disinfection by-products (DBPs), {{as reflected in the}} increasingly stringent regulations and guidelines for the concentrations of DBPs in drinking water. Understanding the disinfection characteristics and molecular weight (MW) distribution of natural organic matter (NOM) will assist in the optimisation of drinking water treatment processes to minimise the formation of DBPs. This study investigated the disinfection behaviour of MW fractions of NOM isolated from a Western Australian source water. The NOM was fractionated and separated using preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the fractions were chlorinated in the presence of bromide ion. The larger MW fractions of NOM were found to produce the highest concentrations of DBPs (trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, and haloaldehydes), with the low MW fractions still producing significant amounts of these DBPs. The results also showed a trend of an increasing proportion of brominated DBPs with decreasing MW and aromatic character. Considering that the smaller MW fractions of NOM produce significant amounts of DBPs, with a higher relative contribution from <b>brominated</b> DBPs, <b>water</b> treatment processes need to be optimised for either bromide removal or the removal of aliphatic, small MW fractions of NOM, in order to meet DBP guidelines and regulations...|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to determine halo-acetic acids with a detection limit of 0. 1 mug/L. Halo-acetic acids were determined in samples drinking water derived from surface- and bankfiltrated water however, not in drinking water derived from groundwater. Halo-acetic acids were found in chlorinated and non-chlorinated drinking waters. The total acetic-acid concentrations were {{in the range of}} 0. 1 - 14. 7 mug/L. In chlorinated drinking water the total amount of these acids was always higher than in non-chlorinated drinking <b>water.</b> <b>Brominated</b> acetic-acids accounted for 65 % of the total acid concentration showing that brominated compounds form {{a large part of the}} halogenated products. In a few samples river water and drinking water chlorite and chlorate were analysed. These compounds were found in river water and in drinking water derived from bank filtrated water. The results of the analyses have to be confirmed. The chlorate in the drinking water samples can be originated in the raw water source and/or as a pollution in sodium-hypochlorite solution used for chlorination. More research has has to be done to examine this phenomenon into more detail. ...|$|R
40|$|Brominated trihalomethanes (THMs) are {{disinfection}} by-products present {{frequently in}} chlorinated drinking <b>water.</b> <b>Brominated</b> THMs are mutagenic {{in a variety}} of systems and are carcinogenic in rodents. The metabolism of brominated THMs is thought to involve a GSH conjugation reaction leading either to formaldehyde or DNA-reactive intermediates via glutathione S-transferase-theta (GSTT 1 - 1), which is polymorphic in humans. In the present study, we have determined the genotoxicity of one of the brominated THMs, bromoform (BF), by measuring its ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in whole-blood (WB) cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes from GSTT 1 - 1 + and GSTT 1 - 1 - donors. The results showed no differences in SCEs per cell by BF between GSTT 1 - 1 + and GSTT 1 - 1 - individuals when the cells were exposed to 5 x 10 (- 3) M BF at the beginning of cell culturing (10. 8 +/- 0. 85 vs. 10. 57 +/- 0. 47, respectively), at the 16 th (9. 66 +/- 0. 91 vs. 9. 57 +/- 0. 07), or the 24 th h (8. 21 +/- 0. 61 vs. 8. 29 +/- 0. 24) of cell growth. Although GSTT 1 - 1 is expressed in the erythrocytes, the lack of expression of the GSTT 1 - 1 gene in the target cells (lymphocytes) may account for this observation...|$|R
