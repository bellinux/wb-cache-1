25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical <b>binding</b> when <b>using</b> <b>plastic</b> or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of the page and winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil <b>binding</b> <b>uses</b> a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|R

With the industrial revolution, mass production of goods started and plastic seemed to be a cheaper and effective raw material.

40|$|AbstractIn 2011, Malaysia {{introduced}} the No Plastic Bag Day program {{to discourage the}} <b>use</b> of <b>plastic</b> bags for carrying items purchased from shopping stores. In the country, most of them <b>use</b> <b>plastic</b> bags as carrier bags. However, their excessive use leads to {{a large amount of}} plastic waste. Plastic waste {{takes a long time to}} degrade and contributes to air, water and soil pollution. Aimed at reducing the environmental degradation from improper disposal of <b>used</b> <b>plastic</b> bags, the No Plastic Bag Day program applies a “market” instrument to discourage consumers from <b>using</b> <b>plastic</b> bags to carry items purchased. In the program, participating stores do not give out plastic bags. They charge a levy of MYR 0. 20 (USD 0. 06) for each new plastic bag requested by customers during the program. This paper reports the findings of an observatory study conducted during the middle of 2013. The study aims to identify the level of consumer participation in the program and analyze the effectiveness of the program...|$|R
