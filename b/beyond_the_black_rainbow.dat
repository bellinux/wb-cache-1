25|$|Director Cosmatos {{stated that}} he's {{interested}} in social control mechanisms, our own personal, internal controls and how religion affects our consciousness and society. These philosophical ideas {{are present in}} <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow,</b> a film focused on issues of repression and control of emotions. Cosmatos partly picked up these themes by reading the science fiction works of Beat novelist William S. Burroughs, books by and large dealing with societal control.|$|E
2500|$|One of <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> notable {{characteristics}} is its deliberately slow, hypnotic pace. According to Cosmatos, <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> {{belongs to}} what he dubbed the [...] "trance film" [...] subgenre. Cosmatos mentioned Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), Alain Resnais' Last Year at Marienbad (1961) and Saul Bass's Phase IV (1974) as cinematographic blueprints for his debut film. Cosmatos explained the rationale behind his screen-writing, which downplays the [...] "very concrete story {{at the heart of}} it" [...] in favor of an [...] "atmospheric" [...] approach: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> {{has been}} praised for its visual style. Cosmatos {{declared}} that his [...] "modernist" [...] {{use of color}} was influenced by Michael Mann's Manhunter (1986) and The Keep (1983). The blue hue cinematography – the [...] "night mode" [...] as Cosmatos dubbed it – {{was inspired by the}} freezer room scene in John Carpenter's Dark Star (1974). Norm Li cited other references: Daft Punk's Electroma (2006), Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977), and George Lucas' THX 1138 (1971). A number of reviewers noted similarities between BtBR and Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971). [...] "I love Stanley Kubrick, and have seen, and probably internalized, all of his work, but any similarity was not my intent", explained Cosmatos. Critics have also compared <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> to Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972), Ken Russell's Altered States (1980), and Gaspar Noé's Enter the Void (2010). Of the latter, the director deemed it [...] "a very interesting, very beautiful film." ...|$|E
25|$|Another of <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbows</b> main themes is identity. Over {{the course}} of the movie Dr. Nyle {{experiences}} a radical change of personality whose roots lie in the terrifying drug experience he had in 1966, under Mercurio Arboria's supervision. Being exposed to his shadow side so intensely crippled not only his mind, but his body: Barry is forced to use appliances such as a wig and contact lenses. Similar to many a Lovecraftian protagonist, Barry Nyle is ultimately a pathetic character: his far-reaching knowledge, restrained demeanor and carefully controlled work environment are unable to dominate the forces of irrationality and chaos burning in his mind. In the end, the doctor undergoes a physical and psychological transformation where he forfeits all control and gives in to madness.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> was {{financed by}} DVD {{residuals}} from Tombstone (1993), directed by Panos' father. The film {{was shot in}} three weeks using a modified Panavision 35 mm camera. This was suggested by cinematographer Norm Li, for he noted that Panos' references – mostly films from the '70s and '80s – [...] "were all grainy, colorful, and full of texture", and he felt the 35mm format was [...] "the only way to shoot." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1966 {{flashback}} {{segment of}} the movie was inspired by E. Elias Merhige's experimental horror film Begotten (1990). Begotten was entirely shot in high-contrast black-and-white, which for Cosmatos [...] "was a perfect look for the flashback because I wanted it {{to feel like a}} fading and decayed artifact." [...] The young Barry Nyle's acid trip in that segment of <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> was inspired by the [...] "Battle of the Gods" [...] sequence in Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt (1963).|$|E

2500|$|Jeremy Schmidt, {{keyboard}} {{player for}} Vancouver-based rockers Black Mountain, was invited by Cosmatos to compose the film's soundtrack. [...] "Evil Ball", a track from Schmidt's solo project, Sinoia Caves, {{was used by}} the movie's director on a private screening held for Schmidt. A mutual appreciation for Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter soundtracks and Giorgio Moroder's music for Midnight Express (1978) and American Gigolo (1980) cemented their bond.

2500|$|The film's control leitmotif {{is shown}} in a subtler way by {{reflecting}} North America's political climate in the 1980s. <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow</b> {{has been called a}} [...] "Reagan-era fever dream". Its paranoid, Cold War mood contains nods to the late U.S. president – through a clip of an ominous televised speech by Ronald Reagan himself – and former Panamenian general and convicted drug lord Manuel Noriega (Dr. Nyle's [...] "Noriega" [...] jacket). The South American dictator had direct involvement in the [...] "Iran-Contra" [...] scandal. Noriega's fight against the Sandinistas, Nicaragua's left-wing guerrillas, was backed up by the CIA and the Pentagon.

2500|$|Cosmatos admits a {{dislike for}} Baby Boomers' spiritual ideals, an issue he {{addresses}} in <b>Beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Rainbow.</b> For him, the Boomers' search for alternative belief systems made them dabble {{in the dark}} side of occultism, which in turn corrupted their quest for spiritual enlightenment. The use of psychedelic drugs for mind-expansion purposes is also explored, although Cosmatos's take on it is [...] "dark and disturbing", a [...] "brand of psychedelia that stands in direct opposition to the flower child, magic mushroom peace trip" [...] wrote a reviewer.
