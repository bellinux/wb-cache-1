2500|$|The Freedom from Religion Foundation and {{its members}} point out that even the {{government}} lawyers did not deny that the funds involved [...] "derived from Congressional tax appropriations." [...] They said the government was trying to [...] "distinguish between general <b>budget</b> <b>appropriations</b> made by Congress and tax appropriations made to specific 'spending programs.'" [...] They said such a claim of distinction [...] "is not based upon any principle of differential responsibility or culpability by Congress in making appropriations that are allegedly misused." [...] They held {{that the government was}} urging the Court to accept the idea of distinction because of [...] "a belief that the executive branch should be able to use Congressional tax appropriations without accountability under the Establishment Clause." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{all these}} controversies, the {{administration}} still had some meaningful and profound policies to applaud. The administration presents a reprise {{of the population}} policy, which involved the assisting of married couples to achieve their fertility goals, reduce unwanted fertility and match their unmet need for contraception. The administration also pushed for <b>budget</b> <b>appropriations</b> for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped {{due to the fact}} that the church condemned it. The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program [...] "Sustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development". As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.|$|E
40|$|The subject. The article {{deals with}} the problem of legal status of the state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> {{managers}} in the process of budget planning in the Republic of Lithuania. The purpose of the article is evaluation of state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers’ role in the process of budget planning in the Republic of Lithuania. The methodology of research is the analysis of the budgetary legislation of the Republic of Lithuania and the scientific literature, using the methods of logical and systematic analysis and other methods of scientific research Main results, and scope of it’s application. The legal definition and the system of state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers is analyzed in the article. Particular attention is given to the question of role of state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers in the process of budget framework. The role of the Government and Parliament, as well as a special body of management of public finances (in the Republic of Lithuania, the Ministry of Finance) – legislative and executive authorities – is emphasized in the scientific literature. But it is often not mentioned what an important place in this process other participants of budgetary relations – state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers – takes. The main participation of state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers in the budget planning process related to the planning of the budget expenditures. Preparation of strategic plans and programmes of budgetary funds by state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers can be considered part of governance activities in general. For budget planning drawn up draft budgets of the programs by state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers is particularly important. Conclusions. The efficiency of the use of state funds depends on the spending of funds, the quality and validity of the developed programmes of activities led by their agencies. State <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers are involved, along with other entities, on each stage of the budget planning. They provide the Ministry of Finance the data necessary for the compilation and clarification of the macroeconomic and fiscal forecast; they constitute the programmes, which are funded by the state; finally, state <b>budget</b> <b>appropriation</b> managers are prepare programs, which later becomes the basis of the entire draft state budget. </p...|$|R

2500|$|The Foundation {{said that}} the government's call for a {{distinction}} to [...] "be recognized between appropriations for 'Congressional programs' and 'general budget appropriations' made to fund executive operations", was not recognized conceptually or legally. They said the government had cited [...] "no decision that recognizes such a distinction between Congressional appropriation bills, nor is the distinction between Congressional appropriation bills, nor is the distinction provided with any conceptual plausibility." [...] They said [...] "The Constitution does not distinguish between Congressional appropriations made to administrative 'spending programs' and Congressional <b>budget</b> <b>appropriations</b> made to the executive branch. All appropriations require Congressional legislative action. The Congressional 'power of the purse' refers to this exclusive power of Congress to appropriate funds, which power derives from specific provisions of the Constitution, including Article I, § 8, which empowers Congress to 'pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States.' The Appropriations Clause, Article I, § 9, Cl. 7, further provides that 'no Money shall {{be drawn from the}} Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Foundation {{said that}} the Appeals Court [...] "rejected the {{argument}} that general <b>budget</b> <b>appropriations</b> may be used by executive officials to endorse religion." [...] In support of this finding they also cited Minnesota Federation of Teachers v. Randall, 891 F.2d 1354, 1358 (8th Cir. 1989), where [...] "the Eighth Circuit specifically rejected any notion that taxpayers only have standing where a special tax assessment was levied {{to pay for an}} expenditure that promoted religion." [...] In Randall the court said that if such a rule was adopted [...] "when expenditures are made from general funds, no one would be able to challenge Establishment Clause violations. We believe taxpayer standing was created to specifically permit the airing of establishment claims." [...] The Foundation also cited Mehdi and Chankan v. United States Postal Service, 988 F. Supp. 721 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), which [...] "involved a claim that the United States Postal Service violated the Establishment Clause by maintaining sectarian displays with federal tax appropriations. The court concluded that the plaintiffs had standing as taxpayers to challenge the government expenditures, made pursuant to Congress’ Taxing and Spending power, as violative of the Establishment Clause." [...] They said that under the government's argument [...] "such expenditures would not be actionable by taxpayers because they are not part of a Congressional 'spending program.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Foundation {{held that}} the Appropriations Clause negated the government's claim {{that there was a}} {{distinction}} between Congressional programs and general <b>budget</b> <b>appropriations.</b> They cited Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937) [...] "No money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress." [...] They said [...] "Regardless {{of the nature of the}} payment – salaries, payments promised under contract, etc., no payment may be made from the United States Treasury unless Congress has made the funds available. As the Supreme Court stated more than a century ago: 'However much money may be in the Treasury at one time, not a dollar of it can be used in the payment of anything not previously sanctioned by a Congressional appropriation.' Reeside v. Walker, 52 U.S. 272, 291 (1850). ...the Supreme Court has consistently held that any exercise of power by a government agency 'is limited by a valid reservation of Congressional control over funds in the Treasury.' Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 425 (1990), 'Money may be paid out only through an appropriation made by law; in other words, the payment of money from the Treasury must be authorized by a statute.' Id. at 424. As a consequence, budget appropriation bills are enacted by Congress just as all other legislation. The Supreme Court described this process in Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 448 (1998).|$|E
