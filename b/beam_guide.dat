This is the first appli-cation of a depressed collector to a high-power gyrotron, and was relatively easily accomplished due to the natural separation of the electron beam and the output rad-iation in the QOG. Collector efficiencies as high as 50 % and overall efficiencies up to 16 % were observed. The output power reached 431 kW with an overall efficiency of 13 % and a collector eficiency of 41 %. The collector efficiency was limited in this experiment due to interception of approximately 15 % of the electron beam on an undepressed section of the <b>beam</b> <b>guide,</b> a problem readily correctable with a small change in the <b>beam</b> <b>guide</b> dimensions. If {{this part of the}} electron beam was collected at the collector potential, the overall and collector efficiencies would increase to 16 % and 55 % respectively.

40|$|High-performance Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) neutron supermirror optics can nondispersively image {{neutrons}} {{to small}} spots. Ray tracing finds that under many conditions, KB mirrors work near the theoretical limit set by source brilliance and can deliver {{orders of magnitude}} greater intensities than is possible with conventional (nonfocusing) neutron optics. In general, KB neutron supermirrors are preferred when the required beam size at the sample is small and when {{the distance between the}} optics and the sample is not small. Waveguides with beam definings slits are preferred for very short wavelengths, for big beams and when the slits can be placed very close to the sample. For example, for 3 ̆bb 2 ̆ 23 c 0. 1 nm, if the distance from the last optical element to the sample is 2 ̆ 23 c 100 mm, almost two orders of magnitude greater intensity can be focused onto a 100 3 ̆bcm spot with M = 3 KB supermirrors than with a <b>beam</b> <b>guide</b> and symmetric slits.

40|$|Special {{approaches}} {{unique to}} the waveband are required for the modelling of terahertz optical systems. Ray tracing is inadequate because in typical instruments the propagating beams are not very many wavelengths in diameter and a "quasi-optical" approach is required in which Fresnel diffraction effects can be efficiently and accurately simulated. Typically, it is also necessary {{to be able to}} simulate the coupling of quasi-optical beams to feed antenna structures to predict optical performance. In many systems the beams can be considered to be coherent and their propagation through a <b>beam</b> <b>guide</b> consisting of re-focussing elements can be efficiently modelled using modal analysis, especially useful for quick design purposes, beam control and optimisation. This modal approach has been extended to allow for aberrations and truncation particularly relevant in compact mirror based systems. At the same time physical optics, although computationally intensive, is also a useful tool when detailed analysis is required, particularly for providing crosspolarisation information and high accuracy far-field beam patterns from large reflecting antennas, for example. However, modal analysis in general is a very powerful tool, which enables one also to understand issues associated with throughput when partially coherent systems are being considered. This is important for the efficient optical modelling of large arrays systems now being developed for next generation astronomical instrumentation.

40|$|Charged {{particle}} beam actuators such as particle accelerators and {{particle beam}} optics systems have wide applications in industry and academia, from medical and industrial diagnostics to investigations in fundamental science. This work details the preliminary {{efforts in the}} miniaturization of charged particle accelerators and manipulators to be highly compact and portable, by developing a toolbox of beam actuation components, which can be integrated for different applications. The three components that were developed are the electrostatic curved particle <b>beam</b> <b>guide,</b> a co-planar waveguide based RF resonator architecture for linear accelerators, and the Einzel lens for beam focusing. The central thesis is to use micro-fabrication techniques to attain micron precision in structures with 100 - 500 micron feature sizes, channels in which high electric fields (> 106 V/m) could be sustained to act upon charged particles. The use of electrostatic fields is feasible in many applications, {{eliminating the need for}} permanent magnets required in macro-scale charged particle systems. The micro-fabricated components utilizing electrostatic fields are realized on a planar substrate with the electrodes defined by micro-machined doped silicon or PCB copper, on a substrate such as silicon handle wafer or PCB dielectric. Within the planar implementation, the charged particle beam propagates in the plane of the substrate, with device sizes varying from 1 cm 2 chips to cell-phone dimensions. Micro-fabrication processes were developed to accommodate electrically isolated actuator patterning, as well as multilayer high aspect-ratio structures. Planar fabrication and assembly would enable integration of the individual components of the toolkit with micron-precision channel-channel alignment within each layer. Ar+ ion guidance of 90 ° and 127. 5 ° are demonstrated in 10 [MICRO SIGN]m channels of radii of 1 mm and 2 mm. On-chip Ar+ ion acceleration and deceleration of 30 eV is also shown with the use of longitudinal electrical fields of a linear accelerator channel (driven at 35 MHz). Using an electrostatic lens focusing of a beam of 2 keV electrons is achieved in the plane of the substrate, with focal length shifts of up to 167 mm for lens actuating voltages up to 300 V.

The absolute analysis of the sample composition with a commercial program GUPIX is described. Representative analysis of various samples is presented and compared to literature values or to the results of the PGAA method. The PIXE installation is now ready for routine use. A new Prompt Gamma-Ray Activation Analysis (PGAA) facility is now being designed for the research reactor FRM-II in Garching by Munich. The PGAA instrument at FRM-II will use a beam of cold neutrons for the determination of the elemental and isotopic composition of a sample bulk. A number of Monte Carlo simulations were performed to obtain the most convenient <b>beam</b> <b>guide</b> geometry for the cold neutrons; first to keep the neutron flux as high as possible and also to find out, how to focus the neutrons to a small spot of 1 x 1 mm^ 2. The divergence of the neutron beam was also part of the study. The challenging task is to make the PGAA facility flexible for four different instrumental set-ups: standard PGAA, Position-Sensitive PGAA, Cold Neutron Tomography and an Ge Array for nuclear structure experiments. The expected parameters of the PGAA facility at FRM-II are then compared to the former one at Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. In close cooperation with the PGAA group at the Budapest Neutron Centre (BNC) in Budapest, interesting geological samples were measured and analyzed. Small amounts of samples (100 - 300 mg) were analyzed to demonstrate the reliability of the PGAA analysis even for such cases. The results of the analysis for geological standards and meteorites, both either as stones or as homogeneous powders are presented and discussed. PIXE and PGAA analysis for the same samples were performed, the results were compared and conclusions about when PIXE and PGAA are competitive and when complementary are given. In case of PGAA, comparison with Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A high-efficiency compton {{background}} suppressed gamma-ray spectrometer by anti-coincidence counting with a NaI(Tl) -shield {{around a}} central HPGe-detector for in-beam prompt gamma-ray {{neutron activation analysis}} (AC-PGNAA) using a Cf- 252 neutron source has been designed and built to provide simultaneous anti-coincidence spectrometry of natural, industrial and environmental samples. The spectrometer consists of a high-purity germanium detector as the main detector and a large volume cylindrical NaI(Tl) detector as a guard detector. The Ge detector is a closed-end coaxial detector with dimensions of 4. 35 cm length, 4. 8 cm diameter and a relative photopeak efficiency of 16. 3 %. The guard counter has a 29 cm diameter by a 29 cm long NaI(Tl) cristal. The anti-compton (AC) array {{is located in a}} large cubic (1 m" 3) polyethylene irradiation facility with a 1. 5 * 10 " 8 n/sec Cf- 252 source at its axial center where the irradiated sample {{is in the form of}} a polyethylene bottle of 50 ml. The irradiation facility contains two steel-lead collimators: One for neutron <b>beam</b> <b>guide</b> with polyethylene plug for neutron thermalization; the second collimator is for gamma-emission detection where a 2. 5 cm thick polyehtylene box filled with Li_ 2 CO_ 3 absorbers enriched in Li- 6 is inserted near to the target to remove scattered neutrons within the detected gamma-beam. While the end of the collimator is further shielded by lead (20 mm thick) which had a conically shaped collimating aperture, its smallest opening had a diameter of 16 mm to protect the front part of the NaI(Tl) assembly from direct gamma-radiation from the target. The AC-arrays are further shielded from the surrounding background by housing it in a lead-shield of 5 cm thickness lined with cadmium and copper sheets of 1 mm each. The associated electronics working in conventional fast-slow mode have been designed to operate independently and simultaneously in the anti-coincidence mode as well as in the coincidence or in the normal passive mode. When operating in the anti-coincidence mode the compton edge of Cs- 137 is reduced by a factor of 7. 9 to provide a peak-to-compton edge ratio of 500 / 1. The assembly has the ability to measure instantaneously, simultaneously and nondestructively bulk samples up to about 50 cm" 3. Major constituent elements in several rocks and minerals such as H, B, N, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Cl, K, Ca, P, S, Ti, Fe, Sm, Nd, Mn and Gd can be determined, while oxygen cannot be measured due to its small capture cross section (0. 27 mb). Several important minor and trace elements such as B, Cd and Hg beside the low residual activity, rare earths and short-lived isotopes could be detected. The sensitivity of the AC-PGNAA technique is limited by the available neutron flux at the target matrix and the neutron absorption cross section of the elements of interest. PGNAA has the advantage to estimate the constituent elements which are difficult to be measured through the delayed gamm-ray measurements such as B, Bi, C, H, P, Tl, Be, Cl and S in industrial and reference materials and those elements which are transformed into other stable isotopes when undergoing neutron capture. The design of the spectrometer assembly, its properties and performance are described. (orig.)
