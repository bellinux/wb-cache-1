5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> {{the rank of}} major in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, {{but there is no}} record that he took part in the fighting.|$|E

In the attack against A Company, the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon, which was near Agok, but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, {{at the end}} of the Peace of Amiens, Hope briefly took {{command of}} HMS Atlas, but it soon became clear that his health was failing and he could no longer {{maintain}} an active naval career. Retiring from the navy on half-pay, Hope was an invalid from 1804 until 1807, when a return to health permitted him to take a post as a Lord of the Admiralty. Hope changed positions several times in this role, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> onto the position for twenty years as a political favourite, a status maintained by being almost totally politically inactive. In 1812, Hope was advanced to rear-admiral and in January 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on the reorganisation of the order, and was invested later in the year.|$|E

Taylor made only 14 runs, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> onto six catches for England's potent bowling attack. Australia replied with a 103-run {{victory in the}} third Test, and Taylor was quiet both with the gloves and the bat. The fourth Test was equally unspectacular for Taylor, though England took a series-lead with a 93-run victory.|$|E

25|$|According to the Seventh Letter, whose {{authenticity}} {{has been}} disputed, as Plato came of age, he imagined for himself {{a life in}} public affairs. He was actually invited by the regime of the Thirty Tyrants (Critias and Charmides were among their leaders) to join the administration, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> back; he hoped that under the new leadership the city would return to justice, but he was soon repelled by the violent acts of the regime. He was particularly disappointed, when the Thirty attempted to implicate Socrates in their seisure of the democratic general Leon of Salamis for summary execution.|$|E
25|$|The 1924 season saw Abell play 12 {{first-class}} matches: seven for Oxford University {{and five}} for Worcestershire. His batting produced nothing of note (his highest score that season was just 23*) <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> 12 catches and made two stumpings. The following year, however, he passed 500 {{runs for the}} only time in his career, this total including 124 for Worcestershire against Sussex. He also claimed 17 dismissals. From 1926 until 1928 he performed poorly with the bat, 50 being his highest score in 31 innings, but he continued to pick up victims behind the stumps.|$|E

25|$|In 1910, West {{was looking}} to open a private law office. Meanwhile, John M. Alexander was serving as Managing Secretary from May to October, under the general auspices of Edgar M. Robinson, who had set up BSA's {{original}} one-room national office and recruited Alexander to run it. Neither Robinson nor Alexander wanted to run BSA permanently, so Colin H. Livingstone, {{the president of the}} BSA put out inquiries. Ernest Bicknell of the American Red Cross wrote to Luther Gulick, president of the Playground Association of America and recommended West for the position. After much persuasion West finally accepted the position on a temporary basis and moved to New York City, while Robinson returned to the YMCA and turned BSA's reins over to West. The Russell Sage Foundation provided the initial funding for West to become the first Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America. He initially accepted for a six-month tenure, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the position for 32 years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the causes}} of the defeat was that General József Nagysándor, who had the task to cross the Vág at Szered in order to hold the Austrian units there, did not {{observed}} that these enemy units left that place and joined Wohlgemuth's main troops, to support the attack in the main front. He remained on his position, despite the fact that even Görgei ordered him to cross the now undefended Vág river, and attack from side and behind the enemy troops, which could have brought the victory to Hungarians. Do to the inactivity of Nagysándor the numerically much superior Austro-Russian troops managed to chase the Hungarian troops from the positions they occupied the day before. Görgei had no choice that to order the Hungarian retreat. He sent Leiningen a messenger with the order to continue its retreat, crossing the Vág river, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> Királyrév for a while, until the units of lieutenant-colonel Rakovszky which were pursuing the enemy troops chased out of the village turned back. Until this happened, Colonel Kászonyi, with the cavalry battery of the II. corps attacked the enemy troops which were moving towards Királyrév. After all detached troops arrived, Görgei ordered the retreat of the II. corps too, towards the bridge of Aszódpuszta.|$|E

500|$|Johannes Kepler's (1571–1630) {{cosmology}} {{eliminated the}} celestial spheres, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> that the planets were moved both by an external motive power, which he {{located in the}} Sun, and a motive soul associated with each planet. [...] In an early manuscript discussing the motion of Mars, Kepler considered the Sun to cause the circular motion of the planet. [...] He then attributed the inward and outward motion of the planet, which transforms its overall motion from circular to oval, to a moving soul in the planet since the motion is [...] "not a natural motion, but more of an animate one". [...] In various writings, Kepler often attributed a kind of intelligence to the inborn motive faculties associated with the stars.|$|E
2500|$|Hutchinson {{never reached}} 1,000 {{runs in a}} season, his closest {{approach}} coming with 990 in 1928: he had been well on course {{at the end of}} July, having already passed 800, but his highest score in 16 innings thereafter was just 30. In other seasons, his run aggregate and average were often fairly modest, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> his place in what was, admittedly, a consistently moderate batting side with his cover fielding, which was remarked upon year after year by Wisden.

[...] Mike Spann’s family visited the fortress after his death.
