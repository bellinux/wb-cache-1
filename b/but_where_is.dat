500|$|Thanks to the media, {{people have}} started taking boxing seriously {{over the past}} two years. Everyone knows my name now because my {{achievements}} have been highlighted. Lekin boxing ka toh kuch promotion hi nahin hota India mein. (But boxing is still not promoted in India!) We don’t have boxing academies, we don’t even have proper boxing rings. I have lost count of the times I have approached the government and the sporting authorities for support, but nothing has happened. [...] In this country, everyone is hung up on cricket. Forget about boxing, India is doing so well in other sports too. Saina Nehwal is a great badminton player, the Indian tennis team has just won a Davis Cup tie, lekin hamare liye support kahan hai? (<b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> the support for all of us?) ...|$|E
500|$|The Field Spaniel was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; {{one of the first}} breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; [...] "Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have at me and my dogs from behind the hedge. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (if there ever was one!) has not been forthcoming. Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Viktoria finally {{decides to}} take a break and leaves for an {{anonymous}} vacation at a resort on the seashore. The name of the movie ("Soul") comes from a dialogue which takes place at this point in the movie between Viktoria and an older stranger at this isolated vacation resort, during a stroll on a pier. Viktoria confesses her fears of losing her voice and the stranger comforts her, saying that the songs of a singer live as long as the soul of the singer remains alive. Viktoria asks: [...] "Soul? <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> this soul?". Her producer finally locates her with the news that an important international song competition is going to take place in Germany, and she has been [...] selected to represent her country.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot {{have any idea of}} where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> it really going?" [...] That is precisely the kind of question that is scientifically meaningless. That {{is the nature of the}} world we live in. That is the quantum mechanical universe.The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official YouTube channel. Caltech also posted on YouTube a series of short videos made by Blinn to demonstrate the show's computer animation at SIGGRAPH conferences.|$|E
