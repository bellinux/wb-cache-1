5|$|The Osprey is a medium-large {{fish-eating}} <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> or raptor. It {{is widely}} distributed because it tolerates {{a wide variety}} of habitats, nesting in any location that is near a body of water and provides an adequate food supply. It is the only member of its family.|$|E

50|$|She {{encountered}} the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> in the Hero Hunters storyline. As <b>of</b> <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> #98, she is employed at Dinah Lance's flower shop, Sherwood Florist II. Her most recent appearance was in <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> #109, where she makes an appearance {{as one of}} the heroines called in to confront and intimidate Spy Smasher.|$|R
50|$|The {{television}} series <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> also features batarangs. However these versions are circular and bear the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> symbol, {{rather than the}} traditional bat shape.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a small}} <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.|$|E
5|$|The Stargazer was to {{originally}} {{be represented}} by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard {{the bridge of the}} Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> bridge set.|$|E
5|$|This nocturnal <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> hunts mainly rodents, {{usually by}} {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion}} of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk.|$|E
50|$|The Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation <b>of</b> Migratory <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> in Africa and Eurasia (Raptors MoU) is an international, legally {{non-binding}} {{agreement to}} protect migratory <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|R

50|$|The park is a {{good place}} to study Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> Among <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> noted here are the golden eagle, the {{lammergeier}} vulture, and the Himalayan griffon vulture.|$|R
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{technique}} pioneered on Back to the Future Part II, another {{shot with a}} different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate key light and fill light passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and {{a shot of the}} <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.|$|E

5000|$|The Union Québécoise de Réhabilitation des Oiseaux de Proie (Quebec's <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> Rehabilitation Union) is a non profit {{organization}} {{created in}} 1987. Its {{mission is to}} provide help for the conservation <b>of</b> both <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> and their natural environment. It has two divisions: the [...] "Clinique des Oiseaux de Proie" [...] (<b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> Clinic) and an information office to publicize the plight <b>of</b> these endangered <b>birds.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> #126, the Calculator copies Kilg%re's {{programming}} into himself, {{gaining the}} ability to control all forms of technology. He then uses this power to launch an attack on the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|Producer Michael Wearing {{had worked}} on Play for Today {{for which he had}} {{produced}} Alan Bleasdale's The Black Stuff (1978) and which he and Bleasdale subsequently spun off into the highly acclaimed Boys from the Blackstuff (1982). He also produced the conspiracy thriller <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> (1982). Following Edge of Darkness he continued to be one of British television's most high profile and successful producers, appointed Head of Serials at the BBC between 1989 and 1998 where he was responsible for such programmes as Pride and Prejudice (1995), Our Friends in the North (1996) and Dennis Potter's final two plays Karaoke (1996) and Cold Lazarus (1996).|$|E
5|$|Raptor is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead {{of having a}} short layout designed {{to fit into a}} compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra roll, a first for inverted roller coasters. At its opening, it was the largest investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed as a <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the 2016 company wide soft {{relaunch}} DC Rebirth, the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> are re-introduced in the {{new title}} Batgirl and the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey,</b> initially featuring a team consisting of Batgirl, Black Canary and Huntress.|$|R

50|$|In {{the eastern}} part of the region there is the well known nature reserve of the forests of Dadia, an ideal habitat for living <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> where live 36 of the 38 species <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> <b>of</b> Europe, like the rare Eastern {{imperial}} eagle and Lesser spotted eagle.|$|R
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a {{single-engine}} ground-attack {{aircraft that}} constitutes {{the second generation}} of the Harrier Jump Jet family. Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after a <b>bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> it is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B {{is used by the}} United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount of}} work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey,</b> Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|Taylor learns {{the whales}} have been {{released}} early, and goes to Kirk for assistance. Taylor, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov {{and return to the}} now recharged <b>Bird</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey.</b> After transporting the whales aboard the ship, the crew returns with Taylor to their own time. On approaching Earth, the ship loses power and comes down in San Francisco Bay. Once released, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space. All charges against the Enterprise crew are dropped, save one for insubordination: for disobeying a superior officer, Kirk is demoted from Admiral back to the rank of Captain where he is returned to command of a starship. The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), and leaves on a new mission.|$|E
50|$|Nightstalkers: vaguely insectoid creatures which {{resemble}} large bats with cloaks, and {{of roughly}} similar size to larger bats and <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> They {{have a similar}} ecological niche to <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> primarily eating insects but also smaller rodents.|$|R
50|$|Per <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> #100, Karen—along with {{numerous}} other DCU heroines—was contacted by Barbara Gordon {{and asked to}} join the expanded roster of the latter's team, the <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prey.</b> However, the team disbanded before she participated in any missions.|$|R
40|$|A total <b>of</b> 170 <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> {{admitted}} to two Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centers of Italy were examined. Birds were divided by diurnal (n = 15) and nocturnal (n = 7) species, sampled by cloacal swabs, and examined for Campylobacter spp. by cultural and molecular methods. Campylobacter spp. were isolated in 43 {{out of the}} 170 (25. 3 %) <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> examined. Among these, 43 / 43 (100 %) were identified as Campylobacter jejuni and 10 / 43 (23. 3 %) were identified as Campylobacter coli recovered from mixed infections. Diurnal <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> showed a significantly higher prevalence value (P = 0. 0006) for Campylobacter spp. than did nocturnal <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> <b>prey...</b>|$|R
