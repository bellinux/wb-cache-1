50|$|The Ellas-McKay House is a {{historic}} house at 404 North Wells Street in Clarendon, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and the irregular and asymmetrical massing typical of the Queen Anne period. The {{left side of the}} front facade has a clipped-gable projection, while the right side has a semi-circular porch with an engaged gable dormer above. Both of these gables have decorative <b>barge-board.</b> The house was built in 1908 by T. S. Ellas, a prominent local builder, for his own family. In 1948 it was acquired by R. J. McKay, a prominent local civic leader.|$|E
5000|$|The chapel {{was built}} with [...] "dressed stone walls on a chert rubble-stone base". It has a slate roof, which {{includes}} some carved wooden <b>barge-boards,</b> added in 1898. A burial ground was established alongside the chapel.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 Bayley Lane: The only {{surviving}} timber-framed {{property on}} Bayley Lane, no. 22 {{is an early}} 16th-century house with carved buttresses, carved <b>barge-boards,</b> and traceried panels. Other decorative work of this age and quality is now only to be found at Bond's Hospital and Ford's Hospital.|$|R
50|$|The {{residence}} exterior {{includes some}} fine decorative detailing. The gables have timber cross-braces, scalloped <b>barge-boards</b> and fretwork at the peaks. The roof {{is separated from}} the verandah by a stepped cornice with dentils. The entry portico has a pair of timber panelled arches with keystones, surmounted by a cornice with dentils.|$|R
5000|$|A rake is an {{architectural}} term for an eave or cornice which {{runs along the}} gable end of {{the roof of a}} modern residential structure. It may also be called a sloping cornice, a raking cornice. The trim and rafters at this edge are called rake-, verge-, or <b>barge-board</b> or verge- or barge-rafter. [...] It is a sloped timber on the outside facing edge of a roof running between the ridge and the eave. [...] On a typical house, any gable will have two rakes, one on each sloped side. The rakes are supported by a series of lookouts (sometimes also called strong arms) and may be enclosed with a rake fascia board on the outside facing edge and a rake soffit along the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|The Britannia Heights Methodist Church {{was built}} between 1873 and 1874 {{on what is}} now Britannia Road and Carling Avenue. Begun in 1873 with first {{services}} the following summer, the interior wasn't completed until 1875. A plaque under the pulpit listed James West and William West, contractors Jul 3 1873. The Carpenter Gothic-style frame building had interior wood panelling. The pointed windows and doors were arched equilaterally in the Neo Gothic style. The roof over {{the front door and}} main building was decorated by a delicate <b>barge-board</b> trim of lacelike scrollwork. [...] The original ceiling was made of tongue and groove stained wood in an ornamental design carved in rectangular shapes. The Christmas concerts took place on a little wooden platform. The original heating was provided by stove and pipes. Later the church was heated by a furnace with a large central register. Although the lawn at the front entrance was small, the east lawn was large enough for the members to socialize after the services. The drive shed was on the easterly back side.|$|E
50|$|The Great Audience Hall {{was built}} {{with a special}} eye to {{external}} effect, and this object was attained by carving and gilding all the wooden parts of the roofs-except the panels between the two roofs, which were merely gilt-that is, the gables, <b>barge-boards</b> and eaves-boards. The carving is in low relief and consists principally of a lotus and foliage-band on the eaves-boards; the <b>barge-boards</b> are ornamented with a plain scroll design and surmounted by flamboyant which are very effective as a decoration. But the wealth of ornamentation is lavished on {{the corners of the}} hipped roofs and the points of the gables as well as their lower extremities. The corners of the hipped (lower) roofs are surmounted by two wooden boards, made up of several joined piecesand meeting so as to form a right angle at the corner; the chief motifs are flamboyant, foliage, lotus-bands and guilloches.|$|R
50|$|In {{the centre}} of the village, on the corner of Mill Lane stands the old school, which is now a private residence. This was built in 1870 to the designs of architects Richard Carpenter and William Slater. The school has Gothic-style windows and door arches, is faced in flint with a red tiled roof and {{decorative}} <b>barge-boards</b> to the gables. The former schoolmaster's house has a distinctive chimney-stack with four outlets.|$|R
50|$|The gable is a {{projecting}} one extending further east {{than the}} wall below and the finish {{is also one}} of tile-hanging (matching that of the adjacent cottage). The tiles are clay and are decorative fish-scale type of probable 19th century origin. At the gable the cladding is embellished by pierced white painted timber <b>barge-boards.</b> A single two light casement window lights the interior of the garrets. The window has a moulded timber frame with a central mullion that is hollow-chamfered on the exterior and plain chamfered on the interior. The leaded lights have diamond quarrels and each light is side hung on pintles fixed to the timber frame.|$|R
5000|$|Butterhill House {{was owned}} by the Marson family in the 19th century and then passed to the Busby family who still lived there in 1900. Mrs. A. J. Busby {{was one of the}} chief landowners in Coppenhall in 1912 and 1916, but between at least 1924 and 1932 Butterhill House was owned and {{occupied}} by T. P. Darlington. Miss Darlington was living there in 1940. The house was sold in 1955 to Mr. A. N. Hillier, who had converted it by 1956 into flats. It is a mid-19th-century brick building with gabled dormers, ornamental <b>barge-boards,</b> and stone bay windows. It also has a large walled garden to the north. The house has for some years now been a residential care home for the elderly.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857, Cash's {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} three-storey weavers' cottages on a plot of land alongside the Coventry Canal at Kingfield, and on a road now known as Cash's Lane (...) , then in countryside, outside the city boundary. Initially 100 such cottages were planned, but eventually only 48 were built, in two blocks. These used bricks, with tiled roofs and mock Tudor <b>barge-boards</b> on the gables. Each had a garden. On {{the top floor of}} each cottage was a well-lit work area topshop, known collectively as 'Cash's Topshops', housing a Jacquard loom, powered by a central, steam-powered beam engine. They opened for business on 12 October 1857, and the individual workshops were combined into single, large, workspaces in 1862. The houses still stand, and were Grade II listed on 10 October 1975.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is constructed of Douglas Fir framing on twelve-inch (305 mm) centers holding smooth redwood plank {{tongue and groove}} siding with redwood sleepers, ground sills and redwood exterior ornamental features. It is founded on plastered brick which surrounds the dirt floor basement and forms a pedestal to support {{the rest of the}} framing. Metal trim around the chimneys augments the wood shingle roof ("best-quality of heart redwood" [...] shingles with clipped corners were originally specified.) Gable-ended dormers extend through the steep roofline; decorated <b>barge-boards</b> and heavily-molded finials, corbels and string corners adorn the dormers and roof eaves. A strong sense of verticality is enhance by tall, narrow windows and the steeply-angled 52.5Â° roof. The original main chimney vented flues from four fireplaces and rose in a slender pillar twelve feet above the roof at the symmetrical center of the building. Two other chimneys were of similar design. (By 1928, the tall, slender, cylindrical chimneys had been replaced by unremarkable short, rectangular brick ones.) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{opened an}} iron gate {{and entered the}} wood, casually {{interested}} in the vast variety of colours that the half-fallen leaves of the season wore: more, much more, occupied with personal thought. The path she pursued became gradually involved in bushes as well as trees, giving to the spot the character rather of a coppice than a wood. Perceiving that she had gone far enough, Ethelberta turned back by a path which at this point intersected that by which she had approached, and promised a more direct return towards the Court. She had not gone many steps among the hazels, which here formed a perfect thicket, when she observed a belt of holly- bushes in their midst; towards the outskirts of these an opening on her left hand directly led, thence winding round into a clear space of greensward, which they completely enclosed. On this isolated and mewed- up bit of lawn stood a timber-built cottage, having ornamental <b>barge-boards,</b> balconettes, and porch. It was an erection interesting enough as an experiment, and grand as a toy, but as a building contemptible.|$|R
50|$|The Necropolis Chapel {{was built}} by the {{architect}} Henry Langley in 1872 in the Gothic Revival style. It is located at 200 Winchester Street, Toronto, in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood {{at the edge of}} the Don Valley. Its entrance is marked by a pointed barrel vault that leads to the central part of the chapel. The latter has a simple gable roof, whose steep, pitched gables raise high to a sharp ridge. The square tower is placed on the east side of the plan, giving the edifice a picturesque, asymmetrical appearance that is tightly linked to the Gothic. This particularity shifts the center of gravity of the building, giving the it an ascending diagonal axis. The steep slope of the roof along with the placement and configuration of the tower give the building a jagged, pointed contour. The dominant material used is yellow brick, with a stone entrance vault. The roof is covered with two different patterns of slates and is unique for its multicolored appearance. There are a number of High Gothic Revival style elements, which include rich wrought iron on fences, detailed trefoils carved on the stone facade, ridge cresting on the tower roof and finials. White sawn wood ornament decorates the eaves of the porch and the <b>barge-boards</b> of the steep gables of the main gate and the caretakerâs house. Kept almost intact over time, the Necropolis Chapel fits perfectly into its surrounding context, which is the heritage conservation district Cabbagetown.|$|R
