The latest edition of Ellenberg's indicator values applies a 9-point scale for each of six gradients: soil acidity, soil productivity or fertility, soil humidity, soil salinity, climatic continentality and light availability. Indicator values have also been published for Switzerland, Great Britain, and some other floras.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concentrations of fluorides in the environment, several <b>bioindication</b> methods for assessing the impact of fluoride pollution on living organisms have been developed {{in the last few}} decades. Studies of the exposure and impact of fluorides on mammals (primarily ungulates) are performed either as different methods of accumulative <b>bioindication</b> (i. e. determination of fluoride levels in bones, e. g. mandibles) and/or as methods of response <b>bioindication</b> (e. g. macroscopic assessment of the presence and severity of dental fluorosis as a specific morphologic change, which is the consequence of fluorides affecting the formation and development of the enamelin the time of tooth formation). Suitability of ungulates (particularly roe deer) mandibles as a perfect biomonitoring tool for assessingthe fluoride pollution has often been confirmed by the determination of strong positive correlations between fluoride concentrations in the environment and: (i) fluoride levels in mandibles of red/roe deer; (ii) severity of dental fluorosis in both deer species. A high potential of roe deer mandibles for <b>bioindication</b> purposes is stimulated by the fact that lower jaws of ungulates are often (in Slovenia they even must be) systematically collected with the purpose of cognitive management and control. Therefore, huge numbers of mandibles are available in Europe, equipped with all the needed individual (e. g. age, sex, health status) and geographical data (culling location). This enables large-scale (even national-wide, as seen in the case of Slovenia), but nevertheless spatially accurate environmental biomonitoring of fluoride pollution, in a reliable and cost effective way.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the performance of some indices and community attributes frequently used to assess river quality and test the role of macroinvertebrate taxa richness as element of <b>bioindication</b> in several coastal tropical streams of western Esmeraldas (Ecuador). In addition, a macroinvertebrate taxon list of this region was provided for the first time. Thirteen sampled points distributed across nine streams were selected for this study and nineteen parameters and attributes of <b>bioindication</b> were tested. The differences between nonimpact and impact places were evaluated mainly using one-way analysis of variance. Jackknife 2 and Clench were used to estimate the regional richness {{and the quality of}} the inventory, respectively. Seventy taxa (principally genus and family) of the main groups of macroinvertebrates were collected. Measured richness and family richness were the best metric followed by Biological Monitoring Working Party/Colombia (BMWP/Col), Odonata richness, Shannon-Weiner, and EPT richness (Ephemeroptera[*]+[*]Plecoptera[*]+[*]Trichoptera) indices. Only a slight right trend (Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Chironomidae attributes) or incorrect performances (Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) and % EPT) were showed by frequently used metrics.

40|$|Ellenberg's {{indicator}} {{values have}} been suggested as useful method of estimating site conditions using plants. We examined whether Ellenberg's R values are suitable for indicating soil reaction and if calibration to physical pH measurements can improve <b>bioindication</b> in oligotrophic and mesotrophic submontane broad-leaved forests in Slovakia. Vegetation releves and pH-H 2 O and pH-CaCl 2 soil reaction were recorded for this purpose. Ellenberg's R values (R_e) were compared to Jurko's indicator values (R_j) {{and a set of}} species R values and tolerances (T), which were calibrated with physical pH data using the weighted averaging (R_w, T_w) and Huisman-Olff-Fresco modeling (R_h, T_h). Original R_e values were then recalibrated with measured pH data to establish new, adjusted set of scores (R_c, T_c) at Ellenberg's scale. The Re values are significantly correlated with the other R values, and they demonstrate similar frequency distribution to R_j and R_w values for the studied species pool. The frequency distribution becomes similar across all the R values when indifferent species were excluded. The performance of all the indicator values in terms of <b>bioindication</b> was tested. Releve means of the R values were regressed on the field pH measurements. The performance of <b>bioindication</b> varied from 36 % to 49 % of the explained variance for pH-CaCl 2, with the R e and R c values yielding 46 % and 49 % respectively. The <b>bioindication</b> slightly improved for all calibrated methods (R_w, R_h and R_c) when species were weighed inversely with their tolerances - the performance varied from 42 % to 51 %, and the R c values performed most effectively. We concluded that Ellenberg's R values represent a powerful system for bioindicating soil acidity when compared to the other alternatives, with pH-CaCl 2 showing better results than pH-H 2 O.

Four trophic status indices were compared with the actual chemical data and the annual averages of total phosphorus concentrations. Diatom assemblages on different substrates indicated significantly different trophic status for the site. Indicators based on epiphytic diatoms from young reed stalks correlated strongly with the concentrations of total phosphorus, so that reeds {{were found to be}} the most suitable substrate for <b>bioindication.</b> <b>Bioindication</b> based on three of the four indices studied (Rott’s TDIA, Schönfelder’s TS, van Dam’s TDW) was positively correlated with actual phosphorus concentration at each site.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} and nutritional characteristics are frequently assessed using plant species and community <b>bioindication,</b> e. g., the Ellenberg system of species indicator values. This method, based on complete inventories of plant species present in plots, is time-consuming, which could prevent its general use for forest or other natural land management. Our {{aim was to}} determine the impact of a reduction in the time spent to carry out a floristic inventory on the quality of soil characteristic assessment using plant <b>bioindication.</b> We compared the measurements of soil pH-H 2 O (pH), organic carbon to total nitrogen ratio (C:N) and base saturation (BS) in the 0 - 5 cm soil layer of 470 plots with the same variables estimated from floristic inventories of increasing duration, using plant indicator values (IV) from the EcoPlant database. The performance of predictions was evaluated by the square of the linear correlation coefficient between measured and predicted values (R- 2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of predictions. The number rather than the percentage of total plot species used for the estimations was determinant for the prediction of soil pH quality. Performance of <b>bioindication</b> of pH, BS and C:N reached the maximum R- 2 using the first 20 - 25 species recorded per plot, corresponding to a 14 -min-long floristic inventory in comparison to a mean of 28 min spent to carry out a complete floristic inventory. A precision of prediction of 80 % of the maximal precision was obtained after 4 - 5 min (6 - 12 inventoried species) for the three studied variables. These results are independent of the nutritional capability of the soils and were similar at the national and local scales. In order to estimate soil nutritional resources by plant <b>bioindication,</b> it is feasible to significantly reduce the time spent on floristic inventories and, thus, their cost. This is especially useful when the goal is to map the soil quality for decision-making in forest management...|$|E

40|$|Arthropods have {{received}} considerable attention as biological indicators (bioindicators) {{as they are}} widespread, and easy to sample. Due to a shortage of trained taxonomists and limited resources, many taxa cannot be used, however. In this thesis, I use carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), which are taxonomically well known, to compare three approaches of <b>bioindication,</b> using a traditional taxonomic approach as the baseline. The taxonomic approach distinguished coarse differences in forest canopy removal, as did a recognizable taxonomic unit approach. The latter failed to provide {{the same level of}} precision based on diversity data, however. A functional trait approach yielded non-significant results, but demonstrated potential to provide more in-depth information, albeit at a considerable additional investment of time.

40|$|Deposition of {{reactive}} nitrogen {{derived from}} intensive agriculture and industrial processes {{is a major}} threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services around the world; however our knowledge of the impacts of nitrogen is restricted to a very limited range of organisms. Here we examine the response of groups of microfauna (testate amoebae), mesofauna (enchytraeid worms) and plants to ammonium nitrate application in the Ruabon heathland long-term experiment. Plant data showed significant differences between treatments, particularly characterised by a loss of bryophytes in nitrogen-treated plots, by contrast enchytraeids showed a non-significant increase in abundance in response to treatment.

(Czech Republic), dwarf pine was introduced {{at the end of}} the 19 th century by humans into alpine communities. To analyse the influence of non-native woody species on species diversity, vegetation composition and the ecological <b>bioindication</b> of invaded alpine communities, three habitats (non-invaded alpine grasslands, gaps of alpine grasslands within dwarf pine stands and closed dwarf pine stands) were compared at two localities (Keprník, Tabulové kameny) using the space-for-time substitution approach. Plant species composition was assessed by means of phytosociological relevés, and <b>bioindication</b> by means of Ellenberg indicator values. At both localities, both beta and gamma diversity were lower, and species composition more uniform in dwarf pine plantations in contrast to the gaps within and alpine grasslands outside of dwarf pine stands. At Keprník, alpha diversity was lower in the dwarf-pine plantation than outside of it, while at Tabulové kameny no significant differences were found. This is probably due to the somewhat different spatial structure of the dwarf pine stands and the different timing of dwarf pine introduction at these localities. <b>Bioindication</b> showed that dwarf-pine stands were drier, more shaded and had a higher soil fertility than alpine grasslands. Dwarf pine colonisation of alpine grasslands causes the extinction of many endangered plant species, complicating conservation goals.
