2500|$|Peter May won the toss for {{the third}} time in a row and again decided to bat {{regardless}} of the ill-omens as the wicket looked easy going and was expected to take spin. Stonewaller Trevor Bailey who had been promoted in the batting order from 6 to 3, then 2 and was now asked to go in first with Arthur Milton. They were both out for 8 to Ian Meckiff and Alan Davidson and England were 23/2. Once again the England opening partnership had failed and Bailey, a considerable stumbling block for the bowlers down the order had been sacrificed at the top of the order. Tom Graveney (33) and Peter May (42) restored the innings as the fast bowlers found little swing, but Benaud kept them on for over an hour and May edged a ball past Neil Harvey at slip. With the shine taken off the new ball the pacemen were taken off and the spinners brought on, Richie Benaud getting turn almost at once and appealed for leg before wicket against May, but it was turned down. Keith Slater's first Test wicket was May after he had been hit for 4 and 2 and the captain looked in fine form, Slater getting the ball to hang back and it was hit where Benaud had placed Ken Mackay in the covers a few balls before, where he took a fine catch. Graveney edged Benaud just past Harvey which he managed to take for another stunning catch and Dexter was l.b.w. offering no stroke to Slater (2/40) and England were 98/5. The debutant Roy Swetman joined Colin Cowdrey to a great ovation from the 50,000 in the stands and survived a difficult catch to Harvey and another to Colin McDonald who had replaced [...] "The Claw" [...] at leg-slip, both chances off Benaud. The young wicket-keeper used his feet to go down the wicket, so when he padded up he could not given l.b.w., and began to make some runs with Cowdrey stroking the ball through the covers. After tea the vice-captain (34) gave Harvey another catch off Benaud, but Swetman and Tony Lock saw England safely to stumps with 190/6. The next day's start was delayed to past tea because of rain, made worse by the inadequate covering of the infield. When they finally resumed Benaud was spinning the ball more than ever and declined to take the new <b>ball.</b> <b>Lock</b> was out l.b.w. to Mackay, who ended Swetman's fine innings of 41 with another great catch off Benaud. Harvey also accounted for Jim Laker when he knocked the ball up into the air on the first attempt and ran five yards to catch it. Seeing the end was near Fred Trueman scattered the close fielders with a few powerful strokes and heaved the ball into the stands, but he was caught by Burke off Benaud to give the Australian captain 5/83 and England were out for 219. The first day was watched by John Mills and Trevor Howard, who were acting in Australia at the time. Howard compared the England collapse to the final act of the play he was in, saying [...] "Hamlet was never like this".|$|E

5000|$|The quick-connector {{fittings}} {{which allow}} hoses {{to be easily}} attached and removed from the ports come in two mechanical varieties, namely pin lock and <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> which are not interchangeable. Historically, pin lock kegs were used primarily by the Coca-Cola company, while <b>ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs were used primarily by Pepsi. On a pin lock keg, there are metal posts (pins) extending horizontally from around the port. When the connector is attached, these pins hold it in place. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has two pins, while the [...] "liquid out" [...] has three, {{making it impossible to}} accidentally switch the gas-versus-liquid hoses (which would harmlessly result in carbon dioxide bubbling up through the drink, while gas but no drink would be dispensed). <b>Ball</b> <b>lock</b> kegs have ridges in the ports, which are gripped by small metal balls in the connectors. Both types of kegs are fairly easy to find, though ball-lock seem to be more common.As a result of demand from home brewers, second hand kegs are becoming progressively more scarce and in recent years brand new kegs have come onto the market, manufactured in China to the same specifications.|$|E
5000|$|Multiball: To start multiball, {{light the}} lock ball shot by hitting the [...] "Lite" [...] and [...] "Lock" [...] targets and then {{successfully}} shooting {{the ball in}} the <b>ball</b> <b>lock,</b> also called the [...] "No Way Out" [...] Hazard; doing this 3 times will start multiball.|$|E

5000|$|All hits of {{the upper}} playfield pop bumpers {{increase}} the base [...] "Borg Jackpot" [...] amount awarded in Borg Multiball mode. To start the mode, and thus the battle with the Borg ship, the player needs to <b>lock</b> three <b>balls.</b> <b>Locks</b> are lit by shooting the right orbit (or selecting [...] "Light Lock" [...] on {{the start of a}} ball). Then shoot the right orbit again (or â€” if either or both are lit â€” the Delta Quadrant ramp or the Neutral Zone) to <b>lock</b> a <b>ball.</b> After <b>locking</b> the third <b>ball,</b> Multiball will start with one ball placed into the left cannon and the [...] "Start Mission" [...] hole lit. Shooting the hole damages the Borg Ship and scores the Jackpot. A second hit will score a Double Jackpot, and a third hit destroys the Borg ship and scores the Triple Jackpot.

Hitting right eject when lit for lock starts multiball. During multiball, completing HARLEY and DAVIDSON scores 5 million, and lights the orbit shots for 1 million each {{for the rest}} of multiball. The jackpot is not related to multiball. After the first multiball, the eject hole resets to 10,000 (no lights).|$|E
50|$|Additionally three lights labeled U, S and A are lit when a ball {{rolls over}} them. They are worth 2,000 points each.

There are three pop bumpers that are worth 100 points when unlit and 1,000 points when lit.
