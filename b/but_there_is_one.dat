5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although {{as many as four}} queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and will drop to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
25|$|The forest tent {{caterpillar}} moth is nocturnal, taking flight soon after nightfall {{and returning to}} rest before dawn. It is not known how far an egg-laden female can fly, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> credible report of this species flying hundreds of kilometres {{with the assistance of}} an unusually strong wind.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{caterpillars}} {{and adults}} are active during the daytime; however, most species of this taxa are night-flying. Moths are attracted by light, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> species, Borearctia menetriesii, that never {{comes to the}} light. Basking to accelerate digestion is common in the larval stages, and social behaviour may range from solitary to gregarious. Like most Lepidoptera, larvae produce a small silk pad before each moult, in which their prolegs are engaged.|$|E

25|$|The Beattie Park Mound Group {{is located}} in {{downtown}} Rockford, Illinois' Beattie Park. It consists of three conical mounds (one outside the park boundaries), an effigy mound {{in the shape of}} a turtle, and a linear mound. Beattie Park is north of Park Avenue and south of Mound Avenue, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> mound remnant in front of the house at 509 Indian Terrace. On its west, the park is bounded by Main Street and to its east lies the Rock River. Mounds are the most visible evidence of cultures that lived for hundreds of years in the mix of biomes in northern Illinois.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a theory}} that the younger lady is Meritaten, {{daughter}} of Akhenaten and Nefertiti, and wife of Smenkhare, based on {{a study of the}} alleles inherited by Tutankhamun. The theory goes that Meritaten married Smenkhare, believed to be her uncle. Thereby making Tutankhamun a maternal grandson of Akhenaten. The theory holds weight as inbreeding makes it harder to distinguish the generations, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> problem with this theory. Meritaten must be a mitochondrial descendant of Queen Tiye, or her mother Thuya, as the younger lady's mitochondrial DNA fits with her being Tiye's daughter. Nefertiti's lineage is nowhere specified, and if Meritaten is the younger lady, Nefertiti must be a mitochondrial relation of Thuya.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

Ealdorman Æthelweard was a {{descendant}} of King Æthelred I, grandfather of an Archbishop of Canterbury, and patron of Ælfric of Eynsham, the one major English writer of the period who rejected the style. Æthelweard's Chronicon was a translation into hermeneutic Latin of a lost version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. His style is regarded by historians as eccentric and at times unintelligible. In the view of Angelika Lutz his prose was influenced by Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry as well as Latin and Greek sources: [...] "That it was later viewed as a failure may be attributed both to his limited command of Latin grammar and his extreme stylistic pretensions." ...|$|E

[...] Marcotte noted that the [...] "Resistance" [...] is lead, for the audience, by two women in Johnson and Simmons, reflecting the 2017 Women's March, and also that Hydra gained power using fear of Inhumans just as [...] "Trump was able to ride a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment into power". She also highlighted Simmons' warning to a young boy that all Hydra agent are Nazis, calling this a warning [...] "to the audience, reminding them not to forget exactly what kind of authoritarian monster has been put in the White House." [...] Michal Schick of Hypable noted that the political commentary had been running throughout the season, with Nadeer and the Humans First movement, but that [...] "in the face of murderous demons with combustable craniums and body-swapping LMD’s, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. largely kept the commentary in the background. That changed—drastically—as the show entered" [...] the final pod. Schick highlighted the fact that [...] "for all of the clear allusions to Trump’s America, the president himself remains unparodied. The mistress of the Framework’s perversities is Aida, as Madame Hydra, and it’s hard to imagine a more different figure from Trump ... By omitting this easiest and most obvious point of satire, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. broadens its message beyond straight contemporary commentary. It is easy (and desperately tempting) to place blame all of our ills and evils on a current administration, and easy to pin all the ills of the Framework on Aida. But an element of individual responsibility burns through, both in our own lives and in this fiction." ...|$|E

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E
