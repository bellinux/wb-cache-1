5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> caused by trivial rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, No. 7 Wing SAAF {{shot down}} another 16 Italian SM.82s. The {{ease with which}} they caught fire led the Allied pilots to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> carrying precious fuel cargoes. Among those units involved were No. 54 Squadron SAAF, No. 2 Squadron SAAF. Another source gives Axis losses as 10 destroyed and four crash landed.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated their strength, causing the Germans to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> faced with a far greater force. Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, convinced the Germans another landing had taken place there.|$|E

5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole {{by means of an}} {{extended}} drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Kira learns of his origins from ZAFT {{commander}} Rau Le Creuset {{during these}} battles. Kira is the Ultimate Coordinator; his fetus was artificially developed outside his mother's womb and his genetic enhancements {{were intended to}} be superior to all other Coordinators. Kira was the only fetus to survive the process. He was born as the twin brother of his comrade Cagalli Yula Athha but does not learn about this relationship until {{the latter half of}} the series. Kira was adopted by his aunt Caridad and uncle Haruma Yamato and was led to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> his biological parents. Despite being shocked by his origins as the Ultimate Coordinator, Kira continues to fight alongside the Archangel until their opponents, including Rau, have been defeated and the war comes to end.|$|E
50|$|Geokichla erythronota is {{very similar}} in {{morphology}} to the chestnut-backed thrush (Geokichla dohertyi) and some authorities <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> conspecific. Others <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> distinct and that in fact there are un-named races of G. erythronota that are isolated on the islands of Taliabu, Buton and Kabaena, the status of which need to be evaluated.|$|R

5000|$|Leader: Paxos {{requires}} a distinguished Proposer (called the leader) to make progress. Many processes may <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> leaders, but the protocol only guarantees progress {{if one of}} them is eventually chosen. If two processes <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> leaders, <b>they</b> may stall the protocol by continuously proposing conflicting updates. However, the safety properties are still preserved in that case.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli became deeply {{involved}} in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the Book of Common Prayer Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper {{should be forced to}} wear a surplice. Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted in the writing of a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum in 1552.|$|E
5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil paint in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, the mural inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv).|$|E

5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these ideas are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} team sent {{north on}} the evening of July 5 reported seeing tanks south of Osan. The team attempted to destroy a tank it spotted in the village of Sojong but was unsuccessful; it suffered one killed (Private Kenneth R. Shadrick) and was forced to return to Pyongtaek. Shortly after, several survivors from Task Force Smith arrived at 1st Battalion's command post telling stories of their defeat at Osan, but Ayres did not <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> accurate. Brigadier General George B. Barth, acting division artillery commander for the 24th Infantry Division, stopped by the command post and ordered that the battalion hold only as long as it could, and not to risk being flanked or surrounded, wary of the defeat at Osan. Barth then moved to the 34th Infantry Regiment's command where he ordered regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless to consolidate the Regiment at Cheonan to the south. Lovless subsequently moved 3rd Battalion south, without having ever engaged the enemy. Barth believed the 34th Infantry {{would not be able to}} defend Pyongtaek as long as the 21st Infantry defended Osan. From 3rd Battalion, L Company was detached and ordered to hold south of Pyongtaek to cover the 1st Battalion when it retreated. This order was not carried out, and L Company left for Chonan.|$|E

25|$|Jake Esterline {{claimed that}} {{a box of}} cigars, which was treated with chemicals, was also {{considered}} in the plot to assassinate Castro. The scheme was that the chemical would produce temporary personality disorientation, and having Castro smoke one before a speech would result in Castro making a “public spectacle of himself”. Esterline later admitted that even though he couldn't exactly recall what the cigars were intended to do, he didn’t <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lethal.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus {{began to}} {{formulate}} his critique {{in the early}} 1960s {{while he was a}} professor at MIT, then a hotbed of artificial intelligence research.

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that the presence of violent objects such as a gun can trigger aggression. In a study done by Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony Le Page (1967), college students were made angry and then left {{in the presence of a}} gun or badminton racket. They were then led to <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> delivering electric shocks to another student, as in the Milgram experiment. Those who had been in the presence of the gun administered more shocks. It is possible that a violence-related stimulus increases the likelihood of aggressive cognitions by activating the semantic network.|$|E
