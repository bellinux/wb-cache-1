5|$|A new {{paper on}} the cranio-dental {{morphology}} of Allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off {{to allow for the}} widened gape.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E

But after gaining the Second Level with the Sound Four's aid, Sasuke began training under Orochimaru and manages to isolate the level two transformation to specific parts of his body within a few years' time before Itachi removed the Cursed Seal from him. Anko also had hers removed during the Fourth Great Ninja War when Sasuke transferred the consciousness within it into a new body.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E
5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel forages undercover, {{to avoid}} being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for {{pursuing}} its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. When food is abundant, {{only a small portion}} of the prey is eaten, usually the brain. The average daily food intake is , which is equivalent to 30–35% of the animal's body weight.|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> show their dominance.|$|E
5|$|This spotted cat {{most closely}} resembles the leopard physically, {{although}} it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer {{to those of the}} tiger. While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains. Its preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts. The jaguar is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator {{at the top of the}} food chain (an apex predator). It is a keystone species, playing an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts. The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the skull of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> the brain.|$|E

5|$|Sue Hendrickson, amateur paleontologist, {{discovered}} {{the most complete}} (approximately 85%) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith, South Dakota, on August 12, 1990. This Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Sue in her honor, was {{the object of a}} legal battle over its ownership. In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $7.6 million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date. From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History preparators spent over 25,000 man-hours taking the rock off each of the bones. The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made. The finished mount was then taken apart, and along with the bones, shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly. The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17, 2000 in the great hall (Stanley Field Hall) at the Field Museum of Natural History. A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28, the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived. Early speculation that Sue may have died from a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> {{the back of the head}} was not confirmed. Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton, no bite marks were found. Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post-mortem trampling. Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat, ultimately leading Sue to starve because she could no longer swallow food. This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth-edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern-day birds that contract the same parasite.|$|E
25|$|Typically, mainly men {{and boys}} drop by to convey their congratulations, to have a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> eat, to share words of Torah, and to sing songs {{welcoming}} the newborn and thanking God for the birth.

25|$|Having {{made contact}} with the prey, hunting Salticidae {{administer}} a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> inject rapidly acting venom that gives the victim little time to react. In this respect, they resemble the Mimetidae and Thomisidae, families that ambush prey that often are larger than the predator, and they do so without securing the victim with silk; they accordingly must immobilise it immediately and their venom is adapted accordingly.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} centipedes can be {{hazardous}} to humans {{because of their}} bite. Although a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> an adult human is usually very painful and may cause severe swelling, chills, fever, and weakness, {{it is unlikely to}} be fatal. Bites can be dangerous to small children and those with allergies to bee stings. The venomous bite of larger centipedes can induce anaphylactic shock in such people. Smaller centipedes are generally incapable of piercing human skin.|$|E
25|$|Snakebite as a surreptitious form {{of murder}} has been {{featured}} in stories such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Speckled Band, but actual occurrences are virtually unheard of, {{with only a few}} documented cases. It has been suggested that Boris III of Bulgaria, who was allied to Nazi Germany during World War II, may have been killed with snake venom, although there is no definitive evidence. At least one attempted suicide by snakebite has been documented in medical literature involving a puff adder <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> the hand.|$|E

25|$|Most spiders do {{not cause}} bites {{that are of}} importance. For a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> be significant, {{substantial}} envenomation is required. Bites from the widow spiders involve a neurotoxic venom which produces a condition known as latrodectism. Symptoms may include: pain which {{may be at the}} bite or involve the chest and abdomen, sweating, muscle cramps and vomiting among others. Bites from the recluse spiders cause the condition loxoscelism, in which local necrosis of the surrounding skin and widespread breakdown of red blood cells may occur. Headaches, vomiting and a mild fever may also occur. Other spiders that can cause significant bites include: the Australian funnel-web spider and South American wandering spider.|$|E
25|$|It {{is not an}} {{easy task}} {{determining}} whether or not a bite by any species of snake is life-threatening. A bite by a North American copperhead on the ankle is usually a moderate injury to a healthy adult, but a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> a child's abdomen or face by the same snake may be fatal. The outcome of all snakebites depends on a multitude of factors: the size, physical condition, and temperature of the snake, the age and physical condition of the person, the area and tissue bitten (e.g., foot, torso, vein or muscle), the amount of venom injected, the time it takes for the person to find treatment, and finally the quality of that treatment.|$|E
