5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the <b>bag.</b> <b>At</b> least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

500|$|A {{translation}} of Plutarch's Life of Caesar by John Langhorne {{and his brother}} William published in 1770 was the first source {{to use the word}} [...] "carpet" [...] to describe the material used by Cleopatra's servant to sneak her into the palace. [...] Although the original meaning used by Plutarch was more akin to what is today known as a duffel <b>bag,</b> <b>at</b> the time of Langhorne's translation a carpet meant a type of [...] "thick fabric", not an actual rug. [...] But by the nineteenth century, semantic change led to the word taking on a different meaning. [...] The legend of Cleopatra hiding in a rug, although historically inaccurate, became the most popular image, with Gérôme {{one of the first to}} popularize it in modern art.|$|E
500|$|It {{was unknown}} how the remains had settled at the location; the body might either {{have been placed}} at the beach or have drifted in the water from another location, some presuming from as far as Canada. The United States Coast Guard entered the {{investigation}} and analyzed the currents {{of the water in}} the area to estimate where the bag containing the remains could have originated from. Dive teams were also used around the time the body was discovered. As of mid-July and August, authorities believed the victim had been placed at the scene, rather than washing onto Deer Island from another location, because the body was not in an advanced enough stage of decomposition. The beach is near a waste-water treatment plant. One of the investigators thought there was a possibility that the disposal had been performed by an employee of the nearby water treatment plant. Since the area has been regarded as a [...] "busy" [...] area for both workers and the public, it was also possible that the person who placed the <b>bag</b> <b>at</b> the scene did so overnight, to avoid being seen.|$|E
500|$|On August 4, 2007, at 2:45a.m., she {{discovered}} {{the money that}} became part of a political scandal in the electoral campaign of President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. It was {{in the possession of}} a Key Biscayne, Florida, associate of President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez. The carrier, Guido Antonini Wilson (who is referred to in the press by both Antonini and Wilson and who is sometimes referred to by the nicknames [...] "El Gordo" [...] or [...] "The Fat Man"), is an interpreter and was part of a delegation of executives that traveled to Argentina in advance of Chávez' energy deal signing. He opened the <b>bag</b> <b>at</b> the insistence of Telpuk, who noticed the six dense and perfectly rectangular blocks in the luggage scans. At first, Wilson had explained the items as books and papers. When forced to open it, he began to stammer and show signs of nervousness, and he said the suitcase only contained about $60,000. The blocks turned out to be US$790,550. The delegation, which arrived on a Cessna Citation jet from Caracas, Venezuela, chartered by Energía Argentina, SA, carried five Venezuelans and three Argentines who represented their respective governments' energy companies. In a country known for its corruption, Telpuk did not have an interest in a bribe although she felt Wilson may have expected her to be willing to take one. Instead of pursuing a bribe, she reported the finding.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, at the Simpson family's home, Patty {{comes out}} of the closet as a lesbian, saying that she is in love with a pro golfer named Veronica and asking Homer to perform the ceremony. This makes Marge {{extremely}} uncomfortable, even though the evidence was always there. While Homer accepts Patty's sexuality, a furious Marge reveals that she doesn't want her with Veronica and still insists she marries a man. Patty gets angry and points out that Marge acts very [...] "liberal" [...] about the issue but cannot accept her sister's sexuality, and says she hopes to see Marge at her wedding. Before the wedding, Marge accidentally discovers Veronica is actually a man, ironically while Veronica is singing Aerosmith's [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] while shaving, and because Veronica left the toilet seat up after leaving. Happily she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. But Marge is so moved by Patty's heartfelt declaration of love for Veronica during the ceremony that she reveals Veronica's Adam's apple. [...] "Veronica" [...] explains that as the straight Leslie Robin Swisher, he posed as a woman to get onto the LPGA golf tour. He then asks Patty if she'll still marry him, but she declines. Afterwards, Marge reconciles with Patty after telling her that she's learned a lesson and has accepted the fact that Patty's a lesbian; they hug after reconciling. Patty and her other sister, Selma, then go to leave a <b>bag</b> <b>at</b> the airport unattended, as a way to meet security personnel they can date.|$|E
