25|$|Gandhara existed {{since the}} time of the Rigveda (c. 1500–1200 BC), as well as the Zoroastrian Avesta, which {{mentions}} it as Vaēkərəta, the sixth most <b>beautiful</b> <b>place</b> on earth, created by Ahura Mazda. Gandhara was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC. Conquered by Alexander the Great in 327 BC, it subsequently became part of the Maurya Empire. As a center of Bactrian Zoroastrianism, Animism, and later, Greco-Buddhism, and famed for its local tradition of Gandhara Art (Greco-Buddhist), Gandhara attained its height from the 1st century to the 5th century under the Kushan Empire. The Persian term Shahi is used by history writer Al-Biruni to refer to the ruling dynasty that took over from the Kabul Shahi and ruled the region during the period prior to Muslim conquests of the 10th and 11th centuries. After it was conquered by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1001AD, the name Gandhara disappeared. During the Muslim period, the area was administered from Lahore or from Kabul. During Mughal times, it was an independent district which included the Kabul province.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Kings and Queens" [...] was {{directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins. It was shot the weekend of October 11–13, 2009 in Los Angeles {{over the course of}} several nights, filming some of the city's most iconic landmarks. Leto explained, [...] "I think this city is a <b>beautiful</b> <b>place</b> at night, and we have these empty streets, and it's kind of a haunting, forgotten landscape... very serene." [...] The crew recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers to appear in the video. On October 11, 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists. Leto got the inspiration behind the video after some of his friends did Critical Mass and Crank Mob, [...] "groups of riders that get together and kind of reclaim public spaces and take over the streets in several cities around America," [...] and he thought that it would be the perfect backdrop for the music video of [...] "Kings and Queens".|$|E

500|$|Among {{his more}} curious and {{enduring}} innovations was the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. [...] The winter months, between the college bowl {{season and the}} start of Major League Baseball's spring training, was a slow time for sports journalism. [...] At the time, winter team sports like basketball and ice hockey were regional niche sports, and there was little to write about. [...] Laguerre had instituted an annual February issue titled [...] "Fun in the Sun", where he sent his staff to an exotic locale to write about and photograph it for his readers. [...] In 1964, he asked Jule Campbell, then a fashion reporter for Sports Illustrated, to [...] "go to some <b>beautiful</b> <b>place</b> and put a pretty girl on the cover" [...] of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue. That year's issue featured only five pages of girls in swimsuits, and still predominantly featured travel writing, including articles about snorkeling and fish-watching. [...] With the help of that year's [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issue, 1964 became the first year that Sports Illustrated would turn a profit. [...] Though originally only planned as a one-off event, Laguerre was convinced by Sports Illustrated art director Dick Gangel to bring back the swimsuits in 1965, only [...] "a lot sexier". [...] Laguerre once again assigned Jule Campbell to scout models and locations. [...] The 1965 issue contained an article entitled [...] "The Nudity Cult" [...] and de-emphasized the travelogue-like writing of previous [...] "Fun in the Sun" [...] issues from which it evolved. [...] Since then, the Swimsuit Issue has become the biggest selling issue of the magazine, and a major cross-over publication for the fashion and modeling worlds as well.|$|E
500|$|After the Dubai World Cup, California Chrome {{was shipped}} to Rae Guest's Newmarket stables in England {{to prepare for}} Royal Ascot week in June. The {{decision}} to go to England was made by Perry Martin, against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman. Martin explained, [...] "I was trying {{to think in terms of}} what's best for the horse. It was my decision to send him to Newmarket. It's a <b>beautiful</b> <b>place,</b> with trees and pastures for gallops...It's good for his mind. I know Art didn't take the decision well. But he'll be okay." [...] The horse's exercise rider in England, Robbie Mills, who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest, stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England. The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, with European jockey William Buick, who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai, tapped to ride. The day before the race, the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus. Guest stated, [...] "He's been X-rayed and there's no damage." [...] Martin wanted to run him in Chicago's Arlington Million in August, and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start. [...] Upon California Chrome's return to the US in early July, a veterinary radiograph revealed that he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal, effectively ending his four-year-old season. The veterinarians at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Kentucky explained, [...] "California Chrome's x-rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean. He has the early signs of bruising to the bottom of the cannon bones...The return rate for horses with this problem is very high...we found that recovery rate was 95% after giving time in the paddock to heal." ...|$|E
