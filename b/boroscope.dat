50|$|A {{borescope}} (occasionally {{called a}} <b>boroscope,</b> though this spelling is nonstandard) is an optical device {{consisting of a}} rigid or flexible tube with an eyepiece on one end, an objective lens on the other linked together by a relay optical system in between. The optical system in some instances is surrounded by optical fibers used for illumination of the remote object. An internal image of the illuminated object is formed by the objective lens and magnified by the eyepiece which presents it to the viewer's eye.|$|E

50|$|The Ventura Tool Company {{was formed}} in 1930 by Carl and Fritz Huntzinger,. Fritz Huntsinger {{purchased}} the existing Schwab-Lane Tool Company on Ventura Avenue in Ventura, California and changes {{its name to the}} Ventura Tool Company. The company repaired pumps and other machinery in the oilfield; it grew slowly through the Depression, but by 1937 had 50 employees and had become well established on the Avenue. Ventura Tool improved upon the existing <b>Boroscope,</b> an instrument used for inspecting cannon barrels. Huntsinger had a light added to the tip, and the instrument, which used a wide angle lens to relay images back to its operator, could be used for locating defects in petroleum pipes. This innovation revolutionized the inspection of petroleum pipes for defects. Ventura Tool gradually added new techniques for use in these inspections, and the company grew further. It acquired the Master Thread Company, Pressure Weld, Inc. and Tube Upset Corporation. The company specialized in pipe repair and began to develop a high speed drill in the 1940s.41 It also began manufacturing tools for the Air Force. The company would eventually change its emphasis and reincorporate as Vetco Offshore Industries, Inc. in the late 1950s.|$|E

40|$|There are two 850, 000 gallon Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) storage spheres used {{to support}} the Space Shuttle Program; one {{residing}} at Launch Pad A and the other at Launch Pad B. The LH 2 Sphere at Pad B has had a high boiloff rate since being brought into service in the 1960 's. The daily commodity loss {{was estimated to be}} approximately double that of the Pad A sphere, and well above the minimum required by the sphere's specification. Additionally, after being re-painted in the late 1990 's a "cold spot" appeared on the outer sphere which resulted in a poor paint bond, and mold formation. Thermography was used to characterize the area, and the boiloff rate was continually evaluated. All evidence suggested that the high boiloff rate was caused by an excessive heat leak into the inner sphere due to an insulation void in the annulus. Pad B was recently taken out of Space Shuttle program service which provided a unique opportunity to diagnose the sphere's poor performance. The sphere was drained and inerted, and then opened from the annular relief device on the top where a series of <b>boroscoping</b> operations were accomplished. <b>Boroscoping</b> revealed a large Perlite insulation void in the region of the sphere where the cold spot was apparent. Perlite was then trucked in and off-loaded into the annular void region until the annulus was full. The sphere has not yet been brought back into service...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} is a summary of information was received from Limitorque via facsimile: "On August 2, 2011, Flowserve-Limitorque was notified by Browns Ferry Nuclear (BFN) Generating Station that a Limitorque SMB- 5 T valve actuator (1 -MVOP- 074 - 052) had failed to run open automatically during {{the performance of a}} stroke test. Electrical maintenance personnel working at the valve reported an abnormal mechanical noise. Upon disassembly, {{it was found that the}} driving lugs on both the sliding clutch gear and the flexible clutch were seriously worn with a significant amount of deformation. Further investigation by BFN showed that the declutch mechanism would not allow full engagement of the drive lugs on the sliding clutch and flexible clutch. These lugs must be engaged for motor operation to take place. The declutch mechanism required adjustment to allow full drive lug engagement. "Following reassembly of the SMB- 5 T on 1 -MVOP- 074 - 052, an inspection was performed of the SMB- 5 T on valve 1 -MVOP- 074 - 066 which was manufactured and supplied to TVA at the same time. This actuator was functioning normally at the time of the inspection. Disassembly of the clutch compartment revealed evidence of deformation of the clutch drive lugs. To better evaluate the operation of the clutch components, the grease was cleaned out of the compartment and a <b>boroscope</b> used so that the action of the clutch could be seen. <b>Boroscope</b> examination of several declutching and re-clutching tests showed that the clutch lugs would not engage fully.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} of lead-rich {{pipes in}} historical organs {{in different parts}} of Europe has been investigated. The influence of the environment and the composition and microstructure of the pipe metal was studied. Pipe Corrosion was documented by visual inspection (<b>boroscope).</b> The corrosion attack and the composition and microstructure of the metal were characterized by OM, SEM, XRD, IC and FAAS. It is shown that the degree of corrosion of the pipes is correlated to the concentration of gaseous acetic and formic acid in the organ. The organic acids are emitted by the wood from which the wind system is built. It is also shown that pipe corrosion decreases with increasing tin content in the range 0 - 4 % (wt). Possible conservation strategies are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The current {{inspection}} {{technique for}} locating interstitial leaking in the Space Shuttle Main Engine nozzles is {{the application of}} a liquid leak check solution in the openings where the interstitials space between the tubing and the structural jacket vent out the aft end of the nozzle, while its cooling tubes are pressurized to 25 psig with Helium. When a leak is found, it is classified, and if the leak is severe enough the suspect tube is cut open so that a <b>boroscope</b> can be inserted to find the leak point. Since the <b>boroscope</b> can only cover a finite tube length and since it is impossible to identify which tube (to the right or left of the identified interstitial) is leaking, many extra and undesired repairs have been made to fix just one leak. In certain instances when the interstitials are interlinked by poor braze bonding, many interstitials will show indications of leaking from a single source. What is desired is a technique that can identify the leak source so that a single repair can be performed. Dr, Samuel Russell and James Walker, both with NASA/MSFC have developed a thermographic inspection system that addresses a single repair approach. They have teamed with Boeing/Rocketdyne to repackage the inspection processes to be suitable to address full scale Shuttle development and flight hardware and implement the process at NASA centers. The methods and results presented address the thermographic identification of interstitial leaks in the Space Shuttle Main Engine nozzles. A highly sensitive digital infrared camera (capable of detecting a delta temperature difference of 0. 025 C) is used to record the cooling effects associated with a leak source, such as a crack or pinhole, hidden within the nozzle wall by observing the inner hot wall surface as the nozzle is pressurized, These images are enhanced by digitally subtracting a thermal reference image taken before pressurization. The method provides a non-intrusive way of locating the tube that is leaking and the exact leak source position to within a very small axial distance. Many of the factors that influence the inspectability of the nozzle are addressed; including pressure rate, peak pressure, gas type, ambient temperature and surface preparation. Other applications for this thermographic inspection system are the Reinforced-Carbon-Carbon (RCC) leading edge of the Space Shuttle orbiter and braze joint integrity...|$|E
40|$|During this quarter, the Tidd Hot Gas Clean Up System {{completed}} a 691 -hour test run which began {{during the third}} quarter. Table 1 summarizes all test runs since initial operation. Following this test run the system was shut down and the filter opened for inspection and recandling. The system remained out of service during {{the remainder of the}} quarter. In addition to monitoring and evaluating the performance of the HGCU system during testing, engineering effort was devoted to posttest inspection of the APF (Advanced Particle Filter) and evaluation of the effects of totally spoiling the primary cyclone. In addition, the authors worked with Westinghouse in the selection of replacement candles that were installed during the fourth quarter.

40|$|A {{boroscopic}} {{imaging system}} is developed to measure sediment velocities within a highly concentrated sheet layer in open channel flows. A detailed literature review {{is presented to}} investigate previous attempts at sheet layer measurements, followed {{by a set of}} experiments to determine clean water flow characteristics in the open channel flume located in the DeFrees Hydraulics Laboratory. Experiments are carried out in the same flume under sediment-laden, sheet flow conditions to determine the steadiness of the flow as well as to verify velocities in the suspended sediment transport region with existing theories. Sediment velocities are captured in the highly concentrated sediment sheet for the same flow conditions using the new boroscopic imaging system. The <b>boroscope</b> is a minimally intrusive lens with a diameter that is only an order of magnitude larger than the natural sand being studied. Minimum Quadratic Difference techniques, along with several filtering techniques, are utilized to determine particle displacements. A rigorous investigation into calibrations is included in order to convert pixel displacements into physical velocities. Three separate metrics are investigated, all involving light intensity values. These metrics are examined from calibrations performed under fixed, moving and in-situ experimental conditions. The limitation of each calibration as well as a discussion of the effectiveness of the calibration techniques is included. Physical velocities within the sheet layer are determined using the in-situ variance of intensity calibration. A complete streamwise velocity profile spanning from the non-moving bed to the free stream is included which combines velocity data collected from both the boroscopic imaging technique as well as an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The joint profile seems fairly continuous but more attention needs to be focused on the velocities located along the interface of the sheet flow and suspended regions as well as possible reasons for differences between these experimental results and results published previously. Finally, future development is discussed including the further investigation into calibration techniques, the possibility of measuring sediment concentrations as well as water velocities and other possible uses for the boroscopic quantitative imaging technique...|$|E
40|$|Various {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) technologies {{are being developed}} to study the use of ceramic coatings on components in the hot-gas path of advanced low-emission gas-fired turbines. The types of ceramic coatings include thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) and environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). TBCs are under development for vanes, blades, and combustor liners to allow hotter gas-path temperatures, and EBCs are under development to reduce environmental damage to high-temperature components made of ceramic matrix composites. The NDE methods {{will be used to}} (a) provide data to assess the reliability of new coating application processes, (b) identify defective components that could cause unscheduled outages, (c) track growth rates of defects during component use in engines, and (d) allow rational judgment for replace/repair/re-use decisions regarding components. Advances in TBC application, both electron beam-physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) and air plasma spraying (APS), are allowing higher temperatures in the hot-gas path. However, as TBCs become ''prime reliant,'' their condition at scheduled or unscheduled outages must be known. NDE methods are under development to assess the condition of the TBC for pre-spall conditions. EB-PVD test samples with up to 70 thermal cycles have been studied by a newly developed method involving polarized laser back-scatter NDE. Results suggest a correlation between the NDE laser data and the TBC/bond-coat topography. This finding is important because several theories directed toward understanding the pre-spall condition suggest that the topography in the thermally grown oxide layer changes significantly {{as a function of the}} number of thermal cycles. Tests have also been conducted with this NDE method on APS TBCs. Results suggest that the pre-spall condition is detected for these coatings. One-sided, high-speed thermal imaging also has shown promise for NDE of APS coatings. Testing of SiC/SiC composites for combustor liners has demonstrated that environmental EBCs are required to reduce oxidation-induced recession rates. NDE technologies, primarily one-sided and through-thickness thermal imaging, are under development to detect delaminations and degradation of EBCs. Recent results have demonstrated that NDE thermal image data correctly detected pre-spall regions of a barium-strontium-alumino-silicate coating on melt-infiltrated SiC/SiC. The NDE data were verified with field test data from a combustor liner in a 4. 5 MW(e) natural-gas-fired turbine. The shape of the spalled EBC region and the growth of the spalled EBC region after various engine run times were correlated with <b>boroscope</b> image data from field tests. An effort has recently been started to address NDE development for oxide/oxide ceramic composites with an EBC. We will discuss the NDE methods under development for TBCs, recent NDE test results from thermally cycled TBCs, NDE results from EBCs on SiC/SiC, and the new effort directed toward oxide/oxide materials...|$|E
40|$|The Sampling Procedures and Venues Workgroup {{discussed}} the potential venues available and {{issues associated with}} obtaining measurements. Some of the issues included Incoming Air Quality, Sampling Locations, Probes and Sample Systems. The following is {{a summary of the}} discussion of the issues and venues. The influence of inlet air to the measurement of exhaust species, especially trace chemical species, must be considered. Analysis procedures for current engine exhaust emissions regulatory measurements require adjustments for air inlet humidity. As a matter of course in scientific investigations, it is recommended that "background" measurements for any species, particulate or chemical, be performed during inlet air flow before initiation of combustion, if possible, and during the engine test period as feasible and practical. For current regulatory measurements, this would be equivalent to setting the "zero" level for conventional gas analyzers. As a minimum, it is recommended that measurements of the humidity and particulates in the incoming air be taken at the start and end of each test run. Additional measurement points taken during the run are desirable if they can be practically obtained. It was felt that the presence of trace gases in the incoming air is not a significant problem. However, investigators should consider the ambient levels and influences of local air pollution for species of interest. Desired measurement locations depend upon the investigation requirements. A complete investigation of phenomenology of particulate formation and growth requires measurements at a number of locations both within the engine and in the exhaust field downstream of the nozzle exit plane. Desirable locations for both extractive and in situ measurements include: (1) Combustion Zone (Multiple axial locations); (2) Combustor Exit (Multiple radial locations for annular combustors); (3) Turbine Stage (Inlet and exit of the stage); (4) Exit Nozzle (Multiple axial locations downstream of the nozzle). Actual locations with potential for extractive or non-intrusive measurements depend upon the test article and test configuration. Committee members expressed the importance of making investigators aware of various ports that could allow access to various stages of the existing engines. Port locations are engine si) ecific and might allow extractive sampling or innovative hybrid optical-probe access. The turbine stage region was one the most desirable locations for obtaining samples and might be accessed through <b>boroscope</b> ports available in some engine designs. Discussions of probes and sampling systems quickly identified issues dependent on particular measurement quantities. With general consensus, the group recommends SAE procedures for measurements and data analyses of currently regulated exhaust species (CO 2, CO, THC, NO(x),) using conventional gas sampling techniques. Special procedures following sound scientific practices must be developed as required for species and/or measurement conditions not covered by SAE standards. Several issues arose concerning short lived radicals and highly reactive species. For conventional sampling, there are concerns of perturbing the sample during extraction, line losses, line-wall reactions, and chemical reactions during the sample transport to the analyzers. Sample lines coated with quartz. or other materials should be investigated for minimization of such effects. The group advocates the development of innovative probe techniques and non-intrusive optical techniques for measurement of short lived radicals and highly reactive species that cannot be sampled accurately otherwise. Two innovative probe concepts were discussed. One concept uses specially designed probes to transfer optical beams to and from a region of flow inaccessible by traditional ports or windows. The probe can perturb the flow field but must have a negligible impact on the region to be optically sampled. Such probes are referred to as hybrid probes and are under development at AEDC for measurement in the high pressure, high temperature of a combustor under development for power generation. The other concept consists of coupling an instrument directly to the probe. The probe would isolate a representative sample stream, freeze chemical reactions and direct the sample into the analyzer portion of the probe. Thus, the measurement would be performed in situ without sample line losses due either to reactions or binding at the wall surfaces. This concept was used to develop a fast, in situ, time-of-flight mass spectrometer measurement system for temporal quantification of NO in the IMPULSE facility at AEDC. Additional work is required in this area to determine the best probe and sampling technique for each species measurement requirement identified by the Trace Chemistry Working Group. A partial list of Venues was used as a baseline for discussion. Additional venues were added to the list and the list was broken out into the following categories: (1) Engines (a) Sea Level Test Stands (b) Altitude Chambers; (2) Annular Combustor Test Stands, (3) Sector Flametube Test Stands, (4) Fundamentals Rigs/Experiments...|$|E
