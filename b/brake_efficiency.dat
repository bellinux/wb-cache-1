50|$|Brake fade is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the {{friction}} surfaces and the drum {{can act as a}} lubricant and reduce <b>braking</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point <b>braking</b> <b>efficiency</b> returns. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater pedal pressure doesn't change it—in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it. Ultimately, this is what brake fade is, regardless of the mechanisms of its causes. Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|R

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional vehicles (CVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are touted to be a practically attractive measure to create an energy-wise and sustainable society. By employing electric energy {{as one of the}} traction energy sources, HEVs are able to reduce costly fuel consumption as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There are some commercially available HEVs in the market, employing various drive train configurations; however, their drive trains and control strategies are not optimally designed. In this thesis, parametric and power component stage based efficiency analysis methods are introduced to assess the overall drive train efficiencies for different HEV configurations. Hence, it is possible to find the key parameters that significantly affect the overall drive train efficiency. A mid-sized sport utility vehicle (SUV) is modeled in different hybrid configurations within the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) software. Simulations are carried out based on the modeled SUV over varied load demands.

Zero-dimensional modelling and simulation of the engine, turbo, inlet and exhaust manifolds and inlet air conditioner (intercooler/heater) are used to study the effect of compression ratio and exhaust turbine size on maximum mean effective pressure and efficiency. The extended Zeldovich mechanism is used to estimate NO- formation {{in order to determine}} operation limits. Detailed chemical kinetics is used to predict ignition timing. Simulation of the in-cylinder process gives a minimum gl-value of 2. 4 for natural gas, regardless of compression ratio. This is restricted by the NO formation for richer mixtures. Lower compression ratios allow higher inlet pressure and hence higher load, but it also reduces indicated efficiency. Given indicated mean effective pressure, IMEP and a fixed friction, FMEP the best <b>brake</b> <b>efficiency</b> was attained at compression ratios of 15 : 1 to 17 : 1, according to the simulations. Full system simulation using three different turbines, showed that the required inlet pressure could not be reached. At these low loads a high compression ratio enables lower inlet temperature.

40|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a {{throttled}} {{internal combustion}} engine is reduced at low load operation because of the engine work required to drop the intake manifold pressure. These throttling losses are experienced by all throttled engines operating at less than wide open throttle (WOT). By replacing the throttle plate with a suitable air motor, work can be recovered in an expansion process that reduces the induced air pressure to the same intake manifold pressure as the throttled engine. To maximize the benefits from coupling the air motor to the engine cycle, the air {{should be returned to}} a thermal state identical to that of the throttled case at some point prior to combustion. This might be achieved either: (i) prior to cylinder compression via regenerative heat transfer to the inducted air; or (ii) through cylinder compression at an increased compression ratio. The work generated by the Induction Air Motor (IAM) can be directly applied to the engine output thereby increasing the <b>brake</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the same indicated work.

40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} from lean burn natural gas engines {{may not always}} be as low as the potential permits, especially engines with open-loop lambda control. These engines can produce much higher emissions than a comparable diesel engine without exhaust gas aftertreatment. Even if the engine has closed-loop lambda control, emissions are often unacceptably high for future emission regulations. A three-way catalyst is, today, the best way to reduce hazardous emissions. The drawback is that the engine has to operate with a stoichiometric mixture and this leads to; higher heat losses, higher pumping work at low to medium loads, higher thermal stress on the engine and higher knock tendency (requiring lower compression ratio, and thus lower <b>brake</b> <b>efficiency).</b> One way to reduce these drawbacks is to dilute the stoichiometric mixture with EGR.
