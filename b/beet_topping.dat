40|$|The {{harvest and}} {{transport}} of sugar beet leaves during harvesting {{can be considered}} a current task in the area of sugar beet growing system development. A rotary sugar beet leaf cutting mechanism is used for achieving the significant increase in the harvester forward speed during harvest. This leads to intensive vibrations of the topping mechanism in the longitudinal vertical plane causing the decrease of harvest quality. Therefore, it is necessary to analytically determine the effect of kinematic and design parameters of the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>topping</b> mechanism front-mounted on the tractor and to discover the value of the amplitude of oscillations in the longitudinal vertical plane of its sugar <b>beet</b> <b>topping</b> mechanism. We have constructed a mathematical model of the estimated motion of this machine by means of dynamics equations in Lagrange II-kind form. A system consisting of two non-linear differential equations was obtained by developing the equivalent scheme of selected generalized coordinates and by performing the necessary mathematical transformations. This system describes the vibrations of the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>topping</b> mechanism in the longitudinal vertical plane. The optimal design and kinematic parameters of the sugar beet topper mechanism front-mounted on the tractor were determined by means of our own software and numerical solution of the differential equation system, which allows the reduction of mentioned vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{problem of the}} paper concerned verification whether applicable or known methods of post-harvesting evaluation of the roots of sugar beet may {{be applied to the}} assessment of the quality of work of technically varied new machinery for sugar beet har-vesting. Tests of machines of varied solutions of working units, in particular a topping unit, were carried out in order to accomplish the objective of the paper. Two self-propelled combine harvesters of Ropa euro-Tiger V 8 - 3 type and Kleine Beetliner Large and two sets for 2 -stage harvesting by M. A. C. E (Spain) and Amity (USA) companies were used in the study. Ropa euro-Tiger and Kleine Beetliner Large combine harvesters and M. A. C. E. set were equipped with a beet topper but of a varied topping system, whereas, only a defoliator was used in the set by Amity company. Field research of machines included assessment of the topping quality, losses caused by the broken tip of roots and damages of the lateral surface of roots. Research assumptions were assumed according to the method of the International In-stitute for Beet Research (I. I. R. B.). Moreover, assessment of the topping quality with the method of the Netherlands Institute of Sugar Beet Research (IRS) and the Institute of Agri-cultural Engineering of the Bonn University was carried out. Assessment of roots after defo-liation was carried out based on the Roller's classification (2010). Based on the research re-sults and analyses which were carried out, it was proved that the methods of measurement of the quality of beet harvesting machines operation are not fully useful for assessment of the introduced technical and technological changes. It mainly concerns the assessment of the roots topping. Thus, two modified methods of assessment of the quality of roots topping were suggested. They may be used both for machines equipped with a topping device and a defo-liator. Key words: harvesting sugar <b>beet,</b> <b>topping,</b> defoliation, quality of root...|$|E
