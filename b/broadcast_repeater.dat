50|$|Distributed {{transmission}} (DTx) {{is the use}} {{of several}} medium-power stations (usually digital) on the same frequency to cover a broadcast area, rather than one high-power station with any repeaters on a different frequency. digital television stations are technically capable of sharing a channel, however this is more difficult with the 8VSB modulation and invariable guard interval used in the ATSC standard than with COFDM used in the European and Australian DVB-T standard. A distributed transmission system would therefore have tight synchronisation requirements which require all transmitters to receive signal from one central source for broadcast at one GPS-synchronised time. DTS (or DTx) are not <b>broadcast</b> <b>repeaters</b> in the conventional sense as they cannot simply receive the signal of one main terrestrial broadcast transmitter for rebroadcast; to do so would introduce a retransmission delay which breaks the precise synchronisation required, causing interference between individual transmitters.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the FCC updated its {{broadcast}} translator regulations {{to allow a}} microwave relay {{to be used to}} feed programming transmissions to the translator station. KERA was therefore able to build its own translator in Wichita Falls, also on channel 24, as K24AD. The translator provided a better signal quality, and could operate throughout KERA's designated <b>broadcast</b> hours. The <b>repeater</b> moved to UHF channel 44 in 2005, at which point it changed its callsign to K44GS. In September 2009, the FCC granted a construction permit to North Texas Public Broadcasting to convert K44GS to digital transmissions; the permit remained valid until September 2012 (the current occupant of channel 24, K24HH-D, is unrelated to K24AD or the earlier KIDZ-TV).|$|R

40|$|This RFC {{describes}} {{the extension of}} a network’s broadcast domain to include more than one physical network {{through the use of}} a <b>broadcast</b> packet <b>repeater.</b> The following paper will present the problem of multi-network broadcasting and our motivation for solving this problem which is in the context of developing a distributed operating system. We discuss different solutions to extending a broadcast domain and why we chose the one that has been implemented. In addition, there is information on the implementation itself and some notes on its performance. It is hoped that the ideas presented here will help people in the Internet who have applications which make use of broadcasting and have come up against the limitation of only being able to broadcast within a single network. The information presented here is accurate as of the date of publication but specific details, particularly those regarding our implementation, may change in the future. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 2. The Problem Communication between hosts on separate networks has been addressed largely through the use of Internet protocols and gateways. One aspect of internetwork communication that hasn’t been solved in the Internet is extending broadcasting to encompass two or more networks. Broadcasting is an efficient way to send information to many hosts while only having to transmit a single packet. Many of the current local area network (LAN) architectures directly support a broadcast mechanism. Unfortunately, this broadcast mechanism has a shortcoming when it is used in networking environments which include multiple LANs connected by gateways such as in the DARPA Internet. This shortcoming is that broadcasted packets are only received by hosts on the physical network on which the packet was broadcast. As a result, any application which takes advantage of LAN broadcasting can only broadcast to those hosts on its physical network. We took advantage of broadcasting in developing the Cronus Distributed Operating System [1]. Cronus provides services and communication to processes distributed among a variety of different Lebowitz & Mankins [Page 1] RFC 947 June 198...|$|R

This paper analytically quantifies downlink capacity of multicell DAS for two different transmission strategies: selection diversity (where just {{one or two of the}} distributed antennas are used) and blanket transmission (where all antennas in the cell <b>broadcast</b> data). Simple <b>repeaters</b> are a special case of our analysis. A generalized information theoretic analysis is provided to illuminate the fundamental limits of such systems in the cellular context. The results show that DAS reduces other-cell interference in a multicell environment and hence significantly improves capacity (by about 2 x), with partic-ularly large improvements for users near cell boundaries. Less obviously, from a communication theory standpoint, it is shown that selection diversity is preferable to blanket transmission in terms of achievable ergodic capacity. For blanket transmission, we show that the optimal transmission strategy is just phase steering due to the per antenna module power constraints in DAS.
