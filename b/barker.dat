40|$|Thickness of the <b>bark</b> {{has serious}} {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside <b>bark,</b> if the diameter is measured over <b>bark.</b> The measured value of the <b>bark</b> thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible <b>bark</b> thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s <b>bark</b> thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different <b>bark</b> thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of <b>bark</b> thickness measuring were realized: by using <b>bark</b> gauge, increment hammer and slide caliper. <b>Bark</b> gauge gives the highest <b>bark</b> thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the <b>bark</b> and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged <b>bark</b> layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. Slide caliper give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. Slide caliper partly damages the surface layer of the <b>bark.</b> Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the <b>bark</b> thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface <b>bark</b> layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s <b>bark</b> thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce <b>bark</b> thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume.

40|$|The complex {{structure}} of tree <b>bark</b> reflects its many functions, which include structural support {{as well as}} defence against fire, pests and pathogens. Thick <b>bark,</b> however, might limit respiration by the living tissues of the trunk. Nevertheless, little research has addressed community-level variation in <b>bark</b> thickness, and {{to the best of}} our knowledge, no one has tested multiple hypotheses to explain variation in <b>bark</b> thickness. We conducted an extensive survey of <b>bark</b> thickness within and among species of trees in the tropical rain forests of French Guiana. Trunk <b>bark</b> thickness increased by 1. 2 mm per 10 cm increase in stem diameter, and varied widely at all taxonomic levels. Mean trunk <b>bark</b> thickness was 4. 5 mm (range: 0. 5 - 29 mm), which was less that found in two Amazonian rain forests in previous studies. This survey of <b>bark</b> thickness should be of use for forest management since tree survival through fire is strongly predicted by <b>bark</b> thickness. We combined the survey data with multiple datasets to test several functional hypotheses proposed to explain variation in <b>bark</b> thickness. We found <b>bark</b> to provide an average of 10 % of the flexural rigidity of tree stems, which was substantially less than that found in the only other study of <b>bark</b> stiffness. <b>Bark</b> thickness was uncorrelated with species' association with fire-prone habitats, suggesting that the influence of fire on <b>bark</b> thickness does not extend into moist Forests. There was also little evidence that <b>bark</b> thickness is affected by its function as a defence against herbivory. Nor was there evidence that thick <b>bark</b> limits trunk respiration. A re-analysis of previously collected anatomical data indicated that variation in rhytidome (non-conducting outer <b>bark)</b> thickness explains much of the variation in overall <b>bark</b> thickness. As rhytidome is primarily involved in protecting the living tissues of the trunk, we suggest that <b>bark</b> thickness is driven mostly by its defensive function. Functional explanations for the variation in <b>bark</b> thickness were not clear-cut. Nevertheless, this study provides a foundation for further investigation of the functional bases of <b>bark</b> in tropical trees...|$|R
