25|$|We {{have already}} {{encountered}} several definitions of Boolean algebra, {{as a model}} of the equational theory of the two-element algebra, as a complemented distributive lattice, as a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring,</b> and as a product-preserving functor from a certain category (Lawvere). Two more definitions worth mentioning are:.|$|E
25|$|If S is a set, {{then the}} power set of S becomes a ring if we define {{addition}} {{to be the}} symmetric difference of sets and multiplication to be intersection. This corresponds to a ring of sets and {{is an example of}} a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{symmetric}} difference of {7,8,9,10} and {9,10,11,12} is the set {7,8,11,12}. The power set of any set becomes a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring</b> with {{symmetric difference}} as {{the addition of}} the ring (with the empty set as neutral element) and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.|$|E
40|$|We generalize {{the notion}} of modal <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> to rings in general. The {{connection}} between <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> with equality and modal <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> provides a cue for the definition. The main motivation lies {{in the existence of}} examples such as matrix and polynomial <b>rings</b> over modal <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> and Cartesian products of associative rings with identity, along with the desire that the class of "modal rings" be closed under formation of not only the usual homomorphic image, subalgebra and direct product constructions, but also the ring-theoretic constructions of forming matrices and polynomials...|$|R
50|$|<b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> are von Neumann regular rings.|$|R
50|$|Unification in <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> is unitary {{if all the}} uninterpreted {{function}} {{symbols are}} nullary and finitary otherwise (i.e. if the function symbols not occurring in the signature of <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> are all constants then there exists a most general unifier, and otherwise the minimal complete set of unifiers is finite).|$|R
25|$|Both {{of these}} bases allow Boolean algebras {{to be defined}} via {{a subset of the}} equational {{properties}} of the Boolean operations. For the lattice basis, it suffices to define a Boolean algebra as a distributive lattice satisfying x∧¬x = 0 and x∨¬x = 1, called a complemented distributive lattice. The ring basis turns a Boolean algebra into a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring,</b> namely a ring satisfying x2 = x.|$|E
25|$|Every Boolean algebra {{gives rise}} to a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring,</b> and vice versa, with ring {{multiplication}} corresponding to conjunction or meet ∧, and ring addition to exclusive disjunction or symmetric difference (not disjunction ∨). However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the duality principle.|$|E
25|$|In other words, the 1-types {{correspond}} {{exactly to}} the prime ideals of the polynomial ring Q over the rationals Q: if r {{is an element of}} the model of type p, then the ideal corresponding to p is the set of polynomials with r as a root. More generally, the complete n-types correspond {{to the prime}} ideals of the polynomial ring Q, in other words to the points of the prime spectrum of this ring. (The Stone space topology can in fact be viewed as the Zariski topology of a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring</b> induced in a natural way from the lattice structure of the Boolean Algebra; while the Zariski topology is not in general Hausdorff, it is in the case of Boolean rings.) For example, if q(x,y) is an irreducible polynomial in 2 variables, there is a 2-type whose realizations are (informally) pairs (x,y) of transcendental elements with q(x,y)=0.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a duality between two {{categories}} extending the classical Stone Duality between totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces (Stone spaces) and <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> with unit. This duality was announced and very briefly sketched in [7]. The first category denoted by RHQS has as objects the representations of Hausdorff quotients of Stone spaces and as morphisms all compatible continuous functions. The second category denoted by BRLR has as objects all <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> with unit endowed with a link relation and as morphisms all compatible <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> with unit morphisms. Furthermore, we study connectedness from an algebraic point of view, {{in the context of}} the proposed generalized Stone duality...|$|R

2500|$|By Wedderburn's theorem, every finite {{division}} ring is commutative, {{and therefore a}} finite field. Another condition ensuring commutativity of a ring, due to Jacobson, is the following: for every element r of R there exists an integer [...] such that [...] If, r2 = r for every r, the ring is called <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring.</b> More general conditions which guarantee commutativity of a ring are also known.|$|E

We describe connections between medial nonassociative <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> and associative rings in which squaring is an automorphism.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{equality}} may be internalized in Boolean algebras, {{in a number}} of possible ways, as a binary operation satisfying reflexivity and replacement properties. The variety of equality <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> is shown to be equivalent to the variety of modal <b>rings</b> (<b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> endowed with a generalised interior operator and important in modal logic). Varying the strength and exact nature of the replacement property corresponds to selecting from a number of natural varieties of modal rings.

40|$|AbstractAn {{associative}} {{ring with}} unity is called clean (respectively uniquely clean) if every element is (uniquely) {{the sum of}} an idempotent and a unit. In this paper we define clean general rings (with or without a unity) and extend many of the basic results to the wider class. In particular, a clean general ring is an exchange ring {{in the sense of}} Ara. We then study the general analogue of the uniquely clean rings and their relationship to the <b>boolean</b> <b>rings.</b> Finally, we introduce semiboolean rings as a natural generalization of <b>boolean</b> <b>rings...</b>|$|R
40|$|This book gives a {{coherent}} {{account of the}} theory of Banach spaces and Banach lattices, using the spaces C_ 0 (K) of continuous functions on a locally compact space K as the main example. The study of C_ 0 (K) has been an important area of functional analysis for many years. It gives several new constructions, some involving <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings,</b> of this space as well as many results on the Stonean space of <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings.</b> The book also discusses when Banach spaces of continuous functions are dual spaces and when they are bidual spaces...|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring</b> is the power set of any set X, where the {{addition}} in the ring is symmetric difference, and the multiplication is intersection. As another example, we can also consider the set of all finite or cofinite subsets of X, again with symmetric difference and intersection as operations. More generally with these operations any field of sets is a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring.</b> By Stone's representation theorem every <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring</b> is isomorphic to a field of sets (treated as a ring with these operations).|$|E
50|$|Every prime ideal P in a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring</b> R is maximal: the {{quotient}} ring R/P is {{an integral}} domain and also a <b>Boolean</b> <b>ring,</b> so it is isomorphic to the field F2, which shows the maximality of P. Since maximal ideals are always prime, prime ideals and maximal ideals coincide in Boolean rings.|$|E

50|$|Foster's Ph.D. {{dissertation}} and {{his first}} few papers were {{in the area of}} mathematical logic. Starting from this point, he soon focused his interest on the related theory of Boolean algebras and <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings,</b> and was thus led from logic to algebra. He extensively studied the role of duality in Boolean theory and subsequently developed a theory of n-ality for certain rings which played for n-valued logics the role of <b>Boolean</b> <b>rings</b> vis-a-vis <b>Boolean</b> algebras. The late Benjamin Bernstein of the Berkeley mathematics faculty was his collaborator in some of this research. This work culminated in his seminal paper “The theory of Boolean-like rings” appearing in 1946.|$|R
5000|$|Ideals were {{introduced}} first by Marshall H. Stone, who derived their {{name from the}} ring ideals of abstract algebra.
