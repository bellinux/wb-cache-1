5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a <b>British</b> <b>accent</b> and had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell had to speak her lines without Rudd present.|$|E
5|$|Pierce Brosnan {{had signed}} a deal for four films when he was cast {{in the role of}} James Bond. This was {{fulfilled}} with the production of Die Another Day in 2002. At this stage, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind fans and critics were not happy with Roger Moore playing Bond until he was 58 and speculation began the producers were seeking to replace Brosnan with a younger actor. Brosnan officially announced he was stepping down in February 2004. At one point, producer Michael G. Wilson claimed there was a list of over 200 names being considered for his replacement. Croatian actor Goran Višnjić auditioned for the role the same day as Craig, but was reportedly unable to master a <b>British</b> <b>accent.</b> New Zealander Karl Urban was considered, but was unable to make the screen test due to filming commitments. According to Martin Campbell, Henry Cavill was the only other actor in serious contention for the role, but at 22 years old was considered too young. Australian actor Sam Worthington and Scottish actor Dougray Scott were also considered. Hugh Jackman was approached to play the character just before Craig was chosen to play Bond but turned it down due to other commitments.|$|E

25|$|As one of {{the best-known}} {{survivors}} of the disaster, Gracie has been featured as a character in many of the dramatizations of the Titanics sinking. For example, he was played by James Dyrenforth in A Night to Remember (1958) and by Bernard Fox in the film Titanic (1997) - in which - because the actor playing him was British - he speaks with a <b>British</b> <b>accent,</b> despite the real Gracie being American.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{considers}} {{his treatment}} of Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII among his best translations. He looks to Vagrant Story as a title that demands to be in English and thought of his work as revealing the inner English game that always existed underneath. Smith was able to speak directly with Matsuno to improve the script translation, marking the first of their many collaborations. For Final Fantasy XII, his role entailed rebuilding the world to make sense for an English-speaking audience. He chose to portray the Archadian Imperials with a <b>British</b> <b>accent</b> to distinguish them from the American-accented Resistance members. For both of these titles, Smith relied on Matsuno's dense notes on the world's backstory to capture subtle and implied connections and preserve the rich texture of the game.|$|E

Prime sent him to the Speed Planet Velocitron to locate the planet's Cyber Planet Key. Much to Red Alert's displeasure, Hot Shot got increasingly involved in the planet's affairs, rescuing Brakedown from Ransack and Crumplezone. Red Alert eventually called in Prime when {{the two of them were}} nearly destroyed in a sneak attack by Ransack, Crumplezone and Dirt Boss. However, despite Prime's initial displeasure, Hot Shot went on to win the Key in a race.|$|E

500|$|Allen's voice {{actors have}} also been reviewed.

Michael Marr of Capsule Computers also enjoyed Haberkorn's work, echoing the belief that it was as appealing as Kobayashi's.
