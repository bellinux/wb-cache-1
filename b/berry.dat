40|$|Injured and non-injured grape <b>berries</b> were inoculated with spore {{suspension}} of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora or Phaeoacremonium aleophilum under field (intact <b>berries)</b> and laboratory (detached <b>berries)</b> conditions. In one test, <b>berries</b> were injured by pricking the skin with a syringe needle {{to a depth}} of approximately 1. 5 mm. Brown to purple lesions appeared 5 to 7 days after inoculation in both the injured intact and detached <b>berries.</b> Lesions on these <b>berries</b> were larger when inoculated earlier in the season indicating that young, immature <b>berries</b> are more susceptible to infection than mature <b>berries.</b> In another test, <b>berries</b> were injured by rubbing the skin with carborundum dust using a cotton-tipped applicator. Esca-like lesions developed in 4 to 5 days after inoculation of detached but not intact <b>berries.</b> Occasional infection of non-injured <b>berries</b> occurred which appeared as small dots to pin-head size lesions around the lenticels. Scanning electron microscopy observations of these lesions showed abundant hyphal growth on the surface with apparent penetration through lenticels; however, fungal structures were not detected with certainty beneath the lenticels or intact cuticle.

This work aims to establish a possible relationship between ochratoxin A (OTA) and polyphenols in Aglianico grapes in presence of a different degree of ailing <b>berries.</b> Six empirical classes of Aglianico grapes with increasing number of ailing <b>berries</b> were considered. OTA was determined on <b>berries</b> juice by a semi-quantitative cELISA analysis. Polyphenols concentration from skins and <b>berries</b> juice were determined by spectrophotometric methods. The results showed that higher OTA concentrations {{were present in the}} juice obtained from classes with high number of ailing <b>berries.</b> Furthermore, polyphenols concentration of <b>berries</b> skins increased in the classes with high number of ailing <b>berries.</b> Our preliminary results seemed to demonstrate that the presence of mycotoxin-producing fungi and, consequently OTA, on ailing <b>berries</b> could be affect the increase of polyphenolic content in the same <b>berries...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The later {{generations of}} larvae do not feed externally, but tunnel into the <b>berries,</b> feeding from within.

Although early larvae of the first generation may cause serious damage by feeding on the blossoms, buds and developing <b>berries,</b> the later generations often cause the majority of damage to the grape harvest by causing parts of <b>berries</b> to ripen early and hollowing out <b>berries,</b> both reducing yield and increasing the risk of fungal infection and infection by fruit flies.|$|R
