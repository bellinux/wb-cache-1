5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, US131 {{had been}} realigned as an {{expressway}} from the Three Rivers bypass to Moorepark. The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street. This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1958. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1960, the freeway was extended to M-118 in Martin, where traffic used M-118 to connect {{back to the old}} routing. The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 18th {{century the}} botanical booty {{resulting}} from the era of exploration was accumulating in gardens and herbaria – and {{it needed to be}} systematically catalogued. This was the task of the taxonomists, the plant classifiers.|$|E

5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds had one of the most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Japan, conditions became steadily {{worse for}} the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross tons in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised the Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK's first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, the society had spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.|$|E

5|$|By 1879, English law {{began to}} {{distinguish}} between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. In 1882, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in England and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, suicide had become legal {{in much of the}} western world. The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s the {{influence}} of the Sheffield FA started to wane. Internal troubles began to surface with disputes between the SFA and a new rival association, Hallamshire F.A. The former, led by Charles Clegg, also fought a losing battle against the onset of professionalism. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the decade several local clubs, including Sheffield and Hallam F.C., were in financial trouble.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had {{designated}} a highway numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville. This highway was extended east <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1936. The route connected US131 in downtown Three Rivers to US112 outside Coldwater. At {{the time of the}} extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three Rivers and Colon was paved, and the state extended the hard-surface route as far as Nottawa in 1937.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1936, the US27/M-78 routing through Lansing {{was split}} into two. The {{mainline}} {{was restricted to}} cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US27/M-78 was rerouted {{to use it to}} connect to Larch Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> 1960, {{the first}} section of freeway along M-78 was opened in the Lennon area. The next year, the freeway had been {{extended}} as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon. Also in 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of US27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead.|$|E

Even after the treaty, some villages in Bombay remained under Portuguese possession, but many were later acquired by the British.|$|E

By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E

The influence of Calakmul extended deep into the Petén; king Tuun K'ab' Hix of Calakmul oversaw the enthronement of Aj Wosal to the rulership of Naranjo in 546. Another vassal of Tuun K'ab' Hix was taken captive by Yaxchilan {{on the banks of}} the Usumacinta River in 537.|$|E
