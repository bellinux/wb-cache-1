5|$|Dewi Zephaniah Phillips defended Wittgenstein's theory {{by arguing}} that {{although}} religious language games are autonomous, {{they should not be}} treated as isolated <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> statements about secular events such as birth and death. Phillips argued that because of this connection, religions can still be criticised based on human experiences of these secular events. He maintained that religion cannot be denounced as wrong because it is not empirical.|$|E
5|$|Writing for GameSpot, {{reviewer}} Joe Fielder {{highlighted the}} graphics {{for their new}} lighting effects and varied textures, saying that they improve the gameplay experience <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it easier for players to identify ledges and jump-off points. Douglass Perry of IGN remarked that the upgraded engine made the game look better than its predecessors, but overall considered Tomb Raider III to be outdated, especially when compared to newer engines that were released at the time. Edge felt that the old controls did not suit the more complex environments and criticised the game's lack of narrative and cinematic presentation.|$|E

Commentators {{have described}} the book as a revelation, in particular for its detail on the various public figures whom the Transnistrian ethnologist had met before 1944. According to Galin-Corini, these works were also rejected by editors in Moldova, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> brazen statements about Bessarabians who collaborated with the Soviets.|$|E

They are designed to keep the arrow pointed in the direction of travel by strongly damping down any tendency to pitch or yaw. Some cultures, for example most in New Guinea, did not use fletching on their arrows. Also, arrows without fletching (called bare shaft) are used for training purposes, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> certain errors by the archer more visible.|$|E

25|$|Cyprinids {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, cyprinids {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive frozen fish products made this less important {{now than it was}} in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.|$|E
500|$|Conrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its [...] "horrible localization" [...] as a {{main reason}} for negativity. Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: [...] "It's really {{annoying}} how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> the original English voices sound like award-winning performers." [...] Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive. Staff of GamesRadar admitted, [...] "At least the song fits. Can't imagine Sonic listening to Undergrounds wailing Meat Loaf light rock, but he'd definitely jam to Sonic X." [...] Jones praised the rock music from Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, {{as well as the}} [...] "pretty piano music" [...] and [...] "catchy" [...] Japanese intro and outro themes. He also found the backgrounds [...] "nice to look at" [...] but did not like the use of CGI for Sonic's homing attack.|$|E
500|$|Impressed by {{her work}} in Dick, the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman cast Williams in his directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, {{alongside}} Philip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson. A box office bomb, it was praised in the media, appearing on many top ten critics' lists for 2008. Wendy and Lucy, an acclaimed small-budget, low-key drama directed and co-written by Kelly Reichardt, follows Wendy, a drifter looking {{to start a new}} life, searching for her dog Lucy after a series of setbacks. Unlike others, including the director, Williams did not find the film depressing. [...] "Personally I like seeing those kinds of movies. I find them comforting <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> me feel less alone." [...] As the lead actress of Wendy and Lucy, she enjoyed the documentary style of the film. Houston Chronicle writer Amy Biancolli said her performance, [...] "a bare-bones accomplishment of no small heft," [...] was the [...] movie's key. The Toronto Film Critics Association Awards named Williams as the Best Actress, and the film as 2008's Best Movie.|$|E

500|$|In the {{creation}} of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during my stay at One Life. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and fought passionately for {{his position on the}} show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from [...] "first frat boy" [...] to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) {{and at the same time}} slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> women feel both the thrill of the [...] "bad" [...] and the lure of the hidden [...] "good": they can lead the man to change through love. [...] "I'll save him!" [...] Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always had that appeal.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E

50|$|UML state {{machines}} address exactly this shortcoming {{of the conventional}} FSMs. They provide a number of features for eliminating the repetitions so that the complexity of a UML state machine no longer explodes but tends to faithfully represent {{the complexity of the}} reactive system it describes.

2500|$|Camp-style {{performances}} {{may allow}} certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist {{critics argue that}} drag queens are misogynistic <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of {{the black and white}} minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.|$|E

He was roundly criticized in a lengthy paper by Theodore Roosevelt, who wrote that Thayer had only managed to paint the peacock's plumage as camouflage by sleight of hand, [...] "with the blue sky showing through the leaves in just sufficient quantity here and there to warrant the author-artists explaining that the wonderful blue hues of the peacock's neck are obliterative <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it fade into the sky." ...|$|E
