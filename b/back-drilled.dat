40|$|The defect {{detection}} {{capabilities of}} pulse transient thermography and lock-in thermography were compared using equal excitation energies. A signal-to-noise ratio {{analysis was performed}} on defect images obtained by the two techniques. The test piece imaged by both techniques was a carbon fibre composite plate containing <b>back-drilled</b> flat-bottomed hole artificial defects of 4, 6 and 12 mm diameters at depths ranging from 0. 25 to 3. 5 mm. Similar limits of defect detection were found for the two techniques. Lock-in thermography phase images were found to exhibit anomalous switches between positive and negative phase values for different modulation frequencies and for different combinations of defect diameter and depth. This effect resulted in values of defect phase response that differed substantially from the one-dimensional thermal wave interpretation of lock-in thermography imaging. The consequences of this anomalous effect and its physical origins are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{pulse-width}} modulation {{metering system}} for anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) with a stacked manifold and one valve per knife {{was developed and}} tested for lateral distribution and flow characteristics. The manifold ensured that liquid ammonia was fed to the valves for correct metering. The distribution test was simulated on a trailer and flow rate from each shank was determined by a dynamic water absorption system. The flow was tested for valve duty cycle from 10 % to 90 % and recorded an average of 15. 3 kg/hr (34 lb/hr) per knife at 10 % to 106 kg/hr (235 lb/hr) per knife at 90 % duty cycle. The lateral coefficient of variation was between 5. 5 and 9. 3 %. The valve was modified with larger orifice and <b>back-drilled</b> increasing the flow rate {{to an average of}} 215 kg/hr (473 lb/hr) per knife at 90 % duty cycle. Ammonia flow was a function of valve duty cycle and pressure drop across the valve...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 This master’s thesis {{describes}} {{the design process}} and testing results for a pneumatically actuated, manually-operated tool for confined space drilling operations. The purpose of this device is to <b>back-drill</b> pilot holes inside a commercial airplane wing. It is lightweight, and a “locator pin” enables the operator to align the drill over a pilot hole. A suction pad stabilizes the system, and an air motor and flexible drive shaft power the drill. Two testing procedures were performed to determine the practicality of this prototype. The first was the “offset drill test”, which qualified the exit hole position error due to an initial position error relative to the original pilot hole. The results displayed a linear relationship, and {{it was determined that}} position errors of less than. 060 ” would prevent the need for rework, with errors of up to. 030 ” considered acceptable. For the second test, a series of holes were drilled with the pneumatic tool and analyzed for position error, diameter range, and cycle time. The position errors and hole diameter range were within the allowed tolerances. The average cycle time was 45 seconds, 73 percent of which was for drilling the hole, and 27 percent of which was for positioning the device. Recommended improvements are discussed in the conclusion, and include a more durable flexible drive shaft, a damper for drill feed control, and a more stable locator pin...|$|R
