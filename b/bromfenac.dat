40|$|John D Sheppard 1, 2 1 Virginia Eye Consultants, 2 Department of Ophthalmology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, US Abstract: Topical nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids, {{alone or}} in combination, have historically been used off label in the US to prevent and treat postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME). This literature review presents available data {{on the use of}} <b>bromfenac</b> 0. 07 % or 0. 09 % to prevent and treat CME following cataract surgery. <b>Bromfenac</b> is an NSAID approved to treat postoperative inflammation and reduce ocular pain following cataract surgery. Few cases of clinical CME were observed with <b>bromfenac</b> use in a total of 19 reviewed studies. There {{were no significant differences in}} CME incidence between bromfenac and corticosteroid-treated patients or between bromfenac- and <b>bromfenac</b> plus corticosteroid-treated patients. <b>Bromfenac</b> demonstrated comparable efficacy to other NSAIDs in preventing CME. Compared with corticosteroids, <b>bromfenac</b> alone or plus a corticosteroid showed similar or better efficacy in minimizing changes in retinal thickness and macular volume. In diabetic cataract surgery patients, <b>bromfenac</b> was comparable or superior to corticosteroids for minimizing changes in retinal thickness; also, combination therapy with <b>bromfenac</b> and corticosteroids may be associated with smaller changes in foveal thickness, macular thickness, and macular volume versus monotherapy with either treatment alone in this patient population. In two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trials with <b>bromfenac</b> 0. 07 %, CME was reported as an adverse event in 0. 5 % and 1. 5 % of patients receiving <b>bromfenac</b> and placebo, respectively. In an analysis of four placebo-controlled trials with <b>bromfenac</b> 0. 09 %, macular edema was reported in 0. 7 % and 1. 4 % of patients receiving <b>bromfenac</b> and placebo, respectively. When evaluated as treatment for acute or chronic CME, <b>bromfenac</b> was associated with improvement in visual acuity and reduction in retinal thickness, but few studies are available. Overall, published data suggest that <b>bromfenac</b> is safe and effective when used to prevent or treat CME. Large-scale placebo-controlled trials and greater standardization of CME measures are needed to establish optimal <b>bromfenac</b> regimens for the prophylaxis and treatment of CME following cataract surgery.

40|$|Recently, {{several new}} {{ophthalmic}} NSAID products {{have been introduced}} for commercial use in the United States. The purpose of this review is to briefly overview the ophthalmic NSAIDs currently in use and to discuss the management of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery with a particular focus on <b>bromfenac</b> ophthalmic solution 0. 09 %. <b>Bromfenac</b> ophthalmic solution 0. 09 % is indicated for the reduction of ocular pain and inflammation following cataract surgery.

Methods: A prospective single-blind parallel clinical study was conducted in 20 eyes of ten healthy volunteers with no history of ocular or systemic allergic disease, dry eye, contact lens wear, or ocular surgery. Participants were instructed to instill either <b>bromfenac</b> sodium or artificial tears in each eye twice daily for 28 days. Corneal sensitivity tested using a Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometer was evaluated before and immediately after instillation at 7, 14, and 28 days after the initiation of treatment.

Methods: A multicenter, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial of 240  subjects randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to <b>bromfenac</b> 0. 075 % or vehicle was conducted. Subjects were dosed BID beginning 1  day before the cataract surgery, the day of surgery, and 14  days after surgery. A slit lamp biomicroscopy examination was performed to evaluate the signs of inflammation, including anterior chamber cells (ACC) and anterior chamber flare (ACF). The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects with an ACC grade of 0 at Day 15. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of subjects who achieved a pain score of 0 at each postsurgical visual analog scale (VAS) assessment and the proportion of subjects with an ACF grade of 0 at Day 15.

Methods: Eighty eyes (from 40 patients, 18 men and 22 women) undergoing bilateral simultaneous LASEK or epi-LASEK were randomized to receive ketorolac in one eye and <b>bromfenac</b> in the other. Mean age was 33. 13 &plusmn; 9. 34 years. One drop of <b>bromfenac</b> or ketorolac was instilled in each eye 15 minutes and one minute prior to surgery, and two and four hours following surgery. Patients were instructed to instill the medications on-label each day through postoperative day 4. The subjects completed pain and visual blurriness assessments from day of surgery to postoperative day 4. Uncorrected visual acuity was tested on postoperative days 1 and 6. Results: For each of the five days, pain scores for bromfenac-treated eyes were significantly less than that for ketorolac-treated eyes (P &lt; 0. 01).

Titration method was used to construct Pseudoternary phase diagram varying the ratio of Poloxamer 188 and Propylene glycol such as 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and 2 : 1, diluting it appropriately with water. Oleic acid was then added drop-wise till turbidity was observed. Microemulsion was characterized for particle size, Osmolality, drug content and Viscosity. In-Vitro diffusion study was carried out on Keshary-chien membrane permeation cell to evaluate release pattern. Freeze thaw cycling and centrifugation were carried out to check stability of formulation. It was found from in-vitro diffusion studies of formulation that microemulsion of <b>Bromfenac</b> exhibited better penetration than marketed formulation. Particle size of formulation at optimized composition was found to be < 100 nm (Malwern-zeta sizer). A stable formulation requiring less frequency of administration could be prepared. The rate of penetration was found to be faster than the marketed formulation...|$|E
40|$|Eye {{inflammation}} can {{be caused}} by different factors — allergies, infection, trauma (including surgery). It can have severe complications, last even after elimination the reason and cause the visual impairment as an outcome. Two main classes of anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) are used for the prevention and relief of the inflammatory process. Along with the fact that corticosteroids are the «gold standard» treatment of inflammation in ophthalmology, they have a number of serious side effects such as increasing of intraocular pressure and the risk of developing glaucoma, cataracts, activation of bacterial, viral infection and herpes. The positive effects of NSAIDs in comparison with corticosteroids are stable intraocular pressure (IOP), analgesic effect and reduce the risk of secondary infection. The three classes of NSADs are currently used in ophthalmology. They are phenylacetic acid (diclofenac and <b>bromfenac</b> nepafenak), indole acetic acid (indomethacin) and geteroariluksunoy acid (ketorolac). The last synthesized NSAIDs for ophthalmology are amfenac and <b>bromfenac.</b> <b>Bromfenac</b> is effective for the relief of the inflammatory symptoms of and fully complies with the requirements for the ideal anti-inflammatory drugs such as good a penetration ability, creating a sufficient concentration inside the eye, the activity of cyclooxygenase, inhibiting the progress of macular edema, a good analgesic effect, minimal toxicity, comfort of use patients. <b>Bromfenac</b> is the only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, which is applied once a day and has a pronounced anti-inflammatory action...|$|E
