5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> the main trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs.

5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> {{competitive}} play.

Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E
5000|$|Soft SUSY {{breaking}} decouples {{the origin}} of supersymmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>from</b> its phenomenological consequences. In effect, soft SUSY breaking adds explicit symmetry breaking to the supersymmetric Standard Model Lagrangian.

Divorcing the spontaneous supersymmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>from</b> the supersymmetric Standard Model leads {{to the notion of}} mediated supersymmetry breaking.|$|R

5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1982 {{was marred by}} both Downey and Gorham having to take <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> the European tour to recover from personal problems. Downey {{was involved in a}} fight in a nightclub in Denmark in February, and Gorham was suffering from drug-induced exhaustion. Downey missed five concerts, and was replaced by Mark Nauseef again for three of them, and by Mike Mesbur of support band The Lookalikes for the other two. In March, Gorham collapsed and returned home; eight concerts were performed as a quartet and six others were postponed.|$|E
5|$|US20A joins NY64 here, {{following}} the latter for about , allowing US20A to terminate at its parent, US20, here concurrent with NY5, at an intersection in East Bloomfield. At this point, NY64 turns west onto US 20 and NY 5. The three routes head westward across mostly open fields, meeting the southern terminus of NY444 {{south of the}} former village of Holcomb. Past the junction, which once served as the eastern terminus of NY20C, US 20, NY 5, and NY 64 continue into the village of Bloomfield before NY64 <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> NY5 and US20 and turns northward toward Rochester once again.|$|E
5|$|At a wye in the Porter {{hamlet of}} Blairville, NY18 <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> its northsouth {{alignment}} {{and turns to}} the northeast before curving northward once more, returning to a perfect northsouth alignment at an intersection with NY93 in the hamlet of Towers Corners. Southwest of the Four Mile Creek State Park, NY18 turns a full 90 degrees {{to the east and}} begins to parallel the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Here, NY18 meets the northern terminus of NY18F, changes names from Creek Road to Lake Road, and becomes part of the Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. The route proceeds northeast to Four Mile Creek State Park, where it intersects the northern end of the Robert Moses State Parkway. East of the park, NY18 gradually moves to the north, decreasing the area between the route and the lakeshore as it proceeds east.|$|E

5|$|Beresford visited several {{schools and}} auditioned many {{children}} {{for the role of}} Sonny before he came across Allan Hubbard in Paris, Texas. Beresford said Hubbard, like Harper, was chosen based on a simple, rural quality he possessed. The boy was able to relate easily to the character because, like Sonny, his father died at an early age; later, some media reports falsely claimed that his father was killed during the Vietnam War, just as Sonny's was in the film's backstory. None of the filmmakers knew Hubbard's father had died until after filming began. Duvall developed a strong, trusting relationship with Hubbard, which Foote felt improved the duo's on-screen chemistry. Hubbard would often play guitar with Duvall during <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> filming.|$|E
5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse S-curve, {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the Corning Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast to the outskirts of Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At {{the western edge of the}} gully, the Corning Secondary <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it merges with NY14 at the foot of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the community, NY75 intersects Langford Road, {{designated}} as NY249 west of the junction and County Route39 (CR39) east of NY75. Past NY249, the route exits Langford and heads across another stretch of fields and farms toward the Eden town line. NY75 <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> its due north routing just south of it, taking on a more westerly heading to avoid a valley surrounding the south branch of Eighteenmile Creek. It ultimately enters the valley, however, winding its way northward down the depression's southwestern side to reach the creek floor. From here, NY75 follows the base of the valley to the northwest for , serving a handful of homes situated along the forested creekside. The route eventually climbs out of the gully and heads due north for a short distance across more fields to a junction with US62.|$|E

5|$|NY10 begins {{concurrent}} with NY8 at an interchange {{with the}} Quickway (NY17) {{southeast of the}} village of Deposit near the Broome-Delaware County line. The two routes continue north along the eastern extents of Deposit to {{the banks of the}} west branch of the Delaware River, where NY8 <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> NY10 to cross over the river. NY10, however, continues northeast along the riverbank, passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 crosses over the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of the reservoir. As the reservoir begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Croghan, NY812 {{traverses}} the Beaver River {{just north}} of the village line. The route and the river continue northward along parallel routings for a brief distance before the two separate near the hamlet of High Falls. While the river curves east toward the hamlet, NY812 presses northward through the rural hamlets of Indian River and Dutton Corners into the town of Diana, where NY812 starts to parallel the west branch of the Oswegatchie River as both continue north through the town. At Tylers Corners, NY812 intersects NY3 and joins the route eastward into Harrisville, where the conjoined routes cross over the Oswegatchie. Northeast of Harrisville in extreme southwestern St. Lawrence County, NY812 <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> NY3 and heads northwest through Pitcairn (crossing over the Oswegatchie once more in the process).|$|E
5|$|The name {{by which}} the series is known today is not Goya's own. His {{handwritten}} title on an album of proofs given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos). Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> a number of painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.|$|E

5|$|The two routes {{serve as}} Oneonta's main street, {{following}} Chestnut and Main streets across the city's western and central areas. Along the way, NY7 and NY23 pass Hartwick College and serve Oneonta's central business district. NY23 <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> NY7 just northeast of downtown to follow James F. Lettis Highway, a four-lane divided highway, south into the southern {{half of the}} city. As it heads south on the arterial, it connects to Interstate88 (I-88) at an interchange on the northern bank of the Susquehanna River. NY28—which overlaps with I-88 from Oneonta to exit17 northeast of the city—leaves the freeway here, following NY23 across the river to a large commercial district on the south bank. NY28 leaves NY23 here to proceed to the southwest while NY23 goes eastward past several large strip malls and big-box retailers on {{its way out of}} both Oneonta and Otsego County.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
5|$|In Schenectady County, Schoharie Creek <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> NY30A {{and returns}} to the {{vicinity}} of NY30 as it intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Esperance. From Esperance northward, the creek becomes roughly equidistant from both NY30 and NY30A as all three entities cross into Montgomery County. Near the northeastern corner of the county, NY30 enters the city of Amsterdam. The route meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S via separate interchanges before heading downhill as a four-lane divided highway approaching the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). Historically, the bridge over the river was a straight line to Market Street, which is visible as one approaches northbound. Segments of downtown Market Street remain in use today. With the 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY30, together with NY5 and NY67, were re-routed onto splits. After the splits rejoin, NY30 continues on Market Street and leaves the city and, for all purposes, the county.|$|E

5|$|His brother {{claims that}} Stauskas scored about 50 {{points a game}} in middle school. For much of his youth, he and future Gonzaga point guard Kevin Pangos {{attended}} basketball camps together, regularly playing one-on-one while other campers took <b>breaks</b> <b>from</b> basketball for other activities. Until 2009, Stauskas played for Loyola Catholic Secondary School. He averaged 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 2007–08 and 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 2008–09. Its basketball team nearly disbanded before Stauskas's grade 10 season in 2008–09, when Loyola {{was in danger of}} not fielding a team because school policy required the presence of a teacher. Although his father, a computer consultant, was willing to volunteer as a coach, no teacher was willing to serve. Stauskas's father finally found a French teacher who sat in the gym and graded papers while his father coached. In the meantime, Stauskas joined the premier Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team in Toronto, run by Ro Russell. Some of Russell's prior players, such as Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph had gone to the United States to complete their scholastic years. Stauskas, not wishing to risk not having a team to play on after the crisis of 2008–2009, spent the 2009–10 academic year at South Kent School, but the forested rural campus made him homesick and he transferred to St. Mark's School the following year. He missed the 2009–10 basketball season {{as a result of a}} hip injury. Michigan Wolverines men's basketball head coach John Beilein became familiar with Stauskas during the Summer 2010 NBA camp prior to Stauskas's junior year. Stauskas visited Michigan that summer and was also being recruited by Villanova, Iowa State, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Florida and Providence. By the time he arrived at St. Mark's, he was expected to be an All-State performer. In the 2011 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game, Stauskas led St. Mark's in scoring with 17 points against Nerlens Noel and the Tilton School, but St. Marks lost 72–56. On March 26, 2011, Stauskas made a verbal commitment to Michigan. This commitment made him the second member of Michigan's recruiting class of 2012. That summer he scored 27 points in an exhibition of Canadian high school all-stars against the Baylor Bears men's basketball team.|$|E
