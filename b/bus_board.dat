40|$|Abstract. A {{certain type}} of {{airborne}} photoelectric equipment is the key device for aiming and distance measuring. On the basis of analyzing the test requirement of the equipment, a test system is designed with PC 104 embedded computer as the core control system. The function of the test system is suggested. Hardware programs of power, <b>bus</b> <b>board,</b> signal conditioning circuit and anti-jamming measure are designed. The multithreading technology and measures to prevent wrong data communicating are applied to develop software of the test system. The test system {{can be applied to}} test and debug the photoelectric equipment. The data handling technology used in the test equipment has advantages as high speed, high efficiency and high reliability...|$|E

40|$|The new {{high-performance}} interface allows {{rapid development}} of realtime applications. We have all heard the quote, ”Revolutions do not happen overnight”. Indeed, the USB revolution was {{years in the}} making: but soon after the USB (universal serial <b>bus)</b> <b>board</b> fired its first spike, nearly every member of our lab had abandoned their chip-testing setups to join the insurgency. This custom tool had ousted logic analyzers, pattern generators, digital I/O cards, and other bourgeois equipment. My comrades, we wish to spread the revolution. We have two aims in this article: first, we want to demonstrate that, with the right components and driver, USB 2. 0 offers a high-performance (7 million spikes/sec), portable (compatible with any PC), inexpensive (under $ 500 in parts and printed circuit board), and flexible (coded in C++) compute...|$|E
40|$|David Jack Cowen aims {{to clarify}} the {{economic}} history of early America by increasing {{our understanding of the}} premier financial institution of the day, the First Bank of the United States (p. 235). Cowen exploits archival material on the Bank of the United States (BUS), including new information about BUS balance sheets. He examines actions of the BUS through analysis of its balance sheets and ties this evidence to recent research that has generated information about securities (bond) prices. He also reviews contemporary correspondence as well as the minutes of <b>BUS</b> <b>board</b> meetings to glean information about motivation behind BUS activities. These bits and pieces are used to support Cowen s major interpretation of BUS actions in this era: that the BUS acted as an agent for the U. S. Treasury and, at the direction of various Treasury secretaries, acted as a central bank. ...|$|E
40|$|Model 104 -DA 12 - 8 is a PC/ 104 <b>Bus</b> <b>board</b> {{with eight}} DACs, 128 K SRAM for {{waveform}} data storage, eight 4 - 20 mA current sinks and three 16 -bit counter/timers. The DACs can be updated individually or simultaneously. An automatic circuit sets the analog outputs to zero at power-on or reset. Each output is buffered by a short-circuit protected op-amp sourcing up to 5 mA. Data for updating each DAC {{may come from}} either the card's onboard RAM or from the PC/ 104 bus. The on-board 64 K sample RAM and onboard intelligent circuitry provides flexible allocation of between one and eight FIFO buffers/waveforms. Counter/Timers Three 16 -bit down-counters, in a type 8254 IC, are included. These are configured as two frequency sources derived from an on-board 2 MHz crystal-controlled oscillator. Counter/Timers 1 and 2 are concatenated by the card to form a single 32 -bit counter. Input/Output Connections Primary I/O connections (analog reference, voltage and current outputs) are made via a 40 pin header. Fused + 5 V and + 12 V are also available on this header.

30|$|Smartcard data {{recorded}} the trips {{of more than}} 2.4 million smartcard users on 915 bus lines and 6 subway lines in Shenzhen (Figs. S 1 –S 4). Each smartcard has a unique ID number. During the 1 -week data collection period (August 8 – 15, 2016), 48 million transaction records were generated. The time and station that a passenger enters or exits the subway were recorded, whereas only the information of the <b>bus</b> <b>boarded</b> and the boarding time were recorded for bus passengers. The time that a bus arrived at each bus stop was inferred by matching the GPS coordinates of the bus to the stops along the bus route. This generates the timetable of the <b>bus.</b> Consequently, the <b>boarding</b> time of each bus passenger was compared with the timetable to identify the bus stop where each passenger got on <b>board.</b> Given that <b>bus</b> passengers do not tap cards when getting off a bus, the destination information is not available. In the following section, we use a four-step method to infer the destination of each bus trip.|$|R
