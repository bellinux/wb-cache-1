5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|Crustacean {{appendages}} {{are typically}} biramous, meaning they {{are divided into}} two parts; this includes the second pair of antennae, but not the first, which is usually uniramous, the exception being in the Class Malacostraca where the antennules may <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> biramous or even triramous.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous {{adenitis}} is an {{autoimmune disease}} that affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known {{to occur in}} dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it is thought to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> autosomal recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and one report describes this condition in a rabbit. In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution of the hair loss differs greatly.|$|E
50|$|Weeklies (such as Time and Newsweek) <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dated a week ahead. Monthlies (such as National Geographic Magazine) <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dated a month ahead, and quarterlies <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> dated {{three months}} ahead.|$|R
50|$|Source {{of income}} {{is where the}} income is {{considered}} to arise under the relevant tax system. The manner of determining the source of income <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> dependent {{on the nature of}} income. Income from the performance of services (e.g., wages) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the services are performed. Financing income (e.g., interest, dividends) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the user of the financing resides. Income related to use of tangible property (e.g., rents) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the property is situated. Income related to use of intangible property (e.g., royalties) <b>is</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the property is used. Gains on sale of realty <b>are</b> <b>generally</b> treated as arising where the property is situated.|$|R

5|$|The site can <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> {{divided into}} three broad areas, the site core, a North Zone and an East Zone. The North Zone is {{separated}} from the site core by a wide depression containing clay soil that may {{have served as a}} reservoir for the city. Several quarries have been identified on the northern and southern edges of this depression.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incident}} in 1951, where a US Army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote), studies began {{in the use of}} warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant. It was found to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E
5|$|England {{also had}} a {{tradition}} of drawing on expert foreign engineers for military engineering; Italians were particularly sought after, as their home country was felt to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> more technically advanced, particularly {{in the field of}} fortifications. One of these foreign engineers, Stefan von Haschenperg from Moravia, worked on Camber, Pendennis, Sandgate and St Mawes, apparently attempting to reproduce Italian designs, although his lack of personal knowledge of such fortifications impacted poorly on the end results. Technical treatises from mainland Europe also influenced the designers of the Device Forts, including Albrecht Dürer's Befestigung der Stett, Schlosz und Felcken which described contemporary methods of fortification in Germany, published in 1527 and translated into Latin in 1535, and Niccolò Machiavelli's Libro dell'art della guerra, published in 1521, which also described new Italian forms of military defences.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, KKR was one {{of seven}} private equity firms {{involved}} in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable {{given the number of}} firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> unattractive.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, the French {{utilized}} large column formations {{against the}} rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General André-Gaston Prételat, found to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, {{he believed the}} optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge of the terrain and high mobility. However, the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels {{because they were too}} small numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} and most important surveyors of Kīlauea was James Dwight Dana, who, staying with the missionary Titus Coan, studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades first-hand. Dana visited Kīlauea's summit and described it in detail in 1840. After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider Kīlauea a separate volcano, instead referring {{to it as a}} flank vent of Mauna Loa; it was not until another geologist, C. E. Dutton, had elaborated on Dana's research during an 1884 expedition that Kīlauea came to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> accepted as a separate entity.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{initially}} moved little, Bret brought prolonged overcast {{conditions to}} much of the northern Bahamas, with most of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. An estimated 3 in (75mm) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 1617. In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48mph (77km/h) {{at the height of the}} storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match. Outer rainbands spawned a waterspout that touched down on eastern Paradise Island, accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents. Nevertheless, locals considered the storm's impact to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> positive, as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation.|$|E
5|$|The Cunard Building's {{architectural}} style can <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> {{described as a}} mix of Italian Renaissance and Greek Revival, {{with a degree of}} Beaux-Arts influence on the building's structural form. Willink and Caldwell's designs were heavily influenced by the work of Italian architect Baldassare Peruzzi and more broadly Italian Renaissance palace design in general, with the Farnese Palace in Rome believed to have been particularly influential. Despite the strong Italian influence, the architects chose to introduce Greek style for the details around the building itself and, as the building itself is larger than the Italian palaces that provided its inspiration, its structural form was prominently based upon American Beaux-Arts buildings such as those in New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{artefacts}} recovered include {{fragments of}} pottery, charcoal, bone and a whetstone (a stone for sharpening blades). Later, on excavation, spinning whorls and weaving combs were found, suggesting textile production, although {{this may have}} been for domestic use rather than industry. Evidence of bronze-casting and iron-smelting were found. Fine jewellery made from bronze bone have also been found showing a high degree of craftsmanship. Files and hammer heads were examined by metallography which showed that carbon compositions were found to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> low. In 1905 an early British tin coin was discovered, believed to be from the 1st century A.D, which was sent to the British Museum. Various other objects from the excavation are also help by the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or {{clusters}} on decaying hardwood logs and stumps (especially oak and chestnut) {{during the spring}} and autumn. The fungus forms a white, woolly mycelium {{on the surface of}} decomposing oak leaves. Occasionally, it can be found growing on a living tree. In eastern North America, it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Missouri, North Carolina, and New York. It has been found in Oregon, but the species appears to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> rare along the Pacific Coast. The range of the fungus also includes Europe, the Canary Islands, North Africa, East Siberia, Japan, Malesia, Turkey, and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses have been found to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E

5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E
5|$|Using one of {{the above}} definitions, dinosaurs can <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> {{described}} as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body. Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and pelycosaurs (especially Dimetrodon), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded {{the size of a}} domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} {{had recently been}} made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to <b>be</b> <b>generally</b> used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. As a result, the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. Its size limited the possible crew to three—a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret—which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as loader for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.|$|E
