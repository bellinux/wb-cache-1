25|$|Therefore, GTR (for four characters, as {{is often}} the case in phylogenetics) {{requires}} 6 substitution rate parameters, as well as 4 equilibrium <b>base</b> <b>frequency</b> parameters. However, this is usually eliminated down to 9 parameters plus , the overall number of substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (=1) only 8 free parameters remain.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the model}} must be time {{reversible}} and must approach the equilibrium nucleotide (base) frequencies at long times, each rate below the diagonal equals the reciprocal rate above the diagonal {{multiplied by the}} equilibrium ratio of the two bases. As such, the nucleotide GTR requires 6 substitution rate parameters and 4 equilibrium <b>base</b> <b>frequency</b> parameters. Since the 4 frequency parameters must sum to 1, there are only 3 free frequency parameters. The total of 9 free parameters is often further reduced to 8 parameters plus , {{the overall number of}} substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (=1) only 8 free parameters remain.|$|E
25|$|The Intel Core {{microarchitecture}} (previously {{known as}} the Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It {{is based on the}} Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 microarchitecture, introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. The high power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as the inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons for which Intel abandoned the NetBurst microarchitecture and switched to completely different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core microarchitecture never reached the clock speeds of the Netburst microarchitecture, even after moving to 45nm lithography; however, after many generations of successor microarchitectures which are developed with the Core as the basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more) Intel managed to surpass the clock speeds of Netburst using the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) microarchitecture which reached a <b>base</b> <b>frequency</b> of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22nm lithography and ultimately derives from the P6 microarchitecture through the Core microarchitecture and many other succeeding improvements.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{calculations}} {{often require}} estimating allele frequencies, which differ across time due to selection and drift. Data were 50, 000 simulated markers and 39, 985 actual markers for 2391 genotyped Holstein bulls. Gene content of relatives and gene <b>frequencies</b> in the <b>base</b> (founder) population were estimated using pedigrees and a linear model. Ancestors born since 1950 were included, {{for a total}} of 22, 088 animals. Because pedigrees were very complete, only one unknown-parent group was used. Convergence to 5 digits of accuracy required about 1000 iterations. Total time was 2 processor days and proportional to number of animals times markers, but actual clock time was reduced by processing loci on separate chromosomes in parallel. Simple allele frequencies were obtained from only the known genotypes. True <b>base</b> <b>frequencies</b> were correlated with estimated <b>base</b> <b>frequencies</b> by 0. 98 versus 0. 94 with simple frequencies. Genomic predictions and inbreeding coefficients were computed in four ways, using true or estimated <b>base</b> <b>frequencies,</b> simple frequencies, or an “estimate” of. 5 for each marker. When allele frequencies estimates were used instead of 0. 5 to assign mixed model coefficients, solutions converged more slowly but predictions were more accurate. From simulated data, realized reliabilities for young bulls were 62. 8 % using either true or estimated <b>base</b> <b>frequencies,</b> 62. 6 % using simple frequencies, and 62. 0 % using frequencies set to 0. 5.

Frequency estimation had small effects on genomic predictions but large effects on genomic inbreeding coefficients in both simulated and real data. Peer reviewe...|$|R
