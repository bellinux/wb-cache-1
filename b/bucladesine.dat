50|$|Recently, {{the effect}} of <b>bucladesine</b> as a cAMP analog has been studied on the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure in the {{wild-type}} mice. The data showed that <b>bucladesine</b> (300nM/mouse) reduced the seizure latency and threshold. In addition they found that combination of <b>bucladesine</b> and pentoxyfillin has additive effect on seizure latency and threshold.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bucladesine</b> (50-100nM/mouse) showed {{significant}} attenuation in the morphine withdrawal syndrome in the wild-type mice. In addition, its high dose (200nM/mouse) combination with H-89, as a protein kinase inhibitor, had additive attenuating effect on withdrawal syndromes.|$|E
50|$|Nardosinone is a {{sesquiterpene}} {{and chemical}} constituent of Nardostachys jatamansi. In in vitro studies, the compound has demonstrated concentration-dependent enhancement of <b>bucladesine</b> and staurosporine-induced neurite outgrowth. Nardosinone has similarly {{been demonstrated to}} enhance NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis from PC12D cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bucladesine</b> is a cell {{permeable}} cAMP analog. The compound {{is used in}} a {{wide variety}} of research applications because it mimics cAMP and can induce normal physiological responses when added to cells in experimental conditions. cAMP is only able to elicit minimal responses in these situations.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{an inflammatory}} demyelinating disease {{that leads to}} neuronal cell loss. Cyclic AMP and its analogs are well known to decrease inflammation and apoptosis. In the present study, we {{examined the effects of}} <b>bucladesine,</b> a cell-permeable analogue of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), on myelin proteins (PLP, PMP- 22), inflammation, and apoptotic, as well as anti-apoptotic factors in cuprizone model of demyelination. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed with chow containing 0. 2 % copper chelator cuprizone or vehicle by daily oral gavage for 5 weeks to induce reversible demyelination predominantly of the corpus callosum. <b>Bucladesine</b> was administered intraperitoneally at different doses (0. 24, 0. 48, or 0. 7 Î¼g/kg body weight) during the last 7 days of 5 -week cuprizone treatment. <b>Bucladesine</b> exhibited a protective effect on myelination. Furthermore, <b>bucladesine</b> significantly decreased the production of interleukin- 6 pro-inflammatory mediator as well as nuclear factor-ÎºB activation and reduced the mean number of apoptotic cells compared to cuprizone-treated mice. <b>Bucladesine</b> also decreased production of caspase- 3 as well as Bax and increased Bcl- 2 levels. Our data revealed that enhancement of intracellular cAMP prevents demyelination and plays anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in mice cuprizone model of demyelination. This suggests the modulation of intracellular cAMP as a potential target for treatment of MS. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|Anti-inflammatory {{therapeutic}} {{options for}} the topical treatment of skin diseases with inflammatory or allergic contribution are mostly limited to topical glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors. Both compound classes induce adverse effects. Elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 was shown to induce potent anti-inflammatory effects, but the safety profile of currently available compounds is not sufficient. A different approach to increase intracellular cAMP is the substitution of chemically stabilized cAMP analogues. <b>Bucladesine</b> is a stabilized cAMP analogue with an excellent safety profile which had been marketed as topical treatment of impaired wound healing. In the current study, a novel water free emulsion containing <b>bucladesine</b> was evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects. In the arachidonic acid induced ear oedema model in mice, single or multiple administration of an emulsion containing 1. 5 % was capable of significantly reducing the inflammatory oedema. The data indicate that <b>bucladesine</b> represents an interesting treatment option for skin diseases where an anti-inflammatory activity is indicated. Due to the established clinical safety, this agent may {{bridge the gap between}} potent agents such as glucocorticoids or calcineurin inhibitors and emollients without active compounds...|$|E
