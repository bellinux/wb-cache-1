50|$|<b>Betula</b> <b>utilis</b> (Himalayan birch, bhojpatra, भूर्ज bhūrja) is a birch tree {{native to}} the Himalayas, growing at {{elevations}} up to 4500 m.

The white, paper-like bark of the tree was used in ancient times for writing Sanskrit scriptures and texts. It is still used as paper for the writing of sacred mantras, with the bark placed in an amulet and worn for protection. Selected varieties are used for landscaping throughout the world, even while some areas of its native habitat are being lost due to overuse of the tree for firewood.|$|E
50|$|Doorenbos {{started his}} career as a nursery {{representative}} in 1915, visiting the UK and United States. His long career was distinguished by the raising of a number of important cultivars, including Symphoricarpos × doorenbosii, <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis</b> 'Doorenbos', and numerous Dahlias. Perhaps his most famous achievement was the hybrid elm cultivar 'Den Haag', indeed it has been postulated that {{he was the first to}} think of crossing elms to obtain varieties resistant to Dutch elm disease. Doorenbos was also responsible for the introduction of the Himalayan Elm Ulmus wallichiana to Europe, cuttings of which he obtained from the Arnold Arboretum in 1929; the species was later to play a major role in the Dutch elm breeding programme.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} types {{present in}} the Hirpora Wildlife Sanctuary include western mixed coniferous forests, deciduous sub-alpine scrub forests and sub-alpine pastures. Western mixed coniferous forest is dominated by Kail pine with spruce and fir (Abies pindrow) as its primary associates. The West Himalayan sub-alpine forests are dominated by fir, while the deciduous sub-alpine scrub is dominated by Himalayan birch (<b>Betula</b> <b>utilis)</b> and juniper (Juniperus communis) with wild rose as an associate. The southeastern part has moderately open coniferous vegetation dominated by Kail pine and associated with fir and spruce. The vegetation of the more rocky and open northwestern portion is predominantly sub-alpine scrub forest dominated by juniper and the Kail pine as an associated species. Man-made sub-alpine pastures also occur in both north-western and south-eastern parts of the sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation in Kazinag is {{dominated}} by coniferous forests with deodar (Cedrus deodara) at lower altitudes, fir (Abies pindrow), spruce (Picea smithiana) at middle to upper elevations and kail (Pinus wallichiana) is widely distributed from lower to upper elevations. Birch (<b>Betula</b> <b>utilis)</b> occur mainly in the subalpine zone whereas the other broad leaved forests including Prunus and Acer which occur in middle elevations and the horse chestnut (Aesculus indica) strands are distributed in lower elevations mainly along streams. The temperate scrub occurs at middle and lower elevations and {{is dominated}} by Indigofera, Spirea and Rosa.

50|$|Based on revised {{classification}} of Champion and Seth (1968), some 13 vegetation types are represented (Bacha,1986). In general, silver fir 'Abies pindrow' and spruce 'Picea wallichian', mixed with cedar Cedrus deodar and blue pine Pinus griffithii are predominant from 2,400m to 3,000m. Notable {{is the small}} expanse of chilgoza pine Pinus geradiana in the Dachan Range. At lower altitudes (1,700-2,400m) occur nearly pure stands of cedar and blue pine, and moist temperate deciduous forest, represented by horsechestnut, Aesculus indica, walnut Juglans regia, maple, Acer spp. poplar, Populus ciliata, hazel Corylus cornutam bird cherry Pasus corfnuta, ash Fraxinus cornuta and yew Taxus wallichiana. The sub-alpine zone, from 3,000m to the tree line at 3,700m, supports mostly silver fir and birch <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis</b> forest and this merges with birch -rhododendron Rhododendron campanulatum scrub, above which is alpine pasture.|$|E
30|$|Farmers and herders {{reported}} that <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis,</b> Cotoneaster nummularia and Myrsine africana are rapidly decreasing. <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis</b> {{is located in}} high pastures, in patches usually above tree line and is frequently used as fuel at uplands by landless herders when no other woody species are available, whereas Cotoneaster nummularia and Myrsine africana are the much preferred shrubs available in the lowland scrub areas, and hence are over-utilized due to repeated defoliation and shrinking habitat for the livestock of transhumant herders. <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis</b> is becoming rare, and although the Cotoneaster nummularia and Myrsine africana are still frequent in lowland areas, these species are decreasing rapidly.|$|E

Here, we performed bio-guided fractionation of <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis</b> Bark (BUB), in which it was extracted in methanol and fractionated with hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, n-butanol and water. All six fractions were evaluated for their in-vitro anticancer activity in nine different cancer cell lines and ethyl acetate fraction was found to be one of the most potent fractions in terms of inducing cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. By utilizing column chromatography, six triterpenes namely betulin, betulinic acid, lupeol, ursolic acid (UA), oleanolic acid and β-amyrin have been isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of BUB and structures of these compounds were unraveled by spectroscopic methods. β-amyrin and UA were isolated for the first time from <b>Betula</b> <b>utilis.</b> Isolated triterpenes were tested for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against six different cancer cell lines where UA was found to be selective for breast cancer cells over non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF 10 A).
