50|$|Russell Island {{is known}} for the infamous land scams of the early 1970s, when many of the islands farms were divided into over 20,000 blocks. At the time, the area, with a {{population}} of less than 500, did not have a local authority enforcing planning regulations. Heavily advertised and sold off by unscrupulous vendors, these blocks were often not where the unwary customers thought they were <b>buying.</b> <b>It</b> <b>all</b> rode on the vague promise of a bridge from the National Party government at the time. Media reports exposing the scam pointed to blocks that were underwater at high tide and the lack of public land.|$|R

5000|$|The Domostroy, a Russian advice book of {{the sixteenth}} century for upper classes, {{includes}} advice to set aside property for purposes of a dowry, and use it to accumulate linens, clothing, and other things for it, rather than have to suddenly <b>buy</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for the wedding; if the daughter should happen to die, the dowry should be used to give alms and for prayers for her soul, although some might be set aside for other daughters. [...] In late Tsarist Russia the dowry originally consisted of clothing for the bride, linen, and bedding. [...] Linen became less common, a fact blamed on poor flax harvest and girls being poor spinners, but emphasis was added to the finest of the clothing, and a money dowry was sometimes added, particularly if the bride was regarded as having some fault. [...] Prospective in-laws, usually concerned mostly with her working ability, grew more concerned about a money dowry.|$|E

Mr. Brumley, concealing that wild elation, that sense of a joyous rebirth, that only the liquidation of nearly all one's possessions can give, was firm but not excessive.

Merriman advertised in the newspapers and went out to the farms, ranches and docks to let local producers know he wanted whatever they had. “We’re in this together,” he told them, “If you grow it or catch <b>it,</b> I’ll <b>buy</b> <b>it,</b> and we <b>all</b> succeed.” Pretty soon he had built solid partnerships and local producers would try to get or grow whatever he needed.|$|R
60|$|What {{amazed me}} {{for a week or}} two, was to see, in this prodigious plenty of cattle, and dearth of human creatures, and want of bread, as well as money to <b>buy</b> <b>it,</b> that <b>all</b> kind of flesh-meat should be monstrously dear, beyond what was ever known in this kingdom. I thought it a defect in the laws, that there was not some {{regulation}} in the price of flesh, as well as bread: but I imagine myself to have guessed out the reason: In short, I am apt to think that the whole kingdom is overstocked with cattle, both black and white; and as it is observed, that the poor Irish have a vanity to be rather owners of two lean cows, than one fat, although with double the charge of grazing, and but half the quantity of milk; so I conceive it much more difficult at present to find a fat bullock or wether, than it would be if half of both were fairly knocked on the head: for I am assured that the district in the several markets called Carrion Row is as reasonable as the poor can desire; only the circumstance of money to purchase it, and of trade, or labour, to purchase that money, are indeed wholly wanting.|$|R

A second circuit, which is an edge triggered memory cell, indicates which input signal leads the other. This information is displayed by light emitting diodes.

5000|$|Janet Maslin {{writing in}} The New York Times felt {{the film was}} at its most, [...] "pleasantly {{innocuous}} when it doesn't strain itself {{with that kind of}} moralizing and instead concentrates on the logistical nightmare of elephant-moving. Beyond that, it doesn't have much plot, but the idea of tossing an elephant out of an airplane certainly makes for adequate suspense." [...] In comparison to other films, Maslin thought, [...] "The model for this is a lot closer to [...] "McHale's Navy," [...] which is mentioned here, than it is to [...] "Platoon." [...] But in the end, this generally lighthearted Vietnam caper does try to teach a lesson of sorts, since the gift of an elephant becomes a form of war reparations." [...] In a mostly positive review, Joe Leydon writing in Variety, felt Operation Dumbo Drop was [...] "a well-crafted and entertaining pic with broad, cross-generational appeal." [...] and that [...] "Glover is well cast and establishes an effectively edgy give-and-take with Liotta." [...] He also reserved praise for [...] "Russell Boyd's splendid cinematography and Rick Lazzarini's convincing animatronics." [...] Film critic Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a thumbs down review gruffly calling it, [...] "preposterous" [...] and saying [...] "I'm not <b>buying</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way through." [...] He also ridiculed the outdoor market scene as [...] "the world's most dangerous profession in the movies; selling fruit on a city street." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive [...] "B Grade" [...] rating and viewed the film as a [...] "concept, supposedly based on a true story, is weird — this is what Vietnam movies have come to? But at least the Disney quadruped has the grace to say nothing, and Leary, still an interesting motormouth, knows enough not to smoke or swear when there are elephants around." [...] Peter Stack writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, saw the film as [...] "not the terrible movie that its ubiquitous trailers would indicate. But it is an odd one," [...] and that [...] "Glover and Liotta, though not exactly great comic actors, play off each other with real spark, the two vying for command of the outlandish mission to deliver the elephant across 200 miles of impossible jungle terrain to the mountain village." ...|$|R
