5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E

40|$|Citing Governor <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt's</b> {{proclamation}} declaring December "Flood Awareness Month," Wesley Steiner, Department of Water Resources Director, and Charles Ott, Director of the Division of Emergency Services, {{have urged}} Arizonans {{to be aware}} of possible flood hazards and {{to take advantage of the}} National Flood Insurance Program. The program was established by Congress to enable property owners to purchase flood insurance at reasonable rates. Policies are available through any Arizona licensed insurance agent or broker...|$|R
50|$|<b>Bruce</b> Edward <b>Babbitt</b> (born June 27, 1938) is an American {{politician}} {{from the}} state of Arizona. A member of the Democratic Party, Babbitt served as the 16th governor of Arizona from 1978 to 1987, and as the United States Secretary of the Interior from 1993 through 2001.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> {{served as}} the U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1993 to 2001. As the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt was {{responsible}} for overseeing several government agencies, which included the FWS.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, 2000, Secretary of the Interior <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> {{designated}} the Wildlife Refuge as the Battle of Midway National Memorial. The refuge is now titled as the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial.|$|E
25|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2004 campaign, the Democratic Party in Arizona tapped Paul Babbitt, Coconino County commissioner and the brother of <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt,</b> {{to run for the}} seat and pressured all other candidates with the exception of political unknown Bob Donahue to bow out of the primary in order to clear the way for Babbitt to run against Renzi without a costly primary contest. Paul Babbitt's campaign was named a top national priority by most major Democratic fundraisers and liberal weblogs, because a plurality of Arizona 1st Congressional District voters are registered Democrats and because Renzi won so narrowly in 2002. Unlike the Cordova campaign in 2002, which received only token support from the national Democratic Party organizations, the Babbitt campaign received major support; nonetheless, it was unable to match Renzi's fundraising.|$|E
5000|$|ZUM was {{threatened}} in 2004 when the Seattle Monorail Project (SMP) planned {{to condemn the}} health club's building and redevelop the site as a monorail station. The monorail said [...] "just compensation" [...] for condemnation only applied to {{the owner of the}} property, Clise, and it would only pay ZUM's [...] "relocation fees and up to $50,000 in related expenses." [...] Standing to lose his nearly $900,000 investment in tenant improvements, founder Peter Shmock hired attorney <b>Bruce</b> P. <b>Babbitt</b> and began litigation.|$|R
500|$|Starting in 1993, the Pequot began {{negotiations}} to purchase additional lands and convey those lands to the Department of Interior in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. Local towns sued the tribes to prevent this. [...] In 1996 and 1998, the Interior Department, under Secretary <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt,</b> approved the tribe's request to put [...] and , respectively, into trust. [...] The Supreme Court's decision in Carcieri v. Salazar (2009) prevents any further such transfers.|$|E
500|$|On October 3, Governor <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> {{declared}} a state of emergency. Concerns arose regarding the state of several areas and possible disruptions in the delivery of food and other supplies. President Ronald Reagan declared Arizona counties Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz and Yavapai a [...] "major disaster area" [...] on October 5. About $650,000 worth of government aid was provided to victims of Octave. Babbitt also toured the devastated area. Officials also opened 15 shelters, which housed 2,905 people.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{decided to}} run for United States Senator from Arizona in 1986, when {{longtime}} American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater retired. [...] No Republican would oppose McCain in the primary, and according to his press secretary Torie Clarke, McCain's political strength convinced his most formidable possible Democratic opponent, Governor <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt,</b> not to run for the seat. [...] Instead McCain faced a weaker opponent, former state legislator Richard Kimball, a young politician with an offbeat personality who slept on his office floor and whom McCain's allies in the Arizona press characterized as having [...] "terminal weirdness." [...] McCain's associations with Duke Tully, who by now had been disgraced for having concocted a fictitious military record, as well as revelations of father-in-law Jim Hensley's past brushes with the law, became campaign issues.|$|E
500|$|In Arizona, {{the highest}} {{rainfall}} total was [...] at Mount Graham. In Tucson, flood waters were reportedly 8ft (2.4 m) high. Throughout the state, excessive rainfall caused many rivers to overflow. After the rain ended, the Santa Cruz, Rillito, and Gila rivers experienced their highest crests on record. Five towns [...] Clifton, Duncan, Winkelman, Hayden, and Marana [...] were almost completely flooded. In Marana, many homes were submerged, forcing residents to be evacuated. Over 700homes were destroyed in Clifton. In addition, 86 of the town's 126business were heavily damaged {{due to the}} flooding. Around 3,000buildings were destroyed due to Octave. A total of 853houses, mobile homes, and apartments were destroyed while 2,052others were damaged. About 10,000people were temporarily left homeless. Damage in Arizona totaled $500million (1983USD), which was above the preliminary estimate of $300million. Fourteen people drowned and 975persons were injured. Elsewhere, Octave was responsible for $12.5million in damage in New Mexico. Following the storm, governor <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> {{declared a state of}} emergency. President Ronald Reagan declared Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz and Yavapai counties a [...] "major disaster area".|$|E
500|$|Arizona is one {{of seven}} states which {{does not have a}} {{lieutenant}} governor; instead, {{in the event of a}} vacancy in the office of governor, the Secretary of State, if elected, succeeds to the office. If the secretary of state was appointed, rather than elected, or is otherwise ineligible to hold the office of governor, the first elected and eligible person in the line of succession assumes the office. [...] The state constitution specifies the line of succession to be the Secretary of State, Attorney General, State Treasurer and Superintendent of Public Instruction, in that order. [...] If the governor is out of the state or impeached, the next elected officer in the line of succession becomes acting governor until the governor returns or is cleared. The line of succession has gone beyond secretary of state once, when <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt,</b> as attorney general, became governor upon the death of Wesley Bolin; the secretary of state at the time, Rose Mofford, was an appointee to replace Bolin, who himself had succeeded to the office due to the resignation of his predecessor, Raul Hector Castro. Mofford would later succeed Evan Mecham as acting governor when he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and as governor when he was convicted by the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Twenty-two {{people have}} served as {{governor}} over 26 distinct terms. All of the repeat governors were in the state's earliest years, when George W. P. Hunt and Thomas Edward Campbell alternated as governor for 17 years and, after a two-year gap, Hunt served another term. One governor, Evan Mecham, was successfully impeached, and one, Fife Symington III, resigned upon being convicted of a felony. The longest-serving governor was Hunt, who was elected seven times and served just under fourteen years. The longest single stint was that of <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt,</b> who was elected to two four-year terms after succeeding to the office {{following the death of}} his predecessor, Wesley Bolin, serving nearly nine years total. Bolin had the shortest tenure, dying less than five months after succeeding as governor. Four governors were actually born in Arizona: Campbell, Sidney Preston Osborn, Rose Mofford, and Babbitt. Arizona has had four female governors, the most in the United States, and is also the only state where female governors have served consecutively. Because of a string of deaths in office, resignations, and an impeachment, Arizona has not had a governor whose term began and ended because of [...] "normal" [...] election circumstances since Jack Williams was in office (1967–1975).|$|E
500|$|Hurricane Andrew struck Miami in 1992, with catastrophic {{damage to}} Homestead Air Force Base in Homestead. A plan to {{rejuvenate}} {{the property in}} 1993 and convert it into a commercial airport was met with enthusiasm from local municipal and commercial entities hoping to recoup $480million and 11,000jobs lost in the local community by the destruction and subsequent closing of the base. On March 31, 1994, the base was designated as a reserve base, functioning only part-time. A cursory environmental study performed by the Air Force was deemed insufficient by local conservation groups, who threatened to sue in order to halt the acquisition when estimates of 650flights a day were projected. Groups had previously been alarmed in 1990 by the inclusion of Homestead Air Force Base {{on a list of}} the U.S. Government's most polluted properties. Their concerns also included noise, and the inevitable collisions with birds using the mangrove forests as rookeries. The Air Force base is located between Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, giving it the potential to cause harm to both. In 2000, Secretary of the Interior <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> {{and the director of the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expressed their opposition to the project, despite other Clinton Administration agencies previously working to ensure the base would be turned over to local agencies quickly and smoothly as [...] "a model of base disposal".|$|E

[...] Five were charged, and three were convicted and sentenced to, respectively, 5 years for armed robbery, 3 and a half years for aggravated assault, and 30 days for assaulting a law enforcement officer.|$|E
2500|$|A {{founding}} member of the Democratic Leadership Council {{and the chairman of the}} Democratic Governors Association in 1985, Babbitt sought the Democratic Party's 1988 nomination for President of the United States. Among his proposals was a national sales tax to remedy the then-record budget deficits piled up during the several past administrations. He enjoyed positive press attention (called a [...] "boomlet" [...] in USA Today), but after finishing out of the top tier of candidates in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, he dropped out of the race. In an intentional reference to Richard Nixon (who said after losing the California governorship in the 1962 election that the press [...] "won't have [...] to kick around anymore"), Babbitt joked in his last campaign press conference that the media [...] "won't have <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> to puff up anymore." [...] The Washington Post reported that Babbitt dropped this line from the prepared text of his withdrawal speech.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Arizona Governor <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt,</b> a Democrat, {{created a}} paid state MLK holiday in Arizona by {{executive}} order {{just before he}} left office, but in 1987, his Republican successor Evan Mecham, citing an attorney general's opinion that Babbitt's order was illegal, reversed Babbitt's decision days after taking office. Later that year, Mecham proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be [...] "Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day" [...] in Arizona, albeit as an unpaid holiday. In 1990, Arizona voters were {{given the opportunity to}} vote on giving state employees a paid MLK holiday. That same year, the National Football League threatened to move Super Bowl XXVII, which was planned for Arizona in 1993, if the MLK holiday was voted down. In the November election, the voters were offered two King Day options: Proposition 301, which replaced Columbus Day on the list of paid state holidays, and Proposition 302, which merged Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays into one paid holiday to make room for MLK Day. Both measures failed to pass, with only 49% of voters approving Prop 302, the more popular of the two options; although some who voted [...] "no" [...] on 302 voted [...] "yes" [...] on Prop 301. Consequently, the state lost the chance to host Super Bowl XXVII, which was subsequently held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. In a 1992 referendum, the voters, this time given only one option for a paid King Day, approved state-level recognition of the holiday.|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 1984 NFL owners {{voted to}} give Irsay {{permission}} {{to move his}} franchise {{to the city of}} his choosing. Irsay continued discussions with several cities hungry for an NFL franchise (New York City, Phoenix, Arizona, Indianapolis, Indiana, Birmingham, Alabama, Jacksonville, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee) eventually narrowing the list of cities to two, Phoenix and Indianapolis. In January 1984, Baltimore's mayor Schaefer stated, [...] "We're not going to build a new stadium. We do not have the bonding capacity. We don't have the voters or taxpayer who can support a $60 million stadium. One-third of the people in Baltimore pay taxes. Unless private enterprise builds it, we won't build it." [...] The Phoenix Metropolitan Sports Foundation, headed by real estate developer Eddie Lynch, along with Arizona Governor <b>Bruce</b> <b>Babbitt</b> and other top Arizona officials, had secretly met with Irsay early in January 1984. Preliminary talks seemed promising. Phoenix was offering a below market rate $15 million loan and rent-free use of the 71,000 seat Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University. (Sun Devil Stadium would later serve as the home to the Arizona Cardinals from 1988 to 2005 after the team moved there from St. Louis, Missouri; that team has since moved into University of Phoenix Stadium within that market.) A second meeting was scheduled between Irsay and the Phoenix group. But when word of a second scheduled meeting leaked out and was reported by the media on the Friday before the Super Bowl, Irsay canceled. Meanwhile, Indianapolis and local real estate developer Robert Welch, were lobbying the NFL to bring an expansion team to the city, with Welch as team owner. Welch also had personal discussions with New Orleans Saints owner John Mecom about buying the team and moving it to Indianapolis.|$|E
