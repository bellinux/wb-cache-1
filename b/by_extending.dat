Spanish forces began a siege and bombardment of Gibraltar the following month, causing severe damage through intensive cannon fire.

5|$|Nemerteans {{generally}} move slowly, {{though they}} have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move <b>by</b> <b>extending</b> the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object.|$|E
5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly.

5|$|The Maratha {{redeployment}} was swifter {{and more}} efficient than Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted <b>by</b> <b>extending</b> his front to deny Pohlmann the opportunity to outflank him. A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders, which formed {{the right of the}} first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then– operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye– throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms, including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using recirculating excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. Waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining waste is compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 kilowatt peak has been installed on one of the roof tops.

5|$|This {{and related}} {{predictions}} follow {{from the fact}} that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity. As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived <b>by</b> <b>extending</b> the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.|$|E
