5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a <b>bronchodilator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} <b>bronchodilator,</b> a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bronchodilators</b> are {{the first}} line therapy during acute {{asthmatic}} exacerbations to reverse airway obstruction primarily by relaxing airway smooth muscle. Only three categories of <b>bronchodilators</b> exist in clinical practice: -adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics, and methylxanthines. Each of these categories have specific drugs {{dating back to the}} early 20 th century, raising {{the question of whether or}} not we can find better <b>bronchodilators.</b> While caffeine, theophylline, atropine, and epinephrine were the first generations of therapeutics in each of these drug classes, there is no question that improvements have been made in the <b>bronchodilators</b> in each of these classes.

40|$|Experimental studies {{indicate}} that airway calibre increases {{the sensitivity of the}} afferents involved in the cough reflex but it has proved difficult to demonstrate that airway calibre increases the sensitivity of the afferents involved in the cough reflex. Therefore, <b>bronchodilators</b> might have a role, although rather minor, in the treatment of cough. However, although <b>bronchodilators</b> represent the standard of care in the treatment of airway obstruction associated with asthma or COPD, controversy persists regarding the mechanism(s) by which these agents alleviate cough. Furthermore, the available evidence indicates that the effects of <b>bronchodilators</b> on cough are rather inconsistent in humans and casts doubt on the appropriateness of the common practice of using <b>bronchodilators</b> in the treatment of patients with cough without any other evidence of airway obstruction. Regrettably, appropriate long-term trials specifically aimed at evaluating the clinical efficacy of <b>bronchodilators</b> in pathologic cough have not yet been performed. Therefore, properly executed clinical studies of <b>bronchodilators</b> in various types of acute and chronic pathologic cough are required...|$|R
25|$|Salbutamol's low {{toxicity}} makes it safe for other animals {{and thus is}} the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species. It is usually used to treat bronchospasm or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a <b>bronchodilator</b> in horses with recurrent airway obstruction; {{it can also be}} used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of the {{epiglottis}} {{is known}} as epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. A person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. For this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered a medical emergency, {{because of the risk}} of obstruction of the pharynx. Epiglottitis is often managed with antibiotics, racemic epinephrine (a sympathomimetic <b>bronchodilator</b> that is delivered by aerosol), and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing is difficult. Behind the root of the tongue is an epiglottic vallecula which is an important anatomical landmark in intubation.|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). It seems he adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues {{and ought to}} be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the <b>bronchodilator</b> effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E

25|$|Catecholamine receptors {{persisted in}} this {{wavering}} state {{for more than}} forty years. Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the ergot alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their <b>bronchodilator</b> effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
25|$|Although current {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} {{in a controlled}} hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices {{that can be used}} easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, allopurinol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and allopurinol have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane, {{to be used as a}} <b>bronchodilator</b> that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic information based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. Mechanistic studies may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.|$|E

40|$|Patients with obstructive {{lung disease}} often require {{ventilatory}} support via invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, {{depending on the}} severity of the exacerbation.

The inhaled <b>bronchodilators</b> most commonly used in ICUs are beta adrenergic agonists and anticholinergics.
