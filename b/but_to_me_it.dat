I'm not a fanatic on liquor, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> is a medicine. I keep {{it around and}} take it when I need it. But {{there is no excuse}} whatever for tobacco or drugs".

500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was so much bullshit. The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we {{on the front line}} were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E
500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, {{but it is hard}} to see why it should be so neglected, and at least two poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E

500|$|Holmes's {{academic}} {{interests and}} hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He {{was elected to}} the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. [...] "I am sick at heart of this place and almost everything connected to it", he wrote. [...] "I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> was over. As I said to the Monaco officials, I only wanted to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E

So {{in and of itself}} I think it’s a very tight, proficient and action-packed comic that really tapped into that early 90s anti-hero vibe. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was never Death’s Head.

Reviewer Graham Templeton wrote that [...] "This isn't actually crucial in any way, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it's</b> {{one of the}} most quintessential B5 episodes of all. War, emotion, and multiple political battles fought {{in and out of the}} diplomatic arena. This is the sort of television which simply does not exist anywhere else." ...|$|R

[...] "I didn't really have that much fun doing it," [...] grumbled singer Chris Robinson. [...] "It was alright, and Jimmy's a phenomenal guitarist, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was just a job.

2500|$|Bloc Party later praised [...] "Peek-a-Boo", {{which their}} singer Kele Okereke described: [...] "It sounded {{like nothing else}} on this planet. This is just a pop song that they put {{out in the middle}} of their career that nobody knows about, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> sounded like the most current but most futuristic bit of guitar-pop music I've heard." [...] DeVotchKa later covered [...] "The Last Beat of My Heart" [...] at the {{suggestion}} of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler. The Decemberists also listed [...] "The Last Beat of My Heart" [...] as one of their favorite Siouxsie and the Banshees songs. Peepshow was also one of the albums Nic Offer of the band [...] ("Chk Chk Chk"), listened to the most during his formative years.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the speech}} Obama {{and his wife}} were interviewed by Brian Williams, and when asked about what she thought, Michelle replied, [...] "And all I have to say is, honey, you didn't screw it up, so good job." [...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight." [...] She was later quoted by a journalist: [...] "I was a little amazed. It was really quite an exceptional speech, or I'm being prejudiced, I don't know. <b>But,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> was really quite exceptional." ...|$|E
5000|$|Eckersley {{announced}} his retirement in December 1998. He commented on his career, saying, [...] "I had a good run.

5000|$|Jett {{felt that}} the film {{captured}} 1970s Los Angeles, [...] "that music, that sort of combination of glam and intensity" [...] well, but said [...] "initially it was mischaracterized, because {{at first it was}} called a 'biopic', which implies that it's going to be a literal reading of the action. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it's</b> more of a parallel narrative of The Runaways. It's based on Cherie's book, so it definitely comes from her perspective and focuses more on probably the two of us and Kim." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2014 {{interview}} with Ireland’s Newstalk radio, Zara further attempted {{to clarify the}} controversy. It’s possible to create art from joy, he said, but it’s art created from adversity that is most often the art worth paying attention to: [...] "You can have that impulse to create whether you’ve been through a tragedy or not, obviously. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it's</b> like, if you don't struggle to create your art in some way, why do I care about <b>it?</b> ... <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it’s</b> like, 'Tell <b>me</b> something.

2500|$|Several writers {{noted that}} her success {{seemed to have}} made real her {{appearance}} in the BBC comedy Extras, in which she played a fictionalized version of herself desperate to win an Academy Award. In the episode, Winslet decided to increase her chance of winning an Oscar through starring in a film about the Holocaust, noting that such films were often awarded Oscars. However, in the fictional film, Winslet played a nun sheltering children from the Holocaust, rather than one of its perpetrators. Regarding the similarity, Winslet commented that the similarity [...] "would be funny" [...] but the connection didn't occur to her until [...] "midway through shooting the film...this was never a Holocaust movie to me. That's {{part of the story}} and provides something of a backdrop, and sets the scene. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> was always an extraordinarily unconventional love story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of a Southern continent is confidently asserted on the hemispheres shown [...] in the pamphlet, which bear the inscription in Latin which translates:"This part of the coastline that has been revealed to us by voyages is not yet evident". A paragraph in the text explains: To the south, land {{has been found in}} two places south of America toward the South Pole, stretching in longitude 43 degrees westward, to latitude south sometimes to 54, sometimes 53, sometimes 55 degrees as the topography reveals. Moreover in the year 1526 a land has been discovered at 0 degrees longitude and 52 degrees south latitude, parts of which are empty of inhabitants. The rest of the Austral coasts still lie in obscurity, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> seems very likely that that part of the Earth is not overspread and covered by the Ocean. Indeed it is conjectured and argued that vast and extensive regions and islands lie there, but because of the distances between places and the infertile nature of the soil, they are less frequented.|$|E
2500|$|The Banshees {{continue}} to influence younger musicians. Singer James Murphy {{was marked by}} certain Banshees albums during his childhood. His band LCD Soundsystem covered [...] "Slowdive" [...] as a B-side to the single [...] "Disco Infiltrator". The Beta Band sampled [...] "Painted Bird" [...] on their track [...] "Liquid Bird" [...] from the Heroes to Zeros album. TV on the Radio said that they have always {{tried to make a}} song that begins like [...] "Kiss Them for Me" [...] where all of a sudden, there's an [...] "element of surprise" [...] with [...] "a giant drum coming in". Electronica singer Santigold based one of her songs around the music of [...] "Red Light". [...] "'My Superman' is an interpolation of 'Red Light'", she explained. [...] Indie folk group DeVotchKa covered the ballad [...] "The Last Beat of My Heart" [...] at the suggestion of Arcade Fire singer Win Butler; it was released on the Curse Your Little Heart EP. Gossip named the Banshees as one of their major influences during the promotion of their single [...] "Heavy Cross". British indie band Bloc Party took inspiration from [...] "Peek-a-Boo" [...] and their singer Kele Okereke stated about that Banshees' single: [...] "it sounded like nothing else on this planet. This is just a pop song that they put {{out in the middle of}} their career that nobody knows about, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> sounded like the most current but most futuristic bit of guitar-pop music I've heard".

5000|$|Author Gerald Posner {{profiled}} Odio as an {{unreliable witness}} {{and one who}} has a histrionic personality disorder. Posner, a defender of the Warren Report, discredited Odio's character by revealing portions of her psychiatric history and accounts of what her friends told him. Specifically, Posner mentioned Odio's hysterical fainting spells and {{that she is a}} divorcee who left a fractious marriage. Odio's psychiatrist, Dr. Burton Einspruch, told the House Select Committee [...] "Let me say, consciously, I don’t think she would want <b>to</b> lie, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it’s</b> very conceivable that in the histrionic personality, the kind of personality that she had that where she would not lie, she could be — has a degree of suggestibility that she could believe something that did not really transpire." ...|$|R

2500|$|The second {{occasion}} {{happened during}} the period 1965–1975 in New York City, as musicians of Cuban and Puerto-Rican origin combined to produce the great music of the post Cha-cha-cha period. This music acquired the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised what a benefit {{it was to have}} a common label for son, mambo, guaracha, guajira, guaguancó, etc. Cubans and non Cubans, such as Tito Puente, Rubén Blades and many experts of the Cuban music and salsa have always said [...] "Salsa is just another name for Cuban, music. Tito Puentes once said, now they call it Salsa, later they may call it Stir Fry, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> will alway be Cuban Music"; but over time salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 1960s Willie Colón developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. New York radio programmes offered 'salsarengue' as a further combination. You look at a band of the 1940s playing Cuban music and you will see the same exact instruments in Salsa Music. Later still 'Salsa romantica' was the label for an especially sugary type of bolero. Even when, Benny Moré, Perez Prado the greatest Sonero that ever existed, was singing Boleros with a salsa cadence in the 1940s. It was not until the 1950s that Cuban music became popular for Puerto Rican bands. Plena, Bomba an other styles or music were popular at the time in Puerto Rico. Many famous Puerto Rican musicians went to learn the music styles of Cubans in the 1930s and 1940s, and {{it was not until the}} arrival of Castro in 1959 and the Cuban music stopped its exportation to the world, that Puerto Ricans in New York were able to be greatly noticed, but what is known as Salsa today, was brought to New York in the 1920s and 1930s by Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo, this last one was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie as he was one of the greatest percussionist that ever lived.|$|E
