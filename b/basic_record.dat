40|$|East Asia's {{financial}} crisis has been attributed {{in part to}} the weak performance and risky financial structures of Asian corporations. In the period before Asia's {{financial crisis}}, however, analysts were not suggesting that the financial structure of many East Asian corporations would be unable to withstand the combined shocks of increased interest rates, depreciated currencies, and large drops in domestic demand. To document the <b>basic</b> <b>record</b> of corporate performance and financing structures for East Asian corporations, the authors analyze data for 5, 550 firms in nine countries for the period 1988 - 96. They find large differences in performance and financial structure across countries. Profitability - as measured by real return on assets (ROA) in local currency [...] was relatively low in Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore in the decade before the crisis. Corporations in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand averaged high returns - roughly double those in Germany and the United States for the same period. In 1994 - 96, measured performance declined somewhat in several East Asian countries, especially Japan and Korea. Those differences in performance were not fully reflected in sales growth, as investment rates were high and continued to drive output growth in all countries. These stylized facts suggest that the East Asian miracle was indeed based on a vibrant corporate sector. But the combination of high investment and relatively low profitability in some countries meant that much external financing was needed. Outside equity was used sparingly - in part because stock markets were depressed (Japan) or because insiders preferred to retain control - so borrowing was heavy in most East Asian countries, and leverage increased in the years before 1996 in Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. Risk increased as short-term (foreign exchange) borrowing became increasingly important in the 1990 s, especially in Malaysia, Taiwan (China), and Thailand. In other words, it is now apparent that some of the vulnerabilities in corporate financial structures that were to become an important factor in East Asia's financial crisis already existed in the early 1990 s, although they were not noted at the time.

40|$|Cilj ove doktorske disertacije je bio izraditi model sustava informacija o hrvatskoj znanstvenoj djelatnosti za potrebe hrvatske akademske i istraživačke zajednice koji će sadržavati strukturirane opise njezinih temeljnih sastavnica, a u isto vrijeme i omogućavati otvoreni pristup rezultatima znanstvenih istraživanja. Na temelju proučene literature, primjera dobre prakse u Sloveniji, Norveškoj i Nizozemskoj, snimke i analize postojećeg stanja u Hrvatskoj te autorovog viđenja informacijske arhitekture i potrebnih funkcionalnosti jednog takvog sustava, predložen je model sustava informacija o hrvatskoj znanstvenoj djelatnosti koji na djelotvoran način opisuje i međusobno povezuje sve sastavnice hrvatskog sustava znanosti, a u isto vrijeme osigurava vidljivost njihove znanstvene aktivnosti i produktivnosti te dugoročno očuvanje pohranjenog gradiva. Predloženi model se sastoji od šest međusobno povezanih baza podataka koje prikupljaju informacije o hrvatskim akademskim i istraživačkim ustanovama, hrvatskim znanstvenicima i drugim djelatnicima uključenim u znanstvene aktivnosti, projektima, rezultatima znanstvene aktivnosti (publikacijama i patentima), znanstvenoj opremi i događanjima, a koje su objedinjene u jedan interoperabilni sustav nazvan CroRIS. Sam akronim CroRIS dolazi od engleske verzije naziva sustava (Croatian Research Information System), ali također i aludira na interoperabilnost cijelog sustava s CERIF-ovim modelom podataka (engl. Common European Research Information Format), tj. na činjenicu da je riječ o CRIS sustavu (engl. Current Research Information System). Model donosi razrađene osnovne procese i funkcionalnosti pojedinih sastavnih dijelova CroRIS sustava, skupove elemenata metapodataka za opis zapisa o entitetima, pripadajuće aplikacijske profile, kao i predložene kontrolirane rječnike. Predloženi osnovni skupovi elemenata metapodataka su mapirani s CERIF-ovim modelom podataka, dok su elementi metapodataka za opis publikacija dodatno mapirani i u osnovni skup elemenata dablinske jezgre za potrebe interoperabilnosti s drugim digitalnim repozitorijima putem OAI-PMH protokola. Vrijednosti predloženih kontroliranih rječnika su mapirane s CERIF-ovim semantičkim slojem, odnosno s relevantnim kontroliranim rječnicima koji se koriste za interoperabilnost digitalnih repozitorija. U sklopu modela su također razrađeni i opisani mehanizmi unosa novih zapisa o pojedinim entitetima, kao i mehanizmi administracije pojedinih baza podataka kako na razini samih baza podataka, tako i na razini kontrole kvalitete i točnosti unesenih zapisa pri pojedinim ustanovama. Ostvarenje ovakvog modela, utemeljenog na dobroj europskoj praksi i na rezultatima analize trenutačnog stanja u Hrvatskoj, hrvatskom bi znanstvenom prostoru donijelo objedinjavanje i međusobno povezivanje postojećih izoliranih dijelova znanstvene infrastrukture, osnovicu za neophodne zahvate u stvaranju jedinstvenog sustava za praćenje znanstvene djelatnosti i informacijsku podlogu za donošenje znanstvenih odluka i planiranje znanstvene politike. The {{goal of this}} {{doctoral}} dissertation was to build a model of Croatian research information system which will contain structured descriptions of its basic components, {{and at the same}} time enable open access to archived publications. Therefore, the review of recent literature about the main actors and results of research activities is presented in the first part of this dissertation. These are usually the main entities of research information systems – research institutions, persons involved in research activities, results (publications and patents), scientific equipment and events. A special emphasis was given to results of research activities, which is one of the most important parts of research information, {{and at the same time}} the central part of the model proposed in this dissertation. Since one of the goals of this dissertation was to propose a model able to disseminate results of Croatian research activities in open access, the concepts related with open access to scientific information are also discussed, as well as bibliometric and altmetric aspects of research evaluation in order for the proposed model to be usable for evaluation of Croatian scientific activities. Theoretical background of the model itself relies on current literature related with two main types of systems dealing with scientific information - digital repositories and research information systems. Since the proposed model is based on the integration of two abovementioned information systems, interoperability of those systems is an important topic, especially metadata formats (Dublin Core (DC) and Common European Research Information Format (CERIF)), controlled vocabularies, unique identifiers, as well as protocols for metadata exchange. In the process of designing a system for archiving digital materials, it is very important to take into account the problems related with the technological obsolescence, i. e., the continuous technological development of hardware, software and formats, which makes the long-term preservation of digital material stored in repositories harder to achieve. Therefore, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model that develops a full range of archival information preservation functionalities, such as input, archival storage, management, preservation planning, access and dissemination, was studied. After the review of current literature, examples of good practices in Slovenia, Norway and Netherlands were studied, as well as the current state and analyses of Croatian databases which store information about certain segments of Croatian scientific activities (Croatian scientific bibliography (CROSBI), existing institutional repositories (Full-text institutional Repository of the Ruđer Bošković Institute (FULIR), University of Zagreb Medical School repository (MEF), Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences institutional repository (FFZG) and FAMENA PhD collection (FSB)), Who is who in Croatian science, Pair of compasses – database of scientific equipment, zProjects, Register of scientific organizations and Register of scientists). A special attention was given to publication databases, where an analysis of metadata elements and controlled vocabularies in use was made. The results of this analysis were used for gathering good insight into Croatian current practice and as a starting point in building the proposed model. Based on the studied literature, examples of good practice in chosen European countries, current state and analysis of existing infrastructure in Croatia and author’s vision of information architecture and the required functionality of such system, a Croatian current research information system model was proposed. The proposed model effectively describes and connects all components of Croatian scientific system, and at the same time enables the visibility of its scientific activity and productivity, as well as the long-term preservation of archived material. The suggested model consists of six interconnected databases which gather information about Croatian scientific institutions, Croatian scientists and other persons related with research activities, projects, results of scientific activity (publications and projects), scientific equipment and events. All these databases are a part of one large interoperable system called Croatian Research Information System (CroRIS). The acronym itself also implies that CroRIS system is CEFIF compliant and therefore a CRIS system (Current Research Information System). CroRIS model elaborates system’s basic processes and functionalities of each database, metadata element sets for entity record description, associated application profiles and used controlled vocabularies. The proposed metadata elements sets are mapped into appropriate CERIF attributes, while metadata elements for publications are additionally mapped with Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES) due to the OAI-PMH interoperability issues. Values of proposed controlled vocabularies are mapped with the CERIF semantic layer, as well as with relevant controlled vocabularies needed for digital repository interoperability. As a part of the proposed model, procedures of record ingest and administration jurisdiction and rights for each database are also elaborated on the level of every institution, as well as on the level of whole databases. The central part of the proposed model consists of a database about publications written by Croatian scientists called CROPUB, which is acronym for CROatian PUBlications as well as for Croatian Repository Of PUBlications. CROPUB represents central Croatian scientific bibliographic database, but also the central infrastructure for setting up, hosting and maintenance of institutional repositories for the Croatian scientific institutions. CROPUB is also an orphan repository for Croatian institutions which do not have their own institutional repository, as well as the harvester from locally implemented institutional repositories. Besides, CROPUB is in charge of long term preservation of archived digital materials. Since there is a constant growing need for a tool which could provide insights into the results of scientific activity of a certain scientific society, as well as adding an extra value to these information, CROPUB enables the collection of various bibliometric and altmetric indicators about publications. In this way CROPUB represents a tool with potential for official usage in various evaluation purposes. Academic and special libraries should have the most important role in administration and maintenance of CROPUB and should take over the role of CROPUB editors at the level of their institutions, but also take responsibility for a large portion of work related to the copyright issues and education of users. The database about institutions represents the central database of Croatian scientific institutions, as well as their uniquely identified organizational subunits. The main goal of this database is to enable the linkage of records about other CroRIS entities with institution and its subunits records in order to enable the insight of their scientific activities. The database about persons is designed as a central portal about scientists and other persons included in scientific activities in Croatia and to uniquely identify every person in it. One part of information about persons is publicly available, another part is private, and persons have jurisdiction to decide about public availability of certain part of personal information. Persons have the ability to link their profile with records of other CroRIS entities either directly, or by sending a request to designated administrators/editors. Editors of database about persons at the level of institutions are responsible for administration of basic information about all persons employed at that institution. The proposed model of database about projects has a role of central national database of all domestic and international project in which Croatian scientists are involved in. This database has a possibility of monitoring life cycle of project proposals, as well as granted projects, depending upon wishes of every institution. Project records consist of two parts – the <b>basic</b> <b>record</b> about the project itself and the part of record about institution’s involvement in the project. The ‘owner’ and the main administrator of the project record is the administrator which created a project record, while editors at the institution level are responsible for parts of record which are related with involvement of their institution in the project. Project records are linking with records of other entities of CroRIS system, where linkage with institution and persons is made at the moment of creation of the project record. On the other hand, linking with publications, scientific equipment and events is taking place at the moment of creation of those external records. The last two parts of the proposed CroRIS model are scientific equipment and events databases. The basic role of scientific equipment database is dissemination of information about the existence of certain equipment at Croatian scientific institutions, which could potentially increase its utilization and at the same time enable better conditions for carrying out research activities in Croatia. Records about scientific equipment can be linked with records of other entities in CroRIS system through the process of project record entering and/or the process of entering record about other CroRIS entities. Records about events organized by Croatian scientific institutions or their employees (e. g. conferences, workshops) and records about other events at which Croatian scientists were participating are stored in events database. Event record can be entered into the event database via its central interface or during the process of entering records about other entities in CroRIS system which should be linked with a certain event. If there is no record about a certain event entered into the event database, during the process of entering a record of another entity, users can enter a new event record via the pop-up window. The majority of administration of event database lies on the main administrators on a global level, while editors at the institutional level are responsible only for event records linked with their institution on an organizational level. The practical implementation of the proposed model based on examples of European good practice and on the analysis of the current state in Croatia would consolidate and interconnect existing isolated parts of the Croatian scientific infrastructure. In this way a good foundations for creation of a unique system for monitoring scientific activities would be built, as well as information basis for defining scientific policies and other scientific decision making...|$|E
