40|$|The hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} equipment devices in the blast furnace iron making process. The temperature and duration of hot air are the crucial parameters to assess the performance of the hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove.</b> In order to sustain the desired high temperature air, it requires rapid completed combustion reaction, stable flue gas flow structure, and uniform temperature distribution throughout the regenerator. In the present work, a 3 D numerical model with all essential turbulence, heat transfer, and combustion considerations has been developed to assess the performance of a typical hot air stove. The flow field of the whole domain and temperature distribution within the regenerator were simulated using the model. The predicted results show that the velocity at each nozzle varies substantially due to the uneven pressure distribution in cavity of the traditional hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove,</b> generating the eccentric vortex that leads to nonuniform temperature distribution in the regenerator.

40|$|AbstractA {{large amount}} of energy is {{required}} in the production of steel where the preheating of blast in the hot blast stoves for iron-making {{is one of the most}} energy-intensive processes. To improve the energy efficiency it is necessary to investigate how to improve the hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> operation. In this work a mathematic model for evaluating the performance of the hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> was developed using a finite difference approximation to represent the heat transfer inside the stove during operation. The developed model was calibrated by using the process data from the stove V 26 at SSAB Oxelösund, Sweden. As a case study, the developed model was used to simulate the effect of a new concept of OxyFuel technique to hot blast stoves. The investigation shows that,by using the OxyFuel technique, it is possible to maintain the blast temperature while removing the usage of coke oven gas. Additionally, the hot blast temperature increases while the flue gas temperature decreases, which allows for an increase of the blast temperature, leading to improved energy efficiency for the hot stove system...|$|E

40|$|An {{issue of}} {{improvement}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the operation of a block of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace in order to rise the temperature of the blast-furnace air was considered. It was shown that an increase of the temperature of the blast-furnace air without the use of natural gas and oxygen for combustion is possible due to the changing of the operation modes of a block of hot blast stoves and at the increase of the pressure of the exchange gas. An analysis of the recent researches and publications describing the methods for determining the parameters of the operation of the block of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace was performed; their advantages and disadvantages were described. The goal of the research was set. A database of process parameters of the block was processed to determine the main characteristics of the operation of hot blast stoves of the blast furnace. Averaged values of the basic technical and design parameters were obtained; they characterize the operation of each hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> of the block with the use of which the adjustment of a mathematical model of the operation of each of hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> of the block was achieved. A method for determining the main unit operating parameters on the block on the account of the desired blast temperature was designed. The values of the duration of the cycle "heating + air blasting" depending on the set-point temperature of the smoke at various values of air blasting temperatures were determined for each hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> of the block using a mathematical model. The authors suggested to use such dependencies to determine the temporal parameters of the operation of the block of hot blast stoves. The obtained values of the duration of heating periods and air blasting of each hot <b>blast</b> <b>stove</b> of the block should be corrected if the continuity of the air blast supply to the blast furnace is not ensured.

In order {{to restrain the}} amount of NOx formation during combustion of HBS, the formation mechanism of NOx is investigated, and the NOx formation rate and amount in HBS are calculated by means of thermodynamic model.

A comparison on the combustion process and characteristic of conventional HBS and HTAC HBS is performed by application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation model. Temperature and concentration distribution, flame shape and NOx concentration distribution of two kinds of stove are calculated.

The solution technique used to solve the discrete representations of the model and control PDE`s must be robust to linear systems with disparate eigenvalues, and must converge rapidly without using tuning parameters. The disparity in eigenvalues is created by the different time scales for convection in the gas, and conduction in the brick; combined with a difference between the scaling of the model and control PDE`s. A preconditioned implicit Newton-Krylov solution technique was employed. The procedure employs Newton`s method, where the update to the current solution at each stage is computed by solving a linear system. This linear system is obtained by linearizing the discrete approximation to the PDE`s, using a numerical approximation for the Jacobian of the discretized system. This linear system is then solved for the needed update using a preconditioned Krylov subspace projection method...|$|R

These by-product fuels include blast furnace gas (BFG) and coke oven gas (COG) which contain mixtures of H{sub 2 }, CO, CH{sub 4 } and trace amounts of some heavier hydrocarbons and the impurities NH{sub 3 } and HCN. These fuels are burned alone or in combination with natural gas to fire the coke ovens, <b>blast</b> furnace <b>stoves</b> utility boilers and metal working furnaces.
