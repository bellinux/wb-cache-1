5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E

50|$|Candidates César Pérez Vivas (governor of Táchira state), Antonio Ledezma (mayor of the Metropolitan District of Caracas) and Eduardo Fernández (former {{secretary}} general of COPEI) withdrew from the race, saying they would support candidates with <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> winning.|$|R
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns. The role of filamentous tails in Lycaenidae has been suggested as confusing predators as to the real location of the head, giving them a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> escaping alive and relatively unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as to have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that {{a large majority of}} the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
50|$|In a January 1980 announcement, Hubbard {{told his}} {{followers}} that {{a nuclear war}} was an imminent threat and that the Rundown {{would enable them to}} deal with heavy fallout.

50|$|Sperm stored often determines which male ends up {{fertilizing}} {{the most}} eggs. An {{example of this}} is seen in Red Flour Beetles, where most of the sperm is stored in the first mating. Another male can remove previously stored sperm to <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> successful mating.|$|R
5|$|Philadelphians {{saw three}} ballot {{questions}} in the primary election, all of which involved allowing the city to borrow money. The loans, on the ballot at Clark's urging, were designed to allow the city to temporarily increase spending without raising taxes, and were opposed by many ward leaders in both parties. As a result, they went down to unexpected defeat by a 3:2 margin. Undeterred, Clark and his allies revised and relisted the loans for {{a vote in the}} general election in November, which would see better turnout and, they believed, a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> success.|$|E
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible {{for much of the}} genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, {{nearly all of the}} moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{exclusion}} of Olympic sports, the inclusion of indigenous sports such as vovinam, kempo and chinlone {{and the number of}} gold medals allotted was increased on sports where the host Myanmar deemed to have <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> winning like dragon boat, the Philippines has decided to send a [...] "token delegation" [...] to Myanmar.|$|R
50|$|If players include {{carriers}} {{in their}} fleets, they may dispatch groups of fighters into battle. There are {{many kinds of}} specialized fighter for different tactical attacks. Interceptors, for instance, have <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> destroying enemy fighters but have no anti-ship strike ability, while Torpedo Fighters have a heavy one-shot anti-ship punch but are vulnerable to other fighters.|$|R
50|$|Threats to the {{northern}} hairy-nosed wombat include small population size, predation, competition for food, disease, floods, droughts, wildfires, and habitat loss. Its small, highly localised population makes the species especially vulnerable to natural disasters. Wild dogs are the wombat's primary predator. The habitat at Epping Forest National Park is now well-protected for <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> survival.|$|R
5|$|Tourism is {{the most}} {{significant}} contributor to Kalimpong's economy. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town's residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hopes to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La (pass) in April 2006. Though this has resumed Indo–China border trades, it is expected that Kalimpong will have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> revival as a hub for Indo–China trades if the demand of local leaders for reopening of Jelep La pass also is met.|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} concluded, the obvious {{standout}} draft choice for both leagues was Alabama quarterback Joe Namath. The Houston Oilers, {{in last place}} in the AFL East, had the number-one pick for the AFL. Both the Oilers and Jets realized that the Jets had a far <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> signing Namath in competition with the NFL team which drafted him (as it turned out, the St. Louis Cardinals, formerly the Chicago Cardinals), and the Jets were able to acquire the number-one pick. Neither the Jets nor the Cardinals could sign Namath until Alabama played its {{final game of the}} season, the Orange Bowl, on January 1, 1965. Both the Jets and Cardinals negotiated with Namath's attorney, and when the price got too high for the Cardinals, the Giants secretly acquired Namath's NFL rights. Longtime Jets coach Walt Michaels admitted many years later that the Jets had signed Namath days before the game. On January 2, 1965, the Jets held a press conference to announce Namath's signing.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E
50|$|Generally, Creoles (American-born slaves) had <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> {{becoming}} coartados, just as mixed-race {{slaves were}} more likely than black slaves.  This is likely the result of better access to resources and proximity to the master. Many Creoles who had knowledge of the system also gave small sums of money on the birth of their child to ease their path to freedom.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformation}} {{of medical care}} means that extremely premature and very ill babies have <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> survival than ever before. But {{it is difficult to}} predict which babies will die and which will live, though possibly with severe disabilities. As a consequence, families and health professionals have to make complex decisions about how much intervention is necessary or justifiable.|$|R
25|$|As {{of school}} year 2011-2012, adult {{education}} was launched {{under the name}} Druga šansa (Second chance). Its purpose is to educate people who didn't graduate primary or high school or both, so they could have <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> getting a work. Most people attending adult education are minors who missed their chance to enroll in primary schools (most of them being of Roma descent).|$|R
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females {{are more likely to be}} affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano.|$|E
5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
40|$|Renal allografts {{obtained}} from living related donors have considerably <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> success than allografts from cadavers. The genetic {{factors that influence}} graft survival {{are linked to the}} HLA gene complex. Although results of cadaver transplants have not improved significantly when donor and recipient are matched for HLA-A and -B antigens, accumulating data suggest that matching for the more recently recognised HLA-DR antigens may produce increased graft survival...|$|R
50|$|The offense {{must also}} be mindful of the play clock. If they fail to snap the ball in time they incur a delay of game penalty. Also, with a dwindling play clock, the defense has <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> {{guessing}} when the ball will be snapped. It is easier to predict when the ball will be snapped with 2 seconds left on the play clock, rather than 5 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|Eastern European {{tennis player}} Jimmy Stojkovic (Lee Ingleby), {{who is very}} bad at the game, is {{convinced}} by his father to compete {{under the guise of}} a woman, taking the name Martina Stojkovic, so that he has <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> winning. Billy Jane befriends Jimmy and inspires him to start playing well. Eventually the two begin a [...] "lesbian" [...] relationship, right under the nose of Billy Jane's mother.|$|R
5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> attracting assistance from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring have a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> surviving. These females also attract more males, {{and are more likely to}} cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E
50|$|The early 21st-century closings {{of several}} Planet Hollywood and Jekyll & Hyde Club {{locations}} suggest {{a decline in}} popularity. Theme restaurants often depend on tourist business, since the theme soon becomes stale to locals, and the focus is not necessarily on good food and service. Certain tourist destinations such as the Mall of America or Orlando, Florida have <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> supporting theme restaurants. Theme restaurants are commonplace at theme parks, such as Universal Studios.|$|R
50|$|There may {{not have}} been any <b>better</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> {{finishing}} with a lot of money with the Red Sox due to the team finishing in eighth again in 1932. Weiland's ERA of 4.51 was distinctly better than the team's own 5.02. Weiland began to have issues with throwing the ball over the plate, walking 97 while only striking out 63 and putting up a walks and hits per inning pitched of 1.676.|$|R
50|$|Mortality of meningitis-related infections is {{much lower}} than {{mortality}} associated with septicemia. Because C. canimorsus induces fulminant septicemia, the faster the diagnosis, the <b>better</b> the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> survival.|$|R
