5000|$|BM25F is a {{modification}} of <b>BM25</b> in which the document {{is considered to be}} composed from several fields (such as headlines, main text, anchor text) with possibly different degrees of importance, term relevance saturation and length normalization.|$|E
5000|$|The name of {{the actual}} ranking {{function}} is <b>BM25.</b> To set the right context, however, it usually referred to as [...] "Okapi BM25", since the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University in the 1980s and 1990s, was the first system to implement this function.|$|E
50|$|In {{information}} retrieval, Okapi <b>BM25</b> (BM {{stands for}} Best Matching) is a ranking function used by search engines to rank matching documents {{according to their}} relevance to a given search query. It {{is based on the}} probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Spärck Jones, and others.|$|E

50|$|<b>BM25</b> is a bag-of-words {{retrieval}} {{function that}} ranks {{a set of}} documents based on the query terms appearing in each document, regardless of the inter-relationship between the query terms within a document (e.g., their relative proximity). It {{is not a single}} function, but actually a whole family of scoring functions, with slightly different components and parameters. One of the most prominent instantiations of the function is as follows.|$|E
50|$|The core of {{the system}} is based around the {{proprietary}} Parallel Document Retrieval Engine (PADRE) developed by the Australian National University and CSIRO to perform very fast data look-ups. Its relevancy ranking system uses a variant of the Okapi <b>BM25</b> algorithm to rank document content and metadata. The company has also been granted patents for annotation index methods (used for generating search result snippets) and search result sub-topic identification (used in Funnelback's Contextual Navigation system).|$|E
5000|$|Ranking {{is often}} {{reduced to the}} {{computation}} of numeric scores on query/document pairs; a baseline score function for this purpose is the cosine similarity between tf-idf vectors representing the query and the document in a vector space model, <b>BM25</b> scores, or probabilities in a probabilistic IR model. A ranking can then be computed by sorting documents by descending score. An alternative approach is to define a score function on pairs of documents [...] that is positive {{if and only if}} [...] is more relevant to the query than [...] and using this information to sort.|$|E
5000|$|Technically LGTE is a {{layer on}} the top of Lucene and {{provides}} an extended Lucene API to integrate several services like snippets generation, query expansion, and many others. The LGTE provides the chance to implement new probabilistic models. The API depends on a set of modifications at the Lucene level, originally created by the researchers of the University of Amsterdam in a software tool named Lucene-lm developed by the group of Information and Language Processing Systems (ILPS). At the time, the tool was tested with success for the Okapi <b>BM25</b> model, and a multinomial language model, but also includes divergence from randomness models.|$|E
50|$|Typically, users {{expect a}} search query to {{complete}} {{in a short}} time (such as a few hundred milliseconds for web search), which makes it impossible to evaluate a complex ranking model on each document in the corpus, and so a two-phase scheme is used. First, a small number of potentially relevant documents are identified using simpler retrieval models which permit fast query evaluation, such as the vector space model, boolean model, weighted AND, or <b>BM25.</b> This phase is called top- document retrieval and many heuristics were proposed in the literature to accelerate it, such as using a document's static quality score and tiered indexes. In the second phase, a more accurate but computationally expensive machine-learned model is used to re-rank these documents.|$|E
5000|$|North Korea {{currently}} deploys a Nodong {{ballistic missile}} capable of hitting Japan and South Korea, and {{is developing a}} new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) which could reach Guam and the Aleutian Islands. They also successfully demonstrated the staging and separation technologies required to launch a Taepo-Dong 2 ICBM which has the capability to reach the United States. The Taepodong missile was first tested in 2006, and failed 40 seconds into midflight. North Korean missiles are notoriously unreliable, {{and many of the}} DPRKs missile tests have failed, including the most recent Taepodong-2 launches in 2009 and 2012, and a failed launch of the <b>BM25</b> Musudan in 2016. On 1 January 2017, North Korea announced its final preparation for a test of an ICBM, for the first time. On 6 March 2017, North Korea launched four missiles from Tongchang-ri, a known long-range missile site at 7:36 a.m. local time, one of which landed in the Sea of Japan, with the remaining three missiles landing in Japan's economic zone. On July 4, 2017 North Korea launched a ballistic missile that had the potential to be an ICBM. It flew into space and landed in the Sea of Japan. [...] "The launch continues to demonstrate that North Korea poses a threat to the United States and our allies," [...] a Pentagon statement said.|$|E
