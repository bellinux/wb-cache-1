5|$|Shin Megami Tensei is a post-apocalyptic {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus. Originally released for the Super Famicom in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in the West for iOS in 2014. It is the third game in the Megami Tensei series and {{the first in the}} central Shin Megami Tensei series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica resolves the mystery of her sexual assault a year earlier <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> previous acquaintances and learning about the details of what happened at Shelly Pomroy's party a year earlier while she was under the influence of GHB. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) returns from running away earlier, and Veronica and Logan's relationship matures as she reacts to the news that he had roofies the night of the party.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> characters {{such as their}} client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over, and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht. Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be going very well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees as exciting and flattering.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a single-player {{role playing}} video game similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} Mother series. The player controls a party of playable characters who explore the game's two-dimensional fictional world, primarily shown from a top-down perspective. While navigating the overworld, the player may converse with non-player characters, obtain items, or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party, which is required for leveling up. Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points (HP), power points (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are placed abundantly in the game world, and the player can save the game <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> frogs. Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene that}} shows Emma trying to {{convince}} a depressed Regina to come out <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> her through the office door is {{a reference to the}} similar scene that portrays Anna talking to Elsa through the door after their parents died in the movie Frozen.|$|E

50|$|The caravan {{stops in}} a small town to study magic and assist the Duke of Emelan with the drought. As Daja is working in the smithy, a woman, a wirok, a scorned Trader who negotiates with lugsha, tradesmen, stops <b>by</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the smith. As she notices the blank cap on Daja's Trader staff which signifies her exile status, the Trader refuses <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R

25|$|They {{start their}} {{investigations}} {{at the crime}} scene <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> any witnesses while the Crime Scene Unit (CSU) technicians start processing the scene by collecting forensic evidence. The medical examiner (M.E.)'s office will also be shown to collect the body from the crime scene.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} the service has had to change its fire safety {{strategies}} and now include public education as well as legal enforcement. All fire and rescue services today have specialist departments dealing with community fire safety education. The job of these departments is to educate <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> school children and vulnerable areas {{of the community and}} to assist the public, with many FRS running campaigns, offering free smoke detectors as part of the drive to reduce deaths in the home.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the medical}} {{examiner}} will perform an autopsy on the victim, offering more clues to the victim's cause and time of death (sometimes obtaining the victim's identity from dental records or fingerprints) which the detectives will read about in the M.E.'s autopsy report and <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the M.E. who performed it. When the detectives know the victim's identity they will inform their relatives or loved ones of their death and attempt {{to get more information}} on the victim's life and possible suspects.|$|E

50|$|Some gossip {{protocols}} {{replace the}} random peer selection mechanism {{with a more}} deterministic scheme. For example, in the NeighbourCast algorithm, instead of <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> random nodes, information is spread <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> only <b>to</b> neighbouring nodes. There {{are a number of}} algorithms that use similar ideas. A key requirement when designing such protocols is that the neighbor set trace out an expander graph.|$|R
25|$|With {{their new}} singer, Black Flag and the Minutemen made their first tour of Europe in the Winter of 1981. During that tour, the band met punk icon Richard Hell {{and opened a}} concert for him. Rollins later {{published}} his diaries from that tour in his book Get in the Van. As the front man, Rollins was a frequent target of violent audience members, and became known for fist-fights with audience members. Rollins developed a distinct showmanship on stage, where he could entertain an audience just <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them.|$|E
25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he {{knew where they were}} going to put their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|Izzard {{began to}} toy with comedy at the University of Sheffield, with student friend Rob Ballard. After leaving his {{accountancy}} degree course, he and Ballard took their act to the streets, often in Covent Garden. After his split with Ballard, Izzard {{spent a great}} deal of the early 1980s working as a street performer in Europe and the United States. Izzard says that he developed his comedic voice <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> his audience while doing solo escape acts after splitting with Ballard. He then moved his act into the stand-up comedy venues of Britain. His first gig was at the Banana Cabaret in Balham, London.|$|E

25|$|The defence in {{the case}} was handled by Mr. Thomas Campbell Foster, who argued during the trial that Charles had died from inhaling arsenic used as a dye in the green {{wallpaper}} of the Cotton home. The doctor testified that, in the chemist's shop, {{there was no other}} powder, only liquid, on the same shelf as the arsenic; the chemist himself, however, claimed that there were other powders. Campbell Foster argued that it was possible that the chemist had mistaken the arsenic powder for bismuth powder (used to treat diarrhoea), when preparing a bottle for Cotton, because he had been distracted <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> other people. The jury retired for 90 minutes before returning a guilty verdict.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also tweak the customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
500|$|To {{continue}} {{using the}} crystal {{to build up}} the settlement, the player must accumulate elementite which must be obtained from the dungeons and caves that surround the town. Instead of gathering the crystals first hand, the game prompts the player to recruit young citizens to do so by posting tasks on a town bulletin board. These [...] "adventurers" [...] are paid via taxes the player collects from the residents of the town, as well as from treasures found during their quest. The player can follow their progress by reading message boards placed around town, as well as <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> their penguin assistant, Pavlov.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cope {{was much}} hurried, {{but he could}} not bear to go till he had heard Mr. Blunt's opinion; so he went down to the kitchen, tried <b>to</b> console Paul <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> kindly <b>to</b> him, wrote a note, and read his letters.|$|R
50|$|The {{series is}} {{organized}} into short self-contained chapters with no overarching plot, though some chapters explore Akiba's backstory. However, most are simple cases that Akiba solves, usually with an introduction <b>by</b> Akiba <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the reader {{at the beginning}} of the chapter.|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{can find}} out what ward they reside in <b>by</b> either <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a local LDS leader or by using the meetinghouse locator tool on the church's webpage. This tool will also {{determine}} if there are any singles wards (see below) or special language wards that serve the area.|$|R
500|$|When her son {{became a}} member of The Beatles, Mona {{repeatedly}} tried to get the group a lunchtime residency at The Cavern Club <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the owner, Ray McFall, but was turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time. Brian Epstein later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although she had her own plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time. After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts. She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her [...] "that woman". One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to agree with her.|$|E
500|$|Marc-Antoine Audette {{said that}} it took the duo {{about four or five}} days of calls to Palin's staff to finally {{be able to talk to}} her. They claimed that they started <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> {{low-level}} people in Alaska and made their way up through Palin's campaign staff. Audette said that at first they didn't think their prank would work, calling it a [...] "mission impossible". He claimed that [...] "after about a dozen calls", the duo [...] "started to realize it [...] might work, because her [...] staff didn't know the name of the French President. They asked us to spell it." [...] Audette and Trudel credited their ability to make their way up through Palin's staff to sounding convincing during the first few calls, always arranging to place the call at a set time, and not leaving a contact number. The four days of calls needed to talk to Palin was quicker compared to some of their other pranks. Audette and Trudel {{said that it}} took them two months to talk to Paul McCartney and one to talk to Bill Gates, but only two days to prank Britney Spears.|$|E
500|$|The {{third season}} was {{initially}} planned to include three separate mysteries {{that would be}} introduced and resolved {{in a series of}} non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized <b>by</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying [...] "subtle" [...] motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have [...] "a theory on whodunit" [...] when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The final mystery was originally going to be [...] "unlike any of the others we've done before". Previously, [...] "nice characters" [...] like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was going to believe them as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, [...] "key players [...] really interesting stuff to do".|$|E
