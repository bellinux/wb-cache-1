40|$|Background: In {{contemporary}} literature {{few have}} written in detail on the in-brace correction effects of braces {{used for the}} treatment of hyperkyphosis. Bradford et al. found their attempts effective, treating Scheuermann's kyphosis with Milwaukee braces, but their report did not specifically focus on in-brace corrections. White and Panjabi's research attempted to correct a curvature of> 50 ° with the help of distraction forces, but consequently led to a reduction in patient comfort in the application of the Milwaukee brace. In Germany they avoid this by utitlising braces to treat hyperkyphosis that use transverse correction forces instead of distraction forces.

40|$|Elastic wrist braces {{are worn}} to {{restrict}} {{motion of the}} wrist: to prevent or to treat injury from repetitive motion of the wrist (repetitive strain injury); or to support the wrist when it is weak. The ability of the brace to restrict motion is {{described in terms of}} its moment-deflection relation, or its “stiffness”. Brace stiffness is a function of four factors: (1) the direction of wrist bending; (2) wrist geometry; (3) brace geometry; and (4) the material properties of the brace, including elasticity and anisotropy. When the relationship between stiffness and these four factors is known, it becomes possible to design braces to fit particular wrist geometries and to control the degree of wrist bending. This thesis develops a model of wrist brace mechanics which shows how brace stiffness is related to the four factors. ^ The model consists of five steps. First, a flat sheet of elastic material is formed into a tube-like the form—the brace. This tube formation is described in terms of a 2 D to 3 D mapping function using a finite-element formulation. Second, the wrist geometry is described in terms of a finite-element formulation. Data describing an actual wrist geometry, obtained from a laser-scanning device, is fit by an four element, cubic order mesh. Third, the brace model is mapped onto the wrist model, so that brace becomes “stuck onto” the wrist; thus displacements on the wrist surface are imposed onto the brace. Fourth, deformations in the wrist are described by imbedding the wrist model into a low-order bending model. Fifth, for different degrees of wrist deflection, the deformation field in the brace is calculated. From the deformation field, the total strain energy (elastic storage energy) of the brace is calculated. The derivative of the strain-energy vs. deflection relation gives the moment-deflection relation. ^ This model analysis is carried out for isotropic elastic <b>brace</b> <b>materials</b> and for fibrous anisotropic materials. In addition, the analysis is modified to account for buckling of the <b>brace</b> <b>material</b> that occurs under compressive loads. The analysis shows that buckling has a significant effect in determining the stiffness of the brace. The model analysis was validated by constructing a prototype <b>brace</b> with isotropic <b>materials,</b> and testing it on a physical model of the wrist joint. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1990 An assumed mode {{model of}} a guitar {{soundboard}} has been built and experimentally verified. The frequency range of interest was from 55 to 880 Hertz, covering the frequency range of the fundamentals of the notes played on the guitar. The guitar soundboard is modeled as an orthotropic plate reinforced with tapered beams using the Rayleigh-Ritz technique. Sound power spectra are computed using the radiation impedance of an equivalent array of piston sources and the velocity distribution computed from the forced vibration analysis of the soundboard coupled to a backing cavity and soundhole. The prediction model is compared to an experimental guitar which was documented by recording mode shapes, Chladni patterns, at 25 steps in the assembly process. The material properties used in the prediction programs were determined experimentally. The major findings of the study were: (1) the bracing system dominates the vibration pattern of the soundboard, (2) bracing patterns are required to improve the radiation efficiencies of the unbraced plates, (3) material property variations in the <b>bracing</b> <b>materials</b> can significantly influence the soundboard's dynamics and (4) plate materials and plate finishes have no {{significant impact on the}} radiated sound power spectrum in the modeled range...|$|R

40|$|Background: Traditionally, {{conservative}} {{treatment of}} thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures without neurologic deficit has encompassed {{the application of}} an extension brace. However, their effectiveness on maintaining the alignment, preventing posttraumatic deformities, and improving back pain, disability {{and quality of life}} is doubtful. Objective: The objective was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine whether bracing patients who suffer TL fractures adds benefices to the conservative manage without <b>bracing.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Seven databases were searched for relevant RCTs that compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of orthosis versus no-orthosis for TL burst fractures managed conservatively. Primary outcomes were: (1) Loss of kyphotic angle; (2) failure of conservative management requiring subsequent surgery; and (3) disability and pain outcomes. Secondary outcomes were defined by health-related quality of life and in-hospital stay. Results: Based on predefined inclusion criteria, only two eligible high-quality RCTs with a total of 119 patients were included. No significant difference was identified between the two groups regarding loss of kyphotic angle, pain outcome, or in-hospital stay. The pooled data showed higher scores in physical and mental domains of the Short-Form Health Survey 36 in the group treated without orthosis. Conclusion and Recommendation: The current evidence suggests that orthosis could not be necessary when TL burst fractures without neurologic deficit are treated conservatively. However, due to limitations related with number and size of the included studies, more RCTs with high quality are desirable for making recommendations with more certainty...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bracing {{could be}} efficacious, given good {{compliance}} {{and quality of}} braces. Recently the SOSORT Brace Treatment Management Guidelines (SBTMG) have highlighted the perceived importance of the professional teams surrounding braced patients. Purpose To verify {{the impact of a}} complete rehabilitation team in the adolescent patient with <b>bracing.</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods Design. Initial cross-sectional study, followed by a retrospective case–control study. Population: Thirty-eight patients (15. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 6 [*]years; 26 females; 10 hyperkyphosis, 28 scoliosis of 29. 2 [*]±[*] 7. 9 ° Cobb) extracted from a single orthotist database (between January 1, 2008 and September 1, 2009) and treated by the same physician; brace wearing at least 15 [*]hours/day for a minimum of 6 [*]months; age 10 or more. Treatment: Braces: Sforzesco, Sibilla, Lapadula or Maguelone. Exercises: SEAS. Methods: Two questionnaires filled in blindly by patients: SRS- 22 and one especially developed and validated with 25 questions on adherence to treatment. Groups (main risk factor) : TEAM (private institute: satisfied 44 / 44 SOSORT criteria; grade of teamwork, “excellent”) included 13 patients and NOT 25 (National Health Service Rehabilitation Department: 35 / 44 SOSORT criteria respected; grade, “insufficient”). Results TEAM was more compliant to bracing than NOT (97 [*]±[*] 6 % vs. 80 [*]±[*] 24 %) and performed nearly double the exercises (38 [*]±[*] 12 vs. 20 [*]±[*] 13 [*]minutes/session).

The aim of this review is to present appropriate research to collect and evaluate possible in-brace corrections which have been achieved with brace treatment for hyperkyphosis. This paper introduces new methods of bracing and compares the results of these with other successful <b>bracing</b> concepts. <b>Materials</b> and methods 56 adolescents with the diagnosis of thoracic Scheuermann's hyperkyphosis or a thoracic idiopathic hyperkyphosis (22 girls and 34 boys) with an average age of 14 years (12 - 17 yrs.) were treated with the kyphologic™ brace between May 2007 and December 2008. The average Stagnara angle was 55, 6 ° (43 - 80). In-brace correction was recorded and compared to the initial angle using the t-test. Results The average Stagnara angle in the brace was 39 °. The average in-brace correction was 16. 5 ° (1 - 40 °). The verage percentage of in-brace correction compared to the initial value was 36 %. The differences were significant in the t-test (t = 5. 31, p Discussion If we assume that outcome of brace treatment positively correlates with in-brace correction, the treatment should be initiated before the curvature angle exceeds 50 - 55 ° in a growing adolescent. In scoliosis bracing, if the average in-brace correction equals > 15 °, then it is predicted that the result will lead to a final correction. Applying this to hyperkyphosis patients, the average in-brace correction with this brace was also > 15 °. We therefore estimated to achieve a favourable outcome using this brace type (once compliance was attained) especially when comparing the correction effects achieved with this new approach to the correction effects reported upon using the Milwaukee brace. The latter brace has been shown to lead to beneficial outcomes in long-term studies with comparable in-brace corrections. Conclusion Conservative treatment of Scheuermann's hyperkyphosis in international literature is generally regarded as an effective treatment approach. Physiotherapy and bracing are the first-line treatments for this condition. An average in-brace correction of > 15 ° as was achieved using the kyphologic™ brace predicts a favourable outcome. The kyphologic™ brace leads to in-brace corrections comparable to those of the Milwaukee brace, which has previously been shown to provide beneficial outcome in the long-term. A prospective follow-up study seems desirable before final conclusions can be drawn. Future studies should focus more on thoracolumbar and lumbar curve patterns, because these patterns may predict chronic low back pain in adulthood with reduced quality of life of the patients and high costs with respect to medical care and occupational sickness leave. Surgery according to international literature is rarely necessary in this condition. </p...|$|R

Immediate closed reduction of both anterior and posterior glenohumeral dislocations is recommended and is frequently performed in the ED.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of bow shapes. However, most fall into three main categories: straight, recurve and compound. Straight and recurve are considered traditional bows. If a limb is 'straight' its effective length remains the same as the bow is drawn. That is, the string goes directly to the nock in the strung (<b>braced)</b> position. The <b>materials</b> must withstand these stresses, store the energy, and rapidly give back that energy efficiently. Many bows, especially traditional self bows, are made approximately straight in side-view profile. Longbows as used by English Archers in the Middle Ages at such battles as Crecy and Agincourt were straight limb bows. A recurve bow has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is strung. By definition, the difference between recurve and other bows is that the string touches a section of the limb when the bow is strung. Recurve bows made out of composite materials were used by, among other groups, the Persians, Scythians, Hyksos, Magyars, Bulgars, Huns, Turks, Mongols, and Chinese.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour of {{reinforced concrete}} is governed significantly by {{the transmission of}} forces between steel and concrete. The bond is of special importance for the overlapping joint and anchoring of the reinforcement, where rigid bond is required. It also {{plays an important role}} in the rotational capacity of plastic hinges, where a ductile bond behaviour is preferable. Similar to the mechanical properties of concrete and steel also the characteristics of their interaction changes with the velocity of the applied loading. For smooth steel bars with its main bond mechanisms of adhesion and friction, nearly no influence of loading rate is reported in literature. In contrast, a high rate dependence can be found for the nowadays mainly used deformed bars. For mechanical interlock, where ribs of the reinforcing steel are <b>bracing</b> concrete <b>material</b> surrounding the bar, one reason can be assumed to be in direct connection with the increase of concrete compressive strength. For splitting failure of bond, characterized by the concrete tensile strength, an even higher dynamic increase is observed. For the design of Structures exposed to blast or impact loading the knowledge of a rate dependent bond stress-slip relationship is required to consider safety and economical aspects at the same time. The bond behaviour of reinforced concrete has been investigated with different experimental methods at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich (UniBw) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra. Both static and dynamic tests have been carried out, where innovative experimental apparatuses have been used. The bond stress-slip relationship and maximum pull-out-forces for varying diameter of the bar, concrete compressive strength and loading rates have been obtained. It is expected that these experimental results will contribute to a better understanding of the rate dependent bond behaviour and will serve for calibration of numerical models. JRC.

The location of the non-rigid lateral brace is varied along the length of the beam and along the height of the section. The stiffness of the lateral restraints was determined in such a way that the elastic critical moment is 95 % of the elastic critical moment with rigid lateral restraints. This will keep the reduction in buckling load to a maximum of 5 %. It was found that the forces in the restraints can be larger than design forces suggested by building codes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Different bracing {{concepts}} are used {{today for the}} treatment of scoliosis. The plaster cast method worldwide seems to be the most practiced technique at the moment. CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems are on the market which allow brace adjustments without plaster. The latest development however, is the use of the ScoliOlogiC™ off the shelf system enabling the orthopaedic technician to construct a light brace for scoliosis correction from a variety of pattern specific shells to be connected to an anterior and a posterior upright. This „Chêneau light" brace, developed according to the Chêneau principle, promises a reduced impediment of quality of life in the <b>brace.</b> However, <b>material</b> reduction should not result in reduced effectiveness. Therefore the primary correction effect in the „Chêneau light" brace has been evaluated and compared with that of other braces used today. Methods The correction effects of the first 81 patients (main diagnosis Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) [n = 64] or Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) [n = 15]), treated according to the principle of the „Chêneau light" brace were evaluated after an average treatment time of 6 weeks by a full-body X-ray made in the standing position whilst wearing the brace and compared with the last X-ray before bracing. The average curvature angle of the whole group was 35, 6 °, the average age was 12, 9 years (SD 1, 9), average Risser sign was 1, 3 (SD 1, 5), average Tanner rating 2, 75 (SD 0, 7). Results The Cobb angle in the whole group was reduced by an average of 16, 4 °, which corresponds to a correction effect of 51 %. The differences were highly significant in the T-test (T = 17, 4; p Conclusion The use of the „Chêneau light" brace leads to correction effects above average when compared to the correction effects of other braces described in literature.

40|$|Hypothesis A {{modified}} brace {{position would}} help to prevent injury to some aircraft passengers {{in the event of}} an impact accident. Aim of Experiments To evaluate a modified crash <b>brace</b> position. <b>Materials</b> and Methods 1. Impact Testing Impact testing was performed at the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough. Aircraft seats, mounted on a sled, were propelled down a track at an acceleration of 16 G. A 50 % Hybrid III dummy was used as the experimental model. Four dummy positions were investigated: upper torso either braced forwards or sitting upright and lower legs placed either forwards or rearwards. The impact pulses used were based upon guidelines defined in Aerospace Standard AS 8049 which relates to the dynamic testing of aircraft seats. Transducers located in the head, lumbar spine and lower limbs of the dummy recorded the forces to which each body segment was exposed during the impact. These forces were compared for each brace position. 2. Computer Simulation A mathematical model was developed to simulate occupants kinematics during an impact aircraft accident. This was based upon MADYMO -a crash victim simulation computer programme for biomechanical research and optimization of designs for impact injury prevention. Results Impact testing revealed that the risk of a head injury as defined by the Head Injury Criterion was greater in the upright position than in the braced forwards position (p < 0. 00 1). The risk of injury to the lower limbs was dependant in part to their flailing behaviour. Flailing did not occur when the dummy was placed in a braced legs back position. Computer simulation revealed that lower limb injury may result from the feet becoming entrapped under the luggage retaining spar of the seat ahead. Conclusion A modified brace position would involve passengers sitting with their upper torso inclined forwards so that their head rested against the structure in front if possible. Legs would be positioned with the feet resting on the floor in a position slightly behind the knee. This position differs from those previously recommended in that the feet are positioned behind the knee. This study suggests that such a position would reduce the potential for head and lower limb injury in some passengers given that only a single seat type and single size of occupant have been evaluated. Standardisation to such a position would improve passenger understanding and uptake. Such a recommendation should not obscure the fact that an occupant seated in a forward facing aircraft seat, restrained only by a lap belt is exposed to considerable forces during an impact accident. Such forces are capable of producing, injuries in the femur, pelvis and lumbar spine...|$|R
