40|$|Asbestos {{has been}} used for so long as {{automobile}} <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> material because of its good physical and chemical properties. However, due to the health hazard associated with its handling, it has lost favour and several alternative materials are being increasingly used. Asbestos-free <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> was developed in this work using pulverized cow hooves along with epoxy resin, barium sulphate, graphite and aluminium oxide. This was with a view to exploiting the characteristics of cow hooves, which are largely discarded as waste materials to replace asbestos which {{has been found to be}} carcinogenic. Samples of brake linings were produced using compressive moulding in which the physical and mechanical properties of the samples were studied. The results obtained showed that proper bonding was achieved as the percentage by weight of epoxy resin increased and percentage by weight of pulverized cow hooves decreased. The hardness, compressive strength, coefficient of friction, water and oil absorption, relative density and wear rate of the brake linings were determined and compared with existing <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> properties.

40|$|Braking of road {{vehicles}} {{can be characterized}} as an active – either wanted or unwanted reduction of the force necessary for maintaining the required speed, decreasing the speed, stopping or keeping the vehicle at a standstill. During braking the vehicle loses the acquired motion energy which is most frequently transformed (in case of wanted braking) in the brake system of the vehicle into useless heat released to the environment. Brake force can be defined as the force acting against the motion of a vehicle which is, in case of wanted braking, produced by the vehicle braking system. In case of wanted braking we usually begin with the equilibrium equation of vehicle forces. The paper deals with objective findings and assessment of possible causes leading to the braking system failure paying special attention to the <b>brake</b> <b>lining.</b> The user can approach the <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> failure from two points of view: being aware or unaware of it. Laboratory tests can be used to objectively assess characteristics of brake linings.

This brake system {{regulation}} function is worldwide only provided in passenger cars of the BMW Group. It calculates continually the wear of brake linings and displays to the driver the kilometre availability, as part of the Conditioned Based Service. The task assignment consists in the analysis and improvement of the current <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> wear monitoring function that is used by BMW.

The conclusion of this analysis will serve to design an experimental planning to test brake linings.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> thickness due to wear on drum <b>brake</b> squeal. <b>Brake</b> <b>lining</b> will be worn out and subsequently its thickness will be reduced after a few number of braking applications. Hence dynamic properties of the lining, such as its natural frequency, might be changed. In this work, two different sets of <b>brake</b> <b>lining,</b> i. e., new and worn lining are used to investigate its effect on squeal generation. First, modal testing is performed to determine natural frequencies of those brake linings at free-free boundary condition. Later, squeal tests are carried out using brake dynamometer and squeal frequency is measured up to 10 kHz. Several squeal results are plotted over brake operating conditions to observe the influence of different lining thickness. In addition to these, squeal mechanisms, i. e., modal coupling due to closeness of the natural frequency between drum brake components and negative damping due to negative friction-velocity slope {{that contribute to the}} squeal generation are also investigated and discussed...|$|R

50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using braided stainless steel hose. The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. Braided stainless steel hose is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines.</b> It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series. Braided stainless steel <b>brake</b> <b>lines</b> are a common aftermarket upgrade, purchased and installed after a vehicle is initially purchased.|$|R
