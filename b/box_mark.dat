The trample and protection mechanics were included after being removed from Classic Sixth Edition and later base sets. Equipment, first introduced in the Mirrodin set, is also in Ninth Edition, although it was moved up in rarity. Furthermore, all mechanics now have reminder text; mechanics such as flying and trample did not in earlier sets. Ninth Edition is also the first set to be printed using the new template for enchantments. Previously, enchantments that were played on other permanents were called [...] "local enchantments" [...] and were printed with the type [...] "Enchant creature," [...] "Enchant land," [...] etc. With the Champions of Kamigawa set, Wizards of the Coast {{made an effort to}} simplify the type line, which had contained rules interactions that were not written on the card. [...] "Enchant entity" [...] was changed to [...] "Enchantment - Aura" [...] and the targeting restriction moved to the text <b>box.</b> <b>Mark</b> Gottlieb explained the changes in the article [...] "Aura Hygiene". Errata was issued to make all such cards conform to this template, and Ninth Edition became the first set where the cards were actually printed with this changed wording.|$|E
