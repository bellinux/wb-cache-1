50|$|Pine Bluff Former Production Facilities: PBA once housed two {{chemical}} warfare production facilities, and NSCMP {{was charged with}} destroying them {{to comply with the}} CWC. Destroyed in 1999, the BZ Fill Facility filled munitions with the agent BZ, a hallucinogen. In 2003, NSCMP began demolition of the former Pine Bluff Integrated Binary Production Facilities (PB IBPF), designed to produce binary chemicals and fill binary chemical weapons. These weapons were designed to mix two non-lethal chemicals to form a chemical agent in flight to a target. The DF Production/M20 Canister Fill and Close Facility was the only facility operated. From 1988 to 1990 it produced the <b>binary</b> <b>precursor</b> methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), inserting the chemical into coffee can-sized M20 canisters for use in the M687 155 mm Binary Artillery Projectile. The BLU-80/B Bigeye Bomb Fill Facility, QL Production Facility and DC Production Facility never operated, and all were demolished. The final remaining PB IBPF building, intended to fill binary munitions for the Multiple Launch Rocket System, but never used for that purpose, was reutilized as the Pine Bluff Binary Destruction Facility (PB BDF), to neutralize the <b>binary</b> <b>precursor</b> chemicals DF and QL. After neutralization was completed in October 2006, demolition of the building commenced. Completed on Dec. 28, 2006, it marked the end of the PB IBPF demolition and the last former {{chemical warfare}} production facility destroyed in the United States. This accomplishment was significant since it enabled NSCMP to surpass the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) treaty milestone of demolition of all the nation’s former production facilities four months ahead of schedule. Approximately 2,800 tons of metal were recycled from the IBPF.|$|E

40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the synthesis of complex materials from three or more constituents is the retention of very stable intermediate phases with properties grossly different from the target phase. In our recently developed two-stage synthesis methodology, a <b>binary</b> <b>precursor</b> is prepared and then directly converted into the product phase, thereby avoiding intermediate phase formation. Crystallographic similarities between the precursor and product phases are manipulated such that the major structural elements remain chemically intact. Ordered structural vacancies are used to facilitate rapid and highly selective diffusion of the third element into the precursor. Since no crystallographic reconstruction is required, no extraneous phases can form. The method has been tested on the solid state synthesis of Ti₃SiC₂ and Ti₃AlC₂, producing synthesis temperature reductions of 400 – 600 °C. It is postulated that similar crystal structural relationships in layered oxides, nitrides and intermetallic compounds will allow an extension to many other systems...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{dealloying}} of Pt <b>binary</b> alloy <b>precursors</b> {{has emerged}} as a novel and important preparation process for highly active fuel cell catalysts. Dealloying is a selective (electro) chemical leaching of a less noble metal M from a M rich Pt alloy precursor material and has been a familiar subject of macroscale corrosion technology for decades. The atomic processes occurring during the dealloying of nanoscale materials, however, are virtually unexplored and hence poorly understood. Here, we have investigated how the morphology and intraparticle composition depend on the particle size of dealloyed Pt-Co and Pt-Cu alloy nanoparticle precursor catalysts. To examine the size-morphology-composition relation, we used a combination of high-resolutionscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss (EEL) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and surface-sensitive cycling voltammetry. Our results indicate the existence of three distinctly different size-dependent morphology regimes in dealloyed Pt-Co and Pt-Cu particle ensembles: (i) The arrangement of Pt shell surrounding a single alloy core ("single core-shell nanoparticles") is exclusively formed by dealloying of particles below a characteristic diameter d(multiple cores) of 10 - 15 nm. (ii) Above d(multiple cores), nonporous bimetallic core-shell particles dominate and show structures with irregular shaped multiple Co/Cu rich cores ("multiple cores-shell nanoparticles"). (iii) Above the second characteristic diameter d(pores) of about 30 nm, the dealloyed Pt-Co and Pt-Cu particles start to show surface pits and nanoscale pores next to multiple Co/Cu rich cores. This structure prevails up to macroscopic bulklike dealloyed particles with diameter of more than 100 nm.

The material system would find potential application in the fabrication of components for optical applications such as transparent windows. ^ It was shown that a lack of major endothermic events during precursor decomposition and the resultant formation of highly dense particles upon pyrolysis are critical precursor characteristics for the deposition of dense and hard Y 2 O 3 -MgO coatings by SPPS. Using these principles, a new Y 2 O 3 -MgO precursor solution was developed, which yielded a coating with Vickers hardness of 560 Hv. This was a considerable improvement over the hardness of the coatings obtained using conventional solution precursors, which was as low as 110 Hv. ^ In the thermal decomposition synthesis process, <b>binary</b> solution <b>precursor</b> mixtures of: yttrium nitrate (Y[n]) or yttrium acetate (Y[a]), with magnesium nitrate (Mg[n]) or magnesium acetate (Mg[a]) were used in order to study the effects of precursor chemistry on the structural characteristics of the resultant Y 2 O 3 -MgO powders. The phase domains were coarse and distributed rather inhomogeneously in the materials obtained from the Y[n]Mg[n] and Y[a]Mg[a] mixtures; finer and more homogeneously-distributed phase domains were obtained for ceramics produced from the Y[a]Mg[n] and Y[n]Mg[a] mixtures. It was established that these phenomena were related to the thermal characteristics for the decomposition of the precursors and their effect on phase separation during oxide crystallization. Addition of ammonium acetate to the Y[n[Mg[n] mixture changed the endothermic process to exothermic and improved the dispersion of the component phases. ^ Two suspension types, made with powders synthesized from the Y[n]Mg[n] and Y[n]Mg[a] precursor mixtures were sprayed by SPS. The densities and hardnesses of the coatings deposited using the two powder types were similar. However, the microstructure of coatings deposited using the Y[n]Mg[a]-synthesized powder exhibited some eutectic configuration which was not observed in the coatings deposited using the Y[n]Mg[n]-synthesized powder. ...|$|R

We report the possible detection of nebular material associated with EY Cyg. Possible origins of the apparently large N V/C IV emission ratio are discussed in the context of nova explosions, contamination of the secondary star, and accretion of nova abundance-enriched matter back to the white dwarf via the accretion disk or as a descendant of a <b>precursor</b> <b>binary</b> that survived thermal-timescale mass transfer. The scenario involving pollution of the secondary by past novae may be supported by the possible presence of a nova remnant - like nebula around EY Cyg...|$|R
40|$|Metal oxide {{materials}} are a broad class of materials {{found in many}} current technologies due to their interesting properties such as magnetism and ferroelectricity. Material properties can be tuned and heavily influenced by disorder at the atomic level, {{as has been shown}} in the ferrimagnetic and ferroelectric Al 2 -x-yGaxFeyO 3 materials, which adopt the non-centrosymmetric, orthorhombic GaFeO 3 crystal structure-type (Pna 21). The significant cation disorder and non centrosymmetric nature of the crystal structure underlie the multiferroic properties in these materials and make them one of the few chemical systems to possess multiferroic ordering near room temperature. Unfortunately, while cation site disorder is responsible for the multiferroic properties observed in these compounds, their complex crystal structure has led to inconsistent reports in the ternary Al 2 -xFexO 3 and Ga 2 -xFexO 3 compounds. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is an element specific technique, which can be used to examine cation site disorder as a function of changes in the average coordination environment around the metal, providing a means of studying these complex materials. 	In this thesis, XANES was used to investigate factors affecting cation site disorder in a series of Al 1 -xGaxFeO 3 materials (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) adopting the GaFeO 3 crystal structure-type. The GaFeO 3 crystal structure has four cation sites, of which, the distorted octahedral Fe 1 and Fe 2 sites are primarily occupied by Fe 3 +, and the less distorted tetrahedral A 1 and octahedral A 2 sites are primarily occupied by Al 3 + or Ga 3 +. These materials were initially synthesized using a high temperature ceramic method, and it was found that with increasing Ga 3 + content (x) these materials show a decrease in the amount of cation site disorder between the tetrahedral site and the three octahedral sites. This decrease is attributed to the tetrahedral site preference of Ga 3 +, which inhibits cation site disorder at the A 1 site, as opposed to the octahedral site preference observed for Al 3 +. Additionally, Fe 3 + was found to predominantly occupy the three octahedral sites over the tetrahedral site in these materials, likely because of its large ionic size and the strong magnetic coupling between those three sites. 	The quaternary Al 1 -xGaxFeO 3 materials (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were synthesized again via two other techniques: a citrate sol-gel method and a co-precipitation method. The oxide network binding the <b>binary</b> metal oxide <b>precursors</b> limits ion mobility in the high temperature ceramic method. The citrate sol-gel and co-precipitation methods were used to generate mixed-metal precursors with a more homogeneous distribution of the metal cations than the <b>binary</b> metal oxide <b>precursors</b> commonly used by the high temperature ceramic method. Mixed-metal precursors reduce the distance the ions have to diffuse, while the nature of the amorphous matrix was found to affect disorder in the resulting material. From analysis of the XANES spectra, the ceramic method showed the least amount of cation site disorder, followed by the citrate sol-gel method and co-precipitation method, respectively. Greater annealing temperatures resulted in an increase in cation site disorder, with the average coordination number of Al 3 + and Ga 3 + increasing while the average coordination number of Fe 3 + decreased. Al 1 -xGaxFeO 3 materials synthesized via the co-precipitation method showed the greatest amount of cation disorder, followed by the citrate sol-gel and high temperature ceramic techniques, respectively. 	The research presented in this thesis is among the first to examine a large number of materials from the relatively unexplored Al 1 -xGaxFeO 3 system, and has contributed to the growing body of knowledge on the factors affecting cation site disorder in these materials and potentially other systems. Further, despite a simple rationale for understanding the features present in Al L 2, 3 - and Ga K-edge spectra, these studies have shown how effectively XANES can be used to understand subtle changes in the atomic structure of solid-state materials...|$|R

McGregorThere is a {{need for}} compact, rugged neutron {{detectors}} for a variety of applications including national security and oil well logging. A solid form neutron detector would have a higher efficiency than present day gas filled ³He and ¹⁰BF ₃ detectors, which are standards currently used in the industry today. A sub-branch of the III-V semiconductors is the filled tetrahedral compounds, known as Nowotny-Juza compounds (A[superscript I]B[superscript II]C[superscript V]). These materials are desirable for their cubic crystal structure and semiconducting electrical properties. Originally studied for photonic applications, Nowotny-Juza compounds have not been fully developed and characterized. Nowotny-Juza compounds are being studied as neutron detection materials here, and the following work is a study of LiZnP and LiZnAs material development and device characterization. 	<b>Precursor</b> <b>binaries</b> and ternary materials of LiZnAs and LiZnP were synthesized in-house in vacuum sealed quartz ampoules with a crucible lining. Synthesized powders were characterized by x-ray diffraction, where lattice constants of 5. 751 ±. 001 Å and 5. 939 ±. 002 Å for LiZnP and LiZnAs, respectively, were determined. A static vacuum sublimation in quartz was performed to help purify the synthesized ternary material. The resulting material from the sublimation process showed characteristics of a higher purity ternary compound. Bulk crystalline samples were grown from the purified material. Ingots up to 9. 0 mm in diameter and 13. 0 mm in length were harvested. Individual samples were characterized for crystallinity on a Bruker AXS Inc. D 2 CRYSO, energy dispersive x-ray diffractometer, and a Bruker AXS D 8 DISCOVER, high-resolution x-ray diffractometer with a 0. 004 ° beam divergence. High-resolution XRD measurements indicated reasonable out-of-plane and in-plane ordering of LiZnP and LiZnAs crystals. Devices were fabricated from the LiZnP and LiZnAs crystals. Resistivity of devices were determined within the range of 10 ⁶ – 10 ¹¹ Ω cm. Charge carrier mobility and mean free drift time products were characterized for electrons at 8. 0 x 10 ⁻⁴ cm² V⁻¹ ± 4. 8 % and 9. 1 x 10 ⁻⁴ cm² V⁻¹ ± 4. 4 % for LiZnP and LiZnAs respectively. Sensitivity to 337 nm laser light (3. 68 eV photons) was observed, where an absorption coefficient of 0. 147 mm⁻¹ was determined for LiZnAs devices. Thermal neutron sensitivity was evaluated with unpurified and purified LiZnP and LiZnAs devices. Sensitivity was observed, however material quality and crystalline quality significantly hindered device performance...|$|R
40|$|Fischer carbene {{complexes}} of the Group VI {{transition metals}} (Cr, Mo and W) containing {{at least two}} or three different transition metal substituents, all in electronic contact with the carbene carbon atom, were synthesized and studied both in solution and in the solid state. For the complexes of the type [M(CO) 5 {C(OR) R’}], the substituents chosen included (hetero) aromatic (benzene or thiophene) rings π-bonded to a chromium tricarbonyl fragment or ferrocene as the R’-substituent, while the OR-substituent was systematically varied between an ethoxy or a titanoxy group, to yield the complexes 1 (M = Cr, R = Et, R’ = Fc), 2 (M = W, R = Et, R’ = Fc), 5 (M = Cr, R = TiCp 2 Cl, R’ = Fc), 6 (M = W, R = TiCp 2 Cl, R’ = Fc), 7 (M = Mo, R = TiCp 2 Cl, R’ = Fc), 12 (M = Cr, R = TiCp 2 Cl, R’ = 2 -thienyl) and 13 (M = Cr, R = TiCp 2 Cl, R’ = [Cr(CO) 3 (η 6 -phenyl) ]). Direct lithiation of the ferrocene with n-BuLi/TMEDA at elevated temperatures, followed by the Fischer method of carbene preparation, also resulted, in most cases, in the formation of the novel biscarbene complexes with bridging ferrocen- 1, 1 ’-diyl carbene ligands [μ-Fe{C 5 H 4 C(OEt) M(CO) sub> 5 } 2] (3 : M = Cr, 4 : M = W) or the unusual bimetallacyclic bridged biscarbene complexes [{μ-TiCp 2 O 2 -O,O’}{μ- Fe(C 5 H 4) 2 -C,C’}{CM(CO) 5 } 2] (8 : M = Cr, 9 : M = W, 10 : M = Mo). It was attempted to prepare the mixed heteronuclear biscarbene complex 11 [W(CO) 5 C{μ-TiCp 2 O 2 - O,O’}{μ-Fe(C 5 H 4) 2 -C,C’}CCr(CO) 5], however the complex could not be fully characterized. The investigation was expanded to include Group VII transition metals Mn and Re, and using the same methodology, the manganese complexes isolated included [MnCp(CO 2 {C(OR) Fc}] (22 : R = Et, 24 : R = TiCp 2 Cl), 23 [μ- Fe{C 5 H 4 C(OEt) MnCp(CO) 2 } 2] and 25 [{μ-TiCp 2 O 2 -O,O’}{μ- Fe(C 5 H 4) 2 - C,C’}[CMnCp(CO) 2 } 2]. The different reactivity of the <b>binary</b> dirhenium decacarbonyl <b>precursor</b> complex, compared to that of the Group VI complexes, resulted in the formation of a range of complexes. The target compounds [Re 2 (CO) 9 {C(OR) Fc}] (26 : R = Et, 31 : R = TiCp 2 Cl), 27 [μ-Fe{C 5 H 4 C(OEt) Re 2 (CO) 9 } 2] and 33 [{μ- TiCp 2 O 2 -O,O’}{μ-Fe(C 5 H 4) 2 -C,C’}[CRe 2 (CO) 9 } 2] were isolated displaying a variety of different geometric isomers. In addition, acyl (30) and aldehyde (32) decomposition products, as well as hydrido (29), and hydrido acyl hydroxycarbene (34) complexes and the unique dichloro-bridged biscarbene complex (28) were also characterized. Most of these complexes displayed Re-Re bond breaking, and two probable mechanisms, either radical or ionic, were proposed involving either hydrogen transfer or protonation followed by hydrolysis. Finally, the structural features and their relevance to bonding in the carbene cluster compounds of the Group VI transition metals were investigated as they represent indicators of possible reactivity sites in multimetal carbene assemblies. The possibility of using DFT calculations to quantify the effect of metal-containing substituents on the carbene ligands was tested and correlated with experimental parameters by employing methods such as vibrational spectroscopy, molecular orbital analysis, and cyclic voltammetry. The best results were obtained from the cyclic voltammetric studies, where the localized metal centre’s oxidation potential correlated to both the calculated HOMO energy, and the effect of both the heteroatom substituent and the (hetero) arene substituent, as well as different combinations of the above.
