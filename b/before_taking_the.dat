His chronicle was completed by the biographers of his successor Sarsa Dengel (r. 1563–1597). The latter's chronicle can be considered an epic cycle for its preface describing events in previous eras mixed with biblical allusions. It also describes conflicts against rebel nobility allied with the Ottomans as well as a military campaign against Ethiopian Jews.|$|E

5|$|Big Thunder Ski Jumping Centre was a twin {{ski jumping}} hill located in Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It {{constitutes}} part of Big Thunder National Training Centre. The first hills were built by Knute and Thor Hansen and opened in 1963. They were originally known as Lille Norway Ski Area, then Mt. Norway Ski Area, and Sundance Northwest Resort <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> current name. The large and normal hills {{were built in}} 1974 and the venue {{was taken over by}} the provincial government in 1985. The hills hosted 29 FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and 50 Canadian Ski Jumping Championships tournaments between 1975 and 1995, climaxing with the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1995. Funding was then cut and the venue has since been closed and unmaintained.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{took the}} first set on a {{tie-break}} {{just as he had}} done in the US Open final the previous year, and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve, this time Djokovic took the tie-break. One break of serve in the eighth game (two hours and 52 minutes into the contest) was enough for Djokovic to take the third set <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> fourth 6–2 comfortably against a tired-looking Murray, who needed four hours to defeat Federer in the semifinal just two days before. The match lasted three hours and 40 minutes and four sets. By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, whereas Murray equalled Edberg's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} {{starts as}} Yodit attempts to flee from her nephew Gidajan, who has framed her for theft. She then seeks {{the hand of}} the Syrian prince Zanobis in marriage and performs several deeds to increase her reputation, having to deal with the Beja tribes, Nobatia, and the Ikshids. Then she defends the pass of Darginda from the army of Dagnajan, the king of Aksum, and his allies, the Begemder, while also dealing with Alodians and Orthodox monks, killing the king before he makes it through the mountain pass. Following this, she takes the fight to Gidajan and takes control of several stelae in the region surrounding the city of Massawa <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> city itself. She pursues her nephew to Aksum itself and destroys his palace in the city.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> lead in the straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|Erison Hurtault {{competed for}} Dominica in the men's 400meters dash. In Beijing, Hurtault {{was the only}} Dominican {{participating}} in the event. Born in Matawan, a New Jersey suburb of New York, and attending Columbia University, Hurtault initially tried out for the United States Olympic team, but failed to qualify, <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> berth offered {{to him by his}} parents' homeland. Hurtault was 23 {{at the time of his}} competition in Beijing, and had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the 17 August qualification round, the Dominican-American athlete was placed in the fourth heat. He finished in fourth place with a time of 46.10seconds, displacing Uruguay's Andres Bayron Silva (46.32seconds) but falling behind Jamaica's Ricardo Chambers (45.22seconds). The leaders of Hurtault's heat included Great Britain's Martyn Rooney (45.00seconds) and Australia's Sean Wroe (45.17seconds). Overall, he ranked 34th out of the 55 athletes who completed the qualification round of the event. Hurtault did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Khrushchev again {{sought to}} further his education, {{following}} Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but {{his career in}} the Party flourished. When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in Pravda. Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and afterward purging the cell of the rightists. Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city {{and a member of the}} Party's Central Committee. Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage, and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.|$|E

5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off her skirt and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
5|$|Up until Findlay's {{departure}} in 1947, Watford {{had been}} managed by five managers in 44 years, {{all of whom}} played for the team. By contrast, six men managed the club between 1947 and 1956, only two of whom were former Watford players. After a further three years under McBain between 1956 and 1959, Watford's following three managers presided over improved teams. Ron Burgess led Watford to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1959–60. Bill McGarry was only in charge for one full season (1963–64), but Watford recorded a finish of third in the Third Division, the club's highest Football League finish until that point. His successor Ken Furphy matched that achievement in 1966–67, and led Watford to the Third Division title in 1969, <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> club to its first FA Cup semi-final in 1970. Following Furphy's departure in 1971, Watford entered a period of decline, experiencing relegation under subsequent managers George Kirby and Mike Keen.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, the February Revolution {{broke out}} in Petrograd as {{industrial}} workers went on strike over food shortages and deteriorating factory conditions. The unrest spread {{to other parts of}} Russia, and fearing that he would be violently overthrown, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. The State Duma took over control of the country, establishing a Provisional Government. When Lenin learned of this from his base in Switzerland, he celebrated with other dissidents, and immediately sent advice to the Bolsheviks in Russia. He decided to return to Russia to take charge of the Bolsheviks there, but found that most passages into the country were blocked due to the ongoing First World War, which the Provisional Government had decided to continue with. He organised a plan with other dissidents to negotiate a passage for them through Germany, with whom Russia was then at war. Recognising that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens to travel in a train carriage through their territory, among them Lenin and his wife. The group then traveled by train from Zurich to Gottmadingen, and then to Sassnitz, followed by a ferry to Trelleborg in Sweden. They took a train to Sweden, where they were welcomed by the mayor, and then on to Harapanda. From there, they went by sleigh to Tornio in Russian-controlled Finland, and then by train to Helsinki, <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> final train to Petrograd.|$|E
