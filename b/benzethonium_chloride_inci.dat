40|$|Summary: It {{has been}} shown that <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> {{produces}} linear mixed-type inhibition of choline esterase and acetylcholine esterase. These enzymes also show-reagent-carry-over inhibition if the enzyme activities are measured in plastic cuvettes in which previously protein has been determined by the alkaline <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> method. Choline esterase is about 10 -fold more sensitive to <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> than acetylcholine esterase. With acetylthiocholine as substrate Michaelis-Menten constants for choline esterase and acetylcholine esterase are 85 μηιοΙ/ 1 and 102 μηιοΙ/ 1, respectively. Carry-over inhibitory effect of <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> can be avoided by washing the cuvettes, after protein determination by the <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> method, with 5 ml/ 1 Triton X- 100, 5 ml/ 1 Tween 20 or 10 g/ 1 sodium dodecyl sulphate. The latter has a disadvantage in that it precipitates out at low temperatures. The dry slide method (Johnson & Johnson) for serum choline esterase is free of the inhibitory effect until the concentration of <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> in the sample reaches about 200 μιηοΐ/ΐ...|$|R

The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the quaternary ammonium compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of <b>benzethonium</b> <b>chloride</b> in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated.

As is the case for other Phytophthora species, management options for these two pathogens are limited. Here, we have screened over 100 compounds for their anti-oomycete activity, as a potential first step toward identifying new control strategies. Our screening identified eight compounds that showed activity against both Phytophthora species. These included five antibiotics, two copper compounds and a quaternary ammonium cation. These compounds were tested for their inhibitory action against three stages of the Phytophthora life cycle: mycelial growth, zoospore germination, and zoospore motility. The inhibitory effects of the compounds were broadly similar between the two Phytophthora species, but their effectiveness varied widely among life cycle stages.
