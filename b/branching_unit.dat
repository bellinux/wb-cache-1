50|$|A {{submarine}} <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> is a {{piece of}} equipment used in submarine telecommunications cable systems to allow the cable to split to serve more than one destination. For example, one branch might head for a cable landing point and others may continue.|$|E
50|$|The shore {{station is}} linked to the first <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> as {{followed}} with 5 other branching units that are also linked to other branching units. This solid connection spur cable|forms a ring-shaped SONET network that has two cables in order to control the network traffic in two directions. A 2 by 2 Gbit/s data channel is implemented on the spur cable. Furthermore, each <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> is connected to a regional node station. And the connection between node stations and branching units provide 1 Gbit/s data rate using a fiber-optic cable. 6 Node stations split the back-haul into 6 separated regions and the network behavior in between each regions' devices is identical. Similar to the connections between node stations and branching units, node stations are linked to junction boxes with 1 Gbit/s data rate.|$|E
50|$|A cable {{landing point}} is the {{location}} where a submarine or other underwater cable makes landfall.

50|$|Aarabia shares {{features}} with basal euphyllophytes (Banks' trimerophytes). Two {{of these}} are dichotomous branching, which results in a clear difference between a 'main' stem and a lateral stem, and elongated sporangia, taller than wide, borne {{at the ends of}} fertile branch systems which are differentiated from other branches. Like some Psilophyton species, Aarabia had short side branches in which the last sections curved back on themselves. On the other hand, Aarabia had relatively few sporangia in each fertile <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> and they were single, not paired, whereas most trimerophytes had large clusters of sporangia carried in pairs which were often twisted around one another.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the design of the}} <b>branch</b> <b>unit</b> that has been implemented in some models of the recently announced IBM AS/ 400 1. The <b>branch</b> <b>unit</b> we describe is a modification of the unit originally designed for the experimental IBM ESA/ 370 2 SCISM processor. The main feature of <b>branch</b> <b>unit</b> is its capability to remove branch instructions from the instruction stream dynamically and pre-process them before the branches enter the pipeline. This allows the processor to issue branch-less code from the instruction stack while the branches execute separately and in parallel with the processing of other instructions. The branch prediction in the SCISM processor is achieved by the tagging of instructions in the cache, while in AS/ 400 is achieved with a branch history table. 1 Introduction It is well-known, see for example [1, 2], that branch instructions disrupt pipeline operation by introducing dead cycles (stalls or bubbles) when a decision must be made, based on a prior or coin [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The branch {{predictor}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the achievement of effective performance in microprocessors with pipelined architectures. This paper analyzes performance of <b>branch</b> prediction <b>unit</b> for pipelined processors. A memory of 512 bytes is designed for storing instructions. A 32 byte memory is designed for branch target buffer (BTB). This memory is utilized for storing history of the branch instructions. A Finite State Machine (FSM) is designed for <b>branch</b> predictor <b>unit.</b> It consists of four states: strongly taken, weakly taken, weakly not taken and strongly not taken. Prediction is done based on the status of FSM. If the state of FSM is weakly taken or strongly taken, then predictor guesses it as a taken condition else it is assumed to be not taken condition. When the execution of branch instruction is done for the first time the BTB stores the address of current instruction and also the address where it jumps. After this the current status of the FSM is updated accordingly. The program is executed using a <b>branch</b> predictor <b>unit</b> and also without a <b>branch</b> predictor <b>unit.</b> The latency of both the processors with a <b>branch</b> prediction <b>unit</b> and without is <b>branch</b> prediction <b>unit</b> is computed and compared. The simulation results validates that with <b>branch</b> prediction <b>unit</b> latency is decreased...|$|R
50|$|There were {{originally}} {{no plans to}} land the cable and install a landing station in Saint Helena. If this were done, however, the cable could supply the island's population with sufficient bandwidth to fully leverage the benefits of today's information society. Since January 2012 a campaign called Move This Cable launched by A Human Right, a San Francisco-based NGA working on initiatives to ensure all people {{are connected to the}} Internet, has been lobbying for a branch of the SAex cable to land on the remote island of Saint Helena in order to provide high-speed Internet access to the island's small population of 4,200 people and so to foster socio-economic development.On October 6, 2012, eFive agreed to reroute the cable through Saint Helena after successful lobbying efforts. Islanders have sought the assistance of the UK Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office in funding the £10m required to install a branch from an underwater OADM <b>branching</b> <b>unit</b> on the main cable to the island. The UK Government have announced that a review of the island's economy would be required before such funding would be agreed to.|$|E

While the monovalent GM 1 mimic showed the expected inhibition in the 200 µM range the multivalent scaffolds led to increased binding.
