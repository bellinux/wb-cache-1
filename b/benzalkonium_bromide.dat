40|$|A {{group of}} homochiral imidazolium salts bearing {{hydrophobic}} camphor derived moiety and ester or amide functional group were synthesized and characterized. The novel imidazolium bromides were tested as antimicrobial and antifungal agents and their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated and compared to clinically used <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (BAB) and carbethopendecinium bromide. The MIC values of amide derivatives 2 a and 2 b were slightly smaller {{than those for}} BAB, indicating their good activity. None of the prepared salts was more effective than carbethopendecinium bromide. The biocidal efficacy of amide derivatives was much higher compared to the ester analogues...|$|E
40|$|In {{clinical}} practice, {{the important}} hygienic prevention of bacterial pathogen spread is disinfection of potentially contaminated area. <b>Benzalkonium</b> <b>bromide</b> and chlorhexidine acetate {{are commonly used}} disinfectants with {{a broad spectrum of}} anti-microbial effect. It is vital to inhibit the spread of pathogen in hospital. However, a large number of pathogens with the decreased antiseptic susceptibility have been isolated from clinical samples which showed an increased minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against those antiseptics. These resistant pathogens are the major causes for nosocomial cross-infections in hospital. The present study demonstrated the utility of Oxford plate assay system in determining the potential disinfectant resistance of bacteria. The microbiological assay is based on the inhibitory effect of tested disinfectants upon the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Statistical analysis of the bioassay results indicated the linear correlation (r =  0. 87 – 0. 99, P <  0. 01) between the diameter of growth inhibition zone and the log dosage of the tested disinfectants. Moreover, comparison of inhibitory efficacy of <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>bromide</b> upon 29 S. aureus strains isolated from clinical samples by both Oxford plate method and broth dilution method showed that the diameter of growth inhibition zone has significantly negative correlation with the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (r = − 0. 574, P <  0. 001). These results suggest that the Oxford plate is a simple and time-saving method in detecting potential clinical disinfectant resistance and its usefulness for routine surveillance of pathogenic resistance to disinfectants warrants further investigation...|$|E
40|$|We {{tried to}} compare {{antimicrobial}} effectiveness of <b>Benzalkonium</b> <b>bromide</b> with various lengths of alkyl chains fixed in effective cationic {{section of the}} molecule in this dissertation. We worked with homologues that had the alkyl chain length 12, 14 and 16 carbon atoms and also with the mixture of homologues mixed in ratio 1 : 1 : 1. We were comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness against the members of G+, G- bacteria, torula, fungi and spores. We used agents from the Czech collection of microorganisms of the Natural science faculty of the Masaryk University Brno. Namely they are: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia rubidaea, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtilis. We determined MIC, MBC, MBC/N and MBC-B by the help of suspense micromethod for all strains except the fungi and spores members. Concerning the Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtilis we determined only the MBC. This was executed by the standard suspension method. The results of effective concentrations of particular tests are mentioned in g/ 100 ml. The antimicrobial effectiveness in the MIC test was nearly identical for all tested preparations. Concerning the bacterial strain of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli all homologues and also a mixture proved [...] ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Benzalkonium</b> <b>bromides</b> (BAK) are an {{important}} class of cationic surfactants with both industrialand commercial uses. They are used as preservatives for ophthalmic, nasal and parenteral productsand they are also used as a topical antiseptic and medical equipment disinfectant. In this work auniversal method for the preparation of these compounds is described. Using quaternization ofN,N-dimethylbenzylamines with long-chain n-alkylbromides we have prepared C 8, C 10, C 12, C 14,C 16, C 18 and C 20 homologues of the <b>benzalkonium</b> <b>bromides</b> (BAK) ...|$|R

Analysis of the susceptibilities of the sugE-containing strain (Escherichia coli KAM 32 /pSUGE 28) and sugE-deficient E. cloacae (EcΔsugE) showed that SugE confers resistance to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, tetraphenylphosphonium, <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, ethidium <b>bromide,</b> and sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Enterobacter cloacae is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes a variety of diseases, including bacteremia, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, uri-nary tract infections, endocarditis, intra-abdominal infections, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and ophthalmic infections (9, 10, 11). Recently, multidrug-resistant E. cloacae strains have been reported with increasing frequency in clinical and environmen-tal settings (6, 10, 16 – 18). So far, although several resistance mechanisms have been identified that cause the failure of che-motherapy against this bacterium, such as AmpC, GyrA...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Serratia marcescens, an {{important}} cause of nosocomial infections, shows intrinsic resistance {{to a wide}} variety of antimicrobial agents (multidrug resistance). Multidrug efflux pumps are often involved in the multidrug resistance in many bacteria. A study was undertaken to characterize the multidrug efflux pumps in S. marcescens. Methods: The genes responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype in S. marcescens were cloned into Escherichia coli KAM 32, a drug-hypersusceptible strain, for further analysis. Results: We cloned sdeXY genes and determined the nucleotide sequence. Clones that carried the sdeXY genes displayed reduced susceptibility to several antimicrobial agents including erythromycin, tetra-cycline, norfloxacin, <b>benzalkonium</b> chloride, ethidium <b>bromide,</b> acriflavine and rhodamine 6 G. A protein similarity search using GenBank revealed that SdeY is a member of the resistance nodulation cell-division of sdeXY into E. coli cells possessing tolC, but not in cells lacking tolC, resulted in multidrug resistance. We observed energy-dependent ethidium efflux in cells of E. coli KAM 32 possessing sdeXY and tolC. Conclusions: SdeXY is the first RND-type multidrug efflux pump to be characterized in multidrug-resistan...|$|R
