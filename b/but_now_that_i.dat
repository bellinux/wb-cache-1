500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to {{end of the}} West Indies {{domestic}} season, Australia {{toured the}} Caribbean. Having not been selected for either the Test series or the initial or the first three ODIs, Miller was [...] "surprised" [...] {{to be one of}} three new players called up for the final two ODIs in St Kitts, replacing Suliemann Benn. [...] "I was looking out for it [...] because I had a good season so I always kept my mind in tune for that call so that I won't be surprised," [...] said Miller. [...] "I was disappointed [...] <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got the chance I have to take it with both hands." [...] The West Indies had already lost the series 30.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have ever}} heard," [...] replied Julian, [...] "much the contrary; {{and it was}} <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{reminded}} you that you had been his friend." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou, Holly," [...] {{she said}} quickly, [...] "who art ever of a cavilling and {{suspicious}} mind, remembering what <b>I</b> said <b>but</b> <b>now,</b> believest <b>that</b> <b>I</b> lie to thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On that, indeed, {{it will be}} safe to rely. He is a most {{extraordinary}} man, Dunham--one who long puzzled me; <b>but</b> who, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> understand him, commands as much of my respect as any general in his majesty's service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{something}} in your expression, sir, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can see the colour of your clothes, why of course I know better. There's three marriages--which was it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{have had}} nothing to put to my mouth. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have met so kind a gentleman, I am sure that I shall have a good supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{know it is}} {{all right}} I shall not mind it. I wonder if I couldn't send my father the good news by telegraph?" ...|$|E
6000|$|FEEBLE. Then said Mr. Feeble-mind to him, [...] "How camest thou hither? <b>I</b> was <b>but</b> <b>now</b> {{complaining}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had not {{a suitable}} companion, but thou art {{according to my}} wish. Welcome, welcome, good Mr. Ready-to-halt; I hope thou and I may be some help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isobel," [...] he began, [...] "I {{need not}} tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love you; till lately I have not known how much, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not live without you." ...|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this time}} I had {{remained}} a mere spectator {{of what had}} happened. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> feared <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was on the brink}} of witnessing an awful tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to me again, Stillwell, {{after you}} have spoken to the boys. <b>But,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have {{suggested}} it, I am a little afraid. You know what cowboy fun is. Perhaps--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had once}} started, I {{made up my}} mind not to be captured. I was a good block ahead, and by {{skillful}} turning I gradually managed to increase the distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've seen {{pictures}} of Jesus," [...] said Felix meditatively. [...] "He looks just like a man, only better and kinder. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{come to think of}} it, I've never seen a picture of God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Signifies! Yes; it does signify a great deal. <b>But,</b> Thorne, Thorne, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} it, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{can think}} of things, it was--was it not you yourself {{who told me that}} the baby did not live?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was only}} in April 1974 <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{converted}} to Conservatism. (I had thought I was a Conservative <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not really one at all.)" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} matter if I was always with my company, Terence, <b>but</b> <b>now,</b> you see, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am acting as field-officer {{to the left}} wing till your father rejoins, it makes it awkward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Joe,' she said, quietly {{holding out}} her hand to him. 'I did not know you before, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do, I feel there is no {{occasion}} {{for me to have}} that fourth copy made.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{this young}} man has nothing that should revolt me. I think he has been wrong. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have said it I will let all that pass from me. He will dine with us to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, see ye here," [...] {{continued}} Dick, [...] "an we but escape whole we'll marry; and an we're to die, we die, and there's an end on't. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think, how found ye my chamber?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whence camest thou? ah! whence camest thou?" [...] said Gudruda. [...] "I thought thee dead, my love; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> dreamed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> prayed Odin, and he spared thee {{to me for}} a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I did {{but guess}} how thy heart and thy mind tended, Bertrade; <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> seest <b>that</b> <b>I</b> divined all too truly. He be indeed good to look upon, but what knowest thou of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to hope too--and to help if I can. I {{have tried}} to help him to- day, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> fear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have made a mistake, and that his wife will not thank me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Battery out of order, no doubt. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have started, I {{will find}} out what time it is." [...] He stepped to a speaking-tube in the wall, blew its whistle, and called, [...] "Mother!" [...] and {{repeated}} it twice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never fear. I'll behave," [...] promised Ruggedo. [...] "It is {{hard work}} being a King, and harder still {{to be a good}} King. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a common nome I am sure I can lead a blameless life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... and {{the very}} macer cried 'Cruachan!' <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have got you again I'll never despair. The oak shall go over the myrtle yet; we'll ding the Campbells yet in their own town. Praise God that I should see the day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no!' {{said the}} hostess. 'Not {{as bad as}} <b>that.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> declare <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will not be drawn into saying another word till you have had your supper. If you ask me fifty {{questions}} in the meantime, I won't answer one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's--whatever it is. I can't {{get over}} the thought of her. Once I thought I could, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't. It seems to grow worse. Sometimes I feel {{as if it would}} drive me crazy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, [...] "it {{will hurt}} {{me more than}} {{anything}} I could have had to face. In fact, {{the thought of it}} has been almost unbearable; <b>but</b> it's <b>now</b> clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall have to go through with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Frankly, I do. It {{will cost}} further money {{to bring it}} up, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a free hand and unstinted {{material}} I am even sanguine. We start in earnest in two months or so, {{and then we will}} see--what we shall see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't {{argue the}} matter; {{there are the}} lines--they speak for themselves. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> look again, you are not entirely wrong: there is a {{considerable}} admixture of jute, moss, and I think tallow. It certainly is most remarkable! Sir Isaac Newton--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{would like}} to know is if Aunt Olivia is going to be married," [...] said the Story Girl absently. [...] "I can hardly believe it. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think of it--Uncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in Halifax last summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A penny to KEEP, you mean: for {{all your}} love for the lass at the 'Bugle,' did thee ever spend a {{shilling}} in the house? Thee wouldn't go <b>now,</b> <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going too, and the Captain here stands treat." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should be}} very glad to meet an American Altrurian, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> wished she would {{tell me about the}} normal New York house, and what was its animating principle, {{beginning}} with the basement door.|$|R
6000|$|He put his {{trembling}} hand {{upon the}} table between them, and sat looking at her.--'that I was changed. I {{was surprised to}} hear you say so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> understand, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am. Don't be angry with me, Walter. I was too much overjoyed to think of it, then.' ...|$|R
