5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{begins a}} few moments after Dracula ends. Count Dracula has just been {{destroyed}} by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to Scotland Yard, where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had already been dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of hiring a lawyer, he enlists {{the aid of a}} psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.|$|E
5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} {{to push for}} an attack on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, where {{a small group of}} Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
50|$|Cameron {{does not}} care about his father's Golden age villainous legacy. He became a villain, not <b>because</b> of legacy, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> not a nice guy. He {{is a far more}} {{ruthless}} foe than his predecessor. He has begun a relationship with his teammate, the Tigress.|$|R
50|$|Well-Being Dairy's figurehead president. He has the timid {{and gentle}} {{soul of a}} good man. Although he's rich, he doesn't look down on people. <b>But</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> scared of his wife, he can't bring himself to go against her even when he knows that she is at fault.|$|R

5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was not well.|$|E
5|$|When {{serialization}} began, Kishimoto {{decided the}} ending would feature {{a fight between}} two characters: Naruto and Sasuke, which would end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from {{the early stages of}} the manga, since Hinata had always respected Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his wife because she wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno, but Kishimoto viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a love triangle among the three characters, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> decided that fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was little room for romantic plotlines.|$|E

5|$|When {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, {{not only because of}} his {{position}} <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> thought bellicosity unseemly in an old man. In February 1939, he became his court's senior circuit leader (in effect, chief judge, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded Martin Manton, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton's criminal conviction for bribery. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague's corruption.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock and envy of the other salesmen, and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to retain them. Vickers nearly ruins {{a relationship with a}} client but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Along the way, Vickers reveals that he was not hired for his business experience, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further. He also discovers a card challenging him to a paintball match, and the two play behind the building.|$|E
5|$|Thomas and {{his younger}} brother Henry served in the {{coronation}} of their cousin King Edward II of England on 25 February 1308; Thomas carried Curtana, the Sword of Mercy, and Henry carried the royal sceptre. After initially supporting Edward, Thomas became one of the Lords Ordainers, who demanded the banishment of Piers Gaveston and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured, Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312. Edward's authority was weakened by poor governance and defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn. This allowed Thomas to restrain Edward's power by republishing the Ordinances of 1311. Following this achievement Thomas took little part in the governance of the realm and instead retreated to Pontefract Castle. This allowed Edward to regroup and re-arm, leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the Treaty of Leake. In 1321 Edward's rule again collapsed into civil war. Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was Edward's cousin he was given a quicker death by beheading.|$|E
50|$|According to his Myspace page Mascarita Sagrada is both {{married and}} has children, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> always worked under a mask and never given {{his real name}} nothing else is known about {{that part of his}} life. Sagrada is also {{involved}} in charitable events, especially those focusing on children, such as visits to hospitals and orphanages.|$|R

25|$|His affectionate {{nickname}} was 'Noddy', not, {{as often}} said, because, {{once he was}} out, {{he was known to}} sleep often in the dressing room, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was once discovered watching the children's programme there.|$|E
25|$|The girls {{upstairs and}} the cameo woman – protects {{them from the}} sexual {{advances}} of the officers, not for his own pleasure, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> sees them as women connected to important men who could help him out after the war.|$|E
25|$|Descartes is not {{the first}} to use the {{mechanical}} analogies <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of the Smiths, a {{succession}} crisis occurred in the Latter Day Saint movement. Hyrum Smith, the Assistant President of the Church, was intended to succeed Joseph as President of the Church, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was killed with his brother, the proper succession procedure became unclear.|$|E
25|$|The Speaker {{usually comes}} from among MPs of the {{governing}} party. <b>But</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> or she cannot vote unless his or her vote would break a tie and by convention must vote {{to maintain the status}} quo (which includes voting confidence in the government), a minority government can slightly weaken the opposition's power by electing an opposition speaker.|$|E
25|$|Robeson was {{contacted}} by both Bayard Rustin and James Farmer {{about the possibility}} of becoming involved with the mainstream of the Civil Rights Movement. Because of Rustin's past anti-Communist stances, Robeson declined to meet with him. Robeson eventually met with Farmer, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was asked to denounce Communism and the Soviet Union in order to assume a place in the mainstream, Robeson adamantly declined.|$|E

5000|$|Redux Riding Hood, {{written by}} sitcom writer Dan O'Shannon, tells the {{familiar}} story of Red Riding Hood {{from the point}} of view of the big, bad wolf. The wolf (voiced by then-beloved co-star of Seinfeld, Michael Richards) is haunted by the decision to eat Red Riding Hood after dressing up as her grandmother, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> regrets the choice <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> convinced he can do it better now that he’s learned from his mistakes. But to do that, he has to build a time machine and avoid his poor wife (Mia Farrow). Can the wolf rewrite fairy-tale history or is he destined to never gobble down poor Red? ...|$|R
50|$|Oud was a {{respected}} voice in parliament, not only <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{spoke with a}} soft high pitched voice, <b>but</b> also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was the House's conscience {{when it came to}} constitutional issues and administrative laws.|$|R
25|$|In 1942, Representative Morrison {{introduced}} Governor Jones's {{proposal for}} a volunteer state guard. One of the five opponents of the bill, T. C. Brister, then a freshman member from Pineville in Rapides Parish, explained that he opposed the measure not because of opposition to the Jones administration <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation under J. Edgar Hoover was better suited for handling such wartime security issues.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} {{has been}} that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus {{not so much because}} he loved money, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loved his country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down.|$|E
25|$|Roberto Dellasega of Italy was disqualified, and {{therefore}} excluded from any opportunity to advance. Norway's Anders Jacobsen did not show, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was pre-qualified he {{advanced to the}} competition round anyway. The top finisher in the qualifying round was Michael Uhrmann of Germany. His countryman Michael Neumayer had the second-longest jump but placed third to Czech jumper Jakub Janda because of Janda's higher judge's score. All four jumpers from the host country of Canada failed to qualify.|$|E
