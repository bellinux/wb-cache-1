5|$|Among {{the first}} devices {{external}} to the human body that are considered instruments are rattles, stampers, and various drums. These earliest instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing. Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies. Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> and function rather than any resemblance to modern instruments. Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the Chukchi people of the Russian Far East, the indigenous people of Melanesia, and many cultures of Africa. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture. One East African tribe, the Wahinda, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.|$|E

25|$|The new B+ was {{incapable}} of operating some original BBC B programs and games, such as, for example, the very popular Castle Quest. A particular problem was {{the replacement of the}} Intel 8271 floppy disk controller with the Western Digital 1770 – not only was the new controller mapped to different addresses, it was fundamentally incompatible and the 8271 emulators that existed were necessarily imperfect for all but <b>basic</b> <b>operation.</b> Software that used copy protection techniques involving direct access to the controller, simply would not operate on the new system. Acorn attempted to alleviate this, starting with version 2.20 of the 1770 DFS, via an 8271-backward- compatible Ctrl+Z+Break option.|$|E
25|$|The {{gear teeth}} {{were in the}} form of {{equilateral}} triangles with an average circular pitch of 1.6mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even. Due to advances in imaging and X-ray technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.|$|E

25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. He was sure he {{was not the only one}} of the FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
25|$|There exist two {{underlying}} {{models in}} each OT system: the data model {{that defines the}} way data objects in a document are addressed by operations, and the operation model that defines the set of operations that can be directly transformed by OT functions. Different OT systems may have different data and operation models. For example, the data model of the first OT system is a single linear address space; and its operation model consists of two primitive operations: character-wise insert and delete. The <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> model has been extended to include a third primitive operation update to support collaborative Word document processing and 3D model editing. The basic OT data model has been extended into a hierarchy of multiple linear addressing domains, which is capable of modeling {{a broad range of}} documents. A data adaptation process is often required to map application-specific data models to an OT-compliant data model.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the realm}} of numbers to which these {{operations}} can be applied expands there are also changes in how the operations are viewed. For instance, in {{the realm of}} integers, subtraction is no longer considered a <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers. Similarly, when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers, division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers. In keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, [...] "Why can't we divide by zero?", becomes [...] "Why can't a rational number have a zero denominator?". Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> of the CANDU {{design is}} similar to other nuclear reactors. Fission {{reactions}} in the reactor core heat pressurized water in a primary cooling loop. A heat exchanger, {{also known as a}} steam generator, transfers the heat to a secondary cooling loop, which powers a steam turbine with an electric generator attached to it (for a typical Rankine thermodynamic cycle). The exhaust steam from the turbines is then cooled, condensed and returned as feedwater to the steam generator. The final cooling often uses cooling water from a nearby source, such as a lake, river, or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario, use a diffuser to spread the warm outlet water over a larger volume and limit the effects on the environment.|$|E

2500|$|Submarine Qualification {{insignia}} (usually {{known as}} [...] "dolphins" [...] or [...] "fish") are breast insignia of the submarine warfare community which are issued to those naval personnel after they complete a complex, demanding and extensive program that incorporates learning each system aboard the submarine and completion of certain watchstanding requirements including cross rate watch requirements. This program differs {{from many of}} the other [...] "Warfare" [...] programs in that it requires personnel to become proficient in engineering and operational details {{to such an extent that}} each person must be able to understand and perform <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> of each system and equipment aboard the submarine. [...] In addition each person must be able to efficiently perform damage control and emergency control functions in each space on the submarine. [...] The Submarine Qualification insignia for officers and enlisted was first proposed by then-Captain Ernest King on 13 June 1923, with the current design finalized March 1924.|$|E
2500|$|Every well-ordered set {{is uniquely}} order {{isomorphic}} to a unique ordinal number, called the order type of the well-ordered set. The position of each element within the ordered set is also given by an ordinal number. In {{the case of}} a finite set, the <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> of counting, to find the ordinal number of a particular object, or to find the object with a particular ordinal number, corresponds to assigning ordinal numbers one by one to the objects. The size (number of elements, cardinal number) of a finite set is equal to the order type. Counting in the everyday sense typically starts from one, so it assigns to each object the size of the initial segment with that object as last element. Note that these numbers are one more than the formal ordinal numbers according to the isomorphic order, because these are equal to the number of earlier objects (which corresponds to counting from zero). Thus for finite n, the expression [...] "n-th element" [...] of a well-ordered set requires context to know whether this counts from zero or one. In a notation [...] "beta&-th element" [...] where β can also be an infinite ordinal, it will typically count from zero.|$|E

2500|$|Numbers uses {{a hybrid}} {{approach}} {{to the creation of}} formulas, supporting the use of named data like Improv, but implementing them in-sheet like Excel. In <b>basic</b> <b>operation,</b> Numbers can be used just like Excel; data can be typed anywhere and formulas can be created by referring to the data by its cell. However, if the user types a header into the table, something one normally does as a matter of course, Numbers uses this to automatically construct a named range for the cells on that row or column. For instance, if the user types [...] "month" [...] into A1, and then types the names [...] "January", [...] "February", etc. into the cells below it, Numbers constructs a named range for the cells A2 through A13 and gives it the name [...] "month". The same is true when the user types in the figures for [...] "sales" [...] and [...] "income". The user can then write the averaging formula in a category-like text format, = total income / cars sold. The formula will find the appropriate data and calculate the results independent of the row. Like Improv, this formula does not refer to the physical location of the data in the sheet, so the sheet can be dramatically modified without causing the formula to fail.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the heights}} of the various SkyScreamer {{installations}} vary from park to park, the <b>basic</b> <b>operation</b> of the ride is consistent. Riders sit in one of 16 two-seat chairs connected to a gondola mounted on a central tower, which brings the gondola up and down. A seat belt is placed over the rider's waist to keep them firmly in their seat, and a lap bar is fastened into place. When the ride cycle begins, the gondola rises {{to the top of}} the tower, beginning to spin slowly around the central tower and picking up speed as it ascends further. By the time it reaches the top, it is rotating around the tower at its full speed of approximately , with riders rotating around the tower in a circle [...] in diameter. The gondola remains at the top of the tower for a period of time, then it descends and slows down slightly before returning to the top. At the end of the cycle, the gondola lowers to the ground and slows its rotation such that, by the time it reaches the bottom of the tower, all rotation has ceased and the riders are able to depart. Optionally, SkyScreamer can be set to rotate in the opposite direction during its cycle, such that riders are traveling backwards. Thus far, the installations at St. Louis, Discovery Kingdom, Fiesta Texas, New England and La Ronde have operated in this manner, with each running them in this mode during special events or as a limited-time promotion.|$|E
