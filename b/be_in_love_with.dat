At the behest of Dudley, Psaltis traveled to the ECW Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where ECW promoter Paul Heyman {{told her that he}} would book her for several appearances in an angle with Lance Storm. She debuted in ECW on August 28, 1998 as the manager of Storm, feuding with Chris Candido and his manager, Tammy Lynn Sytch. Although she was only supposed to have a three-week role in the company, Heyman was impressed by the chemistry between Psaltis and Storm and offered her a contract, which she accepted. Psaltis created her character to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Storm and clumsy rather than glamorous.|$|E

25|$|In 1616, the 22-year-old Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden {{started looking}} around for a Protestant bride. He had since 1613 tried to get his mother's {{permission}} to marry the noblewoman Ebba Brahe, {{but this was not}} allowed, and he had to give up his wishes to marry her, though he continued to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> her. He received reports with the most flattering descriptions of the physical and mental qualities of the beautiful 17-year-old princess Maria Eleonora. Elector John Sigismund was favorably inclined towards the Swedish king, but he had become very infirm after an apoplexic stroke in the autumn of 1617. His determined Prussian wife showed a strong dislike for this Swedish suitor, because Prussia was a Polish fief and the Polish King Sigismund III Vasa still resented his loss of Sweden to Gustavus Adolphus' father Charles IX.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame MÃ¼nster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Felix. Her love encourages her to take a new perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E

500|$|While {{the name}} of the anti-Hulk armor, usually {{referred}} to as the [...] "Hulkbuster" [...] in comic books, is not spoken in the film, its deployment system and containment cell are code-named [...] "Veronica".

500|$|... "Homer's Phobia" [...] {{has been}} cited as a {{significant}} part of The Simpsons exploration of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes. The series made several references to homosexuality before the episode aired. In the 1990 episode [...] "Simpson and Delilah", the character Karl (voiced by Harvey Fierstein) kisses Homer, while the recurring character Waylon Smithers is often shown to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> his boss, Montgomery Burns, initially suggestively and since then more overtly. However, [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] was the first episode to revolve entirely around homosexual themes. Two later episodes that explored LGBT issues were [...] "Three Gays of the Condo" [...] and [...] "There's Something About Marrying".|$|E
500|$|However, not all reviews were positive. The same review from The Plain Dealer [...] {{expressed}} displeasure at how, [...] "after 150 {{pages of}} romantic dithering, I was tapping my foot to move on."

Exceptâ why? There's little {{distinction between the two}} thinly imagined guys, {{other than the fact that}} Peeta has a dopier name.

500|$|In Psychology Today, Morris B. Parloff {{stated that}} Bartley had written his {{biography}} of Erhard [...] "carefully, lovingly, and well". Kris Jeter, writing in Cults and the Family, commented that [...] "wise researchers know and teach {{that one should}} <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> their research topic", and counted Bartley's book among several in which [...] "this love was highly evident". Steve McNamarra, in the Pacific Sun, said that the book was [...] "clearly written and, while basically sympathetic" [...] was not [...] "an adulatory 'house job'." [...] McNamarra found the sections detailing Erhard's [...] "soap opera", making up three-quarters of the book, the easiest to read, while the [...] "intersections", passages in which Bartley provided concise summaries of the philosophical traditions underpinning Erhard's est training, were tougher but ultimately rewarding.|$|E
500|$|The {{moment that}} Cupid and Psyche are {{revealed}} {{is an example}} of [...] "Keatsian intensity" [...] as they are neither in a state of separation nor are they united; they exist in a state somewhere in between in a similar manner to the figures depicted in Keats's [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". The narrator's ability to witness the union is unique to Keats's version of the Psyche myth because the lovers in the original story were covered in darkness. However, the narrator questions if he was able to see them at all or if he was dreaming. This inability of the narrator to know if he was awake is a theme that appears in many of Keats's odes that followed, including [...] "Ode on Indolence", [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". Regardless of the narrator's state of consciousness, he is able to relate himself to Cupid as he believes himself to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Psyche, representing the mind.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} Mr. Hooper episode, [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] was studied {{extensively}} for comprehension and attention. After it was filmed, it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers. The results found several unintended negative effects. As The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "it bombed". Despite Gordon's reassuring the Muppets Elmo, Big Bird, and Telly, children {{believed that their}} parents' arguments would lead to their divorce. They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice's parents loved them despite the divorce, were unclear where the characters' parents lived (especially their father, who had never appeared on the show before). Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again. According to Singer, [...] "The kids came away with negative messages... The kids misunderstood arguments. They said arguments did mean divorce. Some thought Snuffy's parents were moving away even though we said just the opposite.

500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1558 Robert and Amy Dudley {{were looking for a}} {{suitable}} residence of their own in order to settle in Norfolk; nothing came of this, however, before the death of Queen Mary I in November 1558. Upon the accession of Elizabeth I Robert Dudley became Master of the Horse and his place was now at court at almost constant attendance on the Queen. By April 1559 Queen Elizabeth seemed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> Lord Robert, and several diplomats reported that some at court already speculated that the Queen would marry him, [...] "in case his wife should die", as Lady Dudley was very ill in one of her breasts. Very soon court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Robert Dudley from her side. He visited his wife at Throcking {{for a couple of days}} at Easter 1559, and Amy Dudley came to London in May 1559 for about a month. At this time, on 6June, the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra wrote that her health had improved, but that she was careful with her food. She also made a trip to Suffolk; by September she was residing in the house of Sir Richard Verney at Compton Verney in Warwickshire.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or somethingâ there was something, but I don't think it's everâ I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E
