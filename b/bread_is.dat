5|$|<b>Bread</b> <b>is</b> a {{significant}} part of German cuisine and German bakeries produce about 600 main types of bread and 1,200 different types of pastries and rolls (Brötchen). German cheeses account for about a third of all cheese produced in Europe. In 2012 over 99% of all meat produced in Germany was either pork, chicken or beef. Germans produce their ubiquitous sausages in almost 1,500 varieties, including Bratwursts, Weisswursts, and Currywursts. In 2012, organic foods accounted for 3.9% of total food sales.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, it is {{recommended}} to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt.|$|E

5|$|Mercury was {{ingested}} {{through the}} consumption of homemade bread, meat and other animal products obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to have been}} the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.|$|E
5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is an everyday bread and is very similar to pita. It often takes the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used to scoop various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> a paper-thin unleavened bread and when unfolded it is almost transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E
5|$|Pita <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> a {{double-layered}} flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used {{in multiple}} ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} okara-containing breads, white bread, bagle, and nun, were produced, and the microstructure, {{physical}} property, and characteristic of taste were investigated. Twenty percentage of wheat flour of the <b>breads</b> <b>was</b> substituted with dry okara. The difference between microstructures of breads {{with and without}} okara was slightly observed in three kinds of breads, respectively. While the height or thickness of <b>breads</b> <b>was</b> decreased by the substitution of wheat flour, the hardness of <b>breads</b> <b>was</b> increased by the substitution.

5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number of meals based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> used for scooping the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|E

25|$|When the Pharaoh {{freed the}} Israelites, {{it is said}} that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the {{duration}} of Passover no leavened <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> eaten, for which reason Passover was called the feast of unleavened bread in the Torah or Old Testament.

5000|$|A rural county, Dorset {{would have}} been typical of England in the Middle Ages, and its {{population}} would have eaten similarly {{to the rest of}} the country. <b>Bread</b> <b>was</b> the staple food, and it came in two main categories: white and other breads; white <b>breads</b> <b>were</b> the finest quality breads and {{would have been}} made using wheat and then well-sifted flour; other <b>breads</b> <b>were</b> a mixture of breads which also contained wheat, though the flour would not have been sifted as much, husk and other grains. The most commonly eaten <b>bread,</b> called maslin, <b>was</b> of the other category and contained wheat and rye.|$|R
40|$|Common {{buckwheat}} (Fagopyrium esculentum Moench) {{was used}} to substitute 15 % of wheat flour to make buckwheat enhanced wheat breads. Proximate composition, physical quality, functional components and antioxidant properties of buckwheat enhanced wheat <b>breads</b> <b>were</b> analysed and {{compared with those of}} white bread. Specific volumes of three <b>breads</b> <b>were</b> 6. 10 - 6. 75 cm(3) /g. Buckwheat enhanced wheat bread showed lower lightness and whiteness index values and higher redness and yellowness values. On a seven-point hedonic scale, all sensory results were 5. 33 - 5. 91, indicating that three <b>breads</b> <b>were</b> moderately acceptable. No differences were found in appearance, colour and overall sensory attributes for three breads, whereas both buckwheat enhanced wheat <b>breads</b> <b>were</b> rated higher in flavour and mouth feel. Buckwheat enhanced wheat bread contained more rutin and quercetin as expected. Buckwheat enhanced wheat <b>bread</b> <b>was</b> good in antioxidant activity, reducing power and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging ability with unhusked buckwheat enhanced wheat bread being the most effective. Overall, buckwheat enhanced wheat <b>bread</b> could <b>be</b> developed as a food with more effective antioxidant properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Breading (also {{known as}} crumbing) is a dry grain-derived food coating {{for a piece}} of food made from bread crumbs or a {{breading}} mixture with seasonings. Breading can also refer to the process of applying a bread-like coating to a food. <b>Breading</b> <b>is</b> well suited for frying as it lends itself to creating a crisp coating around the food. <b>Breading</b> mixtures can <b>be</b> made of breadcrumb, flour, cornmeal, and seasoning that the item to <b>be</b> <b>breaded</b> <b>is</b> dredged in before cooking. If the item to <b>be</b> <b>breaded</b> <b>is</b> too dry for the coating to stick, the item may first be moistened with buttermilk, raw egg, egg wash or other liquid.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{develop a}} reduced sodium bread in which salt (NaCl) is {{partially}} replaced with K, Mg, and Ca salts. Methods: Experimental <b>bread</b> <b>was</b> compared against standard brown bread, after a drop test (to assess whether bread quality deteriorates with abuse) and after usual baking practices for baking properties (volume, crust colour, crumb colour and cell structure), sensory properties and nutritional composition. Plant production feasibility was evaluated {{in an industrial}} plant. <b>Breads</b> produced there <b>were</b> subjected to sensory evaluation using triangulation tests in a panel of 122 consumers. Twenty-four samples of both standard and experimental <b>bread</b> <b>were</b> laboratory-analysed for Na, K, Mg and Ca content. Results and Conclusion: A 32. 3 % reduced Na brown <b>bread</b> <b>was</b> developed which was acceptable in terms of baking qualities, appearance, texture and taste. Potassium, magnesium and calcium content of the <b>bread</b> <b>were</b> increased by 55. 2 %, 69. 0 %, and 34. 8 %, respectively...|$|R
25|$|Normally, {{the custom}} {{is not to}} talk between washing hands and eating bread. However, {{according}} to some, if salt was not placed on the table, it is permitted to ask for someone to bring salt, before the blessing on <b>bread</b> <b>is</b> recited.|$|E

Swedish recipe books dating from the 17th-18th century contain recipes of cakes, but not everyday bread, indicating that cakes were baked less often and amongst the higher echelons of society.
