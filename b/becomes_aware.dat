5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> after two bars that the soloist {{knows exactly what}} he is doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
5|$|The team <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> {{that a human}} has the {{uncontrolled}} {{ability to}} affect electrical energy, made this way by Jacob Fischer (Max Baker). Fischer is a rogue scientist wanted by Interpol, who experimented on humans by luring his victims through bogus ads. Olivia continues to encounter John Scott, who promises her that he does love her, and will prove it. Through him, Olivia realizes that someone survived the elevator impact.

They send Meegar to a hospital to be examined.|$|E
5|$|Verses 12.23–31 {{state that}} the lingasharira, which is the subtle body that is not visible, glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead. This shining Shakti (force, energy, power), {{translates}} Bhattacharya, is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision. Atman is perceived when the mind located {{in the space between}} the eyebrows, becomes free of all distractions and activities. In this state, the yogin <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of self within, and in the sages, in siddhas and others. If dissolution of the mind in the space between the eye brows does not occur, the yogin should envision absolute bliss, alternatively the full moon inside the mouth. This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity, helping it reside in Vishnupada or the Akasha (sky), and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation. This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge, the goal of the practice of yoga.|$|E

5|$|Williams gained public {{recognition}} for Brokeback Mountain, a film directed by Ang Lee that depicts the homosexual relationship between Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal). Williams plays Ennis' wife Alma, who <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the true}} nature of his and Jack's relationship when she sees them in an embrace. After viewing The Station Agent, casting director Avy Kaufman suggested to Lee that he cast Williams as Alma. The film was a box office hit, grossing around $178million worldwide in ticket sales against its $14million production costs. The film received eight Oscar nominations, the most for any film that year, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Williams, and it won three accolades at the 78th Academy Awards. The saffron Vera Wang dress, which she wore to the Academy Awards in March 2006, has been cited by Cosmopolitan magazine as one of the Best Oscar dresses of all time.|$|E
5|$|It is {{explained}} that, {{in the aftermath}} of her being left by Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon travelling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is shocked to learn that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair. O'Malley, who finds himself in the unpleasant situation of repeating his internship, quickly gains support in Lexie, who decides not to tell the fellow interns about his failed exam. Karev is revealed to have visited Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), following her departure. In the absence of Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), who relocated to Los Angeles, California, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) seeks reconciliation with Shepherd, formerly his closest friend and confidant. Initially unwilling to resume his friendship with Sloan, Shepherd ultimately gives him a second chance. Bailey manifests a cold attitude towards Webber, in order to express her disappointment in not being considered for the position of Chief Resident, in spite of her enviable reputation among the hospital staff. Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of gray hair. This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of her lust {{for a younger}} man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

5|$|The Overmind is {{the center}} of the Zerg Swarm's hive mind society, created by the Xel'Naga as a single {{consciousness}} for their experiments on the Zerg. It is the antagonist of StarCraft, where it is voiced by Jack Ritschel; Paul Eiding voices the character in Wings of Liberty. At some point during its creation, it was secretly enslaved by the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, who implanted it with a directive to destroy the Protoss and bound the Zerg to a hive mind. The Overmind <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of Xel'Naga, attacking and assimilating its masters. Through this, the Overmind learns of the existence of the Protoss and is determined to assimilate the fellow Xel'Naga-empowered species, believing this will result in perfection. To provide the necessary force to overcome the Protoss, the Overmind targets the psionic potential of the Terrans for assimilation. He also assimilated Sarah Kerrigan so as to create a weapon to free the Zerg from the control of his Dark Master. The Zerg and Protoss clash on various Terran worlds, eventually leading to Zeratul assassinating the cerebrate Zasz. Zasz's death momentarily links the minds of the Overmind and Zeratul, allowing Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind quickly launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet's surface. Following a lengthy and costly campaign on Aiur, Tassadar harnesses the energies of the dark templar to strike at the Overmind directly, disintegrating it.|$|E
25|$|Common {{causes of}} oral {{ulceration}} include rubbing on sharp edges of teeth, fillings, crowns, false teeth (dentures), or braces (orthodontic appliances). Accidental biting {{caused by a}} lack of awareness of painful stimuli in the mouth (e.g., following local anesthetic used during dental treatment) may cause ulceration which the person <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of as the anesthetic wears off and the full sensation returns.|$|E
25|$|At lunch, the Prince <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> {{that his}} family is worried about Tancredi's safety. As a result, the Prince makes an effort to appear {{simultaneously}} concerned and reassuring. When dessert is brought out, it's his favorite - a large, castle-shaped jelly. As dessert commences, the castle is essentially demolished before Don Paolo, the Prince's son and heir, {{gets a chance to}} have any.|$|E

25|$|Gender typing is {{the process}} by which a child <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of their gender and thus behaves {{accordingly}} by adopting values and attributes of members of the sex that they identify as their own. This process is extremely important for a child’s social and personality development because it largely impacts the child’s understanding of expected social behaviour and influences social judgments.|$|E
25|$|Walker and Pilgrim {{investigate}} {{the death of}} a seemingly normal person who is later revealed {{to be a member of}} an alien organization called the Millennium Guard. Pilgrim <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> that she is being investigated by Internal Affairs for her recent actions, and Walker is contacted by the Millennium Guard to take the place of the earlier victim. When he accepts, he is given new powers. Walker also begins a romantic relationship with a witness to the murder.|$|E
25|$|Resolved {{to gather}} {{material}} evidence, Batou infiltrates the LOCUS SOLUS headquarters ship while Togusa remotely hacks its security systems using an unaware Kim as a proxy. The ship's security <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of the hacking and retaliates with {{a virus that}} fries Kim's cyberbrain. Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard. As Batou fights to the ship's center, the Major then appears by controlling a gynoid remotely, helping Batou fight the gynoids and hack the ship's security.|$|E

25|$|The {{automaticity}} model, {{which became}} widespread following exposition by John Bargh {{and others in}} the 1980s, describes sophisticated processes for executing goals which can be selected and performed over an extended duration without conscious awareness. Some experimental data suggests that the brain begins to consider taking actions before the mind <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of them. This influence of unconscious forces on people's choices naturally bears on philosophical questions free will. John Bargh, Daniel Wegner, and Ellen Langer are some prominent contemporary psychologists who describe free will as an illusion.|$|E
25|$|Child {{trafficking}} {{has also}} been shown to have a major effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking. Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short. As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life. In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.|$|E
25|$|In the future, Apocalypse has {{conquered the}} Earth and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse's body had grown feeble: he <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> {{of the young}} Nathan's {{presence}} in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer his consciousness and power into the clone's stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan. Nathan grows up to become the warrior Cable (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist known as Stryfe) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse's future domination of the planet.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, {{published}} in 2008, {{claims to have}} replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization {{on the part of}} participants. The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the readiness potential). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.|$|E
25|$|The story unfolds as a first-person {{narrative}} and contains many references (see below) to real people, places, literary works and philosophical and cultural concepts, besides some fictional or ambiguous ones which {{contribute to the}} plot development. It is divided into part one, part two, and a postscript. Events and facts are revealed roughly in the order that the narrator <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of them or their relevance. The timing of events in Borges's first-person story is approximately from 1935 to 1947; the plot concerns events going {{back as far as}} the early 17th century and culminating in a postscript set in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on experiential {{learning}}, but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also <b>becomes</b> <b>aware</b> of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E
