Failures in the spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> of the main transmission were experienced in tests because the method of analysis employed had not considered the effect of rim bending. Consequently, new gears with strengthened rims were designed and fabricated. For a more accurate prediction of the load capacity of the gears, an extensive Finite Element Method (FEM) system was developed. The U.S. Army's XCH-62 HLH aft rotor transmission was finally successfully tested at full design torque and speed, but the US Congress cut funding for the program in August 1975. The designers of the Mil Mi-26 avoided similar problems by using a split-torque design in the main rotor transmission.|$|E

5000|$|Drive shafts {{have been}} used on {{motorcycles}} since before WW1, such as the Belgian FN motorcycle from 1903 and the Stuart Turner Stellar motorcycle of 1912. As an alternative to chain and belt drives, drive shafts offer long-lived, clean, and relatively maintenance-free operation. A disadvantage of shaft drive on a motorcycle is that helical gearing, spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> or similar is needed to turn the power 90° from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{exception}} to this is the Torsen differential, which uses worms and planetary worm gears {{in place of the}} <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> of conventional open differentials. Torsen differentials are most prominently featured in the HMMWV and some commercial Hummer vehicles, and as a centre differential in some all wheel drive systems, such as Audi's quattro. Very heavy trucks, such as those used to carry aggregates, often use a worm gear differential for strength. The worm drive is not as efficient as a hypoid gear, and such trucks invariably have a very large differential housing, with a correspondingly large volume of gear oil, to absorb and dissipate the heat created.|$|E
50|$|Wilkinson {{had also}} diversified into light car {{production}} {{by this time}} and designed a substantial enclosed sidecar with leaf spring suspension as an option for the TMC. In 1912 the 'worm drive' rear hub was replaced with more effective <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> and the Wilkinson designed girder forks were updraded to a 'Saxon' design to improve handling. Only about 250 Wilkinsons were produced before the First World War restrictions brought the line to its end in the Spring of 1916 and the Wilkinson company had to produce thousands of bayonets for the war effort. After the war they decided to continue to develop the in-line four engine - but in a new car called the 'Deemster' and they never returned to motorcycle production.|$|E
50|$|Shaft-driven bikes {{have a large}} <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> where a {{conventional}} bike would have its chain ring. This meshes with another <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> mounted on the drive shaft. The use of <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> allows the axis of the drive torque from the pedals to be turned through 90 degrees. The drive shaft then has another <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> near the rear wheel hub which meshes with a <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> on the hub where the rear sprocket would be on {{a conventional}} bike, and canceling out the first drive torque change of axis.|$|R
50|$|In {{straight}} <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> {{the teeth}} are straight and {{parallel to the}} generators of the cone. This is the simplest form of <b>bevel</b> <b>gear.</b> It resembles a spur gear, only conical rather than cylindrical. The gears in the floodgate picture are straight <b>bevel</b> <b>gears.</b> In straight <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> sets, when each tooth engages it impacts the corresponding tooth and simply curving the gear teeth can solve the problem.|$|R

5000|$|In 1814 the Boston Manufacturing Company of New England {{established}} a [...] "fully integrated" [...] mill on the Charles River at Waltham, Massachusetts. Despite {{the ban on}} exporting technology from the UK, one of its proprietors, Francis Cabot Lowell, had travelled to Manchester to study the mill system and memorised some of its details. In the same year, Paul Moody built the first successful power loom in the US. Moody used a system of overhead pulleys and leather belting, rather than <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing,</b> to power his machines. The group devised the Waltham System of working, which was duplicated at Lowell, Massachusetts and several other new cities throughout the state. Mill girls, some as young as ten, were paid less than men, but received a fixed wage for their 73-hour week. They lived in company-owned boarding houses, and attended churches supported by the companies.|$|E
5000|$|Eight Maybach VL-II [...] {{gasoline}} engines were mounted {{inside the}} hull. Each engine turned a two-bladed, 16 ft diameter, fixed pitch, wooden propeller via a driveshaft and <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> which allowed the propeller to swivel from the vertical plane to the horizontal. With the engines ability to reverse, this allowed thrust {{to be applied}} forward, aft, up or down. It appears from photographs that the four propellers on each side were contra-rotating, each one turning the opposite way to the one ahead of it. Thus {{it would appear that}} the designers were aware that running the propellers in the air disturbed by the one ahead was not ideal. While the external engine pods of other airships allowed the thrust lines to be staggered, placing all four engine rooms on each side of the ship along the lower keel resulted in the Akrons propellers all being in line. This was to prove problematical in service, inducing considerable vibration, especially noticeable in the emergency control position in the lower fin. By 1933, the Akron had two of her propellers replaced by more advanced, ground-adjustable, three-bladed, metal propellers. These promised a performance increase and were adopted as standard for the Macon.|$|E

Rotor diameter was to be 28 meters (92 ft), fuselage length 27.2 meters (89 feet 3 inches), and footprint length 49.5 meters (162 feet 3 inches). Its widely spaced landing gear would allow it to straddle heavy cargoes such as armored vehicles, and still carry twelve troops in its slender fuselage. Boeing also considered selling a commercial version, the [...] "Model 301". The helicopter was powered by three Allison XT701-700 turboshafts, each rated at 8,079 shp, which fed into a combining gearbox capable of absorbing 17,700 shp.

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> remains complex since tooth {{geometry}} {{and the resulting}} kinematic performance stem directly from the manufacturing process.

This paper describes the computer aided design (CAD) definition and manufacturing of spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> tooth surfaces.

5000|$|As the war progressed, {{aircraft}} designers demanded ever-increasing {{amounts of}} power. Inline engines {{were able to}} meet this demand by improving their upper rev limits, which meant more power. Improvements in valve timing, ignition systems, and lightweight materials made these higher revs possible, {{and by the end}} of the war the average engine had increased from 1,200 rpm to 2,000. The rotary was not able to do the same due to the drag of the rotating cylinders through the air. For instance, if an early-war model of 1,200 rpm increased its revs to only 1,400, the drag on the cylinders increased 36%, as air drag increases with the square of velocity. At lower rpm, drag could simply be ignored, but as the rev count rose, the rotary was putting more and more power into spinning the engine, with less remaining to provide useful thrust through the propeller.One clever attempt to rescue the design, in a similar manner to Redrup's British [...] "reactionless" [...] engine concept, was made by Siemens AG. The crankcase (with the propeller still fastened directly to the front of it) and cylinders spun counterclockwise at 900 rpm, as seen externally from a [...] "nose on" [...] viewpoint, while the crankshaft and other internal parts spun clockwise at the same speed, so the set was effectively running at 1800 rpm. This was achieved by the use of <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> at the rear of the crankcase, resulting in the eleven-cylindered Siemens-Halske Sh.III, with less drag and less net torque. Used on several late war types, notably the Siemens-Schuckert D.IV fighter, the new engine’s low running speed, coupled with large, coarse pitched propellers that sometimes had four blades (as the SSW D.IV used), gave types powered by it outstanding rates of climb, with some examples of the late production Sh.IIIa powerplant even said to be delivering as much as 240 hp.|$|E

40|$|Tests of a 167 Kilowatt (224 Horsepower) {{split torque}} face gearbox were {{performed}} by the Boeing Company in Mesa, Arizona, while working under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) split torque gearbox followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The split torque tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face gears. Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output face gear to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth root fillets provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper face gear from the lower face gear was measured between the two idlers. The POC split torque tests demonstrated that face gears can be applied effectively in split torque rotorcraft transmissions, yielding good potential for significant weight, cost and reliability improvements over existing equipment using spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing...</b>|$|E
