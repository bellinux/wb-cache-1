5|$|Once {{in front}} of Schumacher, Hill was able to {{gradually}} extend his lead to 3.4seconds by lap30 despite carrying a heavier fuel load for one fewer planned pit stop. However, he lost second gear {{during the course of}} that lap, and then spun off at turntwo on lap31, retiring from the race with a suspected gearbox seizure. On the same lap, Herbert also retired from the race after suffering damage in a collision with Suzuki, who himself had to make an unscheduled pit stop to replace his car's damaged nosecone. Schumacher thus assumed the lead as a result of Hill's retirement, leading by 11.5seconds from Coulthard. Salo was third in the remaining Tyrrell, 39.4seconds behind Coulthard. Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars completed the top sixpositions. Schumacher made his secondpit stop on lap37, exiting in second position behind Coulthard. Salo and Häkkinen, both performing much better than had been expected prior to the race, battled over thirdposition until lap39, when Salo, suffering from cramp and driving with one hand, spun at the final bend. He made a pit stop soon after for fresh tyres, dropping to eighthposition. Häkkinen, having moved up to third, made his secondstop on lap43, exiting behind the two Ferrari cars, Berger moving {{in front of}} Alesi as the latter made his stop on the following lap, rejoining in seventh. Coulthard made a pit stop from the lead on lap47, the gap between him and Schumacher not big enough to allow him to maintain the lead. Schumacher set the fastest lap of the race, 1:30.921, extending his lead {{to such an extent that}} when he made his own final stop on lap52, he maintained the lead. After his final stop, Schumacher gradually opened his leading margin 11seconds, winning the race after 71 laps in a time of 1:48:49.972s, with Coulthard finishing second in his Williams. The Ferrari cars of Berger – who made his final stop on lap49 without losing a place – and Alesi were third and fifth respectively, but off the pace as Schumacher lapped them both in the closing stages. Häkkinen, despite losing part of his rear wing after his car was struck by a bird, split them both to take fourth position. In the closing stages, Morbidelli and Blundell both overtook Salo, only for the Footwork driver to retire on lap62 with a blocked fuel line. Blundell, who had earlier changed his steering wheel and was driving without the use of third gear, thus took the final point in sixth place, ahead of Salo, Suzuki, Montermini – who completed the race distance despite struggling with a broken floor on his chassis, taking the Pacific team's first race finish – and Diniz. The race saw a high attrition rate; only ten out of the 25 starters finished the race. Of the other late retirements, Wendlinger suffered a broken <b>battery</b> <b>cable</b> on lap41, Roberto Moreno and Badoer retired on lap47 due to a spin and gearbox problem respectively, and Inoue's car caught fire on lap48. The Japanese driver was in any case due to receive the black flag for receiving an illegal push-start from the marshals following a spin on the circuit.|$|E

Any of these problems will result in some, but not enough, power being sent to the solenoid, which means that the solenoid will only begin to push the engagement gear, making the metallic click sound.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, it {{was aimed}} {{to get a}} proper image of the components, (<b>battery,</b> <b>cable,</b> firing mechanism, main charge etc.) of a 48 × 35 × 11 cm {{simulated}} improvised explosive device (IED) placed into a suitcase, using appropriate X-ray beam angle, distance and pulse. A- 600 portable X-ray imaging system (Vidisco Inc.) {{was used as the}} experiment equipment. The imaging relation among the ray-source, video camera unit (VCU) and control display unit (CDU) was studied by using geometric formations to avoid shooting mistakes. The optimum shooting distance, angle and pulse parameters for simulated suitcase IED were determined in a closed environment under normal conditions. With the determined parameters, X-ray images were taken from three main directions to obtain a 2 -dimension image of a 3 -dimension substance. With the shootings from these main directions, the images taken onto the VCU were determined as square, rectangular and hexagonal. The picture enhancement techniques were also determined to avoid the blurring, enlargement and penumbra shadow on the images taken. It was concluded that the proper images of simulated IED placed in a suitcase were taken with 150 cm distance, 99 pulse and 90 ° main and 45 °/ 135 ° supporting side angles...|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews two {{formulations}} of some structural aspects of knowledge systems. These two structural specifica-tions of knowledge systems, by Judith Willer and by Norwood Russell Hanson, are then combined {{to suggest a}} model for relating several "ideal type " knowledge systems. Some tentative descriptions of these knowledge systems are given. The paper concludes by suggesting that scientific systems involve a particular combination {{of two of the}} systems and that sociology of knowledge and cognitive psychology have clear roles in the theoretical development of such a model. We make 'sense ' out of the phenomenal world in a number of ways. These ways of ordering, structuring, and relating the world are here referred to as under-standings. What is taken as truth, correctness, or valid and worthwhile knowledge varies across different forms of understandings. A sing~e individual can simultaneously hold different understandings of the same subject matter. A physical scientist may have an abstract, theoretical understanding of the physical universe {{and at the same time}} operate within the physical world using a practical empirical form of understanding. What is a valid explanation of what "makes " his car go is different within each form of understanding. The theoretical form consists of various laws of mechanics, gases, and electrical activity. The event "car moving " disappears within the scope and generality of the explanation. The individual possessing this form of understand-ing could hardly use it to convey to another person the "reason " his car did not start on a particular occasion. Such a reason could however, be conveyed through the use of a shared practical form of empirical understanding. He might simply say that the <b>battery</b> <b>cable</b> was broken, and thus convey the "reason. " Understandings take objective form in knowledge systems.
