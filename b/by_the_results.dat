5|$|The {{starting}} {{order is}} {{the order in}} which the pilots will race in each flying session. The starting order for Training is defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the last year's Red Bull Air Race World Championship standings. The highest ranking pilot starts first. Starting order for new race pilots is determined by a draw. The starting order for Qualifying is defined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the fourth training session. The order is reversed so that the slowest pilot from the fourth training session starts first. The starting order for all sessions on Race Day is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> in Qualifying. The order is reversed so that the slowest pilot from Qualifying starts first.|$|E

5|$|Although Sondheim was {{cautious}} of a cinematic {{adaptation of}} his musical, he was largely impressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> The film received largely positive reviews, with Depp's performance receiving critical praise — the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 86% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 221 reviews, and Metacritic gave the film an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 39 reviews. Sweeney Todd appeared on many critics' top ten {{lists of the}} best films of 2007.|$|E
5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia in 1907—08, {{like that}} which toured South Africa, faced {{questions}} about its strength. Because {{at least four}} first-choice players chose not to tour, and another was not selected despite strong claims, the team was less representative than usual for an Ashes series. The tourists lost the Tests 4–1, although Wisden suggested that the series was more competitive than suggested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b>|$|E

5|$|This {{discrepancy}} is {{also caused}} by ties. In men's artistic gymnastics, a three-way tie {{for the gold}} medal in the horizontal bar meant that no silver and bronze medals were awarded; in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bars ties for first positions resulted in two golds per event, and thus no silvers were awarded; and a tie for silver in the individual all-around resulted in no bronze being awarded. In women's artistic gymnastics, ties for {{the gold medal in}} the uneven bars and floor meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. In athletics, a three-way tie in the men's high jump, and ties in the men's 3,000m steeplechase and the women's high jump for second place meant that no bronzes were awarded for those events. In men's bowling, a tie for second place in the singles and trios resulted in two silver medals per event, and thus no bronzes were awarded; a tie for the bronze-medal position in the doubles and the team of five meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. In softball, due to rainy weather at the final competition the ranking was decided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the preliminary round and semifinals. Japan was awarded the gold medal based on its unbeaten record in the preliminary games; China and Chinese Taipei shared the silver. Those two were to have played to decide who would meet Japan in the gold-medal game. In swimming, a tie for first position in the men's 50m freestyle resulted in two gold medals and no silver was awarded; a tie for second position in the women's 100m freestyle meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
