40|$|Indonesia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} number of {{fatalities}} caused by traffic accident. It is become main concern since last decades. Approximately of 10 % fatalities is caused by <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> accident, it recorded by PT. Pertamina Persero, Indonesia in 2015 that 17 % and 20 % <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> accident is caused by over speed and fatigue, respectively. Therefore, over speed has become main factor the occurrence of <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> accident. Main objective of this research is to install speed limiter on the <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> in order to improve safety engineering system, decrease accident and to maintain engine performance. This research is conducted in Indonesia especially in Java-Bali route travel. Speed limiter is installed to the <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> engine which completed by fuel cut-off solenoid to reduce the speed automatically when it exceeding the maximum speed that has been determined. From the result shows that top speed which performed by driver up to 133 km/h when <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> uninstalled by speed limiter. Meanwhile, when speed limiter is installed to the <b>tank</b> <b>truck,</b> top speed locked at 70 km/h even though the driver want to speed up. It means that fuel cut-off system is very effective to lock the speed at 70 km/h and it shown the improvement up to 65 %. The monitoring activities observed that the decreasing number of fatalities caused by <b>tank</b> <b>truck</b> accident become 7 % as compared to last year of 17 %. It can be found that the speed limiter coupled by speed recorder was very efficient to improve safety engineering system of the <b>tank</b> <b>truck...</b>|$|R

Given are a set of <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> with different characteristics {{and a set of}} drivers with different skills. The objective is to assign a feasible driver to every shift of the <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> such that legal and safety restrictions are satisfied, the total working times of the drivers are within desired intervals, requested vacation of the drivers is respected and the trucks are assigned to more favored drivers. We propose a two-phase solution algorithm which is based on a mixed integer linear programming formulation and an improvement procedure. Computational results are reported showing that the algorithm is able to generate feasible schedules in a small amount of time.

40|$|Abstract—A local {{municipality}} {{has decided}} to build a sewage pit to receive residential sewage waste arriving by <b>tank</b> <b>trucks.</b> Daily accumulated waste are to be pumped to a nearby waste water treatment facility to be re-consumed for agricultural and construction projects. A discrete-event simulation model using Arena Software was constructed to assist in defining {{the capacity of the}} system in cubic meters, number of <b>tank</b> <b>trucks</b> to use the system, number of unload docks required, number of standby areas needed and manpower required for data collection at entrance checkpoint and <b>truck</b> <b>tank</b> load toxicity testing.
