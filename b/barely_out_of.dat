5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
500|$|Goodman {{also took}} an early {{interest}} in church activities as a youth, {{participating in a}} boys' brotherhood group and Sunday school and becoming a member of Tioga Presbyterian Church at age 14, an event he described as [...] "the most important step I ever took or ever will take in my life." [...] Just <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his teens, Goodman became a popular and highly respected Sunday school teacher and led the Philadelphia chapter of a young men's group called the Brotherhood of Andrew and Philip.|$|E

2500|$|... 1632 {{occurs in}} the midst of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648). The plot {{situation}} allows pragmatic, American, union-oriented, political thought to grind against the authoritarian, religion-driven societies of an unconsolidated Holy Roman Empire <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Ages. Flint explores examples of suffering due to the petty politics of self-aggrandizement and self-interest on the one hand, and the irreconcilable differences of the schism in Christianity such as the Protestant Reformation and the Counter-Reformation on the other. Despite the fact that the shift puts Grantville in May 1631 initially, because of the ongoing war and the primitive transportation networks of the day Grantville's arrival has something of a delayed impact, so the bulk of the book's action takes place in 1632, hence the name.|$|E

60|$|She {{went down}} {{the steps of the}} piazza, and Mr. Tippengray, having {{apparently}} lost the power of making up his mind what he should do, did what she wanted him to do, and followed her. They did not walk very far, but stood <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hearing of the persons on the piazza; her eyes sparkling up into his face, as his helpful words took root in her understanding.|$|E
60|$|Andrew, {{with his}} gun over his shoulder, his rough tweed clothes splashed with black mud, gazed at her {{as though she were}} an apparition. Then he saw {{something}} in her face which told him so much that he forgot the little catboat, <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, he forgot the little red-roofed village barely a mile away, he forgot the lone figures of the shrimpers, standing like sentinels far away in the salt pools. He took Jeanne into his arms, and he felt her lips melt upon his.|$|E
60|$|He came {{at last to}} {{the great}} gates leading to the ruined castle, gates whose pillars were surmounted by huge griffins. He looked at the deserted lodges, the coat of arms, nothing of which {{remained}} but a few drooping fragments. He shook the iron gates, which still held together, in vain. Finally he drove the car through {{an opening in the}} straggling fence, and up the long, grass-grown avenue, until he reached the building itself. Here he descended, walked along the weed-framed flags to the arched front door, by the side of which hung the rusty and broken fragments of a bell, at which he pulled for some moments in vain. To all appearances the place was entirely deserted. No one answered his shout, or the wheezy summons of the cracked and feeble bell. He passed along the front, <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach of the spray which a strong west wind was bringing from seaward, looked in through deserted windows till he came at last to a great crack in the walls, through which he stepped into a ruined apartment. It was thus that he entered the home in which he had been born.|$|E

60|$|Therefore Edmund of Lancaster {{desired to}} adopt Hamlyn de Valence {{as his own}} squire, to save him from {{association}} with Richard; and both prince and squire, {{and all the rest}} of the train, made it perfectly evident to the young Montfort that he was <b>barely</b> tolerated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> respect for the Prince.|$|R
60|$|The {{tragedy of}} the story, its sombre tone, the {{overhanging}} presence of death in it, are prevented from being oppressive {{to us by the}} variety of minor situation and subordinate character with which the writer has surrounded the central figures. No writer living is so consummate a master of landscape, and besides the forest we here have an elaborate sea-piece, full of the weird, ineffable, menacing suggestion of the sea in some of her unnumbered moods; and there is a scene of late twilight on a high solitary down over the bay of Mont Saint-Michel, to which a reader blessed with sensibility to the subtler impressions of landscape will turn again and again, as one visits again and again some actual prospect where the eye procures for the inner sense a dream of beauty and the incommensurable. Perhaps the palm for exquisite workmanship will be popularly given, and justly given, to the episode humorously headed The Massacre of Saint Bartholomew, {{at the opening of the}} third volume. It is the story of three little children, <b>barely</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> infancy, awaking, playing, eating, wondering, slumbering, in solitude through a summer day in an old tower. As a rule the attempt to make infancy interesting in literature ends in maudlin failure. But at length the painters have found an equal, or more than an equal, in an artist whose medium lends itself less easily than colour and form to the reproduction of the beauty and life of childhood. In his poetry Victor Hugo had already shown his passing sensibility to the pathos of the beginnings of our life; witness such pieces as Chose vue un Jour de Printemps, Les Pauvres Gens, the well-known pieces in L'Année Terrible, and a hundred other lively touches and fragments of finished loveliness and penetrating sympathy. In prose it is a more difficult feat to collect the trivial details which make up the life of the tiny human animal into a whole that shall be impressive, finished, and beautiful. And prose can only describe by details enumerated one by one. This most arduous feat is accomplished in the children's summer day in the tower, and with enchanting success. Intensely realistic, yet the picture overflows with emotion--not the emotion of the mother, but of the poet. There is infinite tenderness, pathos, love, but all heightened at once and strengthened by the self-control of masculine force. A man writing about little ones seems able to place himself outside, and thus to gain more calmness and freedom of vision than the more passionate interest or yearning of women permits to them in this field of art. Not a detail is spared, yet the whole is full of delight and pity and humour. Only one lyric passage is allowed to poetise and accentuate the realism of the description. Georgette, some twenty months old, scrambles from her cradle and prattles to the sunbeam.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{aerodynamic}} {{effects in the}} duct within which the propellers rotated, the platform was dynamically stable, even though the pilot and center of gravity of the platform were fairly high up. In testing, the prototypes flew well, but the U.S. Army judged them to be impractical as combat vehicles as they were small, limited in speed and only <b>barely</b> flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ground cushion effect.|$|R
