Following this, the rats were treated topically with Temovate (corticosteroid) for an additional 15 days. At the end of the treatment period, superficial abrasion wounds were induced in the treated skin. Abrasion wounds healed more slowly in the skin of Temovate-treated rats than in skin of control animals. Healing was more rapid in skin of rats that had been pretreated with either curcumin or ginger extract alone or with the combination of curcumin–ginger extract (along with Temovate) than in the skin of rats treated with Temovate and vehicle alone. Skin samples were obtained at the time of wound closure. Collagen production was increased and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 production was decreased in the recently healed skin from rats treated with the <b>botanical</b> <b>preparation</b> relative to rats treated with Temovate plus vehicle. In none of the rats was there any indication of skin irritation during the treatment phase or during wounding and repair.

40|$|Background: PC-SPES is a <b>botanical</b> <b>preparation</b> {{shown to}} have {{efficacy}} in patients with androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate carcinoma. Several herbal constituents in PC-SPES inhibit tumor growth through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, although the mechanisms of these activities are poorly defined. We sought to identify PC-SPES-induced changes in gene expression, specifically in those genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins that could be as-sociated with PC-SPES-induced cytoxicity. Methods: LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells were treated with PC-SPES, and changes in gene expression were determined by complemen-tary DNA (cDNA) microarray hybridization and northern blot analyses. PC-SPES and paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, effects on microtubules were assessed by immunofluorescence of treated cells and by in vitro tubulin polymerization assays. In vivo effects of PC-SPES and pacli-taxel were assessed using CWR 22 R androgen-independent prostate cancer xenografts. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: PC-SPES treatment of LNCaP cells for 24 hours altered the expression of 17 cytoskeletal genes. mRNA levels of -tubulin decreased sevenfold. Although paclitaxel stabilized and PC-SPES treatment disrupted microtubule architecture in LNCaP cells, the combination of both agents had an intermediate effect.

40|$|At present {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} for use of botanicals and botanical ingredients in medicines, for teas or in foods and in food supplements.

Currently, {{there is a}}n increasing awareness among safety experts and regulators of risks {{associated with the use of}} botanicals and botanical ingredients in food including food supplements. It is becoming clear that ¿natural¿ does not equal ¿safe¿ and that, in modern society, adverse health effects can occur as a result of (mis) use. With the growing awareness of these issues efforts to ensure safety of botanicals and botanical ingredients are also increasing. Several guidance documents on safety assessment of <b>botanicals</b> and <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> to be used as ingredients in food and food supplements have been published, although, at present, relevant legislative frameworks and guidances for risk assessment are not established yet. Furthermore, when defining possible guidance documents for risk assessment of botanicals, several issues emerge that need to be developed beyond the present state-of-the-art.

EFSA has been re-evaluating all feed additives currently on the market, authorised under the previous regulatory framework such that they are harmonised with the current regulation. As part of this work, EFSA issued a tender to procure support for this re-evaluation process as there was a need to consider the completeness of data submissions related to substance identity and description, physico-chemical properties, purity and manufacturing processes.

40|$|<b>Botanicals</b> and <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> {{have become}} widely {{available}} {{on the market in}} the form of food supplements and other food preparations. In Europe the safety of botanicals and derived food products placed on the market has to comply with the general requirements set out in  regulation (EC) No 178 / 2002. In spite of this regulation, the risks of <b>botanicals</b> and <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> are generally not assessed before they enter the market. The present thesis aimed to perform a risk assessment of some selected <b>botanicals</b> and derived <b>preparations</b> focusing on samples containing the so-called alkenylbenzenes, including myristicin, apiol, safrole, methyleugenol, elemicin, and estragole.   Samples containing alkenylbenzenes may be of concern because these compounds may be genotoxic and carcinogenic displaying similar characteristics regarding mode of action (MOA) and tumor formation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop a MOA based approach for read-across in risk assessment from safrole, for which in vivo toxicity studies are available to myristicin and apiol for which tumor data are not reported, thus contributing to alternatives in animal testing. This was done using physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling. <b>Botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> included in the risk assessments performed in the present thesis were basil-containing pesto and nutmeg-based plant food supplements (PFS). Given that several of the preparations analyzed contained several alkenylbenzenes a risk assessment of combined exposure to these alkenylbenzenes was included as well, to give a better understanding of when risk management actions would be needed for <b>botanicals</b> and derived <b>preparations</b> containing these ingredients. The introduction chapter starts with a short background and definition of the aim of the thesis, followed by a description of the physicochemical properties, natural occurrence and estimated daily intake (EDI) of the alkenylbenzenes, as well as of their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) characteristics, carcinogenicity and MOA, the relevant risk assessment approach, and finally PBK modelling. Chapter 2 and 3 of the thesis describe the development of PBK models for myristicin and apiol in male rat and human, enabling the prediction of dose-dependent effects in bioactivation and detoxification of these alkenylbenzenes. This allows comparison of the PBK model-based prediction of bioactivation of myristicin or apiol to the PBK model-based predictions for bioactivation of the structurally related compound safrole, enabling estimation of a BMDL 10 for myristicin and apiol from read-across to the BMDL 10 available for safrole, thereby facilitating risk assessment of current dietary exposure to myristicin or apiol. The results from PBK analysis support that risk assessment of myristicin may be based on the BMDL 10 derived for safrole, and that risk assessment of apiol may be performed using a BMDL 10 value of 3 times the BMDL 10 for safrole. These results enabled a preliminary risk assessment of current exposure to these alkenylbenzenes showing that the current exposure to myristicin results in MOE values indicating a priority for risk management (Chapter 2), while current exposure to apiol does not raise a concern (Chapter 3). The results obtained illustrate that PBK modeling can facilitate a read-across in risk assessment from a compound for which in vivo toxicity studies are available to a related compound for which tumor data are not reported, thus contributing to alternatives in animal testing. Subsequently, in Chapter 4 the BMDL 10 values obtained were used to perform a risk assessment  for alkenylbenzenes in basil-based pesto sauce. To this end the levels of methyleugenol and other alkenylbenzenes in basil-containing sauce of pesto were quantified enabling an associated risk assessment based on the MOE approach, taking into consideration the possible combined exposure to different alkenylbenzenes and the BMDL 10 values as defined in literature and in chapter 2 and 3 of the thesis. The MOE values obtained generally indicated a priority for risk management when assuming daily consumption of basil-based pesto sauce. It was concluded that consumption of pesto sauces would be of concern if consumed on a daily basis over longer periods of time. Chapter 5 evaluates the risk of exposure to myristicin and related alkenylbenzenes through human exposure to nutmeg-based PFS based on the MOE approach. Chemical analysis of various PFS samples was performed and the amount of alkenylbenzenes that would be consumed through consumption of these nutmeg-based PFS where quantified. MOE values where calculated for the individual alkenylbenzenes as well as taking into account the presence of more than one alkenylbenzenes within selected PFS samples. It was concluded that the results reveal that daily nutmeg-based PFS consumption following recommendations for daily intake for especially longer periods of time would raise a concern. Chapter 6 summarizes the results obtained in the thesis, compiles the overall discussion and presents the future perspectives that follow from the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Key words Annona – {{mosquitoes}} – neem – plant extracts – Pongamia – {{synergistic effect}} While most people consider mosquitoes as an annoy-ance, these tiny assassins {{have the potential}} and lethal capacity to kill {{more than a million}} victims a year around the world 1. Mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, filariasis, dengue, yellow fever and encephali-tis are continuing to be major health problems for the people 2. Malaria alone kills three million people an-nually, including one child every 30 sec 3, 4. V tor control technologies such as ‘source reduction’, ap-plication of oils and <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> were em-phasised {{in the second quarter of}} the last century 5. But with the advent of DDT towards the end of the second quarter, an unprecedented flurry ensued for finding synthetic compounds. These compounds were very active against mosquito larvae but were highly toxic to non-targeted organisms. Pesticide exposure among humans has been linked to immune dysfunc-tion, various forms of cancer and birth defects 6, 7. It is, therefore, necessary to identify a safe, eco-friendly alternate source of larvicide in order to reduce mos-quito menace. Over two thousand species of plants are known to possess insecticidal activity 8. Some of the plants that have been tested against mosquito larvae in India ar...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{evidence}} on the safety of topical <b>preparations</b> containing <b>botanical</b> extracts is limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess (i) the use of botanically derived compounds in a large population, (ii) the incidence of cutaneous side-effects, and (iii) the diagnostic usefulness of patch testing. METHODS: A questionnaire was used in 2661 patients to assess both the prevalence and type of topical <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> used, and the occurrence of adverse skin reactions. Patients declaring adverse reactions were patch tested with (i) the Italian (SIDAPA) baseline series, (ii) an additional botanical series, and (iii) the patients' own products. RESULTS: Of the patients, 1274 (48 %) reported the use of topical botanical products; 139 patients (11 %) commented on adverse cutaneous reactions; 75 (54 %) showed positive reactions with the Italian baseline series. Among the 122 patients tested with the botanical series, 19 (16 %) showed positive reactions, in many cases with concomitant relevant positivity {{to at least one}} allergen of the Italian series connected with cosmetics. The commonest botanically derived allergens were propolis, Compositae extracts, and Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil. CONCLUSIONS: Contact allergy is a possible adverse effect of natural products. Baseline series supplemented with the commonest botanical allergens may be adequate for detecting most of the cases of contact allergy to natural topical products...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{authentication}} {{is constantly}} {{necessary to prevent}} the adulteration of target plant with other plant species. For the standardization of <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> chromatographic techniques (HPLC, TLC, HPTLC, UV spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, gas chromatography, infrared and NMR spectroscopy) have limitations because the compositions and relative amount of chemicals in a species varies with growing conditions, harvesting periods, post-harvest processes and storage conditions. This can be misleading if the samples are deliberately adulterated with a marker compound. Also, {{it is difficult to}} distinguish closely related species due to similar chemical compounds. Ordinary chemical authentication was not reliable enough to produce easy-to-interpret results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more effective, accurate, reliable and sensitive technology for the authentication of herbs. In recent years DNA manipulation techniques have been adapted for the authentication of herbs which comprise of the molecular markers, sequencing of specific genes, and sophisticated hybridization setups such as DNA microarrays. DNA-based molecular markers have acted as resourceful tools in various fields like taxonomy, physiology, embryology, plant breeding, ecology, genetic engineering etc. The innovation of polymerase chain reaction was a milestone in the development of DNA markers. This facilitated the development of marker based gene tags, cloning of agronomically important genes, variability studies, phylogenetic analysis, selection of wanted genotypes, etc. Thus DNA markers offer severa...|$|R
40|$|<b>Botanicals</b> and <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations,</b> {{including}} {{plant food}} supplements (PFS), {{are widely used}} in Western diets. The growing use of PFS is accompanied by an increasing concern because the safety of these PFS is not generally assessed before they enter the market. Regulatory bodies have {{become more aware of}} this and are increasing their efforts {{to ensure the safety of}} PFS. The present review describes an overview of the general framework for the safety assessment of PFS, focusing on the different approaches currently in use to assess the safety of botanicals and/or botanical compounds, including their history of safe use, the tiered approach proposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) and the Margin of Exposure (MOE) concept. Moreover, some examples of botanical compounds in PFS that may be of concern are discussed. Altogether, it is clear that “natural” does not equal “safe” and that PFS may contain compounds of concern at levels far above those found in the regular diet. In addition, the traditional use of a PFS compound as a herb or tea does not guarantee its safety when used as a supplement. This points at a need for stricter regulation and control of botanical containing products, especially given their expanding market volum...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{existing}} {{evidence and}} inform family physicians about issues concerning herbal product use in Canada. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: The Canadian Food and Drug Act and findings of an Expert Advisory Committee on Herbs and <b>Botanical</b> <b>Preparations</b> were consulted {{to provide an}} overview of the issues regarding herbal product regulation in Canada. Case reports of herbal toxicity were identified to illustrate some of the hazards of herbal products, and references provided to guide health professional in searching the literature for clinical trials that evaluate these drugs' efficacy. MAIN FINDINGS: Herbal products not registered as drugs in Canada are sold as foods and are exempt from the drug review process that evaluates product efficacy and safety. This places the public at risk of unwanted effects from the use of herbal products that are adulterated with other substances and of forgoing effective conventional therapy. Moreover, consumers are exposed to a plethora of information portraying herbal products as harmless. Some progress has been made to address these concerns by facilitating the registration of herbal products as drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Most herbal products that were evaluated were unsafe or ineffective, or no information was available to evaluate their efficacy. Despite the perception that herbal products are innocuous, family physicians need to be aware that herbal therapy can be harmful in order to help their patients make informed choices...|$|R
40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) are plant metabolites {{present in}} some <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations,</b> with especially 1, 2 -unsaturated PAs being of concern {{because they are}} genotoxic carcinogens. This study presents an overview of tumour data on PAs and points of departure (PODs) derived from them, corroborating that the BMDL 10 for lasiocarpine represents a conservative POD for risk assessment. A risk assessment using this BMDL 10 and mean levels of PAs reported in literature for (herbal) teas, indicates that consumption of one cup of tea a day would result in MOE values lower than 10 000 for several types of (herbal) teas, indicating a priority for risk management for these products A refined risk assessment using interim relative potency (REP) factors showed that based on the mean PA levels, 7 (54 %) of 13 types of (herbal) teas and 1 (14 %) of 7 types of plant food supplements (PFS) resulted in MOE values lower than 10 000, indicating a priority for risk management also for these products in particular. This includes both preparations containing PA-producing and non-PA-producing plants. Our study provides insight in the current state-of-the art and limitations in the risk assessment of PA-containing food products, especially (herbal) teas and PFS, indicating that PAs in food presents a field of interest for current and future risk management. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although topical {{remedies}} and cosmetics {{based on}} herbal ingredients {{are becoming increasingly}} popular with the public due to the perception that botanical compounds are safer and healthier than their synthetic counterparts, {{a large number of}} adverse cutaneous effects of plant extracts, notably contact sensitization, have been reported in medical literature. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of herbal compound usage in a dermatological out-patient population and to estimate the incidence of consequent cutaneous side effects. Methods: 400 patients were subjected to a self-administered 15 -item questionnaire to assess both prevalence and type of topical <b>botanical</b> <b>preparations</b> used and occurrence of skin adverse reactions. Results: 241 patients (60. 25 %) reported use of natural topical products, predominantly aloe, marigold, chamomile, propolis and arnica. Females used herbal products, for both medicinal and cosmetic purposes, more frequently than males. 15 patients (6. 22 %) referred one or more adverse cutaneous reactions. Conclusion: Herbal preparations were widely used in the examined population, but, despite the common belief in the innocuous nature of botanical extracts, the incidence of side effects referred by the patients confirms that they should be regarded as a potential source of adverse skin events. The lack of adequate patch testing in case of suspected contact allergic dermatitis, incomplete or misleading product labelling, and the risk of chemical adulteration may represent further concerns as regards application of botanical products...|$|R
