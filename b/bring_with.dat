5|$|Botanical gardens {{must find}} a {{compromise}} between the need for peace and seclusion, {{while at the same}} time satisfying the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants, information centres and sales areas that <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> them rubbish, noise, and hyperactivity. Attractive landscaping and planting design sometimes compete with scientific interestsâ€” with science now often taking second place. Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1913, The New York Times {{reported}} that Hogan left Zanesville {{to manage a}} Fond du Lac franchise in the Illinois-Wisconsin League. According to the article, he planned to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> him five players from the defunct Zanesville club. Reliable information on the Fond du Lac Molls' overall performance is currently unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Sir John's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, invites her {{daughter}} and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, to visit. They <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> them the impoverished Lucy Steele. Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years, dashing Elinor's hopes of a future with him. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He greets Marianne uncomfortably and barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they soon learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne becomes inconsolable.|$|E

5|$|An unnamed narrator, while gazing {{upon his}} pet cat, begins to reminisce about {{a law in}} the town of Ulthar which forbids the killing of cats and relates the story of how this law came to be. The tale begins with the {{introduction}} of an old cotter and his wife who delight in trapping and violently killing any cats who venture onto their property. The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter's house. One night a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> them an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a small, black kitten to keep him company. After being unable to find his kitten on the third day of his stay, Menes hears the stories of the old cotter and his wife, and decides to take action.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
5|$|Having been proclaimed emperor {{solely on}} the {{initiative}} of the Senate, Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace. As was custom by this time, a change of emperor was expected to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> it a generous payment of gifts and money {{to the people and}} the army. Accordingly, a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens, while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person. This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, {{revealing}} a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.|$|E
5|$|The rebel barons {{responded by}} {{inviting}} the French prince Louis to lead them: Louis had {{a claim to}} the English throne {{by virtue of his}} marriage to Blanche of Castile, a granddaughter of Henry II. Philip may have provided him with private support but refused to openly support Louis, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John. Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> him naval vessels and siege engines essential to the rebel cause. Once John contained Alexander in Scotland, he marched south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion.|$|E
5|$|Chagall also invited other Russian artists, {{most notably}} the painter and art {{theoretician}} Kazimir Malevich and Lissitzky's former teacher, Yehuda Pen. However, {{it was not until}} October 1919 when Lissitzky, then on an errand in Moscow, persuaded Malevich to relocate to Vitebsk. The move coincided {{with the opening of the}} first art exhibition in Vitebsk directed by Chagall. Malevich would <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> him a wealth of new ideas, most of which inspired Lissitzky but clashed with local public and professionals who favored figurative art and with Chagall himself. After going through impressionism, primitivism, and cubism, Malevich began developing and advocating his ideas on suprematism aggressively. In development since 1915, suprematism rejected the imitation of natural shapes and focused more on the creation of distinct, geometric forms. He replaced the classic teaching program with his own and disseminated his suprematist theories and techniques school-wide. Chagall advocated more classical ideals and Lissitzky, still loyal to Chagall, became torn between two opposing artistic paths. Lissitzky ultimately favoured Malevich's suprematism and broke away from traditional Jewish art. Chagall left the school shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|In another story, Saint Lucy {{was working}} to help Christians {{hiding in the}} catacombs during the terror under the Roman Emperor Diocletian, {{and in order to}} <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> her as many {{supplies}} as possible, she needed to have both hands free. She solved this problem by attaching candles to a wreath on her head.|$|E
25|$|Officials in Canada began {{requiring}} that each prospector entering Canada {{on the north}} side of the White Pass <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> him one ton (909kg) of supplies, to ensure that he did not starve during the winter. This placed a large burden on the prospectors and the pack animals climbing the steep pass.|$|E
25|$|Voters are {{encouraged}} to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> them the EasyVote card sent to them before each election, which specifies the voter's name, address, and position on the electoral roll (e.g. Christchurch East 338/23 means the voter is listed in the Christchurch East electorate roll, on line 23 of page 338). However, this is not required, voters may simply state their name and address to the official.|$|E

He developed a reputation for bravery and determination in his fight with the Dutch in the Far East.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010s {{there has}} been {{discussion}} of merging the Baltimore Schools Police into the department as well. It has not been decided if those officers would have to reapply for positions within the Baltimore Police Department nor what, if any, job benefits such as seniority and pension, {{they might be able}} to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> them into the new position.|$|E
25|$|In 1823, after {{experiencing}} many {{troubles with}} his cotton plantation, Birney moved to Huntsville, Alabama {{to practice law}} again. His financial troubles were {{due in part to}} his habit of horse race gambling, which he gave up eventually after many losses. Most of his slaves stayed on at the plantation, though he did <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> him to Huntsville his servant Michael, as well as Michael's wife and three children.|$|E

25|$|In early 2002 the USAF began {{negotiations}} with Boeing on the lease of tankers {{based on the}} Boeing 767 after it considered the Airbus A330-based tanker, the KC-330 to be more costly and a higher technical risk. The USAF said that {{an assessment of the}} two types shows that the EADS offering presents a higher-risk technical approach and less preferred financial arrangement it also said that the larger KC-330 does not <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> it a commensurate increase in available air-refuelling offload.|$|E
25|$|As for the armies, each of {{the local}} chieftains could call upon a militia which often {{accompanied}} them on their journeys around the kingdom. The bulk of the Kandyan army consisted of local peasant conscripts â€“ irregulars pressed into service {{in times of war}} â€“ who tended to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> them around twenty days' worth of supplies and functioned in discrete units often out of contact with each other. One {{of the reasons for the}} Kandyan's inability to hold the land they captured was poor logistical support, as many soldiers had to return to base to replenish their supplies once they ran out.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} that this problem of AIDS cannot be {{overcome}} merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, {{that is to say}} a spiritual and human renewal that would <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E
