50|$|The <b>black-spotted</b> <b>bare-eye</b> (Phlegopsis nigromaculata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|E
50|$|Studies with plants, {{butterflies}} and birds classify this biological reserve {{as one of}} the 12 pleistocenic refuges in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest.It has lost more than half of its forest due to logging since its creation.Protected species are Kaapori capuchin (Cebus kaapori), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguar (Panthera onca), bare-faced curassow (Crax fasciolata), Amazonian barred woodcreeper (Dendrocolaptes certhia), <b>black-spotted</b> <b>bare-eye</b> (Phlegopsis nigromaculata), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus), dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis) and pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida).|$|E
40|$|We {{obtained}} 1403 base {{pairs of}} mtDNA sequences of cyt b and ND 2 from four specimens of the Pale-faced Bareeye (Skutchia borbae, representing a monotypic genus of the Thamnophilidae) and evaluated {{for the first}} time the species' phylogenetic position among core obligate army-ant-following antbirds. All trees placed Skutchia borbae consistently and with high statistical support as sister to the <b>Black-spotted</b> <b>Bare-eye</b> (Phlegopsis nigromaculata) in a clade with the two known species of Phlegopsis. This result supports the return of S. borbae to the genus Phlegopsis, where it was originally placed. When the plumage characters originally used to diagnose Skutchia are mapped onto the phylogeny, it is evident that they have evolved convergently multiple times in core obligate army-ant-following antbirds. This discovery further supports merging Skutchia with Phlegopsis...|$|E
