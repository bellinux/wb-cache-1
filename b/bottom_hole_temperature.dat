Different studies carried out by geologists have suggested possible geothermal resources in the northwest and southeast region.

40|$|The Hawaii Scientific Observation Hole (SOH) {{program was}} planned, funded, and {{initiated}} in 1988 by the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, an institute within the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Initial {{funding for the}} SOH program was $ 3. 25 million supplied by the State of Hawaii to drill six, 4, 000 foot scientific observation holes on Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii to confirm and stimulate geothermal resource development in Hawaii. After a lengthy permitting process, three SOHs, totaling 18, 890 feet of mostly core drilling were finally drilled along the Kilauea East Rift Zone (KERZ) in the Puna district on the Big Island. The SOH program was highly successful in meeting the highly restrictive permitting conditions imposed on the program, and in developing slim hole drilling techniques, establishing subsurface geological conditions, and initiating an assessment and characterization of the geothermal resources potential of Hawaii - even though permitting specifically prohibited pumping or flowing the holes to obtain data of subsurface fluid conditions.

40|$|Summary. As an {{alternative}} to finite element or finite difference modelling, analytical solutions are derived by the method of Laplace transformation and numerical results obtained for several models of the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>temperature</b> stabilization. Included in the models are the finite circulation time, the thermal property contrast between the borehole mud and the surrounding formation, {{and the presence of}} radial or lateral fluid flow in the formation, all of which are found to have significant effects on the dissipation of the thermal disturbance induced by drilling. The mud circulation is considered to have the effect of either maintaining the borehole mud a t a constant temperature or supplying a constant amount of heat per unit length per unit time to the borehole. For small circulation times, the former reduces to the ‘zero circulation ’ model in which the mud circulation creates an instantaneous temperature anomaly at the hole bottom; for small borehole radii, the latter reduces to the line source model and the traditional ‘Horner plot’. For typical drilling operations in which the bottom hole temperatures are measured several hours to several tens of hours after the hole is shut in, the new models generally predict higher equilibrium formation temperatures than does the Horner plot. However, predictions from the various models converge if the BHTs are taken after the hole has been shut in for a period which is greater than about five times the circulation period.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the thermal state of the Cenozoic Roer Valley Graben, the north-western branch of the European Cenozoic Rift System, based on a new set of temperature data. We developed a numerical technique for correcting <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>temperatures,</b> including an evaluation of the uncertainty of thermal parameters. Comparison with drill stem test temperatures indicated that the uncertainty in corrected <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> <b>temperatures</b> using a two-component numerical model is approximately ± 4 °C, which is much more accurate than the up to 15 °C errors encountered in often-used line-source or Horner correction methods. The subsurface temperatures and the derived regional heat flow estimates of 53 ± 6 to 63 ± 6 mWm- 2 show {{no significant difference between the}} central rift and the adjacent structural highs. The absence of an elevated heat flow is attributed to the low amount of lithospheric thinning during the Cenozoic rifting phase (β= 1. 06 - 1. 15). A local thermal anomaly exceeding + 10 °C was found in five wells in the north-western part of the rift basin at depths of 1000 - 1500 m, and is most likely caused by the upward flow of fluids along faults, whereas lower temperatures in the upper 1500 m in the southern part of the rift basin could indicate cooling by topography-driven groundwater flow. Conflicting ideas exist on the active or passive rifting mechanisms responsible for the formation of the different rift basins of European Cenozoic Rift System. The low spatial variation in heat flow found in this study suggests that the mechanism responsible for forming the Roer Valley Graben is passive rifting. © 2010 The Authors.
