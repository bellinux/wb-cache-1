50|$|There are {{typically}} 50 million bacterial cells in {{a gram of}} soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. In a much-cited study from 1998 the world bacterial biomass was calculated to be 350 to 550 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of carbon, equal to between 60% and 100% of the carbon in plants. More recent studies of seafloor microbes have cast considerable doubt on that, one study in 2012 reduced the calculated microbial biomass on the seafloor from the original 303 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C to just 4.1 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C, reducing the global biomass of prokaryotes to 50 to 250 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C. Further, if the average per cell biomass of prokaryotes is reduced from 86 to 14 femtograms C then the global biomass of prokaryotes is reduced to 13 to 44.5 <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> tonnes of C, equal to between 2.4% and 8.1% of the carbon in plants.|$|R

KKR contributed $1.7 <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a restructuring of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders.

The predictions by opponents did not occur mainly because Comcast ended up leasing 89 percent of the building and the offices for the Comcast Center's second largest tenant, Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, were new to the city.|$|E
