5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> disappears.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays {{the festival}} is still held, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> bypass <b>the</b> visit to the haw and are taken {{directly}} to the temple.|$|R

5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E
25|$|Although scoring {{is one of}} {{the main}} stylistic indicators, some pieces do without. For these, the form is {{technically}} similar to the orientalizing style, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> repertoire no longer reflects orientalizing practice.|$|E
25|$|John Singleton Copley's {{painting}} of the Battle of Jersey (6 January 1781), The Death of Major Pierson, became a national icon.

25|$|A third theory puts all saucer {{sightings}} {{down to a}} form of mass hysteria. Arnold {{described the}} craft he saw as saucer-like but not perfectly round (he described them as thin, flat, rounded in front but chopped in back and coming to a point), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the circular saucer was fixed in the public consciousness. The theory posits that as {{the use of the term}} flying saucer in popular culture decreased, so too did sightings.|$|E
25|$|During the Mission Management Team briefing, LeRoy Cain {{noted that}} upon initial {{review of the}} ascent imagery, {{a small piece of}} thermal blanket {{appeared}} to come loose under the left Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pod, but explained that the area is not in an area of concern, as it does not experience high heat during reentry. During the Mission Status briefing, lead Flight Director Mike Sarafin said that after having the crew focus the camera on the left OMS pod, it did not appear that there was any damage, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> analysis team would {{take a closer look at}} the area.|$|E
25|$|Between 1878 and 1884, Muybridge perfected {{his method}} of horses in motion, proving {{that they do}} have all four hooves off the ground during their running stride. In 1872, Muybridge settled Stanford's {{question}} with a single photographic negative showing his Standardbred trotting horse named Occident, airborne at the trot. This negative was lost, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> survives through woodcuts made at the time (the technology for printed reproductions of photographs was still being developed). He later did additional studies, as well as improving his camera for quicker shutter speed and faster film emulsions. By 1878, spurred on by Stanford to expand the experiments, Muybridge had successfully photographed a horse at a trot; lantern slides have survived of this later work. Scientific American was among the publications at the time that carried reports of Muybridge's ground-breaking images.|$|E

50|$|The {{triangulation}} of a parametrically defined {{surface is}} an easy task. You just triangulate the area of definition (see second picture). <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of these triangles in object space may vary in shape and extension, which may be a drawback. This drawback can be minimized by adaptive methods, which use 3D-informations (step width) while triangulating the parameter area.|$|R

500|$|Cheryl L. Nixon {{suggested}} in Jane Austen in Hollywood that Darcy's dive is a [...] "revelation of his emotional capabilities", expressing a [...] "Romantic bond with nature, {{a celebration of}} his home where he can 'strip down' to his essential self, a cleansing of social prejudices from his mind, or...a rebirth of his love for Elizabeth". Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield wrote that the scene [...] "tells us more about our current decade's obsession with physical perfection and acceptance of gratuitous nudity than it does about Austen's Darcy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> carves a new facet into the text".|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Dorothy Baker {{borrowed}} {{the titles of}} her friend Otis Ferguson's two articles and published the novel Young Man with a Horn. Her story of the doomed trumpet player Rick Martin was inspired, she wrote, by [...] "the music, but not the life" [...] of Beiderbecke, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of Martin quickly became the image of Beiderbecke: His story is about [...] "the gap between the man's musical ability {{and his ability to}} fit it to his own life." [...] In 1950, Michael Curtiz directed the film Young Man with a Horn, starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, and Doris Day. In this version, in which Hoagy Carmichael also plays a role, the Rick Martin character lives.|$|E

And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way.

In mid-2007, concurrent to {{the preparation of the}} radio release of [...] "Stranger", Duff was featured on the July covers of the magazines Us Weekly and Shape in a bikini, and on the August cover of Maxim accompanied by the declaration that she had gone [...] "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that Duff's more provocative image would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the album, reports arose that DC Comics had issued a cease and desist letter to Asthmatic Kitty because of the {{depiction}} of Superman on the cover. However, on October 4, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty announced that there had been no cease and desist letter; the record company's own lawyers had warned about the copyright infringement. On June 30, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty's distributor Secretly Canadian asked its retailers not to sell the album; however, it was not recalled. On July 5, the distributor told its retailers to go ahead and sell their copies, as DC Comics agreed to allow Asthmatic Kitty to sell the copies of the album that were already manufactured, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> was removed from subsequent pressings. Soon after it was made public that the cover would be changed, copies of the album featuring Superman were sold for as high as $75 on eBay. On the vinyl edition released on November 22, 2005, Superman's image is covered by a balloon sticker. The image of the balloon sticker was also used {{on the cover of the}} Compact Disc and later printings of the double vinyl release.
