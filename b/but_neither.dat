5|$|In early 1855, the {{government}} of Lord Aberdeen, who had replaced Derby, fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of British troops in the Crimean War. Victoria approached both Derby and Russell to form a ministry, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> had sufficient support, and Victoria was forced to appoint Palmerston as prime minister.|$|E
5|$|No {{constituents}} of the body—in the brain or elsewhere—transform into mental states and processes. Such subjective experiences do not {{emerge from the}} body, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> do they emerge from nothing. Rather, all objective mental appearances arise from the substrate, and all subjective mental states and processes arise from the substrate consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Anna glanced {{momentarily}} {{towards her}} sister, <b>but</b> Annabel <b>neither</b> spoke nor moved.|$|R
60|$|The captain stood, indeed; <b>but</b> he <b>neither</b> winced nor {{drew back}} a foot.|$|R
5000|$|The forgetful functor Top → Set lifts {{limits and}} colimits uniquely <b>but</b> creates <b>neither.</b>|$|R
5|$|Other storms were {{individually}} unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category5 intensity, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto had {{no effect}} on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude.|$|E
5|$|Stravinsky {{had already}} used twelve-tone {{technique}} {{earlier in the}} 1950s, both in Canticum Sacrum (1955) and in Agon (1957). <b>But</b> <b>neither</b> of these is exclusively dodecaphonic, whereas Threni is.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{six months}} brought no new {{encounters}} with U-boats. She scouted areas where submarines {{had been reported}} <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> sighted nor engaged the enemy. On one occasion, she collided with a merchantman, , and had to enter the drydock at Spencer Jetty that same day, 24 November 1917, for repairs.|$|E

60|$|It {{is not in}} my especial province; <b>But</b> I <b>neither</b> seek {{to evade}} nor assume responsibility.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, Dubourdieu sent {{a report}} to the Minister of War describing the French losses. Henri IV took several hits, with 1 dead and 9 wounded. The Sané suffered more damage than the Gomer, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> was seriously damaged. Three men were killed on the Sané, and nine were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Two {{counties}} were {{proposed in}} Florida's state legislature, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> actually became counties. A bill {{was passed by}} the legislature to create Bloxham County, but residents did not vote to approve it. See Leigh Read County, Florida for the events surrounding the proposed county.|$|E
5|$|All {{remaining}} {{competitors in}} the tournament besides Volador Jr. and Doug Williams did not compete in TNA again for some time. Williams and Volador Jr both returned to TNA at their Turning Point PPV event on November9, competing in a Ten Man X Division Elimination Rankings match. Volador Jr. competed as Volador in the contest <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> he nor Williams were successful in winning the bout.|$|E

5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> knew of the other's work.|$|E
5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> took any action.|$|E
60|$|He {{took her}} into his study. She was shy and confused, <b>but</b> {{certainly}} <b>neither</b> angry nor distressed.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{plans were}} floated to {{recreate}} the 500 Club either at the Trump Marina Hotel Casino or at the Sands Hotel and Casino, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> materialized. D'Amato's daughter Paulajane, who grew up in an apartment over the 500 Club, is now a member of the 500 Club Committee, which sponsors benefit concerts. In September 2015 the Philly Pops recreated the 500 Club in a Philadelphia restaurant, featuring performances by Deana Martin and Michael Andrew.|$|E
5|$|Because Titus {{effectively}} {{acted as}} co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership {{in the government}} would soon be his, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> tribunician power nor imperium of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{finished}} his major league career with 264 complete games {{out of his}} 301 games started. After his playing days, he {{was hired as a}} baseball umpire and later announced that he was becoming a boxer, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> venture seems to have worked out. Not much is known about Chamberlain's later life. He died in Baltimore in 1929.|$|E

5|$|Christian Hendrik Persoon {{named the}} species Peziza nigrella in his Systema Mycologia in 1801, {{and it was}} sanctioned under this name in Elias Magnus Fries' Systema Mycologicum in 1821. In 1870, German mycologist Fuckel {{transferred}} it to his newly described genus Pseudoplectania, and made it the type species. The species was ulteriorly placed in Crouania by Friedrich August Hazslinszky von Hazslin, and in Plectania by Petter Karsten (1885), <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> placement is considered correct.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income from writing, and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} into a {{military}} landowning family from the south of the Russian Empire, and followed the family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends. Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, and marry Kulikovsky, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> her husband nor her brother, the Tsar, would allow it.|$|E
