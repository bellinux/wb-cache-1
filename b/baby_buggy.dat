500|$|Marge and Homer {{now need}} a {{babysitter}} and hire Ms. Botz through the local [...] "Rubber <b>Baby</b> <b>Buggy</b> Bumper babysitting service" [...] (however, {{they have to}} call themselves the [...] "Samsons", since their kids have a rather bad reputation with the babysitting service, and are effectively blacklisted). On Marge's advice, Ms. Botz puts Maggie to bed and has Bart and Lisa watch The Happy Little Elves. When Bart tries to suggest alternate viewing, Ms. Botz quickly puts him in his place because she has dealt with troublesome children like him before. After Ms. Botz leaves the room Bart tunes into a station airing America's Most Armed and Dangerous (a parody of America's Most Wanted), which profiles a wanted burglar nicknamed [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] A mug shot of the suspect shows Bart and Lisa that Ms. Botz is [...] "The Babysitter Bandit." [...] Ms. Botz enters {{the living room and}} realizes that her cover has been blown. Bart and Lisa try to hide, but she easily finds them, ties them up and forces them to watch The Happy Little Elves as she continues packing the family's possessions into her suitcases. Maggie eventually wakes up and goes downstairs to discover that her siblings are tied up and watching TV. Maggie frees Bart and Lisa, and Bart is able to knock out Ms. Botz with a baseball bat.|$|E

5000|$|Menominee gained {{prominence}} in the 19th century as a lumber town; in its heyday, it produced more lumber than any other city in the United States of America. During this time of prosperity, the Menominee Opera House was built. It is being restored. In the 1910s a cycle car, the [...] "Dudly Bug", was manufactured in Menominee. In the waning years of lumber production, local business interests, interested in diversifying Menominee's manufacturing base, attracted inventor Marshall Burns Lloyd and his Minneapolis company Lloyd Manufacturing, which made wicker <b>baby</b> <b>buggies.</b> In 1917 Lloyd invented an automated process for weaving wicker and manufactured it as the Lloyd Loom. This machine process is still in use today. In the 21st century, the economy of Menominee is based on manufacturing (paper products, wicker lawn furniture, and auto supplies) and tourism.|$|R

25|$|On some of {{the busiest}} routes, the {{convenience}} of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, {{so most of the}} platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the upward direction) by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a cutout section taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails make life difficult for passengers with <b>baby</b> <b>buggies</b> or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein.|$|R

However, with an increased number of elderly and people with disabilities becoming technologically knowledgeable, it has been noted that few applications {{have been developed for}} this population group using Linked Data. In this paper, we present RailGB, a linked-data driven mobile web application to provide dynamic searches for accessible underground stations in London. RailGB may also prove useful for users such as those with heavy loads or <b>baby</b> <b>buggies.</b> Data in RailGB is collected from different datasets and are mashed-up within a user-friendly mobile web interface.

RailGB offers a fundamental shift in approach by reacting to the users’ needs whilst travelling with choices of access to a range of stations around the particular area to be visited using Linked Data. Further research is required to provide a wider range of information as more high quality open data becomes availabl...|$|R

She gave birth to a baby girl and finds it difficult to survive. The song [...] "The Runaway" [...] shows how Katya escapes the Russian whore house when the owner mixes vodka with heart pills and passes out. She then escapes with her baby into London. There she performs prostitution and steals food to survive. Looking for somewhere to crash for the night, she meets Michelle. Michelle realises the slim chances the baby will have and takes Katya under her wing. Meanwhile, the Russian gangsters are looking for Katya and she goes to the train station and while Aaron is alone on the train, the doors open and Katya leaves her <b>baby</b> in the <b>buggy</b> on the train, as she can see that the gangsters are about to catch her. Aaron bangs on the window in an attempt to gain Katya's attention. After his failed attempts to return the pram to the mother, he sees police at the upcoming station. Aaron hides his gun and drugs inside the pram and the baby's nappy respectively, and walks past the police without any problems, he then takes it upon himself to look after the baby, even though he is mocked by Ed. He then looks after the baby at his flat, talking with Jody about what to do. As the Russian gangsters have found Katya, a time where Michelle is distracted, she sees the car leave off, but she jumps in a cab just in time and orders the driver to follow them back to the whore house. As Vladimir is beating Katya, Michelle sneaks up behind him with a brick and hits him on the head with it. The two women run back into the cab, and although Vladimir attempts to chase them, they get away.|$|R
