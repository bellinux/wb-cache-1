5|$|In 2009 MacFarlane {{began work}} on the {{animated}} series Bordertown. The series is set in Texas and follows a <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> agent and a Mexican immigrant, satirizing America's changing cultural landscape. It ran for 13 episodes {{in the first half}} of 2016, on Fox.|$|E
5|$|Texas' Rio Grande Valley {{has seen}} {{significant}} migration {{from across the}} U.S.-Mexico border. During the 2014 crisis, many Central Americans, including unaccompanied minors traveling alone from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, reached the state, overwhelming <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> resources for a time.

5|$|Later in the day, 19 KLA {{fighters were}} wounded when the VJ shelled an arms {{smuggling}} route {{near the site}} of the ambush. They were evacuated by Albanian border guards and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of the mortar rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further tension between the two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav <b>border</b> <b>patrol,</b> wounding another soldier.|$|E
40|$|Research {{on racial}} <b>border</b> <b>patrolling</b> has {{demonstrated}} how people police racial borders {{in order to}} maintain socially constructed differences and reinforce divisions between racial groups and their members. Existing literature on <b>border</b> <b>patrolling</b> has primarily focused on white/black couples and multiracial families, with discussions contrasting “white <b>border</b> <b>patrolling</b> ” and “black <b>border</b> <b>patrolling,</b> ” in terms of differential motivations, intentions, and goals (Dalmage 2000). In my dissertation research, I examined a different type of policing racial categories and the spaces inbetween these shifting boundaries. I offer up “multiracial interracial <b>border</b> <b>patrolling</b> ” as a means of understanding how borderism impacts the lives of “multiracial ” individuals in “interracial ” relationships. In taking a look at how both identities and relationships involve racial negotiations, I conducted 60 in-depth, face-to-face qualitative interviews with people who indicated having racially mixed parentage or heritage. Respondents shared their experiences of publicly and privately managing their sometimes shifting preferred racial identities; often racially ambiguous appearance; and situationall...|$|R
25|$|The 3rd Attack Group resumed <b>border</b> <b>patrols</b> briefly {{again in}} 1929, after unrest erupted in Mexico. It {{deployed}} 18 of its aircraft on patrol along the Mexican border with Arizona in early April. The patrols lasted until early May {{when the situation}} in Mexico stabilized.

5|$|Mounted {{police have}} been used since the 18th century, and still are used {{worldwide}} to control traffic and crowds, patrol public parks, keep order in processionals and during ceremonies and perform general street patrol duties. Today, many cities still have mounted police units. In rural areas, horses are used by law enforcement for mounted patrols over rugged terrain, crowd control at religious shrines, and <b>border</b> <b>patrol.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the {{extended}} version used in desert <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> makes use of a high-ceilinged canopy to allow a swivelling rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} Lima Site 85 was {{assigned}} to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> Police battalion of 300 men. In {{the first week of}} 1968, the combined North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, U.S. technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, a U.S. <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> {{checkpoint}} {{was opened}} near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR94, {{as well as}} fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR188 to address {{the high rate of}} accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the environmental impact report as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR54, which was finished in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) <b>border</b> <b>patrol</b> ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) {{insurgents and}} foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, a {{day before}} Austria was annexed into Greater Germany {{following}} the Anschluss, Justas Lukoševičius, a Lithuanian <b>border</b> <b>patrol,</b> shot Stanisław Serafin, a Polish soldier, on the demarcation line {{in the village of}} Trasninkai near Merkinė. The exact circumstances are not clear as the obscure event was variously portrayed as a Lithuanian provocation, a Polish provocation, or as an unfortunate accident. During the 1920s and 1930s, similar incidents had occurred: between 1927 and 1937 seven Lithuanian border guards were killed during the course of 78 events. Usually, such incidents were handled at the local level in an attempt to forestall escalation. On this occasion, however, Polish radio and newspapers picked up the story and fanned anti-Lithuanian sentiment. Protests were held in Warsaw, Vilnius, and four other cities where the crowds shouted for military action against Lithuania. There is evidence that the Camp of National Unity was involved in organizing the protests.|$|E

5|$|Bramblestar's Storm, {{the seventh}} volume in the Super Edition arc, {{features}} Bramblestar, {{the leader of}} ThunderClan. The book takes place after the Clans' victory over the Dark Forest cats. This book was released on 26 August 2014. All Clans are struggling due to the lake flooding; however, ThunderClan and ShadowClan appear to be suffering most. Deaths of Clanmates leads to tension and grief between those in ThunderClan as they simultaneously also try to survive outside of their usual territory, having been displaced by the flooding. On a <b>border</b> <b>patrol,</b> Bramblestar encounters some housecats that are taken into the Clan until they can return home. Bramblestar becomes close {{to one of the}} housecats, Jessy, which upsets Bramblestar's deputy (and former mate) Squirrelflight causing many quarrels between them. Ultimately, two of the housecats, Minty and Jessy, decide to leave, leaving only Frankie (later named Stormpaw) with ThunderClan. Jessy leaves because she feels {{that it would be better}} if Bramblestar and herself do not become mates because Bramblestar’s heart belongs with Squirrelflight. In the short manga chapter included at the book's end, it is revealed that Squirrelflight is pregnant with Bramblestar's kits.|$|E
5|$|The JNA tasked the 2nd Titograd Corps and the 9th Boka Kotorska Military-Maritime Sector (VPS)both {{of which}} were {{elements}} of the 2nd Operational Groupwith cutting off and capturing the Dubrovnik area. The 2nd Titograd Corps deployed the 1st Nikšić Brigade while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS employed the 5th and the 472nd Motorized Brigades. The Corps boundary running north-to-south near Dubrovnik was set. The 2nd Operational Group also commanded the 16th <b>Border</b> <b>Patrol</b> Detachment and 107th Coastal Artillery Group, and mobilised Territorial Defence units from Herceg-Novi, Kotor, Tivat, Budva, Bar, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Trebinje. Strugar was in overall command of the 2nd Operative Group while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS was commanded by Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokić. Jokić replaced Admiral Krsto Đurović, {{who had died in}} uncertain circumstances hours before the offensive began. Major General Nojko Marinović, once commanding the 472nd Motorized Brigade and subordinate of Đurović, said that the JNA had killed the admiral because he opposed the offensive. Marinović resigned his post on 17 September and joined the Croatian ZNG. The JNA 2nd Operational Group initially deployed 7,000 troops and maintained similar troop levels throughout the offensive.|$|E
