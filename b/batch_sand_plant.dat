50|$|Between 1930 and 1955, the International Bitumen Company Limited under R.C. Fitzsimmons {{and later}} Lloyd Champion {{operated}} a small-scale oil <b>sands</b> <b>plant</b> at Bitumount, near Fort McMurray, Alberta.|$|R

50|$|The {{plant was}} down, but not out. In 1953 Lloyd Champion, who had {{acquired}} the plant during World War II began forming the Great Canadian Oil Sands consortium, {{based on his}} oil sands assets and his business acumen and drive. That effort lurched from crisis to crisis until Alberta Premier Ernest Manning brought his friend, J. Howard Pew, into the conversation. As the chairman of Philadelphia-based Sun Oil Company, Pew soon became the primary financial backer of the project. As a result, the Great Canadian Oil <b>Sands</b> <b>plant</b> (today the Suncor oil <b>sands</b> <b>plant)</b> went into operation in 1967 - the year of Canada's Centennial celebrations.|$|R

50|$|The system {{originally}} used {{a single}} pipe for water delivery, {{and did not}} have any water purification plants, relying instead on the reservoirs to act as settling basins. By the turn of the 20th century, however, Washington's growth and the high amount of sediment in the Potomac's water kept the reservoirs from doing their jobs well, and so the first treatment plant, a massive slow sand filter bed system, was installed at McMillan Reservoir, and was completed in 1905. The regular use of chlorine as a disinfectant began in 1923 at the McMillan plant. The McMillan plant was not replaced until 1985, when a rapid <b>sand</b> filter <b>plant</b> was opened adjacent to it. Efforts are under way to redevelop the land the slow <b>sand</b> <b>plant</b> used, while maintaining some of the <b>plant's</b> <b>sand</b> silos for historical purposes.|$|R

2500|$|The {{largest single}} plant in Canada {{to use in}} situ {{production}} is Imperial Oil's Cold Lake oil <b>sand</b> <b>plant.</b> This plant uses a technique called cyclic steam injection.

Imperial also uses steam-assisted gravity drainage. In its SAGD production system, Imperial drills two horizontal wells, one five metres above the other. Steam injected through the upper well reduces the viscosity of the oil, which is recovered through the lower borehole. This plant produces more than [...] of bitumen per day.|$|R

In that sense, the experiment was to evaluate different types of substrates for the emergence and early development of seedlings of Cassia grandis L. f. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at the Departament of Vegetable Sciences of Federal Rural do Semi- Árido (UFERSA), in Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. The substrates used were: sand + carbonized rice husk (in ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 3 and 3 : 1), <b>plant</b> <b>sand</b> + wood dust (in ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 3 and 3 : 1), <b>plant</b> <b>sand</b> + coconut fiber (in ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 3 and 3 : 1), <b>plant</b> <b>sand</b> + chestnut bark (in ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 3 and 3 : 1) and <b>plant</b> <b>sand</b> (control). The experimental design was a completely randomized design with 13 treatments (combinations of substrates), with four replications of 25 seeds and the means to test for Skot-knot (pr < 0. 05). We evaluated the following variables: plant emergence, emergence speed, plant height, root length and weight of the aerial part of the plant, root dry mass and total dry mass. According to the results, the substrate <b>plant</b> <b>sand</b> + sawdust (1 : 1) and <b>plant</b> <b>sand</b> + coconut fiber (1 : 3) showed higher values, providing better results in emergence, weight of the aerial part of the plant, length of the aerial part of the plant, root dry mass and root length. It was found that the substrate compounds <b>sand</b> <b>plant</b> and chestnut bark (1 : 3) is harmful to the emergence of seedling of Cassia grandis...|$|R

40|$|Turbine (rotor) mixers {{are widely}} used in {{foundries}} for bentonite rebonding of synthetic system sands. They form basic equipment in modern <b>sand</b> processing <b>plants.</b> Their major advantage is the short time of the rebond mixing cycle. Until now, no complete theoretical description {{of the process of}} mixing in turbine mixers has been offered. Neither does it seem reasonable to try to adapt the theoretical backgrounds of the mixing process carried out in mixers of other types, for example, rooler mixers [1], to the description of operation of the turbine mixers. Truly one can risk the statement that the individual fundamental operations of mixing in rooler mixers, like kneading, grinding, mixing and thinning, are also performed in turbine mixers. Yet, even if so, in turbine mixers these processes are proceeding at a rate and intensity different than in the roller mixers. The fact should also be recalled that the theoretical backgrounds usually relate to the preparation of sand mixtures from new components, and this considerably restricts the field of application of these descriptions when referred to rebond mixing of the system sand. The fundamentals of the process of the synthetic sand rebonding with bentonite require determination and description of operations, like disaggregation, even distribution of binder and water within the entire volume of the rebonded <b>sand</b> <b>batch,</b> <b>sand</b> grains coating, binder activation and aeration. This study presents the scope of research on the sand rebonding process carried out in turbine mixers. The aim has been to determine the range and specific values of the designing and operating parameters to get optimum properties of the rebonded sand as well as energy input in the process...|$|R
