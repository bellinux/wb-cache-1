40|$|The {{performance}} of intelligent video surveillance systems is always degraded under complicated scenarios, like dynamic changing backgrounds and extremely <b>bad</b> <b>weathers.</b> Dynamic changing backgrounds make the foreground/background segmentation, {{which is often}} {{the first step in}} vision-based algorithms, become unreliable. <b>Bad</b> <b>weathers,</b> such as foggy scenes, not only degrade the visual quality of the monitoring videos, but also seriously affect the accuracy of the vision-based algorithms. In this thesis, a fast and robust texture-based background modeling technique is first presented for tackling the problem of foreground/background segmentation under dynamic backgrounds. An adaptive multi-modal framework is proposed which uses a novel texture feature known as scale invariant local states (SILS) to model an image pixel. A pattern-less probabilistic measurement (PLPM) is also derived to estimate the probability of a pixel being background from its SILS. Experimental results show that texture-based background modeling is more robust than illumination-based approaches under dynamic backgrounds and lighting changes. Furthermore, the proposed background modeling technique can run much faster than the existing state-of-the-art texture-based method, without sacrificing the output quality. Two fast adaptive defogging techniques, namely 1) foreground decremental preconditioned conjugate gradient (FDPCG), and 2) adaptive guided image filtering are next introduced for removing the foggy effects on video scenes. These two methods allow the estimation of the background transmissions to converge over consecutive video frames, and then background-defog the video sequences using the background transmission map. Results show that foreground/background segmentation can be improved dramatically with such background-defogged video frames. With the reliable foreground/ background segmentation results, the foreground transmissions can then be recovered by the proposed 1) foreground incremental preconditioned conjugate gradient (FIPCG), or 2) on-demand guided image filtering. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively improve the visual quality of surveillance videos under heavy fog and <b>bad</b> <b>weathers.</b> Comparing with state-of-the-art image defogging methods, the proposed methods are shown to be much more efficient. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{conservation}} of historic stone sculptures and buildings is receiving growing attention because of increasing <b>bad</b> <b>weathering.</b> In this paper, we report our experiments on the {{conservation of}} the Longmen Grottoes through a biomimetic method. Some relevant experiments {{have been done in}} the lab at first. A protective film of calcium oxalate has been prepared on the marble stone through a biomimetic synthesis. The obtained material was characterized by XRD and SEM. The protective performances were also evaluated by its ability to resist soil and acid. Then, the field trials have been carried out in Longmen Grottoes. The results obtained from the laboratory experiments and field trials are satisfied, which indicates that {{the conservation of}} historic stone sculptures and buildings through the biomimetic method should have a good prospect...|$|R
5|$|While some mythological {{beings are}} common to all Slavic ethnic groups, ale seem to be {{exclusive}} to Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serb folklore. Even so, other Slavic groups also had demons of <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b> Among East Slavs, this witch was called Baba Yaga, and was imagined as a woman of gigantic stature with a big nose, iron teeth, and protruding chin; {{it was believed that}} she ate children, and her presence brought thunderstorms and cold weather. The term baba is present in customs, beliefs, and toponyms of all Slavic groups, usually as a personification of wind, darkness, and rain. This leads some scholars to believe there was a proto-Slavic divinity or demon called Baba, associated with <b>bad</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the best}} interdiction efforts of Rolling Thunder, however, the NLF and PAVN {{launched}} their largest offensive thus {{far in the}} war on 30 January 1968, striking throughout South Vietnam during the lunar new year holiday. The Tet Offensive concluded as a military disaster for North Vietnam and its NLF allies, but it also adversely affected U.S. public opinion, which in turn affected the will of Washington. Fortunately for North Vietnam, many U.S. bombing advocates (including Air Force Chief of Staff McConnell) did not want to risk the one aircraft capable of delivering a lot of bombs in <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> – the B-52. Without them, there was little that could be done over the north in response to Tet, since <b>bad</b> <b>weather</b> minimized fighter operations until the beginning of April.|$|E
