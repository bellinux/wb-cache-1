Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with <b>Ben.</b> Abi tries to persuade <b>Ben</b> into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that <b>Ben</b> will always believe his girlfriend over his sister.

Hurley asks <b>Ben</b> to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, <b>Ben,</b> on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, <b>Ben</b> arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. <b>Ben</b> tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E
