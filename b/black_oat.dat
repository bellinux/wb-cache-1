Their quantity depends on type of plant, methods of growing, humidity, and geographic conditions. It was reported that the cellulose contents of wheat straw, rice, <b>black</b> wheat, barley, <b>oat,</b> bagasse, corn stalks, and maize, respectively, are 38.6, 36.5, 37.9, 34.8, 38.5, 39.2, and 43.2  % w/w. The quantities of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for a variety of cellulosic material were reported in the previously published literature [15, 16]. Rice straw, however, consists of 32 – 47  % w/w cellulose, 19 – 27  % w/w hemicellulose, and 5 – 24  % w/w lignin [17, 18]. Thus, it can be stated that the cellulose derived from rice straw is dramatically more valuable if it passes the extraction process efficiency test [19].|$|R

A novel {{catalytic}} kinetic {{spectrophotometric method}} for {{the determination of}} iron is developed based on the catalytic effect of Fe(III) on the oxidation reaction of p-acetylarsenazo(ASApA) by potassium periodate. Maximum absorbance of the Fe(III) -ASApA-KIO 4 system in 8. 0 × 10 - 3 M sulfuric acid occurs at the wavelength of 540 nm. The change in absorbance (∆A) is linearly related with the concentration of iron(III) {{in the range of}} 0. 10 - 4. 0 ng/mL and fitted the equation: ∆A = 4. 91 × 10 - 2 C (C: ng/mL) + 0. 017, with a regression coefficient of 0. 9966 at the wavelength. The detection limit of the method is 0. 031 ng/mL. The relative standard deviation of the method was from 1. 34 % to 1. 78 % for 11 replicate determinations.

Cross reactivity between monocotyledonous phytochrome and antidicotyledonous-phytochrome serum and between dicotyledonous phytochrome and antimonocotyledonous-phytochrome serum was always weak or not perceptible by this assay. Among the four dicotyledonous phytochromes examined, pea and bean were the most similar immunochemically as anticipated. Pea and lettuce phytochrome somewhat unexpectedly also exhibited similar immunochemical reactivity. Zucchini phytochrome by contrast was immunochemically distinct from pea, bean, and lettuce phytochrome, although it did react with all three antidicotyledonous-phytochrome sera. Initial attempts to identify immunoglobulins that would recognize phytochrome regardless of its source indicated that they may exist.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate biological and microbiological attributes in soil under different winter cover crops and nitrogen doses. The experiment was conducted at the Frederico Westphalen-RS campus of the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM) in a Rhodic Hapludox soil. The experimental design was a randomized block in factorial arrangement (2 x 10) : 10 winter cover crops systems (Fallow [control], black oats, white oats, ryegrass, forage turnip, vetch, white lupine; <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> + forage turnip; <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> + vetch and <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> + vetch + fodder turnip), and two nitrogen rates in the form of urea applied in successive crops of beans common and maize, with four replications. We assessed the biological attributes (Margalef’s richness, Simpson’s dominance, Shannon’s diversity and abundance of organisms) and microbiological (carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient of the soil). The fallow with wild species and white lupine showed greater Simpson’s dominance and abundance of organisms due to the increase in the number of individuals of the order Collembola. Vetch improved the biological attributes of the soil with increase in Collembola abundance and diversity of organisms of soil fauna.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cover crops grown {{alone or}} in {{association}} can take up different amounts of phosphorus (P) from the soil and accumulate it in different P-forms in plant tissue. Cover crop residues with a higher content of readily decomposed forms may release P more quickly for the next onion crop. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the release of P forms from residues of single and mixed cover crops in agroecological no-till onion (Allium cepa L.) production. The experiment was conducted in Ituporanga, Santa Catarina (SC), Brazil, in an Inceptisol, with the following treatments: weeds, <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> (Avena sativa L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.), oilseed radish + <b>black</b> <b>oat,</b> and oilseed radish + rye. Cover crops were sown in April 2013. In July 2013, plant shoots were cut close to the soil surface and part of the material was placed in litterbags. The bags were placed on the soil surface and residues were collected at 0, 15, and 45 days after deposition (DAD). Residues were dried and ground and P in the plant tissue was determined through chemical fractionation. The release of P contained in the tissue of cover crops depends not only on total P content in the tissue, but also on the accumulation of P forms and the quality of the residue in decomposition. The highest accumulation of P in cover crops occurred in the soluble inorganic P fraction, which is the fraction of fastest release in plants. <b>Black</b> <b>oat</b> had the highest initial release rate of soluble inorganic P, which became equal to the release rate of other cover crop residues at 45 DAD. Weeds released only half the amount of soluble inorganic P in the same period, despite accumulating a considerable amount of P in their biomass. The mixtures of oilseed radish + rye and oilseed radish + <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> showed higher release of P associated with RNA at 45 DAD in comparison to the single treatments...|$|E

40|$|Currently, one of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} faced by organic no-tillage farming is weed control. Thus, the use of cropping practices that help in the control of weeds is extremely important. The objective of this study was to evaluate population density and level of weed infestation in an organic no-tillage corn cropping system under different soil covers. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with six repetitions and five treatments, consisting of three soil covers in an organic no-tillage system, and an organic and a conventional system, both without soil cover. The treatments with soil cover used a grass species represented by the <b>black</b> <b>oat,</b> a leguminous species represented by the white lupine, and intercropping between both species. Corn was sown with spacing of 1. 0 m between rows and 0. 20 m between plants, using the commercial hybrid AG 1051. Infestation in corn was evaluated at stages V 5 and V 10, and weed density was evaluated at stage V 5. The use of <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> straw alone or intercropped with white lupine, in the organic no-tillage corn cropping system, reduced the percentage of weed infestation and absolute weed density. Management-intensive systems and systems without soil cover showed higher relative densities for species Oxalis spp., Galinsoga quadriradiata and Stachys arvensis. The species Cyperus rotundus showed the highest relative density on organic no-tillage corn cropping systems. <b>Black</b> <b>oat</b> straw in the organic no-tillage cropping system limited the productive potential of corn...|$|E
40|$|To reduce Fusarium Basal Rot {{caused by}} Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae (Foc) through crop rotation, plant species should be {{selected}} based on Foc multiplication in their roots. Foc multiplication rates in 13 plant species were tested in a greenhouse. All plant species enabled Foc multiplication. The lowest Foc levels (cfu g- 1 dry root) were found for wheat, sunflower, cowpea and millet, the highest for black bean. The highest Foc levels per plant were calculated for sudan grass. These data were used to calibrate the model Pf¿=¿Pi/(a¿+¿ßPi) relating final (Pf) and initial (Pi) Foc levels in the soil. The rate of population increase at low Pi (1 /a) was highest for onion and <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> and smallest for sunflower. The pathogen carrying capacity (1 /ß) was highest for <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> and black bean, and lowest for wheat, cowpea and foxtail millet. Foc soil population dynamics was simulated for crop sequences by concatenating Pi-Pf values, considering instantaneous or gradual pathogen release after harvest. Different soil Foc populations were attained after reaching steady states. Foc populations in the sequence onion –foxtail millet - wheat – cowpea were 67 % lower than in the sequence onion – sudan grass - <b>black</b> <b>oat</b> - black beans. In this work, by combining detailed greenhouse experiments with modelling, {{we were able to}} screen crops for their ability to increase Foc population and to explore potential crop sequences that may limit pathogen build-u...|$|E
