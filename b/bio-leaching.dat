With {{the addition of}} suitable nutrient and reductant, the metals existing in the nodules, such as Cu, Co, Ni and Mn can be leached effectively in an acidic and anaerobic system under ambient temperature in 3 days. Manganese oxide, and nickel sulfide participate in the respiration of the microbe as electron acceptor and donor respectively.

40|$|The {{classical}} equations of {{two-phase flow}} in a porous media are solved together with two transport equations representing the leaching process. For the two-phase flow {{we use the}} pressure-saturation formulation, where the principal variables are the total pressure, the total flux and the saturation of the liquid phase. For the transport equations the variables of interest are the sulfuric acid and the copper concentration. The numerical method combines a mixed finite element method with a finite volume method. The first one is used to approximate the total pressure and flux, while the second {{is used to calculate}} the saturation and both concentrations. The advantage of this approach is its capacity to completely characterize the dynamics of the liquid and gaseous phase, and treat with the same model acid and <b>bio-leaching</b> processes. Several examples show the application of the method...|$|E
40|$|Research is {{reported}} on the recovery of molybdenum and nickel from spent coal liquefaction catalysts. Mo release from spent coal liquefaction catalysts {{has been shown to}} be dependent upon many parameters, but release is dominated by microbial growth. The microbial Mo release is a rapid process requiring less than one week for 90 % of the releaseable Mo to be solubilized from whole washed (THF) catalyst. It could be expected that the rates would be even greater with crushed catalyst. Efforts were centered on optimizing the parameters that stimulate microbial growth and action and further efforts centered on catalyst pre-treatment prior to microbial <b>bio-leaching.</b> Recent experiments suggest that hydrogen peroxide promises to be an effective pre-treatment wash. Hydrogen peroxide was also found to be an effective and economical agent for metals solubilization per se and could promote solubilization without subjecting the catalyst to microbial growth...|$|E
40|$|Batch culture {{techniques}} and a kinetic model {{were used to}} examine the effects of Al 3 + and NO 3 − ions on the cell replication rates of iron oxidising bacteria. Aluminium ions at a concentration of 2240 ppm (85 mM) were shown to reduce the cell replication rate to 85 % of that observed for cells in minimal media. Nitrate ions (NO 3 −) at a concentration of 920 ppm (15 mM) were shown to reduce the cell replication rate to 65 % of that observed for cells cultured in minimal media and the culture was not viable beyond three sequential batchculture cycles. The inhibition produced by nitrate is greater than that previously observed for chloride ions, but the impact of aluminium is similar to that observed with salts such as potassium, sodium and ammonium sulphate i. e. a small reduction in replication rate associated with increased concentration but without long term effects on culture viability. The results of this study are significant for South American <b>bio-leach</b> operations that have reported elevated concentrations of Al 3 + ions in process water. The impact of varying substrate (FeSO 4) concentration was also examined; it was found that iron oxidising cells are subject to substrate inhibition...|$|R

The enrichment of the REE concentrated in bastnaesite-group minerals, the intergrowths between REE-minerals and Al–Ni–silicates with significant sulfur contents and their association with goethite microtextures interpreted as bacteriomorphic, indicate REE remobilization along with iron <b>bio-leaching</b> and re-precipitation on karstified limestone. In addition to the previous-reported hydroxylbastnaesites, a (La,Nd,Y) (CO 3) F member of the bastnaesite-group associated with Al–Ni–silicates were identified, the stability of which may reflect the dependence on the source rocks and the local variations of pH-Eh.

40|$|<b>Bio-leaching</b> {{of copper}} (0. 3 %) {{from a low}} grade Indian {{chalcopyrite}} ore of Malanjkhand copper mines, using a native mesophilic isolate predominantly Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A. ferrooxidans), is reported. A bio-recovery of 72 % Cu was recorded {{in the presence of}} this culture (not adapted), which increased to 75 % with an ore adapted culture after 35 days at 35 ºC and pH 2. 0 with < 50 fim particles. The kinetic data showed best fit for the diffusion-controlled shrinking core model, exhibiting linear plots for [1 - 2 / 3 X-(1 -X) 2 / 3] vs time (X-fraction leached). Apparently, the role of the bacteria is to convert the ferrous ion to the ferric state, which oxidizes the chalcopyrite in order to dissolve copper, while maintaining a high redox potential. The activation energy value (E) was calculated to be 96 and 108 kJ/mol for the un-adapted culture and the ore adapted culture respectively in the temperature range 25 - 35 ºC. This leaching mechanism was corroborated by XRD phase identification and SEM studies of the leach residue...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the electrochemical behavior of pyrite under typical <b>bio-leaching</b> conditions {{has been carried out}} with the focus on the effect of the concentration of sulphate ions on the mixed potential, cyclic voltammetric and potentiostatic measurements. The mixed potential decreases with increasing sulphate ion concentration and the addition of iron(II) and increases as expected with increasing iron(III) concentration and agitation at constant pH. Temperature, pH and the concentration of dissolved oxygen have minimal effects on the mixed potential in the presence of iron(III). Cyclic voltammetric and potentiostatic data confirm that the rate of anodic oxidation of pyrite decreases with increasing sulphate ion concentration and increases with increasing temperature. The pH and dissolved oxygen concentration have little effect while addition of chloride ions inhibits the anodic oxidation of pyrite. Studies of the cathodic reduction of iron(III) and dissolved oxygen have shown that the rate of the former is several orders of magnitude more reversible(rapid) than that of dissolved oxygen which only exhibits measurable reactivity at potentials well below the mixed potentials in the presence of iron(III). The reduction of iron(III) is inhibited by sulphate ions due to the formation of electrochemically less reactive sulphate complexes...|$|E
40|$|Indian Ocean {{manganese}} nodules offer {{a lucrative}} resource for valuable strategic metals like Cu, Co and Ni. A novel <b>bio-leaching</b> process to recover these metals in presence of organic reductants from the nodules at near neutral pH and ambient temperature {{is presented in}} this paper. The cell-free growth supernatant of a marine microorganism isolated from the nodules was employed in bioleaching studies of the nodules. The organic metabolites produced during growth of the microorganism, play a primary role in the leaching process by reduction of oxides and/or complexation of the transition metals. Around 40 % cobalt and 25 % of Cu and Ni were recovered in the leach liquor at near neutral pH values in about two hours, indicating that, metabolites preferentially leach cobalt compared to copper and nickel. Chemical leaching tests were also carried out with organic reactants under similar conditions and the recovery of transition metals was {{compared with that of}} leaching with growth supernatant alone. Finally, when growth supernatant was supplemented with certain organic reactants like ascorbic acid, 60 – 70 % recovery of Cu, Co and Ni was obtained in solution within half an hour...|$|E

Accordingly, a total working volume of 90 -L with 5 -layers aerobic <b>bio-leaching</b> bed(ABLB) which introduced aerobic fungi and bacteria was adopted to facilitate the hydrolysis of napiergrass and hydrogen production potential was evaluated in this study. Napiergrass was chopped into 1 ∼ 2 cm and mixed with kitchenwaste, compost as nutrient supplement and inoculum respectively. The crisscrossed mixture was packed and pH controlled tap water was flowed through each layer. One through leaching was performed in the 1 st Run, and the contact time of leachate with biomass was 2. 2 hr. Cellulose conversion efficiency was 27 %. As the contact time increased to 21 hr in 2 nd Run, cellulose conversion efficiency also improved to 50 %. In order to increase the contact time, leachate was recirculated for 7 days in 3 rd Run.

40|$|Background: Acidithiobacillus caldus (A. caldus) {{is widely}} used in <b>bio-leaching.</b> It gains energy and {{electrons}} from oxidation of elemental sulfur and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (RISCs) for carbon dioxide fixation and growth. Genomic analyses suggest that its sulfur oxidation system involves a truncated sulfur oxidation (Sox) system (omitting SoxCD), non-Sox sulfur oxidation system similar to the sulfur oxidation in A. ferrooxidans, and sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR). The complexity of the sulfur oxidation system of A. caldus generates a big obstacle on the research of its sulfur oxidation mechanism. However, the development of genetic manipulation method for A. caldus in recent years provides powerful tools for constructing genetic mutants to study the sulfur oxidation system. Results: An A. caldus mutant lacking the sulfur oxygenase reductase gene (sor) was created and its growth abilities were measured in media using elemental sulfur (S 0) and tetrathionate (K 2 S 4 O 6) as the substrates, respectively. Then, comparative transcriptome analysis (microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR) of the wild type and the Dsor mutant in S 0 and K 2 S 4 O 6 media were employed to detect the differentially expressed genes involved in sulfur oxidation. SOR was concluded to oxidize the cytoplasmic elemental sulfur, but could not couple the sulfur oxidation with the electron transfer chain or substrate-level phosphorylation.

40|$|Microbial {{leaching}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective methods to remove heavy metals from sludge. In the conducted researches, the sludge samples were processed with Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans obtained via cultivation, extraction and purification processes. Heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Cu and Ni were leached from sludge by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and Thiobacillus thiooxidans within different substrate concentration and pH value conditions. It is defined that from the point of view of economy and efficiency the optimal concentration of FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O and sulfur for <b>bio-leaching</b> process was 0. 2 g. The leaching rates of heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Cu and Ni of the same concentration were 74. 72 %, 81. 54 %, 70. 46 % and 77. 35 % respectively. However, no significant differences depending on the pH value among the leaching rates were defined, even for the pH value of 1. 5. Along with the removal of heavy metals from sludge, the organic matter, N, P, K were also leached to some extent. The losing rate of phosphorus was the highest and reached 38. 44 %. However, the content of organic matter, N, P, K in the processed sludge were higher in comparison with level I of the National Soil Quality Standards of China. Ecological risk of heavy metals in sludge before and after leaching was assessed by Index of Geo-accumulation (Igeo) and comprehensive potential risk (RI). The results of research defined that the content of heavy metals in sludge meets the level of low ecological risk after leaching and their contents is lower in comparison with the National Agricultural Sludge Standard of China.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the geochemical observation and monitoring into the underground components of nuclear repositories, {{the purpose of the study}} was to investigate, in a semi-continuous mode of monitoring, the redox potential of reference and natural solutions via a bunch of electrodes. Because, each electrode response depends upon its material nature as well as its surface properties, gold (Au) and glassy carbon (GC) electrodes were investigated as inert indicator electrodes (IIE) in addition to platinum (Pt). Indeed, platinum differs from gold as it has the higher exchange current density (10 mA/cm² for Pt, against 0. 3 mA/cm² for Au). However, gold is known as a more inert material: Pt is susceptible to catalyze reactions, form oxides and adsorb H 2; in contrast, gold does not. Gold has moreover a greater potential range (- 0. 8 to 1. 8 V/NHE) towards the positive potentials (≈ 400 mV) than Pt. In comparison, glassy carbon possesses a larger potential range (- 1. 0 to 1. 0 V/NHE) towards the negative potentials (≈- 200 mV) than Au and Pt. In addition to inert indicator electrodes pure pyrite (FeS 2) was selected as alterable or alternative electrode. Its interest for potentiometric measurements in <b>bio-leaching</b> has already been demonstrated by Cabral and Ignatiadis (2001). It was even more interesting because pyrite occurs naturally in the Callovo-Oxfordian (COx) formation. It was thus of a great interest to integrate it to the bunch of electrodes and to identify the relevance of different redox reactions at the vicinity of the pyrite electrode surface. The test offered an advantage of great importance, because it provided information on the simultaneous behaviour of different electrodes under identical conditions. Electrode performances and robustness were examined versus time "long term measurements". This work also aimed to: - identify the redox reactions controlling the measured potential, both into solution and at the electrode/solution interface - compare the obtained results with speciation measurements and geochemical modelling. Because Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + couple has thus a decisive influence on the behaviour of pyrite electrode, the robustness of the complementary approaches to obtain the voltage measurement it-self and its interpretation was investigated in low organic matter content samples where iron redox-active species dominated redox reactions. [Fe 3 +]/[Fe 2 +] ratios were analysed in different supporting electrolytes (NaCl, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2) at different pH (ranging from 1 to 12) and/or ionic strengths (supporting electrolytes concentration ranged from 0. 1 to 5 mol. L- 1). Investigations were also conducted in not balanced systems: i) Fe° powder immersed in pH-buffered and unbuffered solutions, ii) mackinawite suspension. PHREEQC® geochemical code was used to determine Eh and aqueous speciation by thermodynamic methods with the appropriate associated thermodynamic database (THERMODEM® thermodynamic database generated by BRGM). Potentiometric measurements demonstrated that the potential acquired by all the immersed IIE generally converges to a value of the same order of magnitude, independently of the sample. Acquired potentials were in good agreement with modelling. This fact demonstrates that, under the same experimental conditions, the redox couples fixe identically the potential of inert electrodes (i. e. outcome of the same equilibrium state whatever the inert electrode). In the case when acquired potential did not converge, interface phenomena occurred (adsorption, oxidation, reduction, precipitation, accumulation of ions [...] .). Concerning FeS 2 electrode, different behaviours have been observed as a function of pH: - Pyrite behaviour in acidic media (pH ≤ 2) : pyrite electrode acquired a potential which was increasingly lower than that of the platinum, which measures the redox potential of the solution. The lower value of pyrite at this pH can be explained by the interfacial pyrite oxidation, leading to the increase in Fe 2 + at the vicinity of pyrite electrode. As the pyrite electrode has Nernstian behaviour (Cabral et Ignatiadis, 2001), the equilibrium value is decreased because the Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + ratio at the electrode interface is lower than that of the solution. - Pyrite behaviour at circum-neutral pH (4. 7 ≤pH ≤ 7. 0) : it is important to note that, at low ionic strength, the potential of both pyrite and platinum electrodes were practically identical. The similar voltage measured by the two electrodes implies that the processes at the vicinity of the electrodes were the same. This result is in agreement with those already obtained by Cabral et Ignatiadis (2001), demonstrating that, in particular conditions, pyrite can act as redox electrode. These conditions can, for example, be encountered in the initial COx formation. In comparison with acidic media, at low ionic strength, pyrite oxidation/dissolution is lowered. The increase in pH diminishes the oxidizing capacity of Fe 3 +. The redox potential is thus fixed, for the two electrodes (Pt and Py), via the Fe(OH) 3 /Fe 2 + couple, which is dependent of Fe(OH) 3 solubility as a function of pH. High ionic strength, leads to an increase in the oxidizing capacity of Fe 3 + versus pyrite. It thus leads to an accumulation of Fe 2 + at the vicinity of pyrite electrode, consequently generating progressive decrease in the Fe(III) /Fe(II) ratio at the pyrite/solution interface and thus in the electrode potential. - Pyrite behaviour under alkaline conditions (pH ≈ 9 or higher) : a higher potential value of pyrite at these pH in comparison with the potential acquired by platinum can be explained by an anoblishment process on the pyrite surface. Indeed, at higher pH than 7 iron hydroxide coagulates and stabilizes chemically to form an iron hydroxide coating at the pyrite electrode surface. The combination of equation 1 and 5 leads to Fe 3 + depletion in solution and in the pyrite/solution interface. Fe(OH) 3 coating onto the pyrite electrode responsible for the lowering of pyrite oxidation/dissolution. According to the following reaction Fe 3 + + 3 H 2 O ↔ Fe(OH) 3 + 3 H+, pyrite resulting anoblisment lead to the decrease in pH at the electrode. When the solution redox potential (Pt) is fixed by Fe(OH) 3 (s) /FeOH+ couple (with Eeq = - 1. 14 - 0. 06 log[FeOH+] - 0. 03 log[OH-]), the pyrite electrode potential is fixed by Fe(OH) 3 (s) /Fe 2 + couple (with Eeq = - 1. 46 - 0. 06 log[Fe 2 +] - 0. 01 log[OH-]). These results confirmed, with absolute clarity, that the behaviour of pyrite is a function of the Fe(III) /Fe(II) ratio at the interface. These results are even more interesting because they lead to highlight the double interest of pyrite electrode as both redox and pH indicator when integrated in the bunch of electrodes. In fact, in natural conditions, i. e. those of initial COx formation, pyrite can operate as redox electrode (its potential is similar to that of an IIE). An increase of its potential versus the potential of an IIE can be correlated to an alkaline environment: pyrite electrode can thus behave as a pH indicator. This can be applied in the case of COx formation during its envisaged evolution as nuclear waste repository...|$|E
