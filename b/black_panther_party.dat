She soon left the party, disliking the macho {{behavior of the}} men and believing that the BPP lacked knowledge and understanding of United States black history. Shakur then joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an offshoot of the BPP whose members, inspired by the Vietcong and the Battle of Algiers, led a campaign of armed struggle against the U.S. government using tactics such as planting bombs, holding up banks and executing drug dealers and police.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{his release}} from Cook County Jail, Jiménez ran for {{alderman}} of the 46th Ward and garnered 39% of the vote, becoming the first Hispanic to run and oppose the Cook County Democratic political machine of Richard J. Daley. In September 1973, Jiménez announced his campaign in Pastor Fines Flores United Methodist Church. The campaign followed the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Partys</b> example. Chairman Bobby Seale of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panthers</b> was also running for mayor of Oakland. It was also a [...] "Rainbow Coalition" [...] of activists, relating back to Chairman Fred Hampton. Remnants of the Uptown Young Patriots also worked within the campaign. Walter [...] "Slim" [...] Coleman re-organized white supporters of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party’s</b> Intercommunal Survival Committees. They opened up the Uptown Community Service Center and supported the Young Lords and Cha-Chas aldermanic campaign.|$|R
5|$|Agents of Repression (1988), co-authored by Jim Vander Wall, {{describes}} what the authors claim {{was a secret}} war against the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party</b> and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and '70s by the FBI under the COINTELPRO program. The COINTELPRO Papers (1990; reissued 2002), also co-authored with Jim Vander Wall, examines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau's activities against various leftist groups, from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Mumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook; April 24, 1954) is {{a convicted}} murderer, American activist and {{journalist}} who {{became involved in}} black nationalism in his youth {{and was a member}} of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party</b> until October 1970. He left the party and became a radio reporter, eventually becoming president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1982 for the murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. After numerous appeals, his sentence was commuted in 2011 to life imprisonment without parole.|$|E
5|$|Realising the Conservative {{governance}} of Lambeth Borough council {{was hard to}} unseat, Livingstone aided Eddie Lopez in reaching out {{to members of the}} local populace disenfranchised from the traditional Labour leadership. Associating with the leftist Schools' Action Union (SAU) founded {{in the wake of the}} 1968 student protests, he encouraged members of the Brixton branch of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party</b> to join Labour. His involvement in the SAU led to his dismissal from the PFTCC student's union, who disagreed with politicising secondary school pupils.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, {{he sought}} out former <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> Dhoruba al-Mujahid bin Wahad, {{who had just}} been {{provisionally}} released from prison after spending 19 years incarcerated on a charge of [...] "sedition". Lotringer invited Dhoruba to produce a Semiotexte book vindicating and updating the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party's</b> position. The result was Still Black, Still Strong, an anthology of writings by Assata Shakur, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Bin-Wahad.|$|R

5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on those jobs, specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party</b> was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E

[...] The title of track #13 was inspired by Frank Sinatra's album Love is a Kick.|$|R
5000|$|Breaking {{from some}} on the left, Moore {{at one point in}} his book says that [...] "Mumia {{probably}} killed that guy". Activists supporting the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party's</b> Mumia Abu-Jamal demanded that Moore substantiate this claim. Moore in a later interview stated that he did not believe that Mumia Abu Jamal killed the police officer, and that he would change the passage for the paperback release.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reportedly}} {{an arm of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Panthers</b> <b>Party.</b> Efforts by some to start a chapter at Tech High School were unsuccessful. According to extensive U.S. government surveillance records, Robert Griffo, a member of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panthers,</b> was appointed minister of student affairs at Tech. BANTU was credited with leading the protests that led to three days of rioting in June 1969, after an Omaha police officer fatally shot teenager Vivian Strong in the Logan Fontenelle Public Housing Projects.|$|R

50|$|Kendrick Lamar makes {{multiple}} {{references to}} high-profile black activists of the 20th century, including Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, and Fred Hampton. He claims {{that many of}} these activists, specifically noting <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party's</b> leaders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, lived by the ideals of HiiiPoWeR. His lyrics also connect to the militancy of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panthers</b> by referencing cop-killing (“I got my finger on the mothafuckin’ pistol/ Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte’s web is gonna miss you”). Using Kurt Cobain's suicide and Lauryn Hill's recent troubles as examples, he repeatedly states in the lyrics of the song that society pushes people to act in crazy or evil ways.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a fee of}} $25,000, paid by The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Weathermen smuggled Leary out {{of prison}} in a pickup truck driven by Clayton Van Lydegraf.

50|$|The Winston-Salem chapter, {{like most}} <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Parties</b> {{all over the}} country, caught the {{attention}} of the FBI. After a community-wide increase in support for the National Coalition to Combat Fascism (NCCF), the FBI drastically increased its monitoring of the group, doing what they believed was necessary, to defame and discredit the Panthers, {{in the best interest of}} the public. In 1971, the FBI developed a smear campaign intended to create problems between the Winston-Salem <b>Panther</b> <b>party,</b> and the national headquarters in Oakland, hoping that such dissonance would lead to the annihilation of the Winston-Salem chapter, although it did not. The FBI scrutiny did, however, lead to other problems for the chapter. Even minor infractions by the Panthers brought unwanted attention from the FBI. This often disrupted the group’s daily activities, and occasionally led to the arrests of group leaders.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{three people}} {{ran for the}} U.S. House of Representatives under the Peace and Freedom Party banner.

Patterson received 1,105 votes in Washington state's 2nd Congressional District. Late 1966 began a number of voter registration drives in various states {{with the intent to}} build a national party. Most notably in the San Francisco Bay Area and in Los Angeles county activists became deputy registrars of voters as peace organizers, anti-war veterans, and civil rights workers like Mario Savio took note of the founding of the <b>Black</b> <b>Panther</b> <b>Party's</b> founding in Oakland, California in October 1966.|$|R
