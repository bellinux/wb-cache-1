50|$|Flap steak, or flap meat (IMPS/NAMP 1185A, UNECE 2203) (also called sirloin tips in New England) is a beef steak cut. It {{comes from}} a bottom sirloin <b>butt</b> <b>cut</b> of beef, and is {{generally}} a very thin steak.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of fungal {{infection}} are readily recognized when timber is cut because a brown stain {{will appear on}} the <b>butt</b> <b>cut.</b> In early stages it will be just a spot in the heart wood, but as the disease advances it will extend most of the way around the heart wood, and in extreme cases may result in a hollow stump. Usually it is not observed more than a few feet above ground level.|$|E
50|$|The flap steak is {{sometimes}} confused with hanger steak (IMPS/NAMP 140, UNECE 2180) as both are usually cut thin. The item {{consists of the}} obliquus internus abdominis muscle from the bottom sirloin <b>butt.</b> The <b>cut</b> {{is sometimes}} inaccurately sold as skirt steak.|$|R
5000|$|Directed by Marcus Raboy, {{the video}} places Bubba and actor/comedian Bryan Callen as hosts for an {{infomercial}} promoting a female-targeted product that [...] "enhances" [...] their <b>butts.</b> It <b>cuts</b> to Bubba giving away the product door-to-door and {{in places like}} a chapel and a library, where the product takes effect. The video also features Shay [...] "Buckeey" [...] Johnson of Flavor of Love and Charm School fame.|$|R
60|$|Two {{or three}} mornings later they found on going out that two joints of venison {{had been carried}} off, and {{footprints}} in the snow showed {{that it had been}} done by a grizzly bear. This turned their attention again to the construction of a trap, which had not been thought of since the day it was first mentioned. A young tree of four or five inches in diameter was cut below and brought up. The <b>butt</b> was <b>cut</b> {{in the shape of a}} wedge, and this was driven strongly into a fissure in the rock. A rope with a running noose had been fastened to the tree, and this was bent down by the united strength of four men, and fixed to a catch fastened in the ground, the noose being kept open by two sticks placed across it.|$|R
40|$|Liquid water {{sorption}} in {{the longitudinal}} direction in wood samples of Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce) {{was measured with}} computed tomography (CT) scanning and image processing and then evaluated using multivariate discriminate analysis. The purpose {{was to determine if}} there were any differences in liquid water sorption that could be dependent on the vertical position within the tree (0. 8, 5. 8, and 9. 5 m from the <b>butt</b> <b>cut),</b> the growing site (dry or wet), and the type of tree (suppressed or dominant). Test pieces were CT scanned after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days of water sorption in end grain and during desorption at room temperature. The objective was to find wood suited to exterior use that is durable because it takes up water poorly. The conclusion was that heartwood of spruce absorbs less water than sapwood. Heartwood gradients were generally steeper, with a markedly lower moisture content than sapwood. The moisture content gradient profiles differed between the wet and dry sites during sorption and desorption in heartwood and sapwood. Whether or not the trees had been suppressed or dominant had no impact on the moisture content gradients. There was an indication that moisture content gradients in heartwood differed between the first and the second logs, but in sapwood there was no difference...|$|E
40|$|Trichinellosis is {{widespread}} {{around the world}} with different representatives of the genus Trichinella found in almost every continent. In Argentina the main source of transmission for the disease to humans is pig meat infected with Trichinella spiralis. The object of this work was to determine the distribution of Trichinella larvae in fresh meat cuts which are sold for human consumption and in the muscles traditionally used for the disease diagnosis at meat-packing plants. Cranial muscles to the last rib showed more Trichinella spiralis larvae than those with a caudal location (p 0. 05) between bilateral left and right muscles. Significant larval concentrations were found in the neck muscles, even in carcasses with a low parasitic load; these muscles are used to prepare cold meats (boston <b>butt).</b> Commercial <b>cuts</b> of meat had a substantial larval burdens in animals experimentally infected with 500 to 5, 000 Trichinella spiralis larvae, with parasite burdens similar to infection levels in muscles evaluated at the meat packing plant...|$|R
50|$|Todaka made an {{aggressive}} start, giving the veteran champion a challenging {{fight in the}} early rounds. Todaka {{may have been too}} aggressive, as a head <b>butt</b> opened a <b>cut</b> above Rojas' left eye in the 3rd round. The bleeding did not stop, and the ring doctor ended the fight in the 4th round. The rules stated that a stoppage by an unintentional head butt caused before the 4th round would become a draw, and Rojas retained his title with a draw. Both sides immediately agreed on a rematch, which took place on July 31, 1999, in Nagoya.|$|R
5000|$|What Goes Around {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 4 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "With two production showcase albums {{in just one}} year, Statik Selektah {{runs the risk of}} spreading himself thin, but there's no evidence on that on the prime What Goes Around. From the title track/hypeman opener to the brilliant, Beach Boys-borrowing closer [...] "God Knows" [...] with MCs Bun B, Jared Evan, and Pos from De La Soul, this scattered, roulette wheel-spin of an album offers club cuts, throwbacks, and sullen street numbers all of top quality. The flow of it all isn't perfect, but the short runtime for the tracks and the mixtape style of <b>butting</b> one <b>cut</b> right to the next make this feel like a purposeful whirlwind." [...] Andrew Gretchko of HipHopDX stated, [...] "If Extended Play was Statik Selektah’s way of stating that he could compete with Hip Hop’s best, What Goes Around… is his way of letting the world know that Hip Hop’s Golden Age is alive and well. And while the compilation deejay/producer album tends to have it’s sic share of woes as too many cooks spoil the broth, Statik Selektah balances out this tendency with solid production that invokes images of the days of Hip Hop yore." [...] Mark Bozzer of Exclaim! stated, [...] "If a negative {{can be found in the}} album, it's that due to the sheer amount of different emcees all clamouring for the mic, the album lacks a cohesiveness; however, who cares about that when you can easily bounce from banger to banger on this dope record? Statik continues to bring it and this album reaffirms that." ...|$|R
40|$|Heterobasidion annosum is an {{important}} pathogen, causing conifer root and butt rot. In Italy it attacks Pinus species both in mountain and in coastal plantations. Its diffusion is greatly enhanced during thinning, as its aerial inoculum germinates on new wounds or freshly <b>cut</b> <b>butts.</b> During thinning in the Castel Fusano Pinus pinea forest (Rome, Italy), in 2002 - 2005, a biological control trial was carried out for preventing new disease centres of a North American population of H. annosum, whose airborne spores were abundantly present. In particular, in February 2003 a suspension prepared with a native isolate of Phlebiopsis gigantea, previously studied in controlled environment, was applied on 23 butts. Observations on efficacy and persistence of the isolate in the treated stumps were carried out thirty months later. The pathogen was never detected in the stumps treated. Moreover, {{it was impossible to}} re-isolate from {{the upper part of the}} butts the P. gigantea individual isolate which had been profusely applied. These results confirm that the used isolate is an efficient biological control agent on P. pinea against the exotic isolates of H. annosum, and it is safe from an ecological point of view, as it does not trouble the natural succession of micro-organisms in butts...|$|R
