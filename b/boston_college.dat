5|$|<b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland. <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> {{eventually}} did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4–3) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat <b>Boston</b> <b>College,</b> and <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> beat Wake Forest. Under those circumstances, Florida State would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to <b>Boston</b> <b>College,</b> which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against <b>Boston</b> <b>College,</b> and both Florida State and <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State and Wake Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), and Wake Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} possession, <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> needed only seven plays and just under {{three minutes to}} travel 74yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback {{scramble}} for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had blocked the first <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> field goal attempt, again charged through the <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> offensive line and blocked the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced {{into the hands of}} Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 169 in favor of <b>Boston</b> <b>College.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the 15th contest between <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> and Virginia Tech and was their {{second of the}} 2007 season. The first meeting, {{which took place in}} 1993 in the Big East conference, {{resulted}} in a 4834 <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> win. Between 1993 and 2003, <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> and Virginia Tech played annually as part of their conference schedules. The teams did not meet in 2004 following Virginia Tech's move to the Atlantic Coast Conference. When <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> followed in 2005, the schools resumed meeting during the regular season, playing in 2005, 2006, and 2007.|$|E

5|$|To replace Jagodzinski, DeFillippo {{promoted}} <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> {{defensive coordinator}} Frank Spaziani, who previously {{served as the}} <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> head coach on an interim basis in 2006. <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> offensive coordinator Steve Logan, who was unhappy with the staff changes on the football team, resigned shortly after Spaziani's promotion. To replace Logan, Spaziani hired former Navy head coach Gary Tranquill as Boston College's new offensive coordinator. One week after Logan's announcement, the Eagles' offensive line coach, Jack Bicknell, Jr., also {{announced that he was}} leaving the team. On January 27, special teams and tight ends coach Don Yanowsky announced his resignation from the Eagles, making him the fourth coach to be fired or resign from the <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> football team after the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure applied by the <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boston</b> <b>College,</b> {{in their}} first {{possession}} of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> into a three-and-out possession {{that resulted in a}} punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E

5|$|Clemson {{lost its}} first real test, a conference game at 15th-ranked Georgia Tech, but {{recovered}} {{to win the}} following week against <b>Boston</b> <b>College.</b> The <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> win was Clemson's last for almost a month, however, as Clemson lost to nonconference opponent Texas Christian on September 26, then was defeated by ACC divisional foe Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> linebacker Mark Herzlich led {{all players}} with nine tackles. Of the nine stops, {{one and a}} half were for {{negative}} yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was Cody Grimm, who had eight tackles, two and a half of which were for losses. One and a half of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced a fumble and broke up one <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.|$|E

5|$|Maryland (ACC: 4–2) {{would have}} won the {{division}} title if they had either: (1) beaten both Florida State and Boston College; (2) beaten Florida State, while <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> lost to Wake Forest; or (3) beaten <b>Boston</b> <b>College,</b> while <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> lost to Wake Forest. That last scenario would have caused a three-way tie between Maryland, Florida State, and Wake Forest. All would have possessed a 5–3 conference record, and no head-to-head tiebreaker would have been possible. In that case, the winner would have been decided by divisional record, of which the Terrapins {{would have had the}} best (ACC Atlantic: 4–1).|$|E
5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first downs and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind {{the line of scrimmage}} and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points of the game and gave <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> a 70 lead with 4minutes remaining in the quarter.|$|E

After earning a quick first down, the Eagles were stopped and forced to punt. With 2:13 remaining before halftime, the Hokies had one more offensive opportunity.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> drive {{began on}} its own 35-yard line. With little time remaining, <b>Boston</b> <b>College</b> would have to {{complete}} one or more Hail Mary passes.
