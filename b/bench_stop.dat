40|$|Mining method {{selection}} lies at {{the basis}} of every mining operation and is essential for maximizing economic return. Especially in the current market with decreasing metal prices selecting the right method {{can mean the difference}} between a viable and a non-viable operation. More importantly the right mining method increases the safety of employees and secures the production. The Kylylahti underground copper mine, owned by Altona Mining ltd. is located in Northern-Karelia, Finland. This deposit consists of two orebodies, the upper Wallaby and the lower Wombat. Longitudinal <b>bench</b> <b>stoping</b> is proposed for the Wallaby and Wombat orebodies. The Wallaby orebody is currently mined using the proposed method. However, different orebody characteristics suggest a more suitable mining method for the Wombat orebody. This work determines the mining method which maximizes economic return for the Wombat orebody. This is a three phase process. First phase is the mining method selection on technical suitability to the orebody; for which two methods are. The UBC method is applied first resulting in the selection of the area of sublevel stoping methods. Later a new technique is introduced to optimize the mining method selection process and to control the wide spectrum of mineral deposits. This technique is called the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process approach and is based on Multiple Criteria Decision Making. Six factors specifically applicable to the Kylylahti mine are used as input for the approach resulting in transverse <b>bench</b> <b>stoping</b> as the most suitable method for the Wombat orebody. In the subsequent phase, the rock mass properties of the ore zone and the host rock masses are calculated using the Q-classification method. These values are combined with the results of in situ stress measurements to determine the stability of the open stopes at different depths. Dimensions of the stopes are determined depending on the resulting stability limits on stope height, width and length. Applying these stope limits a preliminary mine design was made, resulting in a reserve estimation of 3. 4 Mt of ore in place. This gives a life of mine of 6 years and 3 months for the Kylylahti mine using transverse <b>bench</b> <b>stoping.</b> The combination of all obtained data is the input for the financial analysis phase for the Wombat orebody; comparing the proposed longitudinal <b>bench</b> <b>stoping</b> to transverse <b>bench</b> <b>stoping,</b> as recommended in this thesis. The sensitivity of the net present value to metal price is investigated in two different metal price forecasting scenarios resulting in an economic return. In both scenarios transverse <b>bench</b> <b>stoping</b> maximized the economic return delivering $ 52 million and $ 63 million extra profit at the end of mine life.

5000|$|Two plain clothes Vancouver Police Department {{officers}} {{arrived on}} the scene in an unmarked car in response to this 911 call. They reported that Boyd was calm and that there were only two men at the scene, Boyd who had stood up from a kneeling position and a second man, still sitting on the bus <b>stop</b> <b>bench</b> and also calm. There was no third man nor any evidence of an assault having taken place. However, one of the officers reported that he saw a hammer in Boyd's hand and, without identifying himself as a police officer, drew his weapon and ordered Boyd to drop the hammer and lie down, which he did. As the other officer approached Boyd in an attempt to handcuff him, he sprang up and struck the officer on the temple causing him to fall down bleeding from a wound to the head. Early reports from the Vancouver Police stated that this officer was unconscious but the officer's evidence was that he was never unconscious and got to his feet almost immediately. Regarding the alleged hammer, at the Coroner's Inquest into Boyd's death the man who had been sitting on the bus <b>stop</b> <b>bench</b> testified that he saw no hammer in Boyd's hand. An ordinary household claw hammer was found on the sidewalk at the scene but it was not tested forensically to determine who had handled it. Although the police press release on the day after his death stated that he had struck the officer with a bicycle chain with a lock attached, {{there is no evidence that}} this was the case (see the discussion of the physical and forensic evidence in the next paragraph). The wound suffered by the officer was a scalp wound and there was no injury to the skull or sign of concussion which is inconsistent with an injury caused by a heavy swung chain. Indeed, the Criminal Justice Branch in 2010 stated that [...] "he struck the officer with a chain or other object." [...] There was no suggestion as to what this other object might have been. The wound was not inconsistent with a blow from a closed fist, especially from someone as muscular as Boyd.|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{cooperation}} {{research is to}} determine the conditions under which individuals invest in a public good. Here, we tested whether cues of being watched increase investments in an anonymous public good situation in real life. We examined whether individuals would invest more by removing experimentally placed garbage (paper and plastic bottles) from bus <b>stop</b> <b>benches</b> in Geneva in the presence of images of eyes compared to controls (images of flowers). We provided separate bins for each of both types of garbage to investigate whether individuals would deposit more items into the appropriate bin in the presence of eyes. The treatment had no effect on the likelihood that individuals present at the bus stop would remove garbage. However, those individuals that engaged in garbage clearing, and were thus likely affected by the treatment, invested more time {{to do so in the}} presence of eyes. Images of eyes had a direct effect on behaviour, rather than merely enhancing attention towards a symbolic sign requesting removal of garbage. These findings show that simple images of eyes can trigger reputational effects that significantly enhance on non-monetary investments in anonymous public goods under real life conditions. We discuss our results in the light of previous findings and suggest that human social behaviour may often be shaped by relatively simple and potentially unconscious mechanisms instead of very complex cognitive capacities...|$|R

Although most {{of the film is}} set in Alabama, filming took place mainly in and around Beaufort, South Carolina, as well as parts of coastal Virginia and North Carolina, {{including}} a running shot on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Downtown portions of the fictional town of Greenbow were filmed in Varnville, South Carolina. The scene of Forrest running through Vietnam while under fire was filmed on Fripp Island, South Carolina. Additional filming took place on the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, and along the Blue Ridge Parkway near Boone, North Carolina. The most notable place was Grandfather Mountain where a part of the road is named [...] "Forrest Gump Curve". The Gump family home set was built along the Combahee River near Yemassee, South Carolina, and the nearby land was used to film Curran's home {{as well as some of}} the Vietnam scenes.

5000|$|In the meantime, two uniformed {{officers}} had arrived. Boyd grappled {{with one of}} them and then attempted to flee the scene. The other uniformed officer, Constable Lee Chipperfield, drew his weapon and began shooting. There were reports from the police, released to the media on August 14, 2007, that Boyd had begun swinging a bicycle chain with a lock attached after he struck the plain clothes officer. However, subsequent forensic DNA tests failed to show that he had been swinging this chain. The only DNA on the chain was that of the officer who had been struck. Since there was no blood or hair on the chain, it is likely that this DNA resulted from the careless handling of the evidence after the incident—without being put into an evidence bag, it was thrown into the front seat well of the unmarked police car in which the injured officer had arrived at the scene. Only one of the officers involved could describe this chain and he stated that it seemed to be [...] "a chain-saw chain with a heavy block of metal attached". The officer who described this chain had handled it himself apparently did not understand the difference between a chain-saw chain, each of whose links has a sharp blade attached (and would cause severe cuts if handled with bare hands) and an ordinary bicycle chain. The [...] "heavy block of metal" [...] was a small padlock. Civilian witnesses described Boyd swinging an object variously described as a belt, a purse, a rope, or a chain, but none described the bicycle chain that the VPD had alleged he was swinging. Many of the witnesses said that the object being swung was a light object about 18" [...] long but others described a long heavy object. Some described an object (e.g. a purse or wallet) attached {{to the end of a}} chain but others insisted that there was nothing attached to the end of the chain. There were two chains found at the scene, a loop of bicycle chain 88" [...] in length with a 2"x2" [...] padlock attached and a light link chain, 22" [...] in length, described by a civilian witness and a police officer as being [...] "made of paperclips". It was this smaller chain that the witness sitting on the bus <b>stop</b> <b>bench</b> described precisely and testified that Boyd was swinging. This smaller chain was not tested by forensic analysis to confirm or deny this.|$|R
