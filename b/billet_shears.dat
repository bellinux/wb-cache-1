50|$|The First to {{have set}} up a rolling mill not only on the railways, but {{probably}} in the country in 1870. It had 3 mills, steam driven Power hammer, fish plate machine, <b>billet</b> <b>shears,</b> the mill was driven by steam from boilers placed {{on the top of the}} furnaces and heated by gas from the furnaces. It produced about 400 tons of rounds, channels, angles and fishplates per month.|$|E

Many processing factors must be controlled in the bicycle chain wheel. This study employed the rigid-plastic finite element (FE) DEFORM TM 3 D software to investigate the plastic deformation behavior of an aluminum alloy workpiece as it is forged for bicycle chain wheels. Factors include the temperature of the forging <b>billet,</b> <b>shear</b> friction factor, temperature of die and punch speed control all parameters. Moreover, this study used the Taguchi method and Genetic algorithm neural networks to determine the most favorable optimization parameters. Finally, our results confirmed the suitability of the proposed design, which enabled a bicycle chain wheel die to achieve perfect forging during finite element testing...|$|R
40|$|Dipl. -Ing. C. Silbernagel is a {{research}} assistant of the IFUM Summary This paper represents the opportunity to establish the precision forging process as a suitable manufacturing method for helical gear wheels, using an innovative tool concept and an intelligent process design by FEM-simulation. Based on the simulation and implemented subroutines, this study shows a process design and optimisation {{as well as the}} prediction of the expected microstructure in the early stadium of process development. The represented precision forging process can be more than an alternative manufacturing method, especially in cost and time reducing respects, because of the use of lower-cost <b>sheared</b> <b>billets,</b> short cycle times and a reduced use of grinding operations. 1...|$|R
