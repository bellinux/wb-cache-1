5|$|A silver jubilee {{event was}} held on 7 October 2014 in Hyderabad, where Nagarjuna {{announced}} that Siva digitised version would be released on 17 October 2014 on nearly 100 screens. In April 2015, Varma told Indo-Asian News Service that the digitised release was postponed until 15 May because of restoration delays. In September Nagarjuna said that a sequel to Siva would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> alternative to a digitised version, and proposed a film about Siva, Asha, and their two sons. Advising Varma to develop a script, he asked the director to cast Amala, Naga Chaitanya and Akhil Akkineni. The sequel would reportedly be produced by Annapurna Studios.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose {{from the sale of}} Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra money that supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E

5|$|The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega {{planned to}} release in fall 1995, with the retail price {{planned to be}} {{something}} less than US$200. Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced {{too close to the}} Saturn to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> competitor. Electronic Gaming Monthly used the Sega Neptune as an April Fools' Day prank in its April 2001 issue. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, the Sounds and Nashville SC, an {{expansion}} soccer {{team of the}} United Soccer League, reached a one-year agreement for Nashville SC to play its inaugural 2018 season at First Tennessee Park. Fan support of the team's games {{is expected to be}} a factor in Nashville's bid for a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise. If the city was to be awarded an MLS team, First Tennessee Park would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> location as the league requires soccer-specific stadiums for new franchises. Instead, the team would play at a new stadium, such as the 30,000-seat facility proposed for the Nashville Fairgrounds. Nashville SC is expected to play its first home game as early as March 2018.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Democratic National Convention {{was held}} in July in St. Louis, Missouri, then also hosting the 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics. Parker's mentor David B. Hill—having {{attempted}} and failed to capture the nomination himself at the 1892 convention—now led the campaign for his protege's nomination. William Jennings Bryan, who had been nominated but defeated by William McKinley in both 1896 and 1900, was no longer considered by delegates to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> alternative. Radicals in the party supported publisher William Randolph Hearst but lacked sufficient numbers to secure the nomination due to opposition from Bryan and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York political machine. Small clusters of delegates pledged support to other candidates, including Missouri Senator Francis Cockrell; Richard Olney, Grover Cleveland's Secretary of State; Edward C. Wall, a former Wisconsin State Representative; and George Gray, a former Senator from Delaware. Other delegates spoke of nominating Cleveland, who had already served two nonconsecutive terms, but Cleveland was no longer popular outside the party or even within it, due to his rift with Bryan.|$|E
