5|$|Operation <b>Brevity</b> was {{a limited}} {{offensive}} conducted in mid-May 1941, during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. Conceived by the commander-in-chief of the British Middle East Command, General Archibald Wavell, <b>Brevity</b> {{was intended to}} be a rapid blow against weak Axis front-line forces in the Sollum–Capuzzo–Bardia area of the border between Egypt and Libya. Although the operation got off to a promising start, throwing the Axis high command into confusion, most of its early gains were lost to local counter-attacks, and with German reinforcements being rushed to the front the operation was called off after one day.|$|E
5|$|Operation <b>Brevity</b> {{would be}} carried out by the 22nd Guards Brigade and {{elements}} of the 7th Armoured Division. Its armoured component consisted of 29 cruiser tanks of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2RTR) and 24 infantry tanks of the 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4RTR). The Royal Air Force (RAF) allocated all available fighters and a small force of bombers to the operation.|$|E
5|$|The French Overseas Minister, Christian Estrozy and French Prime Minister, Francois Fillon visited French Caribbean {{island to}} assess the storm's damage. They {{estimated}} the storm left 600people homeless. The <b>brevity</b> of their visit prompted some of Martinique's famous writers, including Edouard Glissant, Patrick Chamoiseau and Raphael Confiant, to write an open letter airing their grievances concerning French politics and the handling of Hurricane Dean's impact.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{commercial}} failure, and Looking Glass ceased its self-publishing operations after its release. Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was leveled against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its <b>brevity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Escape from Butcher Bay {{was praised}} by critics, who lauded its {{graphics}} and its implementation of stealth, action and adventure elements. However, they commonly lamented its <b>brevity</b> {{and lack of}} multiplayer components. The game {{went on to win}} several accolades, including the Golden Joystick Award for Unsung Hero Game of the Year and the Spike Video Game Award for Best Game Based on a Movie. An enhanced remake of the game, included in , was released in 2009.|$|E
5|$|For the game's halftime show, the Orange Bowl hosted American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Goo Goo Dolls. Reviews criticized the performance for awkward staging and <b>brevity,</b> {{as the group}} performed only two songs. Middle {{school and high school}} dance squads also participated in the halftime show, performaing on the field while the Goo Goo Dolls played. Pregame media coverage erroneously reported that Stanford's marching band, which had been scheduled to perform, was banned from the field. The band had never been scheduled to perform at halftime; each team's marching band was allotted a six-minute pregame performance.|$|E

5|$|General Archibald Wavell—the {{commander-in-chief}} of the British Middle East Command—conceived Operation <b>Brevity</b> as a rapid blow in the Sollum area. Wavell {{intended to}} create advantageous conditions {{from which to}} launch Operation Battleaxe, the main offensive that he was planning for June. Operation Brevity's primary objectives were to recapture the Halfaya Pass, to drive the enemy from the Sollum and Capuzzo areas, and to deplete Rommel's forces. A secondary objective was to advance toward Tobruk, although {{only as far as}} supplies would allow, and without risking the force committed to the operation.|$|E

Media consultant Anita Dunn was slated to be given a promotion and replaced as the Friends of Evan Bayh committee was formed, but the campaign's <b>brevity</b> prevented any notable action. Dunn would go on to serve as President Barack Obama's interim-White House Communications Director, replaced by another Bayh campaign employee, Daniel Pfeiffer, who currently holds the post.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian <b>brevity,</b> a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations {{of the meaning of}} the poem. Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple <b>brevity</b> or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools, rather than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with {{the appointment of a}} superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912. It shares with Katingal Special Security Unit in New South Wales the record for <b>brevity</b> of use of a permanent Australian penal structure.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1977, Sayers was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of a Monday night game, the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, which comprised the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1994, Sayers was selected for the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 1999, despite the <b>brevity</b> of his career, he was ranked 22nd on The Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.|$|E

5|$|Operation <b>Brevity</b> {{failed to}} achieve most of its objectives, {{succeeding}} only in retaking the Halfaya Pass. The British lost five tanks destroyed and a further 13 were damaged but the tank regiments suffered no losses in personnel. Total casualties amounted to at least 206 men. The 1st Durham Light Infantry suffered the most during the operation losing 196 men killed, wounded or captured. The 2nd Scots Guards lost one man killed and four wounded, the 3rd Coldstream Guards lost one man killed and the 11th Hussars suffered four men wounded. Losses among the 2nd Rifle Brigade are unknown. German casualties numbered three tanks (a Panzer II and two Panzer IIIs, although several more suffered minor damage) and 258 men killed, wounded or captured. Jack Greene and Alessandro Massignani place total Italian losses at 395. Allied accounts record the capture of 347 of these men.|$|E
5|$|Rymdkapsel is a 2013 minimalist {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} by indie developer Grapefrukt, the studio of Martin Jonasson. Players build {{a space station}} using tetromino pieces while managing resources and minions, defending against attacks, and extending the base towards four monoliths {{at the edges of}} the level. The game was built over a year and a half and was inspired by the base-building aspects of the Command & Conquer series. It was Jonasson's first full game as an indie developer. Rymdkapsel was released on May 7, 2013 for PlayStation Mobile, and was later ported to iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. Reviewers gave the game generally favorable reviews, where they appreciated its simplicity and challenge, but not its <b>brevity</b> and slow start.|$|E
5|$|While the {{majority}} of the division was in Crete, the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment, which had not been sent to Greece, was detached to the British 7th Armoured Brigade and subsequently took part in Operation <b>Brevity</b> in the Western Desert in May. Following the evacuation of Crete, while the 6th Division began rebuilding in Palestine, the cavalry was allocated {{to take part in the}} bloody but successful attack on Vichy French forces in the Syria–Lebanon campaign. Two depleted infantry battalions from the 17th Brigade– the 2/3rd and 2/5th– were also committed and subsequently took part in the drive on Damascus in mid-June. They were later joined by the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and together they fought through the campaign until the French capitulated in mid-July. In the process they suffered 168 casualties; total 6th Division casualties for the Syrian campaign amounted to 39 killed and 129 wounded.|$|E
50|$|Warner Brothers {{released}} {{several of}} these between 1953 and 1964. Although the trade periodicals like Film Daily and BoxOffice (magazine) occasionally listed the two-reel “Warner Specials” (actually Technicolor Specials and Broadway <b>Brevities)</b> as “featurettes”, the term usually applied to Warner shorts lasting a full half hour or longer.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The <b>brevity</b> of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. Boletus xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as Boletus purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano Alessio to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the <b>brevity</b> of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of Boletus rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (both now placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, and that this was the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Episode III was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura. Having previous {{contributed to the}} score of Episode II by composing the cimenatic tracks, Kajiura was brought back to compose the entire score. Despite the increased work load of handling an entire game's soundtrack, Kajiura found the difficulty similar to the work she did on Episode II. She drew inspiration from the game's artwork and impression of the setting when creating the score. Takahashi, {{in addition to his}} other roles in production, acted as coordinator for the score. A soundtrack album titled Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, featuring selections from the game's score, was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album's <b>brevity</b> was {{due to the fact that}} the full soundtrack would have taken up six CDs, and so Kajiura was asked by sound producer Keiichi Nozaki to create samples for a two-disc release.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} standards were usually first rate (since {{the same company}} made the popular Broadway <b>Brevities</b> and Melody Masters), but the success of an individual film depended on both the talent of the performers and the writers involved. Also many titles were filmed indoors with fewer outdoor action scenes than many California produced comedy shorts.|$|R
