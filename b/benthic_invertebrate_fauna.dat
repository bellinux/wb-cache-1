40|$|The {{work for}} this thesis was {{undertaken}} in Broke Inlet, a seasonally-open estuary {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia and the only estuary in that region which is regarded as “near-pristine” (Commonwealth of Australia, 2002). The only previous seasonal studies of the environmental and biotic characteristics of this estuary involved broad-based descriptions of the trends in salinity, temperature and ichthyofaunal characteristics at {{a limited number of}} sites. Furthermore, no attempt has been made to identify statistically the range of habitats present in the nearshore and offshore waters of this system, and the extents to which the characteristics of the fish and <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>faunas</b> are related to habitat type. These types of data provide not only reliable inventories of the habitat and faunal characteristics of Broke Inlet, but also a potential basis for predicting the likely impact of anthropogenic and climatic changes in Broke Inlet in the future. The main aims of this thesis were as follows. (1) To use the method of Valesini et al. (2010), which employs enduring environmental characteristics, to identify quantitatively the range of habitats present throughout the nearshore and offshore waters of Broke Inlet. The enduring environmental characteristics represent three broad categories, i. e. the location of any site in terms of its proximity to marine and freshwater sources, the degree of exposure to wave activity and the type of substrate and/or submerged vegetation. (2) To test the hypothesis that the species richness, density, diversity and species compositions of the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate faunas differ among habitat types, seasons and, {{in the case of the}} fish fauna, also years. (3) To test the hypothesis that the pattern of relative differences among habitat types, as exhibited by their faunal compositions, is correlated with that defined by their (i) enduring environmental characteristics and (ii) non-enduring environmental characteristics (water physico-chemical variables and sediment characteristics). A high resolution satellite image and a digital elevation model of Broke Inlet were used to measure the enduring environmental characteristics at 104 and 36 widely-distributed sites in nearshore and offshore waters, respectively. These data were used to construct separate Manhattan distance matrices for nearshore and offshore waters, which were then subjected to the CLUSTER and SIMPROF routines in PRIMER v 6 to identify the various groups of sites that did not differ significantly in their environmental characteristics and which were thus considered to represent habitat types. Twelve and four distinct habitat types were identified in nearshore and offshore waters, respectively. The ichthyofaunas at sites representing 11 nearshore (A-K) and three offshore (A-C) habitat types were sampled seasonally for two consecutive years using seine and gill nets, respectively.

40|$|According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{the status}} of European surface waters is {{assessed}} using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30 %), coastal waters (26 %), lakes (25 %) and transitional waters (19 %). More {{than half of the}} methods are based on macroscopic plants (28 %) or <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> (26 %); in addition, phytoplankton (21 %), fish (15 %) and phytobenthos (10 %) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: Small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton > phytobenthos > macroscopic plants > <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> > fish <b>fauna.</b> The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants > <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> > phytoplankton > phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range (0. 8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton > macroscopic plants > <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> > phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters > lakes > transitional waters > rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches.

A total of 23 genera of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna</b> belonging to 6 groups viz., Polychaetes, Bivalve, Gastropod, Amphipod, Isopod and Tanaidacian were recorded during the study.

40|$|Abstract In {{accordance}} with the Water Framework Directive guidelines (WFD, 2000, European Communities Official Journal L 327 2000 / 60 /EC), classification schemes and ecological evaluation tools (based on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna</b> data sets from 1990 to 2002) were applied in the lower Mondego estuary. Two distinct scenarios could be tested due {{to the implementation of}} mitigation practices in 1999, following a long eutrophication process, which started by the early 1980 s. Some discrepancies in the results were found by the application of the different indices. The AMBI index (accounting for taxonomic composition) and the ABC method (accounting for abundance and biomass k-dominance patterns) classifications often disagreed with those based on species diversity (Margalef and Shannon-Wiener). The ambiguous results made the classification a complex task to achieve, contrary to the Directive’s objective of maintaining it simple and clear. Our results suggest the necessity of adjusting some of the indices and their ranges to estuarine characteristics, namely to account the typical dominance and abundance of some particular species. These aspects are not taken into consideration by some of the indices proposed, which are more adapted to typical marine conditions. Based on our results, these widely applied indices might still improve their efficiency in estuarine systems allowing their use in the resembling types already established within the new Directive agenda.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{remoteness}} of the Trindade and Martin Vaz young volcanic archipelago (TMV) {{raises questions}} about the source of its marine benthic fauna and levels of endemism. Addressing these questions requires a comprehensive knowledge of the taxonomic composition of the marine fauna of the islands. A five-year survey in the shallow marine waters (up to 30 m) and a literature review on the data published for TMV have been conducted to document the biodiversity of the benthic fauna. Here we report on ten new records of decapod crustaceans from TMV: Gnathophyllum americanum and Thor amboinensis are circumtropical in distribution, whereas Stenopus hispidus, Gnathophylloides mineri and Parribacus antarcticus are disjunct circumtropical species as their distribution in the Atlantic Ocean is limited eastwardly to TMV or Ascension Island (S. hispidus), therefore, do not extending into the eastern Atlantic. Gnathophyllum circellum and Thor manningi are western Atlantic species, with G. circellum previously known only from the Caribbean Sea. Pontonia manningi, Tuleariocaris neglecta and Enoplometopus antillensis are amphi-Atlantic in distribution. Two of the above species are recorded from the southwestern Atlantic for the first time: Gnathophyllum circellum and Tuleariocaris neglecta. These new records corroborate that the marine <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna</b> of the TMV archipelago is actually a mosaic of amphi-Atlantic, eastern Atlantic, central Atlantic (insular), endemic and circumtropical species, with a strong western Atlantic component...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of carbon pathways in New Zealand streams {{was carried out}} using a multi-faceted, experimental approach. A series of research projects, presented as individual papers, was conducted with special emphasis on consumer processing. Breakdown of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortiodes) enclosed in coarse-mesh (3 mm) and fine-mesh (0. 2 mm) bags was studied in two physically contrasting streams. Weight losses were most rapid in coarse-mesh bags held in Middle Bush Stream, a relatively stable stream with a large shredder population. The rate of leaf breakdown in coarsemesh bags in Craigieburn Cutting Stream {{was similar to that}} In fine-mesh bags buried in both streams. Leaves in bags buried in the beds of both streams lost weight more slowly than their surface counterparts and had slightly lower protein levels and respiration rates. Larvae of the caddisfly, Zelandopsyche ingens, were primarily responsible for the rapid disappearance of beech leaves In Middle Bush Stream. Cage experiments demonstrated that larvae grew and survived equally well in both streams and the absence of Z. ingens from the Craigieburn Cutting Stream benthos was attributed to the inability of the stream to retain coarse particulate organic matter inputs. Retention appears to be the key to shredder distribution and abundance and hence is a major factor controlling litter breakdown. The development, structure and utilisation of stone surface organic layers was investigated at two field sites in dark and natural lighting conditions. In the dark at the forest site an organic layer consisting of slime, fine particles, bacteria and fungi developed and attained maximum biomass (0. 08 mg. cm- 2) in about two months. In the dark at the spring site where water was low in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOC level < 0. 5 g. m- 3) no organic layer developed whereas under conditions of natural lighting at both sites, layers were dominated by diatoms and/or filamentous algae. Laboratory experiments demonstrated the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a prerequisite for layer formation. Uptake by micro-organisms accounted for most of the reduction in levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) recorded in recirculating stream channels. Radiotracer experiments (14 C and 144 Ce) showed that several common stream invertebrates could feed on "heterotrophic layers" (assimilation efficiencies 18 to 74 %) and suggested that the non-autotrophic components of stone surface organic layers are likely to playa significant role in carbon transfer to the benthos, particularly in small, shaded streams. Utilisation of allochthonous and autochthonous inputs by <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> was investigated using stable carbon isotope analysis. The faunas of small, forested streams depended primarily on allochthonous sources of carbon whereas variable utilisation of allochthonous and autochthonous materials was shown by species from a grassland stream. Relatively depleted 13 C values obtained for the mayfly Deleatidium taken from forested sites suggest that its larvae assimilate algae selectively. A shift to greater dependence on autochthonous energy sources was shown by invertebrates from small recently clear-cut catchments (1 - 4 years) in response to canopy removal and flushing of forest-derived organic materials. Although only of a preliminary nature, my results suggest that stable carbon isotope analysis is a useful technique for providing insights into trophic linkages within stream communities. Finally, the influence of physical factors and forest type on the distribution of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>faunas</b> in 43 New Zealand streams was investigated using a systematised survey technique. Several common taxa were numerically dominant at most sites regardless of forest type and both distribution of shredders and faunal diversity were related to stream stability. Implications of these findings for forest-stream management are discussed. In general, New Zealand stream ecosystems are viewed as being strongly dominated by physical factors which determine and limit the framework within. which biological communities can function. Integration of the mass-balance and intra-system approaches to carbon processing is suggested as the logical way to promote understanding of carbon flows to, from and within stream ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} in external phosphorus load to Lake Ringsjön during the 1980 s, {{did not result}} in improved water transparency during the following ten-year period. Furthermore, a fish-kill in the Eastern Basin of the lake, in addition to a cyprinid reduction programme (biomanipulation; 1988 – 1992), in contrast to theory, did not lead to any increase in zooplankton biomass or size. This absence of response in the pelagic food chain may have been attributed to the increase in abundance of YOY (0 +) fish, following the fish reduction programme. Despite the lack of effect on zooplankton, there was a decrease in phytoplankton biomass, a change in species composition and an increase in water transparency following biomanipulation. In 1989, one year after the fish-kill in Eastern Basin, the Secchi depth (summer mean) increased from 60 cm to 110 cm. In the following years, water transparency increased further, despite an increase in phosphorus loading. An unexpected effect of the biomanipulation was an increase in benthic invertebrate and staging waterfowl abundances, which occurred 2 – 4 years after fish reduction. Hence, the response in the benthic community following biomanipulation was considerably stronger than in the pelagic community. A likely explanation is that {{reduction in}} abundance of the benthic feeding fish species bream (Abramis brama), strongly affected the <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna.</b> In this paper, we present what we believe happened in Lake Ringsjön, and which processes are likely to have been important at various stages of the restoration process...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} contrasting surface primary production on the benthic invertebrate megafauna at four sites on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The sites, designated NW, NE, SW and SE, were located {{to the west and}} east of the Ridge axis and to the north and south of the Charlie–Gibbs Fracture Zone. Benthic megafauna were sampled in 2007 and 2009 with a semi-balloon otter trawl, at a target depth of 2, 500 m. The total biomass and density of major taxonomic groups did not differ significantly between sites, despite those to the north being characterised by greater surface productivity than those to the south. However, the density and biomass of individual taxonomic groups, as well as diversity and body size, all showed significant differences between sites. Diversity was highest at the SE, and lowest at the NE site. Most species were larger to the north. Community composition was significantly different between all sites, with the greatest number of unique species found at the SE, and noticeably fewer unique species at the northern sites. There was no clear correlation between the surface productivity and community structure, suggesting complex ecological controls on the communities. It is speculated that, in addition to the energy supply, drivers such as strong currents and sediment characteristics, {{play an important role in}} shaping the communities at the different sites. To what extent the ridge acts as a dispersal barrier for <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna</b> remains unclear. However, high numbers of species unique to the southern site suggest a limited dispersal between the northern and southern areas...|$|E

40|$|The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is {{the fastest}} warming region in Antarctica where climate impact on the cold-adapted marine {{ecosystem}} is already visible. To monitor faunal changes in remote vast bodies of Antarctic waters, efficient and informative tools are essential. High-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as one such tool for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystems, as it increases detection sensitivity of taxa, and sampling is often simpler and less costly than traditional collection methods. We collected water samples from four WAP shallow (≤  300  m) shelf regions, recovered the eDNA therein, and performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing and analyses to determine {{the effectiveness of this}} method to assess marine benthic faunal diversity; this includes the detection of deep-water predatory king crabs whose potential shoreward expansion to warming shelves has sparked much concern. Using a customized bioinformatics pipeline, we identified abundant signatures of common <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna,</b> endemic notothenioid fishes, as well as lithodid king crabs. We also uncovered species richness and diversity comparable to biological inventories compiled by the use of traditional survey methods, supporting the efficacy of the eDNA shotgun sequencing approach. As the rate of eDNA degradation affects faunal detection sensitivity, we also quantified mitochondrial ND 2 gene copies in eDNA derived from a WAP icefish and found ND 2 copies persisted to at least 20  days in the cold WAP water, much longer than values reported for temperate environments. We propose that eDNA metagenomic sequencing complements traditional sampling, and combining both will enable more inclusive biodiversity detection and faunal change monitoring in the vast Southern Ocean...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied a}} benthic {{invertebrate}} assemblage {{of a stream}} that passes through pristine, rural, suburban and urban areas of a municipality located in southeastern Brazil to investigate a possible relationship between this assemblage structure and urbanization. The environmental variables and fauna structure were analyzed in a spatial and temporal scale, sampling the four sites in a dry and wet season. We found a clear spatial pattern, with higher similarity between sites from rural and suburban area that presented intermediate environmental characteristics. The pristine site showed in both seasons the lowest values of alkalinity and fecal coliform. On the other hand, the site located in the urban area showed the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen and higher of suspended solids, ammonia and fecal coliform. The extreme values of these three variables occurred in the wet season, probably related to the high rainfall values. The <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna</b> structure followed the same longitudinal and seasonal pattern found for the environmental variables. The site in urban area showed the lowest richness, diversity and evenness, with a dominance of two groups resistant to adverse environmental conditions (Oligochaeta and Orthocladiinae) and absence of more sensitive groups (Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The increase drag of the substrate and associated invertebrates can {{be responsible for the}} lower abundance and richness observed in the wet season. The environmental variables that best defined the differentiation between sites (dissolved oxygen, organic suspended solids and fecal coliform) related directly to urbanization effects, like dump effluents and removal of riparian vegetation. | Supporting Information Supporting Information </supplementary-material...|$|E
40|$|Stratospheric ozone {{depletion}} over Antarctica {{is expected to}} continue for the next 50 years, with increases in ecologically damaging ultraviolet radiation (UVR: 290 – 400 nm), specifically the ultraviolet-B (UVB: 290 – 320 nm) portion of the spectrum. Most of coastal Antarctica is covered with 2 – 3 m of annual sea ice during the occurrence of the ‘‘ozone hole. ’ ’ This physical barrier to UVR transmission has long been assumed to provide complete protection from the biologically damaging effects of UVR, especially for the planktonic developmental stages of the <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> <b>fauna.</b> We found that short-wavelength UVB (down to 304 nm) is transmitted through the Austral spring annual ice of McMurdo Sound, and causes significant mortality and DNA damage in the embryos of the sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri. Although mortality of sea urchin embryos has been reported for the open waters of the Antarctic, this is the first documentation of mortality and DNA damage for embryos under the annual sea ice. The degree of mortality and DNA damage was dependent on both year and depth, with higher mortality and DNA damage at 1 m depth below the ice compared to 3 m and 5 m. Greater DNA damage occurred in 2003 compared to 2002 despite the thicker annual ice (3. 1 m vs. 2. 5 m). Although the thickness of the annual ice was greater, the severity of the ozone hole, 230 Dobson units (DU) versus 320 DU, and the ratio of UVB to visible radiation was greater in 2003.

We describe the abundance of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and sediment characteristics in main channel habitats in the lower Columbia River and examine the relationships between densities of specific <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> and sediment characteristics and water depth. Using a 0. 1 -m- 2 Van Veen grab sampler, we collected benthic samples in seven areas of the river from River Kilometer (RKm) 121 to 211 in April and September 1988 and 1989. Common taxa collected, included Turbellaria, Oligochaeta, the bivalve Corbicula fluminea, the amphipod Corophium salmonis, Chironomidae larvae, and Ceratopogonidae larvae. Overall, Corbicula fluminea and Ceratopogonidae larvae were consistently the most abundant <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> The relationship of <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> densities between and within years, months, and areas varied substantially between the six predominant taxa. The effect of water depth and sediment characteristics on <b>benthic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> densities, after accounting for the influence of year, month, and area, varied between the six predominant taxa in this study. Water depth was significant (P ltoreq 0. 05) for densities {{of three of the}} six taxa, sediment percent silt/clay significant for four, and sediment grain size and percent volatile solids significant for one each. Results from our study are probably applicable to a large area of main channel habitats in the Columbia River downstream from the lowermost dam.
