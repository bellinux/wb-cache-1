50|$|The 90 degree V8 engine has part-hemispherical {{combustion}} chambers with two overhead valves per cylinder operated by push-rods {{from a single}} chain-driven camshaft positioned centrally {{high up in the}} vee. Aluminium alloy pistons with steel connecting rods run in a cast chrome-iron block with sand-cast high-tensile light alloy heads and crankcase housing a short stiff dynamically balanced crankshaft carried on five bearings. The nose of the crankshaft carries a torsional vibration damper, a four-bladed fan, and the pulley for the triangulated thin belt drive for the dynamo and water pump. The dynamo is located between the cylinder blocks. At the rear the drive is taken {{from the back of the}} camshaft for the distributor positioned high above the unit behind the two semi-downdraught SU carburettors. There is a separate exhaust system for each bank of cylinders. Light alloy is used for the valve covers, tappet blocks, sump and inlet manifolds. Cooling is by pump and fan with a thermostatic <b>by-pass</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} report describes investigations on {{the operating}} and control behaviour of closed-cycle HU-Helium turbine plants. The aim of these investigations is {{to prove that the}} requirements of the grid can be met by the power plant without undue operating conditions. This study refers to a non-integrated and an integrated design of a singleeshafteplant. For comparison the behaviour of anadequate split-shaft-arrangement is opposed. Essentialiy the following control modes are regarded: - Gas injection and discharge at various points of the circuit, - opening and closing of by-passes, control of losseofeload from Full Ioad with the aid of by-passes. The gas injection and discharge gives relatively slow power changes bot favourable efficiencies at part-load. With gas injection on the HP side the power output rises faster than would correspond with the increase of inventory. This behaviour can be used advantageously for frequency maintenance. The <b>by-pass</b> <b>control</b> is characterized by rapid power changes in connection with unfavourable part-load efficiencies. The associated pressure-gradients are inside of tolerable limits. The loss-of-load from fall load as most extremely operating case can be met by <b>by-pass</b> <b>control</b> with PI-controller in the single-shaft-plant. All together one can establish that the single-shaft-plant can fulfil all investigated operating requirements without undue operating conditions. But these cannot be excluded in some cases with the split-shaft-arrangement...|$|E

The injection system consisted primarily of a <b>by-pass</b> <b>controlled</b> fuel pump and an automatic injection valve. The variables of the system studied were the pump speed, pump-throttle setting, discharge-orifice diameter, injection-valve opening and closing pressures, and injection-tube length and diameter...|$|R

Between 1913 and 1955 {{there was}} a hydrological station in operation at Leselidze, roughly 1.5 km upstream of the river mouth.The Psou gained notoriety as a smuggling route out of the country, <b>by-passing</b> Russian <b>controls</b> on the border. As of 2008 it was still designated as a transboundary river which lacked an international cooperation agreement {{as part of the}} UNECE Water Convention.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} practical {{experiences of}} savings within compressed air systems {{with the special}} attention to the compressed air end uses, particularly in pneumatic control systems. Firstly, the systematic approach to energy savings is presented. Following, various energy-saving measures have been reviewed. They encompassed system analysis and harmonization of production and consumption, minimisation of loses (leak prevention strategy, identification and quantification of leakages), possibilities for reducing pressure drop on filters, and three methods for optimization of pneumatic control: <b>by-pass</b> <b>control,</b> PWM control, and usage of exhaust air. Finally, energy conservation of a complex robotic cell with installed electric and pneumatic devices is shown...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} and energy efficiency of the pneumatic drive, the <b>by-pass</b> valve <b>control</b> scheme is designed and studied. For pneumatic positioning application, in the constant speed phase, the inlet and outlet chambers will be connected via by-pass valve to reduce the overshoot and allow some exhaust compressed air to be reused. Therefore, compared with the traditional control of {{the motion of the}} asymmetric cylinder, a 12 – 28 % saving in energy use can be acquired and meanwhile the position accuracy is maintained. Preliminary results from the simulation and experiment studies will be reported...|$|R

The research obtains an effective method of solving the problem of jam on the sub-arterial road: It needs to set up <b>by-pass</b> and <b>control</b> over traffic flow of the by-pass, and give full play to the role of by-pass in city...|$|R
40|$|A pumped {{two-phase}} (heat absorption/heat rejection) thermal {{transport system}} for orbiting instrument payloads is investigated.

40|$|Continuous Commissioning (CCSM) was {{performed}} on the Texas A&M Large Animal Hospital in October 1996 and as a result, significant savings were achieved. Subsequently, the building chilled water and hot water energy consumption increased, and the occupants complained about discomfort problems due to later building operational changes. Most of these problems were caused by control systems in individual areas that were improperly maintained so that coils or other components were operating wildly. When optimal building operations are changed or degrade over time, follow-up CC measures must adapt the systems to maintain efficiency. This degradation may be due to changes in building use, control programming changes, component/sensor failure, or system <b>controls</b> <b>by-pass</b> or override. This paper intends to present the circumstances surrounding this investigation and the subsequent measures taken to correct the problems...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} centres on {{the application}} of cross flow fan units to provide forced air flow over the radiator used for engine cooling. It is shown that a cooling {{system in which the}} airflow is ducted through the vehicle would lead to a significant reduction in vehicle drag. A ducted system allows more exact prediction of performance, and can be more easily designed in conjunction with across flow fan, that has rectangular inlet and outlet sections, and an ability to form 'S', 'L' and 'U' airflow geometries. This shape advantage of the cross flow fan also allows the use of radiators with a higher aspect ratio that could in turn permit lower bonnet lines on vehicles with a further reduction in aerodynamic drag. At higher vehicle speeds adequate cooling is usually provided by ram airflow through the cooling system. An airflow <b>by-pass</b> arrangement <b>controlled</b> by a balance valve has been devised and tested. The operation of this valve was found to be stable and smooth, and extremely beneficial in reducing the total system resistance and increasing fan performance under ram airflow conditions. A computer model has been developed and a programme produced to facilitate matching of the air circuit, fan and motor. Examples illustrate the use of this in the design of a system for a 1, 6 litre passenger vehicle, with maximum b. h. p. in second gear being taken as the most critical engine condition for cooling performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} neuropsychological {{consequences}} after carotid artery stenting (CAS) and extracranial-intracranial by-pass (EC-IC by-pass). Methods: A total of 43 patients referred to CAS, 32 patients referred to EC-IC <b>by-pass</b> and 43 <b>control</b> subjects {{were enrolled in}} the study. Neuropsychologic testing was performed before and three months after procedure. A paired Stu-dent t test was used to compare neuropsychologic test scores at baseline and three months after procedure in each group. Cognitive changes in a three-month follow-up were not normally distri-buted and compared among/between groups with Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Three months af-ter the treatment both the CAS and EC-IC by-pass groups showed improved cognitive performance compared to baseline, whereas the same improvement wasn’t seen in the control group. The scores from Activities of Daily Living also improved in all three groups in a three-month follow-up, and EC-IC group presented a more distinct increase in daily life abilities comparing to the other two groups. Conclusions: CAS and EC-IC by-pass in patients with a carotid or intracranial stenosis may result in cognitive improvement three months after surgery...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of preliminary tests made on the effects of supercharging an air-cooled engine under airplane flight conditions. Service training airplanes were used in the investigation equipped with production types of Wright J engines. A N. A. C. A. Roots type supercharger was driven {{from the rear of the}} engine. In addition to measuring those quantities that would enable the determination of the climb performance, measurements were made of the cylinder-head temperatures and the carburetor pressures and temperatures. The supercharging equipment was not removed from the airplane when making flights without supercharging, but a <b>by-pass</b> valve, which <b>controlled</b> the amount of supercharging by returning to the atmosphere the surplus air delivered by the supercharger, was left full open. With the supercharger so geared that ground-level pressure could be maintained to 18, 500 feet, it was found that the absolute ceiling was increased from 19, 400 to 32, 600 feet, that the time to climb to 16, 00 feet was decreased from 32 to 16 minutes, and that this amount of supercharging apparently did not injure the engine.

40|$|A new, {{small-scale}} {{controlled environment}} plant growth chamber is described, which permits accurately controlled temperatures from ambient (c. 20 °C) down to − 5 °C {{in the day}} or − 15 °C at night. The system also allows controlled injection of pollutant gases. The chamber {{is based on a}} modified commercial chest freezer with temperature <b>control</b> achieved through <b>by-passing</b> the cooling coils in the inner walls of the freezer. This <b>by-pass</b> is <b>controlled</b> by a BBC microcomputer which gives nominal temperature control to 0 · 1 °C over definable diurnal temperature profiles. Photoperiod is also controlled by the microcomputer. The chamber forms a virtually closed system to which pollutant gases are added by injection from low concentration cylinders, regulated using mass flow controllers. The accuracy with which pollutant concentrations are controlled is increased by filtration of the air-stream after passing over the experimental plants: i. e. a ‘single-pass’ system is adopted. In operation air temperatures across the chambers are controlled to within 1 - 1 · 5 °C of the pre-set value over the range 25 to − 10 °C. Leaf temperatures are 2 · 5 - 3 · 0 °C above air temperatures during the day, with a total energy input of c. 180 Wm− 2 from two 400 W metal halide lamps. The lamps provide a photon fluence rate of 270 ± 30 μmol quanta PAR m− 2 s− 1 at plant height. During the dark, leaf temperatures deviate less than 1 · 0 °C from air temperature. Soil temperatures are controlled separately from air temperature and are held above zero at all times. To date, fumigation, with NO 2 and SO 2 has been confined to the daytime. At pre-set concentrations of 20 nl litre− 1 variations during fumigation were less than 2 · 0 – 2 · 5 nl litre− 1 and 0 · 5 nl litre− 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Transnational {{advocacy}} networks (TANs) are {{a rapidly}} proliferating phenomenon in international contentious politics. Widely known for waging headline-grabbing wars of words, TANs remain under-theorised on important levels of analysis. Unsurprisingly, {{they have been}} termed ‘elusive’ in the political literature. Typically portrayed as vital service-providing agencies that <b>by-pass</b> official <b>controls</b> to relay civil society concerns to the world’s media and international policy-makers, TANs are commonly assumed to be the vociferous, Internet-enabled, offspring of traditional NGOs and, thus, heirs to the reputational capital of NGOs. However, despite this respected provenance, {{it is evident that}} TANs frequently fail to achieve their goals. Knowledge of why some TAN strategies succeed while others fail is contested and inconclusive. This empirical thesis attempts to build on the international political literature by showing why the emerging NGO typology of TANs cannot be explained without paying attention to the systemic complexity of their environment and the essentially communicative functioning of these globe-spanning advocacy cooperatives. It seeks to demonstrate also the analytical value of applying complex realism in IR praxis. Hence, the thesis explicates a real-world conundrum: What is the place and function of transnational advocacy networks in the contemporary international system and how effective are they in achieving their aims? To identify macro-structural conditions and indicators of relationship quality — primarily involving state and non-state elements {{in the context of the}} United Nations — the thesis study reclaimed macro-sociological perspective as a first stage, ‘top-down’ approach to this complex, multi-dimensional problem space. The resultant data and patterns were then tested by way of a second-stage, micro-sociological, ‘bottom-up’, case study exploration of the UN’s interface with three iconic TANs — Greenpeace, Oxfam and Human Rights Watch. By conceptualising these relationships as intersections between systemic elements constituted on different social levels and scales of complexity, the scalable methodology enabled the study to transcend the micro-macro problems inherent in the primary research question. The results indicate that TANs are a distinctive typology of NGO that the international system is struggling to evaluate and accommodate within existing arrangements for NGO engagement. Unexpectedly, the study found plausible indications that the barriers many TANs encounter are endogenously produced. The results challenge prevailing assumptions about the place and function of grassroots diplomacy in the international arena; the ability of communications strategies to remedy global problems; and the reality and limitations of ‘people power’. By highlighting under-exposed features of the contemporary international relational landscape, the thesis argues, we might better determine whether many contemporary TANs are, in fact, evolving as the best-suited champions for the urgent, political quests they adopt...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in which a DAF engine was equipped with a two-stage turbocharging system. Objectives were to investigate an engine concept with very high BMEP (25 - 30 bars), maintaining acceptable emissions and fuel consumption, while concentrating on the control system and transient performance. Two-stage turbocharging has several advantages compared with single stage turbocharging. Two-stage turbocharging enables high specific power levels across a broad speed range. In addition transient behaviour of a two-stage turbocharged engine is improved because of the combination of a small (and fast) High Pressure turbocharger and a larger Low Pressure turbocharger. Especially at high intake manifold pressures (pressure ratio > 3. 5) the overall efficiency of two-stage turbocharging is better than with single state turbocharging. The two-stage system on the engine that was tested consists of two parallel Low Pressure turbochargers, a High Pressure turbocharger with <b>controlled</b> <b>by-pass</b> valve, and a cooler behind the High Pressure compressor. With this configuration BSFC was optimised, while maintaining EURO III emission levels. Also transient tests were carried out, whereby the transient behaviour was compared with that of the current DAF engine. In the development of the control algorithms for the by-pass valve, simulatons were used with a complete engine model built in Matrixx. These simulations were also used to estimate transient performance of the engine concept, prior to the test program. In addition the engine model was used to analyse the measured data, and to understand several transient effects that play a role. The results show that two-stage turbocharging is an effective way to increase specific power output while maintaining acceptable fuel consumption and transient performance...|$|R
