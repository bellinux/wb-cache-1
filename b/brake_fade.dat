25|$|Amongst {{the options}} {{available}} for the B8 RS4, are ceramic brakes, allowing the car to perform heavy braking without having <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> A total of ca. 7000 units of the Audi B8 RS4 were built.|$|E
25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|E
25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.|$|E

25|$|In April 1941, the RAF {{sent two}} Spitfire Mark VA fighters to Dayton for testing. The variant used a {{pressurized}} cockpit for high-altitude pilot comfortâ€”the pilot {{would not have}} to wear an oxygen mask. Kelsey ferried one of the aircraft to and from Los Angeles so that it could be examined further at a California facility. Because of the Spitfire's inherent range limitations, Kelsey was forced to make a number of refueling stops at little-used air fields. Kelsey noted engine overheating during taxiing and <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> on long desert runways in the presence of significant crosswind. He found long cross-country flight very tiring due to the Spitfire's marginal stability (which gave it high maneuverability in combat.) Kelsey felt that the highly lauded fighter would not have been approved for purchase in the United States where requirements included long range.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to drum brakes, {{disc brakes}} offer better {{stopping}} performance because the disc is more readily cooled. As a consequence discs are {{less prone to}} the <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> caused when brake components overheat. [...] Disc brakes also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).|$|E
2500|$|Heat {{build-up}} {{can lead}} to failure with disc brakes. Disc brakes heat discs {{in the same way}} as rim brakes heat rims, but discs provide an inherently smaller surface to dissipate heat. Excessive heat leads to boiling hydraulic fluid, resulting in <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> or total failure. Overheating is more common in road cycling assuming the brakes are undersized to reduce weight. Recorded cases of disc brake failures [...] usually involves several kilometers of downhill, combined with small underweight discs.|$|E

50|$|Rheostatic braking {{was used}} on the trains, and {{required}} amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, rheostatic braking was used first, after which friction brakes on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, friction brakes on the motor cars could also be used. The rheostatic <b>braking</b> <b>fades</b> as the speed drops below 10 mph, and so slow speed braking was always by friction brake. As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each bogie were wired in series permanently, and the traction controller performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.|$|R
50|$|The 79 was {{not without}} its problems, however. Wright and Ogilvie noted that the car was very {{marginal}} in some aspects of its design. Andretti had reservations over the car's <b>brakes,</b> which <b>faded</b> noticeably over a race distance, especially in hot conditions; the exhaust {{had a tendency to}} overheat, and the monocoque tub was not as stiff as the team would have liked, which meant a new casting had to be fabricated several times during the two seasons the car was used.|$|R
2500|$|A lighter, {{and higher}} performing, [...] "Audi ceramic" [...] front brake system was an option from 2007 model year onwards (and only with 19inch wheels). It {{comprised}} cross-drilled, radially vented and floating Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite SGL Carbon discs, [...] diameter and [...] thick, with grey Brembo monoblock six-opposed-piston fixed aluminium alloy calipers. [...] The discs {{have a much}} greater tolerance to thermal differences, virtually eliminating <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> and have a duration of five times greater than conventional iron discs. The ceramic brakes also reduce unsprung mass by around 50% and thereby improve steering response and overall handling.|$|E
2500|$|Rotors come in many {{different}} sizes, such as 160mm, 185mm, and 203mm diameter. Other sizes are available as manufacturers make discs specific to their calipers [...] the dimensions often vary by a few millimeters. Larger rotors provide greater braking force for a given pad pressure, by virtue of a longer moment arm for the caliper to act on. Smaller rotors provide less stopping power but also less weight and better protection from knocks. Larger rotors dissipate heat more quickly and have a larger amount of mass to absorb heat, reducing <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> or failure. Downhill bikes usually have larger brakes to handle greater braking loads. Cross country bicycles usually use smaller rotors which handle smaller loads but offer considerable weight savings.|$|E
2500|$|Chrysler discs were [...] "self-energizing," [...] in {{that some}} of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was {{accomplished}} by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> promoted cooler running and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler [...] drums. But because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Imperial Crown through 1954 and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Brambilla {{took the}} lead until lap six when he was passed by Lauda. Tony Brise spun at the chicane and retired shortly after with piston failure. Jody Scheckter was {{storming}} through the field to be in second place by lap ninth. Brambilla's <b>brakes</b> were <b>fading</b> and he dropped down the order. Jean-Pierre Jarier spun into the catch-fencing, James Hunt retired with a broken gear-linkage. Clay Regazzoni had risen to third, but then dived into the pits to change a blistered tyre. Lauda led Scheckter comfortably and the race settled down into a procession.|$|R
40|$|Through {{continuing}} {{studies on}} high-temperature space materials useful for better brake linings, Bendix Corporation worked with Ames Research Center {{to develop a}} novel composite. This team worked to fabricate several combinations of composite materials and evaluated results. The one selected increases wear rates and lowers costs. It exhibits constant coefficient of friction at temperatures as high as 650 degrees Fahrenheit, a region where conventional <b>brake</b> linings <b>fade</b> markedly. Other suitable markets include brakes for trucks and industrial equipment such as overhead cranes and hoists. Afterwards brake linings could find successful application in passenger cars...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the braking {{numerical}} simulations on a pegs-wing ventilated disk brake rotor, obtained by performing a <b>fading</b> <b>braking</b> procedure, are compared with the experimental ones obtained in the same brake, mounted on a work bench, in the same <b>fading</b> <b>braking</b> procedure. The numerical simulations are performed on the entire disk, besides some structural parameters, thermal conductivity, specific heat and elastic modulus, are considered {{as a function of}} the temperature; the other parameters are considered as constant. The {{results of the}} numerical simulations are in a good agreement with the experimental ones. It is also shown that numerical calculations can be considered conservative, since the numerical thermal field is a little bit higher than the experimental one. Furthermore the pegs-wing ventilated disk brake rotor is able to dissipate a great amount of thermal flux showing a great dimensional stability...|$|R
2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|E
2500|$|The R8 V10 {{conventional}} brakes {{brought the}} car to a stop quicker than the LFA's ceramic carbon brakes. However, in the behind the scenes footage, it was shown the LFA's carbon brakes meant for hardcore track usage were not warmed up properly, which is essential for carbon brakes to perform at their best. In the successive run, R8 V10 brakes suffered massive <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> increasing the distance 17 feet while LFA carbon brakes were consistently getting better braking shorter in every successive run.

2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner {{surface of a}} cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders. Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, {{at a time when}} an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Chrysler discs were [...] "self energizing," [...] in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.|$|E

25|$|As an option, Porsche is also {{offering}} its ceramic brake system, PCCB (Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake). The {{advantages of}} this high-tech material mean {{a reduction of}} 37lbs compared to the standard <b>brake</b> system, excellent <b>fading</b> stability owing to consistent friction values and absolute corrosion resistance. The brakes now have a diameter of 380 millimeters at the front axle and 350 millimeters at the rear.|$|R
50|$|Vehicle {{braking system}} fade, or <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> is the {{reduction}} in stopping power that can occur after repeated or sustained application of the brakes, especially in high load or high speed conditions. <b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> can {{be a factor in}} any vehicle that utilizes a friction braking system including automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, airplanes, and bicycles.|$|E
