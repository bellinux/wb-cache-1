5|$|Bridge to Terabithia is a 2007 American drama film {{directed}} by Gábor Csupó and adapted for film by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell. The film {{is based on}} the Katherine Paterson novel of the same name, and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film stars Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, <b>Bailee</b> Madison and Zooey Deschanel. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of Jesse Aarons and Leslie Burke, 12-year-old neighbors who create a fantasy world called Terabithia and spend their free time together in an abandoned tree house.|$|E

25|$|It was {{doubtful}} whether detinue lay where, after bailment, a {{third party}} had destroyed the chattel bailed. This could be encountered when ships were lost at sea, or chattels being moved by wagon were destroyed by acts {{of nature and the}} like. Other cases might involve the finding or bailment of clothing which were destroyed while in the possession of a <b>bailee.</b> The case of a horse bailed to a smith, who bailed it to another smith who damaged, or killed the horse was encountered with some frequency. Action could not lie against the first smith. Contrary opinion is found in a ruling by Stratham.|$|E

500|$|Following Katz, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Fourth Amendment search cases have turned on the right to privacy, but in United States v. Jones (2012), the Court ruled that the Katz standard did not replace earlier case law, but rather, has supplemented it. In Jones, law enforcement officers had attached a GPS device on a car's exterior without Jones' knowledge or consent. The Court concluded that Jones was a <b>bailee</b> to the car, and so had a property interest in the car. Therefore, since the intrusion on the vehicle—a common law trespass—was for the purpose of obtaining information, the Court ruled that it was a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court used similar [...] "trespass" [...] reasoning in Florida v. Jardines (2013), to rule that bringing a drug detection dog to sniff at the front door of a home was a search.|$|E

5000|$|The {{defense counsel}} {{had argued that}} there was no duty imposed on the {{defendant}} to be responsible for the exercise of any given degree of care, in contrast to the duty of care imposed on common carriers and <b>bailees,</b> or under an implied contract. This case was decided during a transitional period {{in the history of the}} common law rule on negligence and liability. Until the mid- to late 19th century in the United States and England, there was no settled standard for tort liability. Courts in the early 19th century often found a negligence requirement for liability to exist only for common carriers or <b>bailees.</b> English and U.S. courts later began to move toward a standard of negligence based on a universal duty of care in light of the [...] "reasonable person" [...] test.|$|R

50|$|Aluminium Industrie Vaasen BV was a Dutch {{supplier}} of aluminium foil. Romalpa Aluminium Ltd processed {{it in their}} factory. In the contract of sale, it said that ownership of the foil would only be transferred to Romalpa when the purchase price had been paid in full and products made from the foil should be kept by the buyers as <b>bailees</b> (the contract referring to the Dutch expression ‘fiduciary owners’) separately from other stock on AIV’s behalf as ‘surety’ {{for the rest of}} the price. But it also said Romalpa had the power to sell the manufactured articles in the course of business. When such sales took place, this would be deemed to be as an agent for AIV. Romalpa went insolvent, and the receiver and manager of Romalpa's bank, Hume Corporation Ltd, wanted the aluminium to be caught by its floating charge. AlV contended that its contract was effective to retain title to the goods, and so it did not need to share them with other creditors in the liquidation.|$|R

If a person bailed his {{chattels}} to another, and that <b>bailee</b> wrongfully gave, sold or bailed the chattels {{to a third}} party, the only action was against the original <b>bailee.</b> Liability to the third <b>bailee</b> was not transferable. In later times, lawyers would talk of trover and bailment. In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the detainer rather than the bailment as the gist of the action, where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'" [...] But there are other later cases which show that it is impossible or at least extremely difficult for the bailor to fashion any count that will avail him against the third party.

5000|$|Financial Week {{reported}} May 5, 2008 (emphasis added): But {{we travel}} {{in a world}} with a systemic bias to optimism that typically chooses to avoid {{the topic of the}} impending bursting of investment bubbles. Collectively, this is done for career or business reasons. As discussed many times in the investment business, pessimism or realism in the face of probable trouble is just plain bad for business and bad for careers. What I am only slowly realizing, though, is how similar the career risk appears to be for the Fed. It doesn't want to move against bubbles because Congress and business do not like it and show their dislike in unmistakable terms. Even Federal reserve chairmen get bullied and have their faces slapped if they stick to their guns, which will, not surprisingly, be rare since everyone values his career or {{does not want to be}} replaced à la Volcker. So, be as optimistic as possible, be nice to everyone, bail everyone out and hope for the best.

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{laid down in}} the encyclopedias and text books, and affirmed in many court opinions that 2 ̆ 2 the doctrine that officers and directors [of corporations] are trustees of the stockholders, applies only in respect to their acts relating to the property or business of the corporation. It does not extend to their private dealings with stockholders or others, though in such dealings they take advantage of knowledge gained through their official position. 2 ̆ 21 Much of this doctrine {{is based upon the}} language of Chief Justice SHAW in Smith v. Hurd 2 decided in 1847. He said: 2 ̆ 2 There is no legal privity, relation, or immediate connection between the holders of shares in a bank, in their individual capacity on the one side, and the directors of the bank on the other. The directors are not the <b>bailees,</b> factors, agents, or trustees of such individual stock-holders. 2 ̆ 2 This case was an action on the case at common law, by an individual share holder against the directors for damages due to various acts of negligence and malfeasance in office through a series of years, in consequence of which the whole bank capital was wasted and lost, and the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s shares, along with the others, became of no value. In sustaining a demurrer, the court gave the following reasons for the rule above: (1) The corporation is a distinct person in the law, in whom the whole stock and property are vested. (2) The individual members have no right to inter-meddle with the property, simply because they are not the legal owners of it. (3) Injury done to the capital stock by impairing its value is not in the first instance a damage to the stockholder. (4) Shares do not constitute a legal estate and property, but a qualified, equitable interest, and an injury done to the stock is not an injury to such separate interest but to the whole body of stockholders in common...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{concerns}} {{the origins and}} history of the duty to account, and enquiry into the principles applied in the development of that obligation. The account appears as early as the Domesday Books of 1086, and can be traced to advancements in Exchequer. The first reports of ‘private law’ writs of account appear sometime between 1163 - 1172. It features in statutes such as the Statute of Westminster II 1285. However, as a praecipe writ it was, like debt, defended by wager of law. In the 1600 s this severely curtailed its practicability: Cf Slade’s Case (1602) 4 Co Rep 92 b (76 ER 1074); and led to the general administration of account in Chancery. Nonetheless, the remedy remains available at law. Accounting parties are often described by the trilogy, ‘bailiffs, guardians and receivers’. But the meaning of ‘receiver’ was both extended and extensive, and comprehended anyone who received property “to the use of” (ad opus) the plaintiff. Thus, accounting parties include partners, executors, employees, <b>bailees,</b> factors, agents, receivers in cases of misrepresentation and fraud, receivers of payments by mistake, for usurpation of office, failure of consideration and, most intriguingly, for payments made by A to B to the use of C. For its part, the development of the account in equity followed the law. Accordingly, important institutions in equity, such as the trust, constructive trust, fiduciaries, confidential information, and civil remedies for theft were premised on the defendant holding {{to the use of the}} plaintiff. The categories of account in equity are not closed: North Eastern Railway Co v Martin (1848) 2 Ph 758 (41 ER 1136). In exceptional cases, the account might be a remedy for breach of contract: Cf Attorney-General v Blake [2001] 1 AC 268. In either case, the further development of the account can best be realised having regard to the jurisprudence and principles of the writ, bill, then cause of action, established over 800 years.

2500|$|Early trover cases {{involved}} the keeping or taking of a bailment by the <b>bailee</b> (the person charged {{to hold them}} with [...] "ordinary care"). Others concerned the use of lost chattels found by another. Who was the real owner? Early on, there was difficulty in dealing with situations where chattels held by a <b>bailee</b> were used by a third party. Examples could be sheep, horses, farm goods, grains or other chattels left {{in the care of}} a person who was required to exercise ordinary care. If negligence led to damages, an action could be had. A third person might use the chattel, returning it in a damaged condition. [...] The early common law had some difficulty in dealing with this kind of situation. This led to expansions of actions in trover.|$|E
2500|$|The 1843 Illinois case of Johnson v. Weedman {{was argued}} {{by a young}} Abraham Lincoln. [...] The case was {{somewhat}} similar {{to the case of}} Fouldes v Willoughby , which had been decided two years earlier. [...] It may have been taken as precedent in this present case. [...] (see supra). [...] A horse had been left in bailment for proper care. [...] The <b>bailee</b> who was in possession of the horse rode it for 15 miles. [...] There was no demonstrable damage to the horse. [...] Lincoln convinced the court that there could be no action for damages. [...] There was not enough evidence for the <b>bailee</b> to be held liable for a conversion, or for an action in trover. [...] There had been no significant invasion of the owner's rights. [...] The Illinois court agreed, and Lincoln won the day.|$|E
2500|$|This {{principle}} of Isaac v Clark (see immediately supra) was extended in Manders v. Williams [...] where {{the court found}} that a <b>bailee</b> had a bailment for a period of time, and not merely at the will of the bailor. In other words, there had to be an agreement, similar to a contractual arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as <b>bailees.</b> When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|R
2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} may be predicated upon an improper disposal, removal, transportation, delivery, or {{transfer of possession}} of property to one not authorized by the owner to receive the property. The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that, with some exceptions, one who makes an unauthorized delivery of a chattel to a person not entitled to its immediate possession is subject to liability for conversion to another who is so entitled. [...] A <b>bailee,</b> agent, or servant who re-delivers to his bailor, principal, or master is not liable for conversion unless the person entitled to immediate possession had made an adverse claim upon him. [...] A <b>bailee,</b> agent or servant who delivers the chattel to a third person pursuant to the instructions of his bailor, principal or master is not liable for conversion unless he has knowledge or reason to know that his bailor, principal, or master is not authorized so to dispose of it.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{questions}} concerning joint ownership in enterprises {{such as a}} partnership belong in equity, and do not {{rise to the level}} of a conversion. [...] Traditionally, a conversion occurs when some chattel is lost, then found by another who appropriates it to his own use without legal authority to do so. [...] It has also applied in cases where chattels were bailed for safe keeping, then misused or misappropriated by the <b>bailee</b> or a third party.|$|E
