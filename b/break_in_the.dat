The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} <b>the</b> <b>break</b> point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{residual variance}} and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> propagation {{mechanism of the}} real exchange rates at {{about the time of}} the Asian crisis that occurred in 1997, and provides some explanations for <b>the</b> <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residual variance increased the volatility of the real exchange rates, which given the overall effects of common adverse shocks to the countries seems to be reinforced by the sudden withdrawal of Japanese commercial banks' lending to the region. And <b>the</b> subsequent <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> propagation mechanism reduced the volatility, which reflects <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government policy stance to result <b>in</b> smoothing <b>the</b> pace of appreciation. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nominal exchange rates rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> price ratios are mainly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real exchange rates...|$|R
40|$|Solutions, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form H/r, of the {{homogeneous}} linear partial {{differential equation}} {{of the second}} order with constant coefficients are used as generalized potential functions. With the aid of generalized Green 2 ̆ 7 s theorems and the methods developed by Erhardt Schmidt, {{it is possible to}} obtain <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivatives of the generalized potentials due to a volume, simple surface and double surface distribution;When the functions involved satisfy certain differetiability and continuity conditions, it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (n + 1) st order derivatives of these generalized potentials are given by recursion. For example, <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (n + 1) st order derivatives of the generalized volume potential are obtained from <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nth order derivatives of potential due to a volume and simple surface distribution. Similar relations are shown to exist for <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (n + 1) st order derivatives of the generalized potential due to simple surface and double surface distribution;In chapter IV the theory has been applied to two problems and <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> potentials and their first and second order derivatives have been found for the case of the x 3 axis parallel to the normal at the point...|$|R

5|$|O'Sullivan {{began the}} 2010/2011 season at Event 1 of the Players Tour Championship, where he lost 0–4 in the quarter-finals against Jamie Cope. O'Sullivan next competed at Event 4, where {{he reached the}} final, but he lost 3–4 against Barry Pinches. At the World Open O'Sullivan made his record 10th maximum <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last frame of his match against Mark King, which he won 3–0. However, {{he had to be}} persuaded by referee Jan Verhaas to play the final black, as he had become aware that there was no {{distinct}} prize money for a maximum <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament, but only a prize of £4,000 for the highest break. Even then, he played the final black in a nonchalant fashion. O'Sullivan then defeated Jimmy White (3–1), Stephen Hendry (3–1), Stephen Maguire (3–1) and Peter Ebdon (3–1) to reach the final, where he lost 1–5 against Neil Robertson. O'Sullivan participated at the Premier League Snooker, and qualified for the finals unbeaten. He then defeated Neil Robertson 5–1 in the semi-finals, and Shaun Murphy 7–1 in the final, to claim his ninth Premier League Snooker title in 14 years. In the UK Championship in December, O'Sullivan suffered an early exit, losing 6–9 against Stuart Bingham in the first round.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence.

Either way, this <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E

5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft the <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

In the semifinals against Germany she played two rubbers, one was won against Julia Görges, another against Andrea Petkovic. With her win over Görges, Kuznetsova became the second-best Russian Fed Cup player by total wins, with 27 won rubbers; the {{absolute}} leader is Larisa Savchenko, with 40 won rubbers. Kuznetsova was not called in the final.|$|E
5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E

5|$|Anderitum {{fell into}} ruin {{following}} {{the end of}} the Roman occupation but was reoccupied in 1066 by the Normans, for whom it became a key strategic bulwark. A stone keep and fortification was built within the Roman walls and faced several sieges. Although its garrison was twice starved into surrender, it was never successfully stormed. The castle was occupied more or less continuously until the 16th century, apart from a possible <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 13th century when it was slighted.

5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara, {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered the ship to reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
