50|$|Over the years, the Great American Scream Machine {{became known}} as a rough ride, causing pain to riders mostly seated {{in the rear of}} the train, and often riders just meeting the minimum height limit of the ride or taller than the average rider.

50|$|One {{thing that}} was noted in the {{build-up}} to the race weekend was the <b>bumpiness</b> of the circuit, with the drivers in the post-qualifying press conference noting that the circuit should be resurfaced. It was also noted that overtaking into the new chicane was banned, although {{the length of the}} ban was unclear, with Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill unclear whether the drivers were not allowed to overtake into the chicane for just the first lap, or for every lap.|$|E
50|$|As with cars, {{wheel travel}} and spring rate affect the <b>bumpiness</b> {{of the ride}} and {{the speed at which}} rough terrain can be negotiated. It may be {{significant}} that a smooth ride, which is often associated with comfort, increases the accuracy when firing on the move (analogously to battle ships with reduced stability, due to reduced metacentric height). It also reduces shock on optics and other equipment. The unsprung weight and track link weight may limit speed on roads and affect the life of the track and other components.|$|E
50|$|While {{resembling}} {{many of the}} small-wheel {{folding bicycle}} designs of the time, the bicycle was distinctive in reducing the flexion of the down tube and hinge by use of cables kept under tension {{by the weight of}} the rider, saving weight and space compared to use of rigid tubing braces. Use of cables provided reduction of excessive vertical flex in the frame while still allowing easy adjustment of the degree of flexion retained, to act as a tunable suspension system absorbing much of the <b>bumpiness</b> of the ride normally associated with small wheel bicycles.|$|E
5000|$|A normal wheel (rotating {{around a}} fixed axle) must be {{circular}} in shape to allow smooth forward motion (without any vertical <b>bumpiness).</b> However, a loose [...] "roller" [...] (i.e. a cylindrical or pseudo-cylindrical rod) {{does not require}} a circular cross-section to allow smooth forward motion — any curve of constant width (as the cross-section of the roller) will work — including circular cross-sections of course, but also including Reuleaux-triangular cross-sections, and higher-sided curves of constant width. Therefore, if a flat transport-material is placed on two or more rollers (with cross-sectional-shapes that are curves of the same constant width) resting on a flat ground-surface, the transport-material will remain a constant height off the ground-surface as it is pushed forward (though the rollers themselves will appear to [...] "move in a curiously irregular manner" [...] if their shape is significantly non-circular).|$|E
50|$|Although {{the track}} has seen some minor changes as seen above, the basic layout has in many aspects {{remained}} unchanged. It is a twisty circuit {{that is the}} slowest in Formula One running at normal race distance above 305 km, which combined with its features of proximity to walls leads to frequent safety cars, further extending the running to nearing the race time limit of two hours. The <b>bumpiness,</b> the heavy braking zones, the lack of daylight and the humidity makes the race very testing for both drivers and cars. It has some 90-degree turns, but is pretty variable in that aspect, featuring technical sections with quick direction changes as well. Overtaking is primarily done {{at the end of}} the first sector, where top speeds are at their highest. Runoff areas exist {{at the end of the}} long straightaways, but are very short by Formula One standards. At most parts of the track, cars run very close to the walls.|$|E

50|$|For 1989, {{the race}} in Detroit was {{replaced}} by a CART event. Instead of moving to Belle Isle, CART utilized a slightly modified version of the downtown Renaissance Center street circuit. The chicane on the main straight was eliminated - something the F1 drivers had been calling for since the first race in 1982. The CART race was held on this 2.52 mi layout for three years. As had been the case in the event's Formula One days, competitors and fans continued to pan the course, criticizing it for its <b>bumpiness,</b> poor visibility and overall poor layout. The 1991 event was perhaps the last straw in what was really a humiliating embarrassment for the organizers. In addition to a disintegrating track made worse by suffocating heat and humidity, it saw Mario Andretti crash his Newman-Haas Lola head-on into a tow truck that was attempting to remove Dennis Vitolo's stranded car {{in the middle of a}} blind corner at St. Antoine and East Jefferson Streets, and then seconds later Mario's son Michael crashed the other Newman-Haas Lola into Dennis Vitolo's car attempting to avoid his father's wrecked car.

5000|$|After the {{previous}} race {{held at the}} Nürburgring (the 2001 European Grand Prix) {{the layout of the}} circuit was changed, its first major change since it was reopened in 1984. The chicane which previously formed the first corner was replaced by a sharp right-hand hairpin and included a tight left and right-hand corner and the changes were designed to make overtaking opportunities more common. The asphalt was widened by 25 meters to facilitate any overtaking manoeuvres. The changes increased the length of the circuit by 645 yards (590 metres) and the amount of laps of the Grand Prix were reduced from 67 to 60. Jaguar team principal and former World Champion Niki Lauda felt the new layout would secure a better view for spectators watching in the grandstands. The new section received mixed reviews from the drivers and critics. Ralf Schumacher said it was [...] "a nice part of the circuit" [...] though he found it difficult to find the ideal braking point and felt overtaking would still be difficult. Jordan driver Takuma Sato noted although the surface was bumpy upon entry he felt being unsighted in the first corner would be [...] "a good feeling". Retired driver and columinst for Bild Hans-Joachim Stuck described it as [...] "sexiest the new corner on the Formula One circuit" [...] and that it was made for aggressive drivers. Coulthard was more vocal in his criticism saying the <b>bumpiness</b> of the section was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and preferred the challenge of the former first corner chicane, while Montoya felt the section was [...] "too slow".|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the yole of friction and disorder in segregation mechanism in surface flow, we investigate the motion of a single ball of radius R on a onedimensional bumpy line made of balls of radius r.

In addition to experimental results for different ratios, we perform numerical simulations where the <b>bumpiness</b> - disorder in spacing between the balls forming the line - is also controlled. Different kinds of behavior are observed. In particular, we obtain a regime where the ball quickly reaches a constant mean velocity. In this regime, we investigate the friction forces during contacts and identify in a generalized model the regions which are dominated by solid friction or by loss due to collisions. We show that smaller balls get trapped more easily on a rough surface which might explain the origin of the segregation process found in rotating drums and sandpiles.
