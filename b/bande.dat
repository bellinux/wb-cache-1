5|$|Recordings of Bach's cantatas {{began in}} the first half of the 20th century. Series of {{recording}}s, often for broadcasting, were made from 1950. Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt were the first to begin recording the complete cantatas in a 20-year collaboration using period instruments, boys' choirs and boy soloists. Helmuth Rilling completed a recording of the sacred cantatas and oratorios on Bach's 300th birthday, 21 March 1985. Other projects to record all sacred cantatas in historically informed performance were completed by Ton Koopman, John Eliot Gardiner, Pieter Jan Leusink and Masaaki Suzuki. Sigiswald Kuijken began to record a cycle of cantatas for the Complete Liturgical Year with an OVPP choir and historic instruments, the ensemble La Petite <b>Bande.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the conditions and the potential for improving the efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness of the ideas program management in organizations by reporting an experience of structuring processes and tools related to generating ideas for innovation at the banco de desenvolvimento do estado do espírito santo (<b>bandes).</b> We seek to understand why it is important to systematize routines and tools for generating ideas for innovation in organizations. Since 2006, with the creation of institutional innovation management (gerin), <b>bandes</b> has focused on systematic routines and tools for innovation management. In 2008, <b>bandes</b> implemented mechanisms to stimulate the innovative process, such as the innovation portal (whose main element is the ideas bank) and the <b>bandes</b> innovation award. The goal was to encourage employees to propose ideas and suggestions that could improve bandes’ internal processes. The primary conclusion is that the <b>bandes</b> suggestion system is still in the learning and maturation process. Furthermore, systematic routines and tools for innovation in <b>bandes</b> have proved to be an important contribution to the improvement of its internal processes and as a channel of communication and employee participation...|$|R

5|$|Mercer {{travels to}} a bohemian pottery-making commune in Shelter Cove, California where Arlen once lived, but learns that {{he moved to}} Reno, Nevada. He passes through Fallon, Nevada {{to meet up with}} the seductive Joely (Jena Malone), his middle school crush. In Reno, they take ecstasy and almost have sex before Mercer resumes his search for Arlen. Later he finds himself on the set of a pornographic film, where the {{director}} (Julio Oscar Mechoso) tells him that Arlen left to work at a pet store in Sacramento, California. Joely asks Mercer if he can drive her cousin Buddy (Colin Fickes) and his friend Rid (William Lee Scott) to Mojave, California, where they are building their own car. While driving, Mercer finds Kate's YMCA card in the trunk of her car and, now knowing what she looks like, describes a dream to her in which he, Joely, and Kate are dancing in a re-enactment of <b>Bande</b> à parts dance sequence. Not wanting to get sidetracked, he tries to leave the others behind in a motel room, but when Buddy threatens to steal the car, Mercer tells him that the car belongs to his girlfriend, and Buddy, Rid, and Joely leave without Mercer in Kate's car. He hitchhikes to Mojave and finds the salvage yard where Buddy and Rid are working, and retrieves the car.|$|E
5|$|The Bahamanis {{introduced}} the large-scale use {{of paper in}} administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as Deccani architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka. The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The <b>Bande</b> Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example). Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal {{are some of the}} palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning (madrasa) built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also famous. In the later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the Pardeshi Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.|$|E
25|$|As a {{major step}} in this {{remarkable}} attempt at literary standardization, the bi-lingual glossary known as the Mahavyutpatti (sgra-sbyor bam-po gnyis-pa) was successfully accomplished in the Tibetan horse year (814 CE). Another great achievement was the cataloguing of the collections then available in royal libraries of the three famous Tibetan palaces {{under the supervision of}} the famous translator <b>Bande</b> sKa-ba dpal-brtsegs with help from his colleagues, <b>Bande</b> chos-kyi snying-po, Lo-tsa-wa <b>Bande</b> debendhara, <b>Bande</b> lhun-po and <b>Bande</b> klu’-dbang-po etc. The earliest catalogue compilation was recorded from the manuscript of the royal collection housed in the palace- pho-brang ‘phang-thang ka-med kyi gtsug-lag-kang in the Tibetan dog year. (818 CE) This cataloguing work became famous by the name of the palace and known as dkar-chag phang-thang-ma. Soon afterwards two further catalogues of collections available in two other royal libraries- pho-brang bsam-yas mchims-phu-ma and pho-brang stong-thang ldan-dkar were compiled and came to be known as dkar-chag mchims-phu-ma and dkar-chag ldan-dkar-ma respectively. dkar-chag ldan-dkar-ma was compiled in the dragon year (824 CE).|$|E

25|$|These are {{the first}} Tibetan {{catalogues}} in three versions that were compiled and published {{in the beginning of}} the ninth century by the great sgra-sgyur gyi lo-tsa-wa <b>Bande</b> sKa-ba dpal-brtsegs and his team.

All the later compilers of the Tibetan Canon based their works extensively on sKa-ba dpal-brtsegs creation.|$|E
