40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the potential of}} bio-dimethyl ether (DME) as a promising fuel for India in the transportation sector where a majority of imported petroleum {{in the form of}} diesel is used. Specifically, the suitability of DME in terms of its properties vis-a-vis those of diesel, ability to liquefy DME at low pressures similar to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and ease of production from renewable feedstock (biomass), and most importantly, very low emissions including near-zero soot levels are some of the features that make it an attractive option. A detailed review presents the state-of-the-art on various aspects such as estimates of potential <b>bio-DME</b> production, methods of synthesis of <b>bio-DME,</b> important physicochemical properties, fuel-injection system-related concerns (both conventional and common-rail system), fuel spray characteristics which have a direct bearing on the engine performance, and finally, exhaust emissions. Future research directions covering all aspects from production to utilization are summarized (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics. doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 3489529...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the performance and/or CO 2 intensities of a <b>Bio-DME</b> (Biomass Di-methyl Ether) production system, considering the differences of biomass feedstock. In the past LCA studies on an energy chain model, {{there is little}} knowledge on the differences of biomass feedstock and/or available condition. Thus, in this paper, we selected Papua New Guinea (PNG) which has good potential for supply of an energy crop (a short rotation forestry), and Japan where wood remnants are available, as model areas. Also, we referred to 9 species of biomass feedstock of PNG, and to 8 species in Japan. The system boundary on our LCA consists of (1) the pre-treatment process, (2) the energy conversion process, and (3) the fuel transportation process. Especially, since the pre-treatment process has uncertainties related to the moisture content of biomass feedstock, {{as well as the}} distance from the cultivation site to the energy plant, we considered them by the Monte Carlo simulation. Next, we executed the process design of the <b>Bio-DME</b> production system based on the basic experimental results of pyrolysis and char gasification reactions. Due to these experiments, the gas components of pyrolysis and the gasification rate under H 2 O (steam) and CO 2 were obtained. Also, we designed the pressurized fluid-bed gasification process. In a liquefaction process, that is, a synthesis process of DME, the result based on an equilibrium constant was used. In the proposed system, a steam turbine for an auxiliary power was assumed to be equipped, too. The energy efficiencies are 39. 0 - 56. 8 LHV-%, depending upon the biomass species. Consequently, CO 2 intensities in the whole system were 16. 3 - 47. 2 Â g-CO 2 /MJ-DME in the Japan case, and 12. 2 - 36. 7 Â g-CO 2 /MJ-DME in the PNG one, respectively. Finally, using the results of CO 2 intensities and energy efficiencies, we obtained the regression equations as parameters of hydrogen content and heating value of a feedstock. These equations will be extremely significant when we install the BTL (biomass-to-liquid, ex. <b>Bio-DME)</b> energy system in the near future, in order to mitigate CO 2 emissions effectively, and to estimate the energy's efficiency. <b>Bio-DME</b> (Biomass Di-methyl Ether) LCA methodology Monte Carlo simulation The regression analysis...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of biomass}} in the {{production}} of plastics can contribute to the depletion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and secondarily to partially fulfill the growing demand for plastics expected in the near future. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the production of ethylene, one of the most important commodities in the petrochemical industry, via the dehydration of bioethanol and the conversion of bio-dimethyl ether (<b>bio-DME)</b> into olefins. Four case studies have been developed taking into account the different origins of bioethanol, and one for the conversion of <b>bio-DME.</b> The assessment includes current and promising processes for the production of bioethanol, i. e., 1 st generation and 2 nd generation bioethanol. The latter comprises biochemical processing (enzymatic hydrolysis), thermochemical processing (both direct and indirect syntheses from syngas) and hybrid processing (fermentation of syngas) of biomass. The results show that two of the considered case studies (Brazilian ethanol and ethanol via indirect synthesis from syngas) enable the cost-competitive production of ethylene at current market prices. If BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) is taken into account for the case studies, the results would be substantially enhanced and all cases, except for the case of bioethanol from biochemical processing, would be profitable.

40|$|YesProcess {{simulation}} of a single-step synthesis of DME based on CO 2 -enhanced gasification of rice straw was conducted using Aspen PlusTM. The process consists of gasification unit, heat recovery unit, gas purification unit, single-step DME synthesis, and DME separation unit. In the simulation, highly pure DME {{was produced by}} the control of CO 2 concentration in syngas to a very low level prior to synthesis. A gasification system efficiency of 36. 7 % and CO 2 emission of 1. 31 kg/kg of DME were achieved. <b>Bio-DME</b> production based on CO 2 -enhanced gasification of biomass {{was found to be}} more cost-effective as it required 19. 6 % less biomass than that of DME production based on conventional biomass gasification. The performance and environmental benefits of the proposed process could be further improved by the utilization of unreacted gases and the handling of CO 2 generated via incorporating poly-generation concept or carbon storage, which could also potentially improve process economics.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{utilization}} of solid carbonaceous wastes, the mitigation of CO 2 {{and the development of}} CO 2 -based chemical production process which is divided into three main parts. The first part consists of the investigation of solid carbonaceous samples behaviours under pyrolysis and combustion processes. The second part covers experimental study of CO 2 gasification aiming at the identification of interactions during co-gasification. Here, the presence of interactions will be further discussed, particularly in terms of increasing the gasification rate of low reactive carbonaceous sample and the effect of pyrolysis heating methods on gasification reactivity. The last part considers the thermodynamic assessment of conventional and CO 2 -enhanced biomass gasification. The objective is to identify the influence of CO 2 as a gasifying agent in biomass gasification. Moreover, the comparisons study of <b>bio-DME</b> production based on conventional and CO 2 -enhanced gasification was also carried out in this thesis. (i) Pyrolysis of NMPCBS and combustion of solid carbonaceous materials This part consists of investigation of solid carbonaceous samples behaviours under pyrolysis and combustion processes. The objective is to explore the feasibility of the utilization of non-metallic part of waste printed circuit boards (NMPCB), including the thermal behaviours of NMPCB and its blends with two types of coals by using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). For individual sample, the results showed that the NMPCB had the fastest rate of pyrolysis and the highest maximum weight loss rate compared with coals, thus, the highest reactivity. These were attributed to the thermal degradation properties of the constituent elements in NMPCB. Meanwhile, based on kinetic study, it is evident that the lower heating rates favoured the pyrolysis process. For blends, it was revealed that there was 6...|$|E
