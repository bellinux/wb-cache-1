40|$|Reaction of {{hydrated}} copper(II) 2 -chloro-benzoate with beta-/gamma-picoline in methanol: water mixture (4 : 1 v/v) yielded polymeric [cu(2 -chlorobenzoate) (2) (<b>beta-picoline)</b> (2) (mu-H 2 O) ](n); 1 and monomeric [Cu(2 -chlorobenzoate) (2) (gamma-picoline) (2) (H 2 O) ]; 2. The newly synthesized complexes {{have been}} characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, TGA and single crystal X-ray structure determination. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that both complexes crystallize in the monoclinic crystal system with space group and unit cell dimensions: (C 2 /c; a = 51. 71 angstrom, b = 10. 58 angstrom, c = 10. 02 angstrom and beta = 100. 5 degrees for 1 and P 2 (1) /c; a = 11. 81 angstrom, b = 16. 33 angstrom, c = 13. 79 angstrom and beta = 90. 77 degrees for 2. Whereas in 1 the presence of constituent and mediating water molecules running along a-axis gives rise to 1 -dimensional zig-zag polymer chains, in complex 2, the presence of square pyramidal arrangement of ligands around copper(II) center results in monomeric structure. Various non-covalent interactions like O-H [...] . O, C-H [...] . O and C-H [...] . pi have been observed to play a decisive role in the stabilization of crystal lattices in both complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{coordination}} {{behavior of}} 2 -chloro- 4 -fluorobenzoate and 2, 4 -dichlorobenzoate ligands towards copper(II) ion were investigated {{in the presence}} of different nitrogen ligands. Four new copper(II) complexes, [trans-Cu(2 -Cl- 4 -FC 7 H 3 O 2) (2) (beta-pic) (2) ] 1, [trans-Cu(en) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ](2 -Cl- 4 -FC 7 H 3 O 2) (2), 2, [trans-Cu(2, 4 -Cl 2 C 7 H 3 O 2) (2) (beta-pic) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ], 3 and [trans-Cu(en) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ](2, 4 -Cl 2 C 7 H 3 O 2) (2). 2 H(2) O, 4, (where beta-pic = <b>beta-picoline,</b> en = ethylenediamine) were synthesized by addition of beta-picoline/ethylenediamine to the respective hydrated copper(II) arylcarboxylate suspended in methanol-water (4 : 1) mixture at room temperature. The newly synthesized complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, TGA, spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR and UV-Vis), conductance, magnetic susceptibility studies. Single-crystal X-ray structure determination of the complexes revealed the presence of neutral structure in complexes 1 and 3 whereas complexes 2 and 4 possess ionic structure consisting of complex cation [trans-Cu (en) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ](2 +) and two 2 -chloro- 4 -fluorobenzoate/ 2, 4 -dichlorobenzoate as counter anions. The crystal lattice in these copper(II) complexes is stabilized by various non-covalent interactions such as N-H [...] . O, O-H [...] . O hydrogen bonds and other weaker interactions including C-H [...] . pi, C-H [...] halogen and halogen [...] . halogen ones. A comparison of non-covalent interactions in four copper(II) complexes is also discussed...|$|E
