It is a hardy bunchgrass which grows in many types of urban, cultivated, and disturbed habitat. It is a weed of many types of agricultural crops, growing in vineyards and fields. Herbicide-resistant strains have been noted.|$|E

This site also produced {{some of the earliest}} evidence for crops of African origin in South India, including both hyacinth bean and pearl millet. In the later Iron Age period finger millet, kodo millet, and rice Ornaments made of carnelian, ceramic, gold and antler were also found. Apart from the bones of the horse; bones of cattle, sheep, goat and dog were found.|$|E
40|$|Goss’s {{bacterial}} wilt and blight, caused by Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis (Cmn), has reemerged {{as an important}} disease of Zea mays (corn) in the U. S. Midwest. Results from a 2011 multistate survey indicated that Setaria spp. (foxtail) were often present in corn fields {{with a history of}} Cmn. The objective of this research was to determine if Setaria spp. that are common in the Midwest are susceptible to infection by Cmn. In the greenhouse, seedlings of four Setaria spp., including S. viridis (green foxtail), S. faberi (giant foxtail), S. verticillata (<b>bristly</b> <b>foxtail),</b> and S. pumila (yellow foxtail), and Zea mays (Golden Cross Bantam sweet corn, GCB) were inoculated with a suspension of 1. 0 × 107 bacteria cells. The trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design and repeated once. Percent of symptomatic leaf area was visually estimated eight days after inoculation. S. faberi exhibited the highest levels of disease among the four Setaria spp., with disease incidence similar to what was observed on Z. mays. S. viridis was the next most susceptible. Symptoms were also observed on S. viridis, S. verticillata, and were lowest for S. pumila. Bacterial streaming was confirmed microscopically and Cmn was reisolated from the four Setaria species. Results indicate that these four Setaria spp. are susceptible to Cmn, thus serving as potential sources of inoculum...|$|E
40|$|Goss’s {{bacterial}} wilt and blight (Goss’s wilt) {{is a serious}} and sometimes severe disease of corn. Goss’s wilt was first identified in Dawson County Nebraska in 1969. Today Goss’s wilt {{can be found in}} two countries including the U. S. and Canada, and twelve states including Nebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Goss’s wilt was observed in Nebraska throughout the 1970 ’s, and from the early 1980 ’s until recently developed only sporadically. Around 2006, a re-emergence of the disease was observed in western Nebraska, northeast Colorado, and southeast Wyoming. Since then, reports of the disease have been rapidly increasing north, south, and east, and has been reported across the entire Corn Belt. A survey was implemented to determine what agronomic and environmental factors may be contributing to this development and increased incidence in corn growing regions of the U. S. The survey showed that the Goss’s wilt rating assigned by seed companies, planting population density, planting date in 2011, crop rotation, and percent crop residue cover were all important factors to whether or not a field tested positive to Goss’s wilt. A second study was implemented to determine if the bacterial pathogen had genetic differences based on geographical origin. The study used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and a box polymerase chain reaction (BOX-PCR) to separate isolates based on differences in DNA banding patterns. The study concluded that Cmn isolates were genetically similar across the entire sampling region, and isolates with similar banding patterns could be found in all states included in the survey. A third study was implemented to test if alternate hosts of the pathogen may be playing a role in the dissemination and survival of the pathogen. Results from the study indicate that three species of foxtail were alternate hosts to Cmn. These included yellow, giant, and <b>bristly</b> <b>foxtail.</b> These results will help producers better manage and potentially prevent Goss’s wilt in the future.

40|$|Maize is an {{important}} income generating food crop in Tanzania. However, yields remain low due to several limiting factors including among others diseases caused by fungi and viruses. The threat caused by several biotic factors in the country was further worsened with an outbreak of maize lethal necrosis (MLN) disease in 2012 in Arusha and Mwanza regions. Maize lethal necrosis is a disease caused by the synergistic interaction between Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). Of these two, MCMV is a new virus in the African continent, first recognized in an MLN outbreak in Kenya, whereas SCMV {{is known to be}} endemic in Africa. This study focused on understanding the extent of MLN spread in north-central regions of Tanzania by conducting surveys between February and June, 2015. A total of 163 farmers‘ fields were sampled, in 14 districts in Arusha, Dodoma and Manyara regions. Incidence and severity were estimated based on MLN symptoms such as chlorosis, mottling and necrosis. The Enzyme – linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods were used for the detection of MCMV and SCMV in field samples. Disease severity assessed on a 1 to 5 rating scale varied from 2 to 3. 6, with an overall mean incidence of 16. 1 %. Thirty nine percent of the samples tested positive to MCMV, 22 % for SCMV and 5. 5 % for both MCMV and SCMV. A total of 254 non-maize crops and weeds tested for MCMV and SCMV, revealed SCMV in 7 samples (2. 8 %) in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarium), finger millet (Eleusine coracana), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and <b>bristly</b> <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria verticillata). The nucleotide sequence of the coat protein region of MCMV showed very high levels of homology (99 %) between MCMV from Tanzania and those from Kenya and other countries. However, the SCMV nucleotide sequence of the coat protein region was divergent by up to 11 %, compared to other isolates. This study confirmed the occurrence of MLN in 13 / 14 districts surveyed and also showed that SCMV occurs in maize as well as other cereal hosts. Further study of pathogen diversity and factors contributing towards disease occurrence is recommended as interventions for disease management are developed and deployed at various levels.
