5|$|The Chicago-style, glass-and-concrete {{skyscraper}} {{incorporated into}} its design several historic 19th-century buildings that lined Walnut Street. These buildings included three Federal-style rowhouses built in 1807 called York Row and the Italianate-style former {{headquarters of the}} Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, built in 1868–1869. After lying vacant and neglected for years, {{the only part of}} York Row preserved were the rowhouses' facades. Only a <b>back</b> <b>portion</b> of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society building was demolished, the rest being incorporated as retail and office space.|$|E

The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library was slated for another expansion in 2014 which would add another floor to the <b>back</b> <b>portion</b> of the facility. Due to the renovations, the Mariner's Museum library will remain closed through Fall 2017.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper lip}} is formed {{earlier than the}} palate, from the first three lobes named a to c above. Formation of the palate is the last step in joining the five {{embryonic}} facial lobes, and involves the <b>back</b> <b>portions</b> of the lobes b and c. These <b>back</b> <b>portions</b> are called palatal shelves, which grow towards each other until they fuse in the middle. This process is very vulnerable to multiple toxic substances, environmental pollutants, and nutritional imbalance. The biologic mechanisms of mutual recognition of the two cabinets, {{and the way they}} are glued together, are quite complex and obscure despite intensive scientific research.|$|R
25|$|Various {{ornaments}} of {{the nasal}} boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of Pachyrhinosaurus. Both P. lakustai and P. perotorum bore a jagged, comb-like extension {{at the tip of}} the boss which was missing in P. canadensis. P. perotorum was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the <b>back</b> <b>portion</b> {{of the nasal}} boss, and P. lakustai had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of P. canadensis was mainly flat on top and rounded). P. perotorum bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and down from the top edge of the frill, and P. lakustai bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes.|$|E
500|$|The {{naming of}} these first {{specimens}} was disputed. Leopold Fitzinger named the animal Batrachosaurus in 1837. In 1841, the English palaeontologist Richard Owen {{referred to the}} genus as Labyrinthodon to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth. Owen thought that the name Mastodonsaurus [...] "ought not to be retained, because it recalls unavoidably {{the idea of the}} mammalian genus Mastodon, or else a mammilloid form of the tooth... and because the second element of the word, saurus, indicates a false affinity, the remains belonging, not to the Saurian, but to the Batrachian order of Reptiles." [...] Owen recognized that the animal was not a [...] "saurian" [...] reptile, yet he also referred Jaeger's Phytosaurus to the genus. Although the two genera have similarly sized conical teeth, Phytosaurus was later found to be a crocodile-like reptile. Additional material, including skulls, firmly placed Labyrinthodon as an amphibian. Jaeger also named Salamandroides giganteus in 1828, basing it on partial occiput, or <b>back</b> <b>portion</b> of the skull. In 1833, he described a complete skull of S. giganteus that had the same teeth as his Mastodonsaurus, making it the first known complete skull of a temnospondyl. Because Mastodonsaurus was named first, it has precedence over the other names as a senior subjective synonym. Batrachosaurus is still used as the name of an unrelated brachyopid temnospondyl.|$|E
500|$|In general, meat ants are {{medium to}} large in size, {{measuring}} , {{and can be}} easily recognised by their dark-bluish body and red head. Generally, their heads and pronotums share similar colours and are lighter than the mesothorax (the middle of the three segments in the thorax) and the propodeum (the first abdominal segment), which are reddish brown. However, the head may sometimes be lighter, and the pronotum and mesothorax may share similar colours. The mesosomal setae (as in haur found on the mesosoma) are dark and sometimes translucent. The iridescence between the compound eyes and the lateral portion of the head ranges from slightly purple to strong and dark purple. The colour of the legs and coxae (the basal segment of the insect leg, which attaches to the body) are darker than the mesothorax, and the petiole (narrow waist) is reddish brown and also darker than the mesothorax. The lateral portion of the second gastral tergite (a dorsal segment other than the head) is shiny, and the iridescence varies among workers, from green or blue to plain green and purple. The soft hairs on the head are frequent around the occipital margin, and around the mandibular insertion, three to eight pale setae are usually seen. The soft hairs are also common around the first gastral tergite. Examined specimens show no known ocelli. Erect setae on the pronotum are abundant. The [...] (meaning in front and toward the <b>back)</b> <b>portion</b> of the propodeum is arched and flat.|$|E

50|$|In 1627, Wallenstein’s {{counter-attack}} {{forced the}} withdrawal of the Danish army from Moravia and sent the Vlachs into retreat. By 1630, Vlachs controlled only their Carpathian strongholds. The final Vlach uprising occurred in 1640, when the Swedes invaded Moravia to do battle with the Habsburgs. Combined Vlach-Swede forces won <b>back</b> <b>portions</b> of Moravia, but then the Swedes withdrew in 1643 to concentrate on a war with Denmark.|$|R

500|$|Fur colour varies greatly {{and changes}} with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and brown hyena, {{that of the}} spotted hyena {{consists}} of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed {{on the back and}} hind quarters. The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, deep brown or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly [...] in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present {{on the back of the}} neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the <b>back</b> <b>portion</b> of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring [...] ) and long, stout bristle hairs (...) [...] European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts.|$|E
500|$|In m2, the trigonid (the front {{portion of}} the tooth) {{consists}} of three very distinct cusps: the paraconid at the front, and behind it the paired protoconid (on the buccal side) and metaconid (on the lingual side). These three cusps are less discrete in Afrotarsius. The paraconid is distinct from the paracristid, the crest that connects it to the protoconid, and is located more lingually than in Afrotarsius. Between this cusp and the metaconid behind it, the central basin of the trigonid is open towards the lingual margin of the tooth. The protoconid has a V shape, with one arm reaching towards the metaconid and the other towards the paraconid. The <b>back</b> <b>portion</b> of the tooth, the talonid, is broader; Eosimias has a narrower talonid. The main cusps, the buccal hypoconid and lingual entoconid, are opposite {{each other on the}} margins of the tooth (the entoconid is further to the front in Phenacopithecus). A crest, the cristid obliqua, connects the front side of the hypoconid to the protoconid. It is nearly in line with the main axis of the tooth, contrasting with its more diagonal position in Eosimias and Phenacopithecus. [...] A crest, the postcristid, descends from the hypoconid along the back margin of the tooth and almost reaches the entoconid, which is separated by a notch. It incorporates the third talonid cusp, the hypoconulid, which is indistinct in Afrasia. In Afrotarsius and eosimiids (except the Pakistani Phileosimias), this crest reaches the entoconid. There is a cingulum, or shelf, on the buccal side of m2.|$|E
