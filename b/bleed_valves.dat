50|$|The {{propellant}} {{feed system}} consists of separate fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (the bearings {{of which were}} lubricated by the fluid being pumped because the extremely low operating temperature of the engine precluded use of lubricants or other fluids), several valves (including the main fuel valve, main oxidizer valve, propellant utilization valve and fuel and oxidizer <b>bleed</b> <b>valves),</b> fuel and oxidizer flowmeters, and interconnecting lines.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{operating}} pressure was maintained by an automatically controlled <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> once the plant had reached steady state, the valve {{could not be used}} during start-up, when there was no air feed, the plant being pressurised with nitrogen. During start-up the <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> was normally isolated and there was no route for excess pressure to escape; pressure was kept within acceptable limits (slightly wider that those achieved under automatic control) by operator intervention (manual operation of vent valves).

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>valve.</b> The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R

Additionally, detection of the simulated failure of the 14 th stage stability <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and, to a lesser extent, the station 2. 5 stability <b>bleed</b> <b>valve,</b> to their fully-open fail-safe positions was achieved by means of spectral comparisons between nominal (normal valve operation) and seeded fault scenarios...|$|R
50|$|When {{the engine}} cutoff signal was {{received}} by the electrical control package, it de-energized the main-stage and ignition phase solenoid valves and energized the helium control solenoid de-energizer timer. This, in turn, permitted closing pressure to the main fuel, main oxidizer, gas generator control, and augmented spark igniter valves. The oxidizer turbine bypass valve and propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> opened and the gas generator and LOX dome purges were initiated.|$|E
50|$|This type of Double Block and <b>Bleed</b> <b>Valves</b> have a {{patented}} design which incorporates two {{ball valves}} and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections.

50|$|Start {{sequence}} {{was initiated}} by supplying energy to two spark plugs {{in the gas}} generator and two in the augmented spark igniter for ignition of the propellants. Next, two solenoid valves were actuated; one for helium control, and one for ignition phase control. Helium was routed to hold the propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> closed and to purge the thrust chamber LOX dome, the LOX pump intermediate seal, and the gas generator oxidizer passage. In addition, the main fuel and ASI oxidizer valves were opened, creating an ignition flame in the ASI chamber that passed {{through the center of}} the thrust chamber injector.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} in using a Double Block and <b>Bleed</b> <b>Valve.</b> Significantly, {{because all the}} valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.|$|R

50|$|Around 3 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds after {{taking off from}} Irkutsk, at an {{altitude}} of 4.000 ft, the engine no 2 suddenly failed. A destruction occurred on the engines air starter that did not shut down after the engine was started and continued to operate at high revs (over 40,000 rpm) with open air <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> from the engines. The rotating disk of the turbine then flew from the starter's compartment and entered the engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines. The hydraulic system elements, broke through the rear case of the combustion chamber and left the engine. The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of flames on the engine no 2. The engine no 2 burst into flames.|$|E
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|E
50|$|To provide {{third stage}} restart {{capability}} for the Saturn V, the J-2 gaseous hydrogen start tank was refilled in 60 seconds {{during the previous}} firing after the engine had reached steady-state operation (refill of the gaseous helium tank was not required because the original ground-fill supply was sufficient for three starts). Prior to engine restart, the stage ullage rockets were fired to settle the propellants in the stage propellant tanks, ensuring a liquid head to the turbopump inlets. In addition, the engine propellant <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> were opened, the stage recirculation valve was opened, the stage prevalve was closed, and a LOX and LH2 circulation was effected through the engine bleed system for five minutes to condition the engine to the proper temperature to ensure proper engine operation. Engine restart was initiated after the “engine ready” signal was received from the stage. This {{was similar to the}} initial “engine ready”. The hold time between cutoff and restart was from a minimum of 1.5 hours to a maximum of 6 hours, depending upon the number of earth orbits required to attain the lunar window for translunar trajectory.|$|E

During stall incep-tion, the tip clearance vortex moved away from the suction surface of the roughened blade’s upper neighbour, leading to vortex breakdown. The stall cell was found to propagate opposite the direction of the blade rotation at about 30 per cent of rotational speed. The effect of air bleeding on stabilizing the compressor is also studied in this work. The mean mass flowrate removed from the <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> was 1. 2 per cent of the mainstream flowrate.

40|$|Active {{control of}} {{rotating}} stall and surge using <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> {{has been demonstrated}} on low and high speed compressors using high bandwidth actuators. In this paper we provide a method to reduce the bandwidth and rate requirements for control of rotating stall by combining an axisymmetric bleed valve with continuous air injection. The addition of the continuous air injection is modeled as a shift of both the stable and unstable parts of the compressor characteristic and serves to reduce the requirement of a bleed valve used for rotating stall stabilization purpose. The results are demonstrated using a lowspeed, single stage, axial flow compressor. 1. Introduction Rotating stall and surge {{are two types of}} instabilities that occur in the axial flow compressor part of a gas-turbine engine. Rotating stall is a flow separation that travels around the annulus of the compressor (referred to as a stall cell) while surge is a large axial oscillation of the flow.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the actuator rate requirements {{for control of}} rotating stall using a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and provide tools for predicting these requirements. Modification of both the stable and unstable parts of the compressor characteristic via addition of continuous air injection serves to reduce the requirement of a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> used {{for the purpose of}} rotating stall stabilization. Analytical tools based on low order models (2 - 3 states) and simulation tools based on a reduced order model (37 states) are described.

40|$|Multiple-spool gas {{turbines}} are usually utilized for power supply in aircrafts, ships, and terrestrial electric utility plants. As a result, having a reliable model {{of them can}} aid with the control design process and stability analysis. Since several interconnected components are coupled both thermodynamically and through shafts, these engines cannot be modeled linearly as single shaft {{gas turbines}}. In this paper, intercomponent volume method (ICV) has been implemented for turbine modeling. A switched feedback control system incorporating bump-less transfer and antiwindup functionality is employed as governor for the engine. Validation with test results from a three spool gas turbine highlights high accuracy of turbine-governor model in various maneuvers. Results show that over-speed after load rejection is considerable {{due to the fact}} that in this arrangement, the power turbine (PT) is not coupled with the compressor which acts like a damper for single shaft gas turbines. To address this problem, <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> (mainly before combustion chamber) are used to arrest the over-speed by 20 %.

40|$|Feedback {{stabilization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominant issues in modern control theory. The validity of linear control design is based on the assumption that the system is stabilizable. With rapid broadening of control applications to complex systems during the past two decades, the attainability of linear stabilizability sometimes has to compromise with system constraints and affordability of distributed actuation. The goal of this thesis is to tackle some of the problems in control of nonequilibrium behavior and to apply the theory to active control of fluid instabilities in gas turbine engines. We consider two of the simplest nontrivial scenarios in local smooth feedback stabilization: the steady-state case, when the linearly unstabilizable eigenvalue is zero; and the Hopf case, when the unstabilizable eigenvalues are a pair of pure imaginary numbers. Under certain nondegeneracy conditions, we give explicit algebraic conditions for stabilizability. And when the system is stabilizable, the stabilizing feedback can be explicitly constructed. The problem of local smooth feedback stabilization for systems with critical unstabilizable modes is closely related to bifurcation control. Under certain nondegeneracy conditions, a steady-state/Hopf bifurcation can be turned into a supercritical pitchfork/Hopf bifurcation if and only if the system is locally stabilizable at the bifurcation point. Algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which the criticality of a simple steady-state or Hopf bifurcation can be changed to supercritical by a smooth feedback. The effects of magnitude saturation, bandwidth, and rate limits are important issues in control engineering. We give qualitative estimates of the region of attraction to the stabilized bifurcating equilibrium/periodic orbits under these constraints. We apply the above theoretical results to the Moore-Greitzer model in active control of rotating stall and surge in gas turbine engines. Though linear stabilizability can be achieved using distributed actuation, it limits the practical usefulness due to considerations of affordability and reliability. On the other hand, simple but practically promising actuation schemes such as outlet <b>bleed</b> <b>valves,</b> a couple of air injectors, and magnetic bearings will make the system loss of linear stabilizability, thus the control design becomes a challenging task. The above mentioned results in bifurcation stabilization can be applied to these cases. We analyze the effects of magnitude and rate saturations in active stall and surge control using <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> and magnetic bearings using the Moore-Greitzer model. The analytical formulas for bleed valve actuation give good qualitative predictions when compared with experiments. Our conclusion is that these constraints are serious limiting factors in stall control and must be addressed in practical implementation to the aircraft engines...|$|E
