500|$|In 1988 he {{was asked}} by Caernarfon Council to make repairs to a chimney at Parc Glynllifon. [...] Beneath the chimney, an engine room {{contained}} an 1854 single-cylinder steam engine in poor condition. [...] Dibnah repaired the chimney and several weeks later was asked to repair the engine, which he dismantled {{during the winter of}} 1988/89 and took back to Bolton. [...] With his assistant Neil Carney, he spent six months repairing the engine. [...] The two sourced a replacement boiler from a local pork pie factory and re-installed the engine in Wales. [...] Dibnah later won a prize for the quality of the restoration work. [...] He also spent about seven months restoring the boiler, engine and <b>blunger</b> at Wetheriggs Pottery near Penrith.|$|E
5000|$|In the potbanks around Stoke-on-Trent the <b>blunger</b> was {{fed by the}} [...] "sliphouse <b>blunger</b> charger" [...] who {{was often}} {{assisted}} by the [...] "sliphouse <b>blunger</b> charger's mate". Different types and amounts of clay and marl had to be shovelled in manually to be mixed with water.|$|E
50|$|A <b>blunger</b> is {{a machine}} {{commonly}} used in the pottery industry for mixing clay and water. A <b>blunger</b> usually consists of a round or octagonal tank with a mixer. Clay {{is added to the}} water-filled <b>blunger</b> and then mixed into a slurry, which is also called slip. The electrical charge of the clay is neutralized by the addition of a deflocculant, which assists in keeping the particles in suspension. This slip can be then sieved as it is emptied from the <b>blunger.</b>|$|E

50|$|Slipcasting or {{slip casting}} is a {{technique}} for the mass-production of pottery and ceramics, especially for shapes not easily made on a wheel. Slipcast ware {{should not be confused}} with slipware, which is pottery formed by any technique that is decorated using slip. In slipcasting, a liquid clay body slip (usually mixed in a <b>blunger)</b> is poured into plaster moulds and allowed to form a layer, the cast, on the inside walls of the mould.|$|E
50|$|An {{additive}} with deflocculant properties, such as sodium silicate, can {{be added}} to the slip to disperse the raw material particles. This allows a higher solids content to be used, or allows a fluid slip to be produced with the a minimum of water so that drying shrinkage is minimised, which is important during slipcasting. Usually the mixing of slip is undertaken in a <b>blunger</b> although it can be done using other types of mixers or even by hand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{enterprise}} {{was provided}} with fuel (coal) via a siding from the Eden Valley railway line, when the railway closed in 1962 the pottery kiln {{fell out of}} use. The beehive kiln remains, as does a <b>blunger</b> for preparing suitable clay. The steam engine used to drive the pottery machinery was restored in the 1990s by Fred Dibnah. Facilities built for visitors including a museum.Pottery making was revived at Wetheriggs, as the only remaining steam-powered pottery in the country. Mary Chappelhow became the master potter at Wetheriggs in 2003: production has since ceased at the site, but she works at Brougham Hall.|$|E
