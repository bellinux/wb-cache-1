The empirical model uses as explanatory variables domestic output growth, price inflation, real exchange rate fluctuations, energy price inflation, global growth, and regional growth. The evidence from the estimation of the model indicates the importance of fluctuations in output growth to the cyclicality of the current and financial account balances. The necessary and sufficient condition to sustain a large current account deficit is high domestic growth, which tends to stimulate financial inflows and provides adequate resources for financing.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{balanced}} current control {{strategy for the}} current source rectifier (CSR) stage of an indirect matrix converter (IMC) under unbalanced grid voltage conditions. If the three-phase grid connected to the voltage source inverter (VSI) of the IMC has unbalanced voltage conditions, it affects the currents of the CSR stage and VSI stage, and the currents are distorted. Above all, the distorted currents of the CSR stage cause instability in the overall system, which can affect {{the life span of}} the system. Therefore, in this paper, a control strategy for <b>balanced</b> <b>currents</b> in the CSR stage is proposed. To achieve <b>balanced</b> <b>currents</b> in the CSR stage, the VSI stage should receive DC power without ripple components from the CSR stage. This is implemented by controlling the currents in the VSI stage. Therefore, the proposed control strategy decouples the positive and negative phase-sequence components existing in the unbalanced voltages and currents of the VSI stage. Using the proposed control strategy under unbalanced grid voltage conditions, the stability and life span of the overall system can be improved. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} two control algorithms for grid-tied three-phase inverters {{for renewable}} energy systems under unbalanced grid voltages. The algorithms {{are focused on the}} quality of the injected currents, so they are used to inject <b>balanced</b> <b>currents</b> despite the voltage unbalances. Each algorithm is composed of three control loops: the reference signal generation, the reference signal synchronization and the curent controller. The first control loop generates the reference currents in order to regulate the active and the reactive powers delivered to the grid by the renewable energy system. The second loop is used to estimate the positive sequence component of the grid voltage. The last control loop generates the power inverter firing pulses in order to follow the reference current. In this paperare considered two algorithms, one algorithm in the abc coordinates and the other in the dq 0 coordinates. In both cases, it is considered a Kalman filter as the synchronization algorithm. The algorithms performance is evaluated by some simulations in PSIM and a comparative analysis is made between them.

40|$|Abstract. Grid-connected {{high-power}} inverters {{are often}} used in distributed generation and power quality systems.

Each phase of the inverter is made up of three legs in parallel. Besides, the control implemented in this work allows full regulation of the power factor. This way, any desired power factor value can be achieved in order to meet grid-connection requirements. Simulation and experimental results are shown in this paper. Key word...|$|E

40|$|Single-phase {{distributed}} {{energy resources}} (DERs), such as rooftop photovoltaic arrays, are usually installed based on the need and affordability of clients without any regard to the power demand of the connected phase of a three-phase system. It might so happen that the power generation in a particular phase is more than its load demand. This may cause a reverse power flow in a particular phase, especially in a three-phase, four-wire distribution system. If now the load demand {{in the other two}} phases is more than their respective generations, then these two phases will see a forward power flow, while there will be a reverse power flow in the third phase.

40|$|Cortical neurons receive barrages of {{excitatory}} and inhibitory inputs {{which are}} not independent, as network structure and synaptic kinetics impose statistical correlations. Experiments in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated correlations between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in which inhibition lags behind excitation in cortical neurons. This delay arises in feed-forward inhibition circuits and ensures that coincident excitation and inhibition do not preclude neuronal firing. Conversely, inhibition that is too delayed broadens neuronal integration times, thereby diminishing spike-time precision and increasing the firing frequency. This led us to hypothesize that the correlation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs modulates the encoding of information of neural spike trains. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect of such correlations on the information rate (IR) of spike trains using the Hodgkin-Huxley model in which both synaptic and membrane conductances are stochastic. We investigated two different synaptic input regimes: balanced synaptic conductances and <b>balanced</b> <b>currents.</b> Our results show that correlations arising from the synaptic kinetics, tau, and millisecond lags, delta, of inhibition relative to excitation strongly affect the IR of spike trains. In the regime of balanced synaptic currents, for short time lags (delta ~ 1 ms) there is an optimal tau that maximizes the IR of the postsynaptic spike train. Given the short time scales for monosynaptic inhibitory lags and synaptic decay kinetics reported in cortical neurons under physiological contexts, we propose that feed-forward inhibition in cortical circuits is poised to maximize the rate of information transfer between cortical neurons. Our results also provide a possible explanation for how certain drugs and genetic mutations affecting the synaptic kinetics can deteriorate information processing in the brain...|$|E

In practice, good results have not been demonstrated with transconductance-based circuits. In this paper, we prove that inherent mismatch to very large scale integration implementation is the reason. Although previous works consider that the small perturbations of the network parameters lead to small deviations from the ideal behavior, we consider that this is over optimistic. When interactions between nodes are supported by unidirectional building blocks, originally <b>balanced</b> <b>current</b> paths are realized by mismatched elements. In the case of linear diffusion, the singular location of natural frequencies of the system implies that a small perturbation of <b>balanced</b> <b>current</b> paths renders qualitatively different network dynamics.

Several numerical examples are also presented to visualize the consequences of mismatch on the processing.

In spite of their nonlinearity, the resulting network is much more robust to mismatch. This last result coincides with previous studies. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.
