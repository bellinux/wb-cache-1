5000|$|The song [...] "Seven" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{cover of the}} song originally by Sunny Day Real Estate. The title of the song [...] "Peev Shalpatine" [...] is {{a reference to the}} Star Wars character Sheev Palpatine. The song's lyrics predominately feature Alonge re-enacting [...] "The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise" [...] from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. The next song, [...] "Weebi FM," [...] is a post-hardcore parody in the style of Hawthorne Heights with the song's title being a reference to [...] "Niki FM". The song's lyrics describe a young man that has been friend zoned by a girl despite being nice toward her and his distress over it. [...] "Cut the Cord" [...] features guest vocals from Hotel Books. The lyrics are seemingly about a man ending a relationship with a person before it is revealed at the end that he is actually ending his cable services with Comcast. [...] "United We Skarmz" [...] is a screamo song in the style of Pg. 99. The song <b>begins</b> with an <b>audio</b> <b>clip</b> <b>of</b> Donald Trump saying that no other president has been treated as badly as he has while the lyrics reference the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, James Garfield, and Abraham Lincoln. [...] "Ohio Is for Emo Kids" [...] is a medley consisting of snippets of twenty different songs. The lyrics mainly focus on the melodramatic nature of many emo songs, referencing things such as suicide, being bullied, losing a job, and missing a concert; the song ends with the opening riff from [...] "The Words 'Best Friend' Become Redefined" [...] by Chiodos before it is abruptly cut-off with Alonge stating that the song is running too long. The song's title is a reference to [...] "Ohio Is for Lovers" [...] by Hawthorne Heights. The album's final song, [...] "Pink Wednesday," [...] is an acoustic rock song with lyrics inspired by the 2004 film Mean Girls.|$|R
