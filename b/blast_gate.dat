40|$|A Microsoft Windows based {{ventilation}} {{software package}} is developed to reduce time-consuming and boring procedure of exhaust ventilation system design. This program Assure accurate and reliable {{air pollution control}} related calculations. Herein, package is tentatively named Exhaust Ventilation Design Software which is developed in VB 6 programming environment. Most important features of Exhaust Ventilation Design Software that are ignored in formerly developed packages are Collector design and fan dimension data calculations. Automatic system balance is another feature of this package. Exhaust Ventilation Design Software algorithm for design is based on two methods: Balance by design (Static pressure balance) and design by <b>Blast</b> <b>gate.</b> The most important section of software is a spreadsheet that is designed based on American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists calculation sheets. Exhaust Ventilation Design Software is developed so that engineers familiar with American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists datasheet can easily employ it for ventilation systems design. Other sections include Collector design section (settling chamber, cyclone, and packed tower), fan geometry and dimension data section, a unit converter section (that helps engineers to deal with units), a hood design section and a Persian HTML help. Psychometric correction is also considered in Exhaust Ventilation Design Software. In Exhaust Ventilation Design Software design process, efforts are focused on improving GUI (graphical user interface) and use of programming standards in software design. Reliability of software has been evaluated and results show acceptable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} influence and prognostic relevance of CD 25 expression in a retrospective data collection of patients with AML who were treated in the HELIOS Klinikum Berlin-Buch. After a flow cytometrically analyzed expression of the CD 25 antigen, the patients were divided into a CD 25 -positive and a CD 25 -negative group. In the process the correlation and the differences between both groups with regard to age, sex, AML classification, ELN risk group, induction therapy, induction results, cytogenetic and molecular genetics were analyzed. It could be shown that there exists a correlation between CD 25 expression and the differentiation of AML. In this regard, the CD 25 expression increased in patients with undifferentiated leukemias, which was demonstrated by the detection of an increased antigen expression of progenitor markers in CD 25 -positive patients such as CD 34 (p= 0. 032) and CD 117 (p= 0. 001). Moreover, it could be revealed via the flow cytometric examination of the mature granulocytic markers, like for example CD 16 (p= 0. 049) and lactoferrin (p= 0. 042), that CD 25 is expressed to a much lesser extent in patients with granulocytic differentiated leukemias. Furthermore, CD 4 and MPO 7 were to a significant extent more frequently expressed in patients with CD 25 -negative AML than in patients with CD 25 -positive AML (CD 4 p= 0. 048 and MPO 7 p= 0. 014). In addition, the investigations revealed that the proportion of blasts in the CD 45 vs. SSC gate (<b>blast</b> <b>gate)</b> is significantly higher in CD 25 -positive patients than in CD 25 -negative patients (p= 0. 001). With regard to the ELN risk classification, it was shown that the patients with CD 25 -positive AML were completely assigned to the prognostically unfavorable or to the intermediate ELN risk group. No patients with CD 25 -positive AML showed a favorable ELN prognosis, whereas 18 % of the favorable ELN risk class were associated with CD 25 -negative patients (p= 0. 047). The ELN risk assessment was confirmed insofar that the patients with a favorable ELN risk class had a higher survival probability than the patients with an intermediate prognosis, and the survival probability of the latter was again higher than for patients with an unfavorable ELN risk class (p= 0. 005). However, it could not be proven that CD 25 -negative patients had a higher survival probability than CD 25 -positive patients (p= 0. 140). The parameters age, sex, molecular genetics, cytological risk group according to MRC criteria and induction therapy did not show any significant differences in regard to the CD 25 expression...|$|E
40|$|By {{exploiting}} spatiotemporal correlations in cardiac acquisitions using k-t <b>BLAST,</b> <b>gated</b> cine 3 D acquisitions of {{the heart}} were accelerated by a net factor of 4. 3, making single breathhold acquisitions possible. Sparse sampling of k-t space along a sheared grid pattern was implemented into a cine 3 D SSFP sequence. The acquisition of low-resolution training data, which was required to resolve aliasing in the k-t BLAST method, was either interleaved into the sampling process or obtained in a separate prescan to allow for shorter breathhold durations in patients with heart disease. Volumetric datasets covering the heart with 20 slices at a spatial resolution of 2 � 2 � 5 mm 3 were recorded with 20 cardiac phases in a total breathhold duration of 25 – 27 sec, or 18 sec if partial Fourier sampling was additionally employed. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated on healthy volunteers and on patients. The comparison of endocardial area derived from single slices of the 3 D dataset with values extracted from separate single-slice acquisitions showed no significant differences. By shortening the acquisition substantially, k-t BLAST may greatly facilitate volumetric imaging {{of the heart}} for evaluation of regional wall motion and the assessment of ventricular volume and ejection fraction.

50|$|In 1960 the British Aircraft Corporation {{took over}} the {{aircraft}} interests of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. In 1960, an RAF Vulcan bomber, approaching from the west, landed at Filton in heavy rain. The pilot braked, but started to aquaplane. He decided to abort the landing. Although he managed to take-off and eventually land successfully elsewhere, the jet blast from the aircraft's four Bristol Siddeley Olympus 201 engines severely damaged a filling station at {{the eastern end of}} the runway, sent cars spinning on the A38 trunk road and wrecked the boundary fence steel railings. Eyewitnesses claimed that the aircraft barely cleared the engine test beds next to the Bristol to South Wales railway embankment. Subsequently, the filling station was moved further north, to a safer location. In the early 1960s, a new Filton bypass was constructed, roughly parallel to the old one, and this later became part of the M5 motorway. The 1960s and 1970s saw the development and production of Concorde at Filton and a further extension of the Filton runway. The first flight of the Concorde 002 prototype took place on 9 April 1969 at Filton Aerodrome. All other British-built Concordes also used the main Filton runway for their first flights. Because of jet <b>blast,</b> <b>gates</b> and traffic lights were installed to close off the A38 road when Concorde took off. A few Lightning fighters were produced during this period.|$|R

60|$|On {{reading this}} mysterious {{inscription}} his Excellency experienced {{a sudden and}} awful shudder. Lord Moustache, however, who was more used to mysteries, taking up a silver trumpet, which was fixed to the portal by a crimson cord, gave a loud <b>blast.</b> The <b>gates</b> flew open {{with the sound of}} a whirlwind, and Popanilla found himself in what at first appeared an illimitable hall. It was crowded, but perfect order was preserved. The Ambassador was conducted with great pomp to {{the upper end of the}} apartment, where, after an hour's walk, his Excellency arrived. At the extremity of the hall was a colossal and metallic Statue of extraordinary appearance. It represented an armed monarch. The head and bust were of gold, and the curling hair was crowned with an imperial diadem; the body and arms were of silver, worked in the semblance of a complete suit of enamelled armour of the feudal ages; and the thighs and legs were of iron, which the artist had clothed in the bandaged hose of the old Saxons. The figure bore the appearance of great antiquity, but had evidently been often repaired and renovated since its first formation. The workmanship was clearly of different eras, and the reparations, either from ignorance or intention, had often been effected with little deference to the original design. Part of the shoulders had been supplied by the other, though less precious, metal, and the Roman and Imperial ornaments had unaccountably been succeeded by the less classic, though more picturesque, decorations of Gothic armour. On the other hand, a great portion of the chivalric and precious material of the body had been removed, and replaced by a style and substance resembling those of the lower limbs. In its right hand the Statue brandished a naked sword, and with its left leant upon a huge, though extremely rich and elaborately carved, crosier. It trampled upon a shivered lance and a broken chain.|$|R

During the battle Ungern's special detachment of Tibetans, Mongols, Buryats and Russians rescued the Bogd Khan from house arrest and transported him through the Bogd Uul to Manjushri Monastery. At the same time another detachment moved to the mountains east of Urga. On 3 February he gave his soldiers a respite. Borrowing a tactic from Genghis Khan, he ordered his troops to light {{a large number of}} campfires in the hills surrounding Urga, using them as reference points for Rezukhin's detachment. This made the town appear to be surrounded by an overwhelming force. Early on 4 February Ungern launched an assault on the Chinese White barracks from the east and captured them. Then he divided his forces in two parts. The first launched a major assault on the remaining Chinese positions in the Chinese trade settlement ( [...] , Maimaicheng). The second moved westwards towards the part of Urga called Consular Settlement. Upon reaching the Maimaicheng, Ungern had his men smash their way in by <b>blasting</b> the <b>gates</b> with explosives and improvised battering rams. After breaking in, a general slaughter set in, as both sides fought with sabers. After the capture of Maimacheng, Ungern joined his troops attacking Chinese troops at the Consular Settlement. After a Chinese counterattack, Ungern's soldiers retreated a short distance northeast and then launched another attack with the support of another Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which began an attack from the northeast and northwest. Ungern's troops gradually moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers. The capital city was finally taken on the evening of 4 February. Chinese civilian administrators and military commanders abandoned their soldiers and fled northwards from Urga on 11 cars on the night of 3-4 February. Chinese troops fled northward on February 4 and 5. They massacred any Mongolian civilians they encountered along the road from Urga to the Russian border. Russian settlers who supported the Reds moved from Urga together with the fleeing Chinese troops. During the capture of Urga the Chinese lost about 1500 men, while Ungern's forces suffered about 60 casualties.|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{approach for}} the analysis of leukemia associated chromosomal translocations has led to the identification of prognostic relevant subgroups. In pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common translocations, t(9; 22) and t(4; 11), have been associated with a poorer clinical outcome. Recently the TEL gene at chromosome 12 p 13 and the AML 1 gene at chromosome 21 q 22 were found {{to be involved in the}} translocation t(12; 21) (p 13;q 22). By conventional cytogenetics, however, this chromosomal abnormality is barely detectable and occurs in less than 0. 05 % of childhood ALL. To investigate the frequency of the molecular equivalent of the t(12; 21), the TEL/AML 1 gene fusion, we have undertaken a prospective screening in the running German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) and Italian Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) multicenter ALL therapy trials. We have analyzed 334 unselected cases of pediatric ALL patients consecutively referred over a period of 5 and 9 months, respectively. The overall incidence of the t(12; 21) in pediatric ALL is 18. 9 %. The 63 cases positive for the TEL/AML 1 chimeric products ranged in age between 1 and 12 years, and all but one showed CD 10 and pre-B immunophenotype. Interestingly, one case displayed a pre-pre-B immunophenotype. Among the B-lineage subgroup, the t(12; 21) occurs in 22. 0 % of the cases. Fifteen of 61 (24. 6 %) cases coexpressed at least two myeloid antigens (CD 13, CD 33, or CDw 65) in more than 20 % of the <b>gated</b> <b>blast</b> cells. DNA index was available for 59 of the 63 TEL/AML 1 positive cases; a hyperdiploid DNA content (> or = 1. 16) was detected in only four patients, being nonhyperdiploid in the remaining 55. Based on this prospective analysis, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of TEL/AML 1 in prognosis by identifying the subset of B-lineage ALL children enrolled in the closed German ALL-BFM- 90 and Italian ALL-AIEOP- 91 protocols who had sufficient material for analysis. A total of 342 children were investigated for the presence of TEL/AML 1 fusion gene and 99 cases (28. 9 %) were positive. The patients expressing the TEL/AML 1 fusion mRNA appeared to have a better event-free survival (EFS) than the patients who lacked this chimeric product. Whereas three of the TEL/AML 1 positive cases (3. 0 %) have relapsed to date, 27 patients without TEL/AML 1 rearrangement (11. 1 %) suffered from relapse. To date, the only subset of B-lineage ALL with a favorable prognosis has been the hyperdiploid group (DNA index > or = 1. 16 < 1. 6). Our findings reinforce the need to include the molecular screening of the t(12; 21) translocation within ongoing prospective ALL trials to prove definitively its prognostic impact...|$|R
