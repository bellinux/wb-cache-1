5|$|At Potsdam, Truman {{agreed to}} a request from Winston Churchill that Britain be {{represented}} when the atomic bomb was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{had said}} that he thought of King Kong after he had a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film. He {{was going to have}} a giant gorilla fight a Komodo dragon or other animal, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the technique of interlacing that he wanted to use would not provide realistic results.|$|E
5|$|Forward Unto Dawn {{received}} a Streamy Award {{and several of}} the crew {{received a}}wards for their work editing, producing and filming of it. The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing. Reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the plot was too slow {{in the first half and}} most of the characters were under-developed. The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for main title design.|$|E

5|$|On 3 July 2014, V-22 {{aircraft}} carried Delta Force commandos to a campsite {{in eastern}} Syria where Islamic State militants had held American and other hostages. The commandos eliminated the militants at the site, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the hostages {{had been moved}} elsewhere and returned home empty handed.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} largely one {{of peace and}} declining {{industrial}} prosperity in Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society being founded in 1777 to improve methods. John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> methods could still be improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} summoned {{everyone in}} the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary's, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> no one was certain of Jennings's role in the commission. After a short debate, the House passed a resolution, voting 15 to 13, to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him. The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state's western counties. Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor.|$|E

60|$|If so, {{they were}} mistaken in their plan. The pirate showed no unusual sign of fear. Once he {{attempted}} to pray, <b>but</b> he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> almost impossible.|$|R
5|$|With {{the draft}} screenplay, Doran pitched {{the idea to}} various studios in order to finance the film, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> many were wary of the {{beginner}} Thompson as the screenwriter. She was considered a risk, as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script. Columbia Pictures executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson's work, and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.|$|E
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort to}} find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Rosenthal {{learned the}} Transcendental Meditation {{technique}} while in South Africa, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{as a medical}} student and a medical resident he didn't have time to practice. Then 35 years later, after one of his patients had a dramatic improvement {{as a result of}} TM, he began practicing again and then began recommending it to his patients. In 2011, he published , which debuted at number seven on the New York Times' Best Sellers: Hardcover Advice, How-To And Miscellaneous list. Earlier that year, Rosenthal published preliminary research on the potential influence of TM on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.|$|E

5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was George Volkoff at the University of British Columbia, {{who had worked with}} Robert Oppenheimer on the physics of neutron stars. They also tried to recruit Harry Thode from McMaster University, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Harold Urey from the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories was also {{interested}} in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with mass spectrography, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

5|$|In {{many ways}} Mycale {{represents}} {{the start of}} a new phase of the conflict, the Greek counterattack. After the victory at Mycale, the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> this was already done. The Peloponnesians sailed home, but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians. The Persians in the region, and their allies made for Sestos, the strongest town in the region, which the Athenians then laid siege to; after a protracted siege, it fell to the Athenians. Herodotus ended his Historia after the Siege of Sestos. Over the next 30 years, the Greeks, primarily the Athenian-dominated Delian League, would expel the Persians from Macedon, Thrace, the Aegean islands and Ionia. Peace with Persia came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias, finally ending the half-century of warfare.|$|E
5|$|John Joseph Broderick {{was born}} on Manhattan's East 25th Street, in the impoverished Gashouse District, the son of Margaret Kendall and Michael Broderick. At the age of 12 he left parochial school to drive a brick truck, and then a coal truck, to support his mother {{after the death of}} his father. He served in the U.S. Navy in World War I and worked as a {{bodyguard}} for Samuel Gompers, the labor leader. He joined the New York City Fire Department in April 1922, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> boring. Having taken both the Fire and Police Department examinations, in January of the following year he joined the New York City Police Department.|$|E
5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed {{only a small part of}} the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E
25|$|November 17, 2008: The jurors, {{charged with}} {{determining}} whether the convicted killer {{is eligible for}} the death penalty, said yes. <b>But,</b> they <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the State had not proven that Addison purposely murdered Officer Briggs.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{of a typical}} bathroom <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{none of the above}} theories pan out in their analysis, <b>but</b> instead <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the spray from the shower-head drives a horizontal vortex. This vortex has a low-pressure zone in the centre, which sucks the curtain.|$|R
50|$|In his {{previous}} publishing business, Lloyd {{had seen the}} vast unmet demand for something good to read among the growing numbers {{of people who had}} learnt their letters <b>but</b> <b>found</b> nothing <b>that</b> they could afford except trash or sermonizing.|$|R
5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure {{she would be able to}} effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate {{command and control}} methods applied by the Sisak Operational Group {{in charge of the}} offensive. It also lacked clear objectives. Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, <b>but</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> they were not radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
