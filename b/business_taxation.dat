40|$|Understanding <b>Taxation</b> of <b>Business</b> Entities {{is new to}} the LexisNexis Understanding Series. This book is {{designed}} primarily for use by law students taking a course on the <b>taxation</b> of <b>business</b> entities, or separate courses on partnership taxation and corporate taxation. The book is broken into parts on partnership taxation, C corporation taxation, and S corporation taxation. Each chapter contains a basic overview and a detailed analysis; this allows for {{an understanding of the}} big picture before diving into the details, and the basic overview alone may be sufficient for some topics that may be covered lightly in a <b>business</b> entity <b>taxation</b> course. For each type of business tax entity, the book covers its life cycle — formation, operations, and liquidation — along with reorganizations and divisions for corporations. The book is replete with descriptions and analyses of the relevant Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations provisions, summaries of leading cases and IRS rulings, and plenty of examples that apply the law to hypothetical situations. Understanding <b>Taxation</b> of <b>Business</b> Entities {{is designed}} primarily for law students, but it is also intended to be useful to practitioners, including generalists who need a relatively brief summary of a business entity tax topic, beginning lawyers who intend to specialize in partnership and corporate taxation and / or are working on an LL. M. in taxation, and experienced lawyers who wish to expand their practices into <b>business</b> entity <b>taxation.</b> The book similarly would be useful to accountants who are pursuing a master of science in taxation, as well as accountants practicing in the area of <b>business</b> entity <b>taxation.</b> - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
