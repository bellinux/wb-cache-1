40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) in the blade attachment region of low-pressure (LP) turbine rotors {{has emerged as}} one of the most significant problems affecting steam turbine rotors today. In response to an expressed utility need for a life prediction tool, EPRI has sponsored the development of an easyto-use PC-based computer program, LPRimLife, which enables utility personnel to perform a rapid remaining life assessment of LP rotors with known or suspected cracking. The first phase of development, incorporating the methodology for evaluating cracking in GE dovetail (straddle-mount) attachments, is complete. The next phase, to address cracking in Westinghouse axial-entry attachments in currently under way. The LPRimLife computer code, developed for EPRI by Structural Integrity Associates, combines the necessary stress analysis, material property data and fracture mechanics algorithms with applicable material degradation data into an integrated methodology to assess the remaining life of LP rotors with rim-attachment cracking. Features built-in to the PC-based code include: • easy-to-use Windows graphical user interface with pulldown menus and dialog boxes • built-in library of stress solutions which can be easily expanded to incorporate user-specific attachment geometries • a fracture mechanics stress intensity factor calculator for arbitrary crack aspect ratios • material properties module with built-in fracture toughness data • an algorithm to account for redistribution of load between top, middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>hooks</b> with cracking • an algorithm to check for overload of a cracked ligament in addition to fracture toughness limit • SCC threshold to simulate crack arrest if stress intensity factors drop below the threshold • deterministic and probabilistic calculation options and built-in graphics and plotting capability to view and modify presentation of results. With comprehensive on-line help, the program facilitates rapid life assessments and parametric studies to be performed by nonexperts within a short time of being introduced to the software...|$|R

5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including <b>bottom</b> trawl. <b>Hooks</b> and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} reports {{the results of}} {{investigations}} conducted during 2006 - 2007 of the bottom longline fishery in the Southern Adriatic Sea. The study investigated the rigging {{of the line and}} the material used. These investigations specifically compared the catch efficiency of the traditionally used J-shaped hook to hooks with innovative design that are commonly used in the Norwegian costal longline fishery. Fishing trials were conducted using a commercial fishing boat operating in areas with two different bottom morphologies (rocky and muddy bottom). Species abundance of the catches in the two areas were compared. The working hypothesis was that the innovative hooks, characterized by a point toward the line of pull (i. e., Mustad: EZ-Baiter, Wide Gap, Wide Gap Eyed), perform better than the traditional hook whose point is parallel to the line of pull (i. e., Mustad: Round Bend Sea). A variant of the traditional J-shaped hook, characterized by an offset-angle (Mustad: Kirby) was also tested. The elasmobranch species (Squalus acanthias 26 % and Raja clavata 13 %) were the most abundant species on rocky bottom, followed by Pagrus pagrus (13 %). These species were hardly present on muddy bottoms where Merluccius merluccius dominated (48 %). The EZ-Baiter and Wide Gap hooks had the highest catch efficiency in terms of biomass of fish caught. They also gave the highest income. The Wide Gap Eyed hook performed the worst as it was not suitable for the baiting operations. The EZ-Baiter and Wide Gap hook were more efficient than the Round Bend Sea <b>hook</b> on both <b>bottom</b> morphologies. The results suggest that the EZ-Baiter hook performed better than Wide Gap <b>hook</b> on rocky <b>bottom,</b> while the Wide Gap performed better on muddy <b>bottom.</b> The Kirby <b>hook</b> did not improve the catch efficiency compared to the Round Bend Sea. It was concluded that introduction of the Norwegian hook designs could improve the efficiency and income of the Italian bottom longline fishery without large investments...|$|R
40|$|Banco de La Concepción {{is one of}} {{the areas}} chosen to be {{depicted}} in the frame of INDEMARES project. It is located at 71 km to the NE of Lanzarote. The main aim of the project was to end up with an inventory and mapping of habitats and fisheries footprint off the study area, information which would let the administrations to establish a new Natura 2000 area, trying to reconcile protection of biodiversity with artisanal local economic activities. Methodology approach complies with a multidisciplinary perspective, having described the area from geological, oceanographic, biological and fisheries points of view. Several surveys have taken place since 2009 to 2013 at Banco de La Concepción waters. Data from VMS (Vessel Monitoring System) were used, combined with interviews to users (fishers), to describe the fishery uses in the area. Ten different types of communities have been identified as “Habitat 1170, Reefs”, following Annex 1 from Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92 / 43 /CEE) from European Union. All of them have three dimensional structure and species with certain size turning these areas into important containers of biodiversity and hot spots for shelter. About protected species by Habitats Directive, Centrostephanus longispinus (Philippi, 1845) belongs to Annex IV. Neophryssospongia nolitangere (Schmidt, 1870) is included in the Canary Islands Catalog of Protected Species as a vulnerable species. Within the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we can find several fishes as endangered species, while in the area can also be found several vulnerable species, special importance have several elasmobranchs species. Subsequent studies about deep water white corals Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) and Madrepora oculata Linnaeus, 1758, present in the study area, could conclude with these species inclusion in the list. Fishery activities identified during this study with a higher degree of fishing intensity (tuna fishing with pole lines and surface longlines for sworfish) don’t interact with the <b>bottom.</b> Electric reel <b>hook</b> and line and bottom horizontal longline activities are not so frequent, but while the first one has very little impact on the bottom (arose from anchoring), the latter is performed by only two vessels but {{with a high degree of}} intensity and very spatially concentrated at rocky bottom areas, generating an important impact on the bottom during the raising maneuver by getting snagged with benthic epifauna. Ecological assessment results from values assigned to different community or species features or parameters, not always in a quantitative manner, depending on their diverse nature. To use a totally aseptic quantitative index is impossible; therefore, an often used tool is to resort to an expert panel (group of experts) which members individually assign a value to each of the assessed parameters. This solution absorbs bias produced by individual criteria. We established three value levels (low, medium and high) for each of the twelve parameters used. After all we end up with a map of an ecological assessment index (EAI) which is simple and weighs every parameter equally. Higher EAI is assigned to bathial rocky bottoms with anthipatarians, closely followed by Corallium spp deep water coral reefs. Bathial rocky bottoms with Callogorgia verticillata (Pallas, 1766) have a mid-high EAI. We are not very optimistic about collective action preconditions, which explain the capacity of human communities to design, implement and enforce designed institutions to resources management and protection. There is an absence of fishermen organizations closely linked to the area, of leadership among effective users, which have a very limited experience in conservation initiatives and an a priori reluctant attitude. A proper step-zero at Banco de La Concepción marine protected area will be provided by sharing available scientific information with users, public report and open and full consultation about the protection possibilities, giving time to assimilation, involving local stakeholders, and finding coordination among institutions and security bodies to ensure protection measures enforcementEC Life+ Project INDEMARES (Code no. 110300900...|$|R
