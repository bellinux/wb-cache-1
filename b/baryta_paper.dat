2500|$|In 1966, IBM {{released}} the Selectric Composer. This highly modified (and much more expensive) Selectric produced camera-ready justified copy using proportional fonts {{in a variety}} of font styles from 8 points [...] to 14 points. Material prepared on a properly adjusted machine by a skillful operator and printed onto <b>baryta</b> (barium sulfate-coated) <b>paper</b> [...] "would take an expert to tell... was not the product of a Linotype or Monotype machine".|$|R
5000|$|Fiber-based (FB or <b>Baryta)</b> {{photographic}} <b>papers</b> {{consist of}} a paper base coated with baryta. Tints are sometimes added to the baryta to add subtle colour to the final print; however most modern papers use optical brighteners to extend the paper's tonal range. [...] Most fiber-based papers include a clear hardened gelatin layer above the emulsion which protects it from physical damage, especially during processing. This is called a supercoating. Papers without a supercoating are suitable for use with the bromoil process. Fiber-based papers are generally chosen as a medium for high-quality prints for exhibition, display and archiving purposes. These papers require careful processing and handling, especially when wet. However, they are easier to tone, hand-colour and retouch than resin-coated equivalents.|$|R
50|$|The gelatin silver {{print or}} gelatin {{developing}} out paper (DOP) is a monochrome imaging process {{based on the}} light sensitivity of silver halides. They have been made for both contact printing and enlarging purposes by modifying the paper’s light sensitivity. A brief exposure to a negative produces a latent image, which is then made visible by a developing agent. The image is then made permanent by treatment in a photographic fixer, which removes the remaining light sensitive silver halides. And finally, a water bath clears the fixer from the print. The final image consists of small particles of silver bound in a layer of gelatin. This gelatin image layer {{is only one of}} the four layers found in a typical gelatin silver print, which typically include the overcoat, image layer, <b>baryta,</b> and <b>paper</b> support.|$|R
5000|$|His {{work is in}} the {{tradition}} of humanist photography [...] and Street photography using the same material as many of the forerunners of this style: Kodak Tri-X black and white film, silver bromide prints on <b>baryta</b> <b>paper,</b> Leica M3 or Leica M4 with a 50 or 90 mm lens. The thin black line surrounding the prints shows that the picture has not been cropped.|$|E
50|$|A {{suspension}} of silver salts in gelatin is coated onto a support such as glass, flexible plastic or film, <b>baryta</b> <b>paper,</b> or resin-coated paper. These light-sensitive materials are stable under normal keeping conditions {{and are able}} to be exposed and processed even many years after their manufacture. This is in contrast to the collodion wet-plate process dominant from the 1850s-1880s, which had to be exposed and developed immediately after coating.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{baryta layer}} plays an {{important}} part in the manufacture of smooth and glossy prints, the <b>baryta</b> <b>paper</b> of the 1890s did not produce the lustrous or glossy print surface that became the standard for fine art photography in the twentieth century. Matting agents, textured papers, and thin baryta layers that were not heavily calendered produced a low-gloss and textured appearance. The higher gloss papers first became popular in the 1920s and 30s as photography transitioned from pictorialism into modernism, photojournalism, and “straight” photography.|$|E
