25|$|On 16 January 2007, {{this series}} had {{attracted}} {{the largest ever}} number of public complaints to the UK broadcasting watchdog Ofcom about a Big Brother series. The complaints received detailed concerns that housemate Shilpa Shetty had been subjected to bullying. Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara's behaviour towards Shetty sparked widespread anger and demonstrations in India, where the alleged racism was reported on the news, and led Big Brothers main sponsor Carphone Warehouse to suspend its sponsorship of the show. As of 19 January 2007, a Channel 4 spokesman agreed that participants should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the controversy, which would probably explain the subsequent statements and apologies tendered by the housemates and their complete lack of surprise after learning about the latest eviction.|$|E
25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators {{did not need to}} know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies have}} {{reported}} inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall {{have been shown to}} be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction. Wolfe (1983) cautions that educators and therapists should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the potential for environments with sounds occurring simultaneously from many sources (musical and non-musical) to distract and interfere with student learning.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of a mnemonic is intentional, suggesting {{that in order to}} successfully use a mnemonic device an individual should be aware that the mnemonic can aid his or her memory. Awareness of how a mnemonic facilitates one's memory is an example of metamemory. Wimmer and Tornquist conducted an experiment in which participants were asked to recall a set of items. Participants <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the usefulness of a mnemonic device (categorical grouping) either before or after recall. Participants who <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the usefulness of the mnemonic before recall (displaying metamemory for the mnemonic's usefulness) {{were significantly more likely to}} use the mnemonic than those who <b>were</b> not <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of the mnemonic before recall.|$|R

25|$|During {{play of the}} game, {{a member}} of the fielding team is {{designated}} as the bowler, and bowls deliveries toward the batsman. Six legal balls in a row constitutes an over, after which a different member of the fielding side takes over the role of bowler for the next over. The bowler delivers the ball from his or her end of the pitch toward the batsman standing at the opposite wicket {{at the other end of}} the pitch. Bowlers can be either left-handed or right-handed. This approach to their delivery, in addition to their decision of bowling around the wicket (from the sides of the wicket on the bowler's end) or over the wicket, is knowledge of which the umpire and the batsman are to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware.</b>|$|E
25|$|Night jumpers should <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of {{the dark}} zone, when landing at night. Above 30 meters (100 feet) jumpers flying their canopy have {{a good view of}} the landing zone {{normally}} because of reflected ambient light/moon light. Once they get close to the ground, this ambient light source is lost, because of the low angle of reflection. The lower they get, the darker the ground looks. At about 100 feet and below it may seem that they are landing in a black hole. Suddenly it becomes very dark, and the jumper hits the ground soon after. This ground rush should be explained to, and anticipated by, the first time night jumper. Recommendations should be made to the jumper to utilize a canopy that is larger than they typically use on a day jump and to attempt to schedule their first night jump as close to a full moon as possible to make it easier to see the ground.|$|E
500|$|After {{reprisal}} from death, Davies felt {{further development}} {{was necessary for}} the character to continue {{as part of the}} drama; one of the first decisions the production team made was that [...] "we can't make this guy look like a sap any longer. He's got to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of what's going on." [...] The events of the episode [...] "Meat", in which Rhys learns the real nature of Gwen's job, are seen by Davies as a [...] "rite of passage" [...] for the couple. Director Colin Teague highlights Rhys' [...] patience in relation to Gwen noting that [...] "he puts up with an awful lot from his wife to be". The second series also explores Rhys's insecurities and jealousies towards series protagonist Captain Jack Harkness, for whom a mutual sexual tension with Gwen was evident in the first series. Both Stephen James Walker and episode writer Catherine Tregenna felt that [...] "the triangle of relationships between Rhys, Gwen and Jack" [...] comprise [...] "the most interesting narrative territory explored in 'Meat'". Although actor Kai Owen feels that [...] "Rhys will always {{have a little bit of}} a gripe about Jack", he concedes that [...] "he respects him and he'll like him for looking after Gwen". Walker comments favourably on the interaction between Jack and Rhys in [...] "Meat" [...] in both its antagonistic and comedic forms, citing the scene in the truck where Rhys questions Jack as particularly effective. The two function as unusual literary foils for one another, insofar as their relationships with Gwen are concerned. In her critical essay Gwen's Evil Stepmother: Concerning Gloves and Magic Slippers, Valerie Estelle Frankel compares Rhys to Jack, likening the former to a [...] "sweet, kind handsome prince" [...] and the latter to a [...] "compelling trickster." [...] Whilst Eve Myles feels that [...] "Jack highlights how ordinary Rhys is", she states that it is precisely this ordinariness which makes Rhys a benefit to Gwen's strength of character.|$|E

500|$|In {{regards to}} the {{relationship}} between Gwen and Rhys, Davies felt that the episode provided a [...] "rite of passage for the couple". Director Colin Teague remarked that the character of Rhys [...] "puts up with a lot from his wife to be." [...] The production team had previously planned to kill the character off {{at the end of the}} previous series but retained the character, partly because they liked Owen as an actor. In storylining the second series Davies states that [...] "one of the first decisions we made was that we can't make this guy look like a sap any longer. He's got to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>aware</b> of what's going on." [...] Tregenna identified one of the central themes of the episode as the [...] "love triangle between Gwen, Rhys and Jack". The argument in which Gwen ultimately reveals to Rhys that she catches aliens for a living was partly improvised by Owen and Myles. The denouement of the episode sees the character of Rhys take a bullet to protect Gwen. To create this scene Owen's clothing was fitted with a minor explosive, the gunshot effect [...] " [...] a bit" [...] which both Teague and Owen felt helped with the timing of the actor's reaction. Location filming for the episode took place around Roald Dahl Plass on 3 July for several scenes, including the final scene with Gwen and Rhys on Mermaid Quay, and the earlier scene where Rhys observes Jack and Gwen by the water fountain. A warehouse near Roath Dock, Cardiff Bay was used as the location for the abandoned warehouse-meat processing plant, whilst the Imperial Park Bypass was used for some of the road scenes. During the episode Gwen asks [...] "What is this, Scooby-Doo?" [...] in regards to Rhys' suggestion the team hide in his van in order to carry out a sting operation. Torchwood Magazine suggest that this was a knowing reference from Tregenna to the critic and satirist Charlie Brooker's reaction to the first series of the show.|$|E

These provisions amend the previous position when a defendant whose bad prior record means that he is tried summarily and then sent elsewhere for sentence; {{the same type of}} court deals with both trial and sentence in ordinary cases.
