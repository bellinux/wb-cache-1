5000|$|The Kosovo Maiden or Maiden of the <b>Blackbird</b> <b>Field</b> (Косовка девојка/Kosovka devojka) is {{the central}} figure of a poem with the same name, part of the Kosovo cycle in the Serbian epic poetry. In it, a young beauty {{searches}} the battlefield for her betrothed husband and helps wounded Serbian warriors with water, wine and bread after the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 between Serbia and Ottoman Empire. She finally finds wounded and dying warrior Pavle Orlović who tells her that her fiancé Milan Toplica and his blood-brothers Miloš Obilić and Ivan Kosančić are dead. Before the battle they {{had given her a}} cloak, golden ring and veil for the wedding as a promise of safe return, but they were slain and Pavle pointed to the direction of the bodies. The poem finishes with; [...] "O wretch! Evil is your fortune!If I, a wretch, were to grasp a green pine,Even the green pine would wither." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{estimate}} of blackbird damage to ripening sunflower (Helianthus annuus) in North Dakota in 1980 exceeded $ 6 million. Although less than 5 % of the sunflower {{fields in the}} state received greater than 10 % damage in each of four past survey years, as much as 50 % of the total state-wide damage occurred in these fields. This loss can be combated with cost-effective control- Successful control requires timely action when blackbirds are in large concentrations. Frightening <b>blackbirds</b> from <b>fields</b> early in the damage season disperses damage and this can result in compensatory growth by sunflower, whereby yields at harvest are largely unaffected...|$|R
50|$|In May 1944, the B-25s {{returned}} from the 9th Weather Region and resumed reconnaissance in the North Atlantic. Three new routes were set, named Redbird, Bluebird and Blackbird: Redbird initially between Goose Bay and BW1 then between Goose Bay and Presque Isle; Bluebird between Bluie West 1 and Meeks Field; <b>Blackbird</b> between Meeks <b>Field</b> and Stornoway. Most of the missions were route reconnaissance but shifted towards more synoptic missions through the summer. Starting in July, there was an additional out and back synoptic track named Raven flown south of Iceland from Meeks Field.|$|R
5000|$|Fields's {{career as}} a {{professional}} songwriter took off in 1928 when Jimmy McHugh, who had seen some of her early work, invited her to provide some lyrics for him for <b>Blackbirds</b> of 1928. <b>Fields</b> and McHugh teamed up until 1935. Songs from this period include [...] "I Can't Give You Anything But Love", [...] "Exactly Like You", and [...] "On the Sunny Side of the Street." [...] During the later 1920s, she and McHugh wrote specialty numbers for the various Cotton Club revues, {{many of which were}} recorded by Duke Ellington.|$|R
40|$|It is {{a little}} disputed fact that each year birds cause damage through crop depredation, {{roosting}} activities, and bird/aircraft strike damage with occasionally associated loss of life. Stephen (1961) cites an article by Elkins (1957) which said ducks cause {{millions of dollars of}} loss to barley, oats, and wheat crops in Canadian prairies. Damage to ripening cereal grain crops in the western United States {{is one of the most}} widespread bird problems (DeGrazio 1964). Zajanc (1962) reports these losses are estimated at $ 15 million annually in three western states alone where <b>blackbirds</b> feed in <b>fields</b> of rice, corn, small grains, truck crops, nuts, and fruits located near roosting areas...|$|R
40|$|In spring 1986 and 1987 I {{examined}} the relationship between blackbird abundance and sequence of rice planting near a very large roost in southwestern Louisiana to identify factors that contributed to bird damage in newly planted rice fields. Millers Lake, an eutrophic man-made lake of approximately 2, 500 ha, attracts a winter roosting population that peaks at 10 to 25 million blackbirds annually. By March and April the roost declines to several thousand birds. Female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were responsible for most rice seed losses, predominating both the roost and feeding flocks in rice fields in spring. Number of flocking birds in fields decreased with roost size, date of year, and distance from the roost. Surveys corroborated recommended planting practices: planting after 24 March coincides with decreased numbers of <b>blackbirds</b> in rice <b>fields,</b> thus reducing the potential for damage to seeded rice by foraging blackbirds...|$|R
40|$|Ripening {{sunflower}} {{fields in}} the northern Great Plains provide blackbirds with easily accessible sources of high-energy food. Blackbirds can be nearly impossible to discourage from foraging in favored fields. Repellents sometimes can be effective feeding deterrents, especially if alternative foraging sites are readily available. Currently, there is one bird repellent (BirdShield®, a. i., methyl anthranilate) registered for use on ripening sunflower. The cost-benefits of BirdShield are being questioned after recent field trails showed no reduction in damage levels (Werner et al. 2005). Both caffeine and garlic are potential taste repellents that have some promise of reducing <b>blackbird</b> damage to <b>field</b> crops. Avery et al. (2005) conducted cage feeding trials with red-winged blackbirds (RWBL) and brown-headed cowbirds and found that caffeine used {{at a rate of}} 2, 500 ppm on rice seed significantly reduced food consumption. Trials with mixed species blackbird flocks in a flight pen and field trials in Louisiana showed that caffeine reduced blackbird feeding to 3 ̆c 10...|$|R
40|$|On August 26, 1976 Avitrol FC Corn Chops- 99 S (AFCC- 99 S) was federally {{registered}} (EPA Registration No. 11649 - 15) for use {{in protecting}} ripening sunflowers from damage by blackbirds. The registration {{was the culmination of}} seven years of effort by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to extend the use of AFCC- 99, which was registered for use against <b>blackbirds</b> in <b>field</b> corn in April 1972. Ripening sunflowers are probably more intensively damaged by blackbirds in the U. S. than any other crop. In a 1972 survey in 469 randomly selected sunflower fields in North Dakota and Minnesota, Stone (1973) found that 9. 7 % of heads examined had been damaged by birds. Initial small-scale tests with AFCC- 99 S for protecting sunflowers were conducted in North Dakota in 1967. R. V. Hansen and W. K. Pfeifer (unpublished reports of Division of Wildlife Services, North Dakota) reported satisfactory to excellent results by spreading AFCC- 99 S in disked strips between standing sunflowers in Rolette County in 1967, in Ransom County in 1968 to 1970, in Cass and Ransom counties in 1971, and in Cass County in 1972. In 1973, the first large-scale tests where AFCC- 99 S baits were broadcast within ripening sunflower fields were conducted by personnel of the Denver Wildlife Research Center and cooperators. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to summarize the data from tests in 1973 and 1974 that largely formed the basis for the registration. Greater detail is presented in the unpublished reports of these studies (Guarino 1974; Besser and Cummings 1975) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{widespread}} bird problems in the Western United States is damage to ripening cereal grain crops. Crops such as corn, rice, and sorghum, when grown close to favored roosting areas are often subject to serious damage from large flocks of feeding blackbirds. The redwinged blackbird is the most numerous species and causes most of the damage, but other blackbird species, including the yellow-headed blackbird, the common grackle, the brown-headed cowbird, and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s blackbird, also contribute to damage problems. The Denver Wildlife Research Center is actively investigating methods to combat <b>blackbird</b> depredations to <b>field</b> corn {{in the vicinity of}} Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern South Dakota. This report will deal with this particular project since it is the Denver Center 2 ̆ 7 s most active study involving blackbird depredations. The Sand Lake project was initiated in 1960 and was planned for five years. Field work usually begins in April and ends in October. The major work period is August and September, the time of peak populations of birds and {{of the most}} acute damage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Spray {{application}} of fluorescent particles {{is a widely}} used and very valuable technique for marking birds. This {{remains one of the}} few practical means to mark large numbers of birds for monitoring movement, despite recent availability of a variety of more technologically advanced options. We monitored the longevity of the DayGlo fluorescent particle marker on red-winged <b>blackbirds</b> under simulated <b>field</b> conditions in a flight pen, and in an observational field experiment. In the pen study we banded 52 red-winged blackbirds with individually numbered leg bands, and sprayed them with DayGlo fluorescent particle marker from a distance of ~ 50 cm, on 1 December 2004. These birds were recaptured and DayGlo fluorescent particle marks assessed 11 times until 10 August 2005. All 31 surviving birds {{at the conclusion of the}} study (i. e. after 254 days) retained at least some DayGlo fluorescent particle marker on one or more body regions. Wings retained DayGlo fluorescent particle marks longer than other body regions and thus could be used to identify marks in large-scale collections. Roosting wild blackbirds aerially marked in September and October 2005 retained marks through June 2006, 263 days after marking. The formulation used is inexpensive (US$ 4. 00 L 1), easy-to-apply at many scales and practical for many species (e. g. starlings, blackbirds, sparrows, gulls and shorebirds) ...|$|R
