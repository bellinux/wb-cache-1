500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore."
