50|$|The Lorraine steel {{industry}} grew rapidly from 1893 to 1913.Dreux undertook {{a series of}} upgrades to the plant, adding new blast furnaces to supply molten pig iron to six <b>basic</b> <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters</b> at Mont-Saint-Martin.As of 1 May 1901 there were seven blast furnaces.Dreux set up Siemens-Martin open hearth furnaces to make special steels, and mills to roll steel into different forms.Georges Rolland of the Corps des mines was made President of the Aciéries de Longwy in 1903. That year he also {{became a member of}} the board of the Comité des forges.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{industrial use}} of ganister was as the lining bricks for the acid <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter,</b> a steel-making process developed in 1856. The process could not initially be used successfully by steelworks other than Bessemer's though, owing to its {{need for a}} low phosphorus iron ore. This {{led to the development}} of the <b>basic</b> <b>Bessemer</b> or Gilchrist-Thomas process, which used a calcined dolomite lining instead of the siliceous ganister. This alkaline lining with a lime flux reacted with the molten iron to form a slag that removed the phosphorus impurities.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{the basic}} oxygen process was {{introduced}} at the Voest-Alpine works in 1952; a modification of the <b>basic</b> <b>Bessemer</b> process, it lances oxygen from above the steel (instead of bubbling air from below), {{reducing the amount of}} nitrogen uptake into the steel. The {{basic oxygen process}} is used in all modern steelworks; the last <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> in the U.S. was retired in 1968. Furthermore, the last three decades have seen a massive increase in the mini-mill business, where scrap steel only is melted with an electric arc furnace. These mills only produced bar products at first, but have since expanded into flat and heavy products, once the exclusive domain of the integrated steelworks.|$|R

50|$|Sir Henry <b>Bessemer,</b> of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> fame, {{received}} a patent in 1857 for casting metal between two counter-rotating rollers. The basic outline {{of this system}} has recently been implemented today in the casting of steel strip.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> could treat a [...] "heat" [...] (batch of hot metal) of 5 to 30 tons at a time. They {{were usually}} {{operated}} in pairs, one being blown while another was being filled or tapped.|$|R

50|$|In 1868 {{the company}} {{installed}} {{a pair of}} <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters,</b> and started using them to produce steel.During the 1970s, various types of wire products were produced at the mill.In 1881 the company built Central Furnaces plant, near the Cuyahoga River, {{for the production of}} pig iron.|$|R
50|$|Four {{separate}} furnaces provided {{steam power}} to four adjacent swan-necked cranes, which {{were used for}} manipulating the massive 120-ton iron and steel ingots delivered to the hammer for forging. Six <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters</b> supplied the steel for the ingots, which were transported on a railway line built expressly for the purpose through the works.|$|R
50|$|Steel {{manufacture}} in Stocksbridge {{had always}} been by melting iron and steel firstly in crucibles (from 1860), then <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters</b> (from 1862) and Siemens Open Hearth Furnaces (from 1899 until 1968) and lastly Electric arc furnaces (from 1939 until 2005). Iron has never been produced from iron ore at Fox's, by any method.|$|R
25|$|The {{problem of}} mass-producing cheap steel was solved in 1855 by Henry Bessemer, with the {{introduction}} of the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> at his steelworks in Sheffield, England. (An early converter can still be seen at the city's Kelham Island Museum). In the Bessemer process, molten pig iron from the blast furnace was charged into a large crucible, and then air was blown through the molten iron from below, igniting the dissolved carbon from the coke. As the carbon burned off, the melting point of the mixture increased, but the heat from the burning carbon provided the extra energy needed to keep the mixture molten. After the carbon content in the melt had dropped to the desired level, the air draft was cut off: a typical <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> could convert a 25-ton batch of pig iron to steel in half an hour.|$|R
50|$|The Edgar Thomson Steel Works was {{designed}} and built because of the Bessemer process, the first inexpensive industrial process for the mass production of steel. In the process, air blowing through the molten iron removed impurities via oxidation. This {{took place in the}} <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter,</b> a large ovoid steel container lined with clay or dolomite.|$|R
50|$|In 1853 Crewe {{had begun}} to make its own wrought iron and roll its own rails, and in 1864 {{installed}} a <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> for manufacturing steel. In 1868 it became {{the first place to}} use open-hearth furnaces on an industrial scale. It also built its own brickworks. Later the works was fitted with two electric arc furnaces.|$|R
50|$|It {{was well}} known for its gold mining equipment, {{including}} stamper batteries and ore crushing mills, and {{played an important role}} in equipping Victoria's first mineral boom in the 1850s and '60s. Major facilities included a <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> (1887) and a cast-iron pipe-making shop which produced water, sewerage and hydraulic pipes, and structural columns, including those for Princes Bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The Steel Corporation of Bengal was {{incorporated}} on 20 April 1937 with Burn & Co. as managing agents. SCOB established steel making facilities at Napuria, {{adjacent to the}} Hirapur Works of IISCO. The new steel plant had an annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes of ingot steel, another 100,000 tonnes were added later. The steel works consisted of three 225-tonne tilting open hearth furnaces, soaking pits, a 40” blooming mill of one million tonne capacity, a 34” heavy structural mill and a 18” light structural mill. A sheet mill was added in 1940. The first heat of steel was tapped on 10 November 1939 and rolled subsequently. A duplex plant initially with two <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters</b> (and subsequently another) was added. The first blow of the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> was made on 6 February 1946. Martin and Burn companies formally merged in 1946 to form Martin Burn Limited.|$|R
50|$|Converting {{is a type}} of {{metallurgical}} smelting {{that includes}} several processes; the most commercially important form is the treatment of molten metal sulfides to produce crude metal and slag, {{as in the case of}} copper and nickel converting. A now-uncommon form is batch treatment of pig iron to produce steel by the Bessemer process. The vessel used was called the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The boom was slowed {{somewhat}} by improvements in steel making (particularly {{the introduction of}} the Gilchrist Thomas 'basic' process, which by using a reactive lining allowed <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters</b> to use ores with higher phosphorus content) and by the availability of cheap iron ore from Spain. However World War I increased demand and impeded overseas supply, so the local industry revived for a time.|$|R
50|$|In June 1868, Darby {{converted}} the partnership into a limited company, the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company (EVSICC), headquartered in Manchester. The capital injection allowed {{investment in the}} most powerful blowing engine {{in the world to}} serve four of the Ebbw Vale furnaces, new rolling mills and a <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> shop which produced the first steel ingots, including high carbon spiegel-eisen (mirror iron).|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} the third furnace in June 1890 led to a renewed {{decision}} to start producing steel; this happened in 1892 after two 12-ton Martin open hearth furnaces and two <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters</b> were installed. A fourth furnace, 288 m3 in volume and 3.3 m higher than the others, started production in August 1895, reaching its planned capacity of 109 tons per day within a month.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converters,</b> open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|R
2500|$|On November 9, 1862, Stone, Chisholm & Jones reorganized {{and became}} the Cleveland Rolling Mill after {{receiving}} investments from Henry B. Payne, Jeptha Wade, and Stillman Witt. The company built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace in 1864 near {{the west end of}} what is now Saxe Avenue, and the following year erected its first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter.</b> This made the Cleveland Rolling Mill only the second Bessemer steel works in the United States.|$|R

50|$|The {{process is}} far slower {{than that of}} <b>Bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> and thus easier to control and sample for quality assessment. Preparing a heat usually takes 8 h to 8 h 30 min to {{complete}} into steel. As the process is slow, {{it is not necessary}} to burn all the carbon away as in Bessemer process, but the process can be terminated at any given point when desired carbon contents has been achieved.|$|R
50|$|Under state control, {{the company}} {{expanded}} further. In 1865 when the plant at Seraing was visited by a mission from Japan, it was 192 acre {{in size and}} had two coal mines, as well as facilities for the manipulation of iron and steel, with boiler and locomotive works. A <b>bessemer</b> <b>converter</b> had been installed in 1863, and the company expanded into the production of transatlantic ships and bridges, ironclads, and tunneling machines.|$|R
5000|$|He {{progressed to}} become a mechanic, working for the Norristown Iron Company, and in 1854 moved to the Cambria Iron Company, where he {{designed}} the first three-high rolling mill, a notable achievement. [...] In 1860 he became General Superintendent and Chief Engineer of the Bethlehem Iron Works in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. While there {{he was responsible for}} installing a <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Converter</b> and various developments in the company, staying until 1892, when he was 70.|$|R
