5|$|In November 2017, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto donated a {{full-size}} replica of San Lorenzo Head 8 {{to the people}} of Belize. It was installed in <b>Belmopan</b> at the roundabout facing the Embassy of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Authorities of Belize City {{considered}} {{abandoning the}} community and moving it to higher ground. Additionally, there was a proposal to relocate the capital further south or inland to the pine ridge, with either resulting in a higher elevation of the capital. However, the process of moving the capital did not begin until 1961, after Belize City was devastated by Hurricane Hattie. <b>Belmopan</b> became {{the capital city of}} British Honduras in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination team {{dispatched}} {{two members}} to Belize City {{and the rest}} of the team traveled to <b>Belmopan.</b> Government supplies were stored in Orange Walk, Corozal ready for post-storm relief. Essential equipment from the Red Cross and the Pan American Health Organization was stored in the elevated UNICEF building and the Belize City UN building was converted to a crisis center.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). He instructed {{the newly created}} Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital <b>Belmopan.</b> The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|By Hattie's {{one year}} anniversary, {{private and public}} workers {{repaired}} and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20millionin loans. In {{the days after the}} storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, <b>Belmopan,</b> was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On October2, the {{government}} of Belize {{declared a state of}} emergency and activated the entire Belize Defence Force due to the storm's threat. The airport in Belize City was closed during Keith's passage, limiting transportation from the country's mainland to its offshore islands. In Corozal, Belize, authorities evacuated the entire city of 10,000people to numerous shelters in Orange Walk. Officials were also ordered evacuations for Belize City, setting up shelters in <b>Belmopan.</b> Overall, about 25,000people evacuate, or about 10% of Belize's population. Three hospitals were evacuated in the country. In a post-storm assessment, residents on the offshore islands acknowledged they were unprepared for the storm and did not anticipate such intensity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} {{storm was}} Hurricane Hattie, a late-season Category5 hurricane that struck Belize. Hattie caused 319confirmed fatalities and about $60.3million in damage. Destruction was so severe in Belize {{that the government}} had to relocate inland to a new city, <b>Belmopan.</b> The remnants of Hattie {{may have contributed to the}} development of Tropical Storm Simone in the eastern Pacific Ocean. In early November, the depression that would later strengthen into Hurricane Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico. The final storm, Tropical Storm Inga, dissipated on November8, after causing no impact on land. On September11, three hurricanes existed simultaneously – Betsy, Carla, and Debbie – the most on a single day in the Atlantic basin since 1893 and until 1998. Collectively, the storms of the 1961Atlantic hurricane season caused about $391million in damage and at least 348fatalities.|$|E
25|$|Residents of <b>Belmopan</b> {{voted in}} a {{referendum}} in 1999 {{to switch to}} direct election of a city council. In 2000, <b>Belmopan</b> was incorporated as a city and held its first City Council election. Anthony Chanona of the People's United Party was elected mayor with a six-man slate, and reelected in 2003. Following the UDP's municipal victory of 2015, the mayor of <b>Belmopan</b> is Khalid Belisle.|$|E
25|$|The City of <b>Belmopan</b> {{has three}} pre-schools, four primary schools and four {{secondary}} schools {{as well as}} a modern Regional Language Centre (RLC) on the central campus of the University of Belize, where students from neighbouring Spanish-speaking countries come to study English. University of Belize's campus in <b>Belmopan</b> has the following faculties: Education and Arts, Management and Social Sciences, Science and Technology, and Nursing and Allied Health. The church/state system prevails in Belizean education, especially where pre-school, primary and secondary school education is concerned, and nearly all schools in <b>Belmopan</b> are sustained by churches.|$|E
25|$|Museums and {{galleries}} {{in the city}} include the planned <b>Belmopan</b> Museum.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{reluctance}} initially amongst foreign governments to relocate their embassies to <b>Belmopan</b> {{as there was}} some doubt as to whether this inland area would really become the functioning capital. The British High Commission opened in 1981 when Belize achieved independence, moving to its current location in 1984. In February 2005, the United States government broke ground and started building a new embassy in <b>Belmopan,</b> 43 {{years after it was}} chosen as the new capital city. The U.S. embassy was officially opened on 11 December 2006. Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Venezuela also have embassies in <b>Belmopan,</b> while Ecuador, Chile, and the Dominican Republic are represented by consulates. However, with four embassies and 29 consulates the former capital of Belize City still has most of the country's foreign diplomatic community.|$|E
25|$|At its {{inception}} and afterward, <b>Belmopan</b> was {{governed by the}} corporation RECONDEV (Reconstruction and Development Corporation), which answered to the government.|$|E
25|$|Some of Belmopan's {{noteworthy}} events include presentations by the <b>Belmopan</b> Choral Society, the Festival of Arts {{for school}} children, and National Day activities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Belmopan</b> {{features}} a tropical monsoon climate (Am) under the Köppen climate classification. The {{city has a}} lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. As is the characteristic of several cities with a tropical monsoon climate, <b>Belmopan</b> sees some precipitation during its dry season. March and April are Belmopan's driest months with roughly 45mm of rainfall observed on average during those months. Like Belize City, these are somewhat unusual months for {{a city with a}} tropical monsoon climate to have its driest months of the year. Typically the driest month for a city with this climate type is the month after the winter solstice, which in <b>Belmopan</b> would be January. Average monthly temperatures are somewhat constant throughout the course of the year, ranging from 23°C to 28°C.|$|E
25|$|The University of Belize's Black Jaguars squad has won two {{national}} championships playing out of <b>Belmopan.</b> Nearby communities including Roaring Creek, Camalote, Esperanza, and Georgeville play a softball tournament {{in the early}} part of the year.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of <b>Belmopan</b> proper (an estimated 20,000 people in 2009) is of various ethnicities, including Kriols, Garifuna, Mestizo, Maya, and recent immigrants from such Asian countries as the People's Republic of China and Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|As <b>Belmopan</b> is {{the seat}} of government, many of its {{inhabitants}} work for the national government in administrative or technical roles. Many are based in the large cluster of government buildings around the National Assembly building.|$|E
25|$|<b>Belmopan</b> has {{approximately}} 589 business establishments (the 1997 census {{revealed the}} presence of 373). Five international banks are in the city, as are several local financial institutions. A bus terminal and market complex were constructed in 2003.|$|E

25|$|These {{districts are}} further divided into 31 constituencies. Local {{government}} in Belize comprises {{four types of}} local authorities: city councils, town councils, village councils and community councils. The two city councils (Belize City and <b>Belmopan)</b> and seven town councils cover the urban population of the country, while village and community councils cover the rural population.|$|E
25|$|Belize {{municipal}} elections, 2006 were {{a series}} of local elections held on March 1, 2006, to fill vacancies for town councils in Corozal, Orange Walk, San Pedro, San Ignacio, Benque Viejo, Dangriga, Punta Gorda, Belize City and <b>Belmopan.</b> All the councils except Belize City elected one mayor and six councillors; Belize City elected one mayor and ten councillors.|$|E
25|$|In 2008's race, foreigners {{dominated}} the <b>Belmopan</b> to Cayo {{section of the}} race as Guatemalans and Americans combined to lead breaks into Roaring Creek, where U.S. National under-23 rider Ryan Baumann left the field in a dominant solo run to the City. Notable is that due to construction projects at the MJSC which started this year and would continue {{for the next few}} years, this year's race finished on the Marine Parade Boulevard near Memorial Park. The course record was lowered to 5 hours, 40 minutes, 12 seconds.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 2009, the cyclists {{pushed forward}} in sunny, dry {{conditions}} {{and a steady}} southeast breeze to Cayo. Mexican Antonio Rios and Costa Rican Marco Salas outran the field after an early breakaway and led the pack {{in and out of}} San Ignacio to <b>Belmopan.</b> Around mile 38, a group of six began what would become the final run to the City, including Belizean hopefuls Jose Choto and Giovanni Leslie. However, Mexicans Carlos Lopez and Carlos Manuel Hernandez left the pack around mile 12 and sprinted 1-2 to the Memorial Park, with Cuba's Frank Travieso taking third. Lopez became the first Mexican to win since 2002 and only the third overall. Belize's run of futility was extended to four years.|$|E
500|$|Rainfall in Honduras {{peaked at}} [...] in Roatán, {{located in the}} Bay Islands Department. However, no damage was {{reported}} in the county. In Belize, between [...] of rainfall {{was reported in the}} southern districts, while [...] fell in <b>Belmopan.</b> This caused flash flooding in low-lying areas. Some houses were damaged and destroyed in Crooked Tree. Additionally, a church at San Lazaro in Orange Walk District suffered severe damage. A tornado also caused wind damage in a few villages in northern Belize. As outer rainbands began to drop heavy precipitation in parts of northern Guatemala, authorities issued orange alerts for high-risk areas, with a yellow alert remaining in effect nationwide.|$|E
500|$|Hattie first {{affected}} {{regions in}} the southwestern Caribbean, producing hurricane-force winds and causing one death on San Andres Island. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, which prompted evacuations. Little effects were reported as Hattie turned to the west, although rainfall reached [...] on Grand Cayman. The worst damage was {{in the country of}} Belize. The former capital, Belize City, was flooded by a powerful storm surge and high waves and affected by strong winds. The territory governor estimated 70% of the buildings in the city were damaged, which left over 10,000people homeless. The damage was severe enough that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, <b>Belmopan.</b> In the territory, Hattie left about $60million in damage and caused 307deaths. The government estimated that Hattie was more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000people; the lower toll for Hattie was due to advance warning. Elsewhere in Central America, the hurricane killed 11people in Guatemala and one in Honduras.|$|E
500|$|Hattie first {{affected}} the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, prompting evacuations on the island. While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall {{of up to}} [...] on Grand Cayman. The country of Belize, at the time known as British Honduras, sustained the worst damage from the hurricane. The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge. The territory governor estimated that 70%of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000people homeless. The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, <b>Belmopan.</b> Overall, Hattie caused about $60million in losses and 307deaths in the territory. Although damage was heavier in Hattie than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000people, {{the death toll from}} Hattie was less due to advance warnings. Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 11people in Guatemala and one in Honduras.|$|E
500|$|The {{strong winds}} {{destroyed}} 130 houses in Belize. Two hotel roofs were wrecked, and the winds knocked down trees and power lines. Widespread areas of Belize lost power and telephone service, including Belize City. There, the heavy rainfall flooded streets, reaching [...] deep. Twenty homes were damaged {{to some degree}} in the capital, while many more suffered minor roof damage. The rains flooded {{the first floor of}} the primary hospital in the city, causing severe damage. Nationwide, 11 health facilities were damaged. [...] Elsewhere in the country, the rains increased levels along rivers, including the Belize River, Rio Hondo, and New River. The Belize River rose for several days after the storm, reaching record levels of 21 ft (6.6 m) in width, which isolated 15 villages. Flooding covered Northern Highway and Western Highway as well as the primary bridge from <b>Belmopan</b> to the rest of Cayo District. Residual floodwaters persisted due to the low-lying land of the country and poor drainage. Floods contaminated water supply in the northern four districts, causing an E. coli outbreak and food poisoning. In Belize, Corozal, and Orange Walk districts, about 30% of the houses were severely damaged by flooding.|$|E
500|$|On October 3, a Belize {{ambassador}} {{issued an}} appeal to the international community for food and money due to the damage from Keith. United Nations Development Programme received $30,000 from the Government of Norway to give immediate relief to the country of Belize. United Nations Children's Fund also gave out $150,000 for relief in areas not focused on by other relief groups. The Peace Corps, the Red Cross, and the United States Navy black hawk helicopters worked together to deliver rice, corn, sugar, salt, cooking oil, toilet paper, and medications to about 700 families in Bermuda Landings and adjacent isolated villages. The American Red Cross donated about $28,500 and 4,080 family hygiene kits. Between October and November 2000, the National Society distributed 5,289 food and hygiene parcels to 26,293 people in Belize City, Orange Walk, and <b>Belmopan.</b> Around that time, the Belize Red Cross Society (BRCS) distributed relief items to 4,622 victims in Belize City. The BRCS also shipped [...] two containers with kitchen sets and water buckets for 1,600 families, donated by the German Red Cross. A donation account to help the relief effort, titled Hurricane Keith Relief Fund, was set up by the town of Placencia, in the local Atlantic Bank. The Belize Consulate in California also set up a donation fundraiser. Placencia also delivered a boat full of donated food, clothing, and building supplies to the San Pedro and Caye Caulker area.|$|E
500|$|On October9, the {{government}} of Belize issued the [...] "all clear" [...] signal, indicating that the storm had fully passed, and began reconstruction efforts and damage assessment. The government declared Stann Creek and Toledo districts as disaster areas, and officials declared a nighttime curfew. By {{the day after the}} storm struck, the airport in Belize City had been reopened, and transportation in all but the southern portion of the country returned to normal. Residents {{in the southern part of}} the country lost access to fresh water, forcing them to drink unclean water. Officials sent medical teams to southern Belize in the most affected areas. The <b>Belmopan</b> Red Cross issued an appeal for residents to donate money, clothing, and food for storm victims. The Red Cross also set up shelters and gave food to more than 7,000people. By October19, most roads in southern Belize were reopened. The Belize government printed a new postage stamp to help pay for reconstruction costs, and officials authorized spending $1.2million to rebuild damaged homes. To assist the farmers who lost crops, the Belize government provided [...] of maize seeds, as well as fertilizer. After the storm, the World Food Programme and the Belize Red Cross collectively provided food for the 9,000families in need of subsidence. By October31, the Red Cross had provided blankets, tarps, and hygienic supplies to 4,800people severely affected by the storm. Homes were gradually repaired, and crop production returned to normal by early 2002. Around Christmas of 2001, the Belize Red Cross provided presents to school children in 14villages affected by the storm. The lost banana crop caused sales to decrease by 22% in 2002, although sales gradually recovered.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Belmopan</b> (...) is {{the capital}} city of Belize. Its {{population}} in 2010 was 16,451. Although the smallest capital city in the continental Americas by population, <b>Belmopan</b> is the third-largest settlement in Belize, behind Belize City and San Ignacio. Founded as a planned community in 1970, <b>Belmopan</b> is one of the newest national capital cities in the world.
