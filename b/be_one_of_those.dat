5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, {{the last}} {{original}} novel in the series, begins directly {{after the events}} of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety {{as well as that of}} their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.|$|E

James Reed of The Boston Globe called the song [...] "a thumping club cut that's irresistible". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush described [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] as a [...] "fist-pumping club jam" [...] but felt that it is [...] "not as catchy as 'Beautiful People'". In a review of Fortune, Barry Walters of Spin magazine wrote that [...] "Don't Wake Me Up", along with [...] "Sweet Love" [...] and [...] "Till I Die", contain [...] "thin melodies and stock shock lyrics" [...] that make Brown's previous singles sound better.

In June 2013, McKay officially confirmed his involvement and said that [...] "everyone feels like as good as the first one is, we can really jack it up a level with the second one. So, fingers crossed everyone will come back" [...] (including Renner and Arterton). McKay suggested that Paramount might insist harder to make the film rated PG-13 this time. Talking about Wirkola's [...] "pretty insane" [...] ideas for the second film, McKay said this could <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> instances where the sequel does go further than the first one."

500|$|According to neo-Darwinism, adaptations are {{produced}} incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations {{only if they}} do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: [...] "The wheel may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [...] {{the other side of a}} deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable." [...] In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable [...] "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that [...] "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".|$|E

Bright said of the spinoff, [...] "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [...] because it is dominated by the Brannings. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with TV Guide, calling them the [...] "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, [...] "It's all very sweet for them both at the moment. I reckon they're going to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> couples who you want to shout 'Get a room!' at. They're characters who need to be loved.

500|$|In Bolognini's films, {{thanks to}} her {{aesthetic}} femininity, [...] Cardinale took roles of manipulative women who lead men to perdition. During the filming of Il bell'Antonio, her co-star Marcello Mastroianni {{fell in love with}} her, but she rejected him, as she did not take his love seriously, considering him to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> actors who cannot help but fall in love with their co-stars. Mastroianni insisted that his feelings were genuine, even after many years. The genuine empathy between the two actors proved to be ideal for reproducing the tension between the characters in the film. Cardinale next portrayed Pauline Bonaparte in Abel Gance's French film Napoleone ad Austerlitz, and after appearing opposite Gassman and Salvatori in the sequel to Big Deal on Madonna Street, Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti, she portrayed Ginetta, the fiancée of Spiros Focás, alongside Salvatori and Alain Delon in Luchino Visconti's critically acclaimed Rocco and His Brothers. However, her leading performance in Francesco Maselli's Silver Spoon Set gained her most attention during this period. Francesco Freda felt the film paved her way [...] "to great success", noting the [...] "sweetness of her smile" [...] which struck a chord with the public.|$|E

Dave Larzelere of Sporting News wrote that the bout had [...] "the potential to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> epic Irresistible Force vs. Immoveable Object kind of battles that we talk about forever afterwards, à la Hagler/Hearns or Corrales/Castillo". Jeff Haney of the Las Vegas Sun described the fight as [...] "not only the sport’s most promising matchup of the year. It also conjures memories of past fights in which regional or national pride was at stake", noting the rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Arizona Republic wrote, [...] "Cotto, an impassive and intimidating Puerto Rican, and Margarito, a patient and tough Mexican, are another chapter in a rivalry rich in legends and still productive". Yahoo! Sports writer Kevin Iole felt that the boxing match would provide a performance {{similar to that of}} the fight between Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales, which was named fight of the year by The Ring magazine.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of The X-Files reacted {{positively}} to the episode. Gillian Anderson cited the episode as being among her highlights of the third season.

[...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I don't know anybody in the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. You know, when people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> episodes that is immediately revered." [...] Assistant director Tom Braidwood appreciated Charles Nelson Reilly's presence, saying that he captivated virtually everyone and gave everyone a lift, nicknaming everyone on the crew.

He noted that [...] "what makes I Am...Yours stand apart from a typical live-album cash-in is the mostly unexpected covers that are weaved into the set." [...] Kellman finished his review by writing, [...] "As live albums go, this is not quite destined to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> all-time classics; a couple missing songs and a little too much talk aside, however, the fans couldn't ask for more." ...|$|E
500|$|The White House is {{also said}} to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal {{government}} in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, [...] "I'm Mr. Burns." [...] The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and sea force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.|$|E
