25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E

While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash.

Methods and resultsIn 133 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (83 paroxysmal type, 50 persistent/long-lasting persistent type), we performed complete isolation of the posterior LA including pulmonary veins (Box isolation) using NCM. Isochronal activation maps were analyzed during sinus rhythm (SR), during pacing from the proximal coronary sinus (CS), and during pacing within the posterior LA before and after ablation. In sinus rhythm, horizontal conduction along the LA roof line, but not into the posterior LA wall, was observed in 59 % of the patients. During paroxysmal CS pacing, horizontal conduction along the LA <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>was</b> observed in 69 % of the patients. Posterior wall pacing conducted vertically over the LA roof and <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> in 98 % and 83 % of the patients, respectively. During AF, rotor wave conduction into the posterior LA through the LA roof and <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> <b>was</b> observed in 85 % of the patients. Heterogeneous conduction directions in the posterior LA at the LA roof and <b>bottom</b> <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> observed in 60 % of the patients. ConclusionsHeterogeneous conduction was observed at the roof and inferior region of the posterior LA in most of these AF patients.
