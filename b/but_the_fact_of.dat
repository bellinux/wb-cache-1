25|$|The {{situation}} is slightly more complex if electronic formatting {{is to be}} used. Where distribution is to be by CD-ROM or other physical media, {{there is no reason}} to treat this form differently from a paper format, and national copyright is an acceptable approach. But the possibility of Internet download without the ability to restrict physical distribution within national boundaries presents legal problems that are usually solved by selling language or translation rights rather than national rights. Thus, Internet access across the European Union is relatively open because of the laws forbidding discrimination based on nationality, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> publication in, say, France, limits the target market to those who read French.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
500|$|Linklater cites Perceval's {{greatest}} achievement as {{his insistence}} on keeping Wellington's {{army in the}} field, a policy which helped to turn [...] the tide in the Napoleonic Wars [...] decisively in [...] Britain's favour. Despite this, {{with the passage of}} time [...] Perceval's reputation faded; Charles Dickens considered him [...] "a third-rate politician scarcely fit to carry Lord Chatham's crutch". [...] In due course, little <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> his assassination lingered in public memory. As the bicentenary of the shooting approached, Perceval was described in newspapers as [...] "the prime minister that history forgot".|$|E
50|$|The seller must {{sell the}} {{property}} in contravention of the edict; in other words, must defy {{the requirements of the}} edict by failing to disclose the existence of the defect. The ordinary rules of non-disclosure apply here, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case determine which of the two actions is appropriate.|$|R
60|$|The Reverend John Hodder {{is called}} to a fashionable church in a middle-western city. He knows little of modern {{problems}} and in his theology is as orthodox as the rich men who control his church could desire. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> modern life are thrust upon him; an awakening follows {{and in the end}} he works out a solution.|$|R
50|$|Lennon {{had been}} shot four times and had not been {{pronounced}} dead on arrival, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooting were not clear {{at the time of}} the announcement. Lennon once appeared on Monday Night Football, during the December 9, 1974 telecast of a 23-17 Washington Redskins win over the Los Angeles Rams, and was interviewed for a short breakaway segment by Cosell.|$|R
500|$|The rapid {{advancement}} {{and personal}} arrogance of the Munshi would inevitably {{have led to}} his unpopularity, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> his race made all emotions run hotter against him. [...] Racialism was a scourge of the age; it went {{hand in hand with}} belief in the appropriateness of Britain's global dominion. [...] For a dark-skinned Indian to be put very nearly on a level with the queen's white servants was all but intolerable, for him to eat at the same table as them, to share in their daily lives was viewed as an outrage. [...] Yet the queen was determined to impose harmony on her household. [...] Race hatred was intolerable to her, and the [...] "dear good Munshi" [...] deserving of nothing but respect.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Goody {{asked to}} be baptised; two days later, she and her sons were christened. Clifford {{confirmed}} that this was her last public appearance, and she had already said her goodbyes to her family: [...] "We're hoping and praying that Jade pulls through, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> {{the matter is that}} she now only has a short time to live." [...] He confirmed that during the next 24 hours her doctors could assess how long Goody had to live, but she had a very short time left in any case. Jack Tweed was allowed to extend his curfew, spending a last night with his wife before she said goodbye to the rest of her family.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the election, Rove voiced {{impatience with}} the notion that his own {{reputation}} is on the ballot. He told the Washington Post, [...] "I understand some will see the election as a judgment on me, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the matter is that, look what has been set in motion: a broader, deeper, strengthened Republican Party, and with an emphasis on grass-roots neighbor-to-neighbor politics, is going to continue." [...] After the election, Rove continued to express optimism, telling the Post, [...] "The Republican philosophy is alive and well and likely to reemerge in the majority in 2008." [...] Rove also told the Post that the GOP election strategy was working until the Mark Foley scandal put the Republican campaign [...] "back on its heels". Rove added [...] "We were on a roll, and [...] stopped it.... It revived all the stuff about Jack Abramoff and added to it." ...|$|E

No {{wonder the}} medical fogies in Middlemarch are jealous, {{when some of}} the {{greatest}} doctors living were fierce upon Vesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he showed that Galen was wrong. They called him a liar and a poisonous monster. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human frame were on his side; and so he got the better of them." ...|$|R
60|$|Still Duane kept silence. He was not {{thinking}} <b>of</b> danger, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> how fleeting must be his stay among friends.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1915, the army was in steady retreat, which was not always orderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic flight were not uncommon. By 1916, however, the {{situation}} had improved in many respects. Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of life. Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic production. Nevertheless, {{by the end of}} 1916, morale among soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915. The fortunes of war may have improved, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the war, still draining away strength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families, remained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution) [...] "was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't make me {{feel too}} gluttonous," [...] she begged, as she stepped out. [...] "I really am not {{in the habit of}} {{inviting}} myself to luncheon like this, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> it is--" ...|$|E
60|$|These {{words were}} not {{especially}} touching or sympathetic. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> that resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her emotions powerfully. With a little faint cry, and throwing her arms out, Mrs Verloc {{burst into tears}} at last.|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{must have}} that {{appearance}} to you; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case are simple;” {{and he told}} the story of the fight. “The battle was practically over when the first shot was fired,” he said. “The two French ships lost upwards of seventy killed and over a hundred wounded, while we had only four men killed and two wounded. If the place had been designed by nature specially for defence it could not have been better adapted for us.” ...|$|R
60|$|But {{you will}} observe one {{remarkable}} circumstance, that, {{up to this}} point, {{the question of the}} life of these organisms has not come under consideration. Morphology and distribution might be studied almost as well, if animals and plants were a peculiar kind of crystals, and possessed none of those functions which distinguish living beings so remarkably. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> morphology and distribution have to be accounted for, and the science, the aim of which it is to account for them, is Physiology.|$|R
25|$|In Villanueva, another slander case {{involving}} two local politicians of Concepcion, Tarlac, the court reiterated its interpretation of <b>the</b> phrase, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> other <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case precluded acquittal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} the dean and chapter and the prebendary's widow," [...] said Eleanor. [...] "Of course you must take them as they come. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> your having a great cathedral in which such {{ornaments}} are required could not but be in your favour." ...|$|E
60|$|Sunday came. The {{challenge}} {{had been}} bruited abroad, and the fishermen and seafaring folk of Benicia {{turned out to}} a man, crowding Steamboat Wharf till {{it looked like the}} grand stand at a football match. Charley and I had been sceptical, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the crowd convinced us that there was something in Demetrios Contos's dare.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{mentioned}} here that Sam, Tom and Dick were {{now in the}} same grade. This may be wondered at, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the matter was that Sam, by hard work the term previous, had caught up to Tom, while Dick, because of being away on some business for his father at various times, had dropped a little behind.|$|E
50|$|The sudden {{ending of}} Bennet's career in 1824 (apparently {{due to the}} death from {{consumption}} of his only son six months after that of a daughter) {{was followed by a}} continental trip in 1825. His reputation was ruined by the threat of prosecution for importuning a young male servant at Spa in August 1825. Bennet represented himself as the victim of a conspiracy to extort money, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case worked against him. When Parliament was dissolved in 1826 his name was linked with that of the homosexual Richard Heber.|$|R
60|$|All {{that had}} {{happened}} was for <b>the</b> best. <b>But</b> for my folly many men might have been slain, and that folly {{would not have been}} committed <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scout's having been taking prisoner.|$|R

"It was thoughtless in me, old fellow, not to {{have sent}} you word when I {{concluded}} to remain at home two days longer, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> {{the matter is that}} I did not think you would be at the depot to meet me, but would let me hunt you up, for I suppose you do have some kind of an office." ...|$|E
60|$|I was inexpressibly touched to get {{a letter}} from some lawyers as to some money. I have never had any account with my friends; some have gained and some lost; and I should feel there was {{something}} dishonest in a partial liquidation even if I could recollect the facts, WHICH I CANNOT. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> his having put aside this memorandum touched me greatly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} {{on that subject}} many times," [...] said Mr. Crowder, [...] "not only in regard to this case, but others, and have formed {{hundreds}} of plans for carrying my possessions into another set of social conditions; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> being obliged to change my identity always {{made it impossible for}} me to avail myself of the advantages of commercial paper, legal deeds, and all titles to property." ...|$|E
25|$|Goddard {{remarked that}} what troubled him was not Bentley being hanged {{when he was}} close to <b>the</b> minimum age, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hard <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, such as his being {{innocent}} of the murder of PC Miles.|$|R
6000|$|... § XLVII. The second form {{of error}} {{is when the}} men <b>of</b> design despise <b>facts.</b> All noble design must deal with facts to a certain extent, for there is no food for it <b>but</b> in nature. <b>The</b> best colorist invents best by taking hints from natural colors; from birds, skies, or groups of figures. And if, in the delight of inventing fantastic color and form the truths of nature are {{wilfully}} neglected, the intellect becomes comparatively decrepit, and that state of art results which we find among the Chinese. The Greek designers delighted in <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human form, and became great in consequence; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> lower nature were disregarded by them, and their inferior ornament became, therefore, dead and valueless.|$|R
5000|$|Using these concepts, Konnov {{considers}} {{the transformation of}} artistic style from the Middle Ages to Postmodern. The subject of discussion is historical typology of the artistic process. Empirical researches of art history show, that style dynamics is not according to well known scheme: Renaissance, Baroque, Classicism, Romanticism, Realism, Symbolism (Modernism), Postmodern. This model (with various additions and updates) is reproduced in numerous conceptions <b>of</b> art history. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>of</b> artistic practice are not correspond to this one*. As {{solution to the problem}} in the thesis it proposes to interpret the [...] "styles" [...] of the Renaissance and Modern period as the moduses of one total style, called [...] "immanent style". Art practice of Modernism and Postmodern is also covered by one [...] "simulative style".|$|R
6000|$|... "Her {{story was}} a lie from {{beginning}} to end," [...] Peter said, [...] "and {{it is quite possible}} that it was a got-up thing, on purpose to see whether we could talk Spanish well.

60|$|This was {{a manner}} in which the squire had by no means {{expected}} to have the affair presented to him. It seemed so impossible that any sound-minded man should take any but his view of the case, that he had not prepared himself for argument. There was every objection to his son marrying Miss Thorne; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> their having no income between them, did certainly justify him in alleging that first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{should be}} only too {{glad to get}} that berth for one of them. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> the matter is, the captain of that ship wants an officer who can speak French fluently, and that's {{not so easy to}} find.
