Follow-up observations in 2018 are planned to secure their orbits and perhaps find new moons.|$|E

Joshi claims FDI will help the farm sector improve critical infrastructure and integrate farmer-consumer relationship. Today, the existing retail {{has not been able}} to supply fresh vegetables to the consumers <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> invested in the backward integration. When the farmers' produce reaches the end consumer directly, the farmers will naturally be benefited. Joshi feels retail reform is just a first step of needed agricultural reforms in India, and that the government should pursue additional reforms.|$|E
25|$|UNHCR's mandate has {{gradually}} been {{expanded to include}} protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and people in IDP-like situations. These are civilians who {{have been forced to}} flee their homes, but who have not reached a neighboring country. IDPs do not fit the legal definition of a refugee under the 1951 Refugee Convention, 1967 Protocol and the 1969 Organization for African Unity Convention, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> left their country. As the nature of war has changed in the last few decades, with more and more internal conflicts replacing interstate wars, the number of IDPs has increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|The Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} in 3-0 {{ruling on}} July 17, 2013 Judge’s Forrest ruling which struck down § 1021(b)(2) {{of the controversial}} U.S. military-detention law NDAA as unconstitutional because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Court of Appeals overturned Forrest’s decision in a 60-page ruling and lifted her injunction, saying that Christopher Hedges and another plaintiff weren’t eligible to challenge the law because it “simply says nothing about the government’s authority to detain citizens.” The court held that under their interpretation the government could not use the particular law challenged by the citizen plaintiffs to militarily detain them, so they had no basis for the court to hear their case. But the court acknowledged that this doesn’t mean that the government could not rely on other laws, including the AUMF {{to the events of}} September 11, to justify indefinite military detention of citizens. The court concluded that the non-citizen plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of being detained and thus could not have their challenge of the law adjudicated by the court. “And while Section 1021 does have a real bearing on those who are neither citizens nor lawful resident aliens and who are apprehended abroad, the non-citizen plaintiffs also have failed to establish standing <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> shown a sufficient threat that the government will detain them under Section 1021,” the court said.|$|E

500|$|Eris (then {{known as}} [...] ) was {{discovered}} in January 2005; it {{was thought to be}} slightly larger than Pluto, and some reports informally referred to it as the tenth planet. As a consequence, the issue became a matter of intense debate during the IAU General Assembly in August 2006. The IAU's initial draft proposal included Charon, Eris, and Ceres in the list of planets. After many astronomers objected to this proposal, an alternative was drawn up by Uruguayan astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández: he proposed an intermediate category for objects large enough to be round but which had not cleared their orbits of planetesimals. Dropping Charon from the list, the new proposal also removed Pluto, Ceres, and Eris, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> cleared their orbits.|$|E
500|$|The Government {{has denied}} these claims, citing {{the lack of}} substantiating evidence.

The Government has also pointed out that Singapore's legal system has won excellent ratings in international surveys. Lee Kuan Yew has also defended the system, asserting that doing things the Government's way has allowed Singapore to be prosperous, orderly and corruption-free whilst gaining international respect; and that the [...] "threat of defamation proceedings may make opposition politicians weigh their words more carefully than they do elsewhere".|$|E

500|$|Many {{unidentified}} late-14th- and early-15th-century northern {{artists were}} of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, [...] "much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied". Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities {{of a number of}} well-known artists have been founded {{on the basis of a}} single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called Master of the Legend of the Magdalen, who may have been Pieter van Coninxloo, is one of the more notable examples; others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.|$|E

However, a {{significant}} market remains for simple rustic pieces (pre-alebrije) and pieces painted with traditional aniline paints, which La Union specializes in. These are popular with those seeking non alebrije pieces such as saints, angels, devils, skeletons and motifs related to Day of the Dead. Alebrije pieces are also made, but are painted simply {{with one or two}} colors with few decorations. La Union artisans make multipiece rodeos, fiestas, and nativity scenes. [...] Another rustic aspect to La Union pieces is that legs can be nailed onto the torsos.|$|E

2500|$|The Ghost Festival is {{held during}} the seventh {{month of the}} Chinese calendar. It also falls {{at the same time}} as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of Buddhist monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the {{assembly}} of the local community. During this month, the gates of hell are opened up and ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who forgot to pay tribute to them after they died, or those who were never given a proper ritual send-off. They have long needle-thin necks <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been fed by their family, or as a punishment so that they are unable to swallow. Family members offer prayers to their deceased relatives, offer food and drink and burn hell bank notes and other forms of joss paper. Joss paper items are believed to have value in the afterlife, considered to be very similar in some aspects to the material world, People burn paper houses, cars, servants and televisions to please the ghosts. Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A large feast is held for the ghosts on the fourteenth day of the seventh month, when people bring samples of food and place them on an offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. [...] Lotus-shaped lanterns are lit and set afloat in rivers and out onto seas to symbolicly guide the lost souls of forgotten ancestors to the afterlife.|$|E
