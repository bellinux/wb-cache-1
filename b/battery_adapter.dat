50|$|The AN/PVS-4 uses a 25mm screw-type variable-gain Image Intensifier tube. Operational voltage is 3.0 Volts. Early {{production}} models feature two circular battery compartments {{located on the}} main housing. These battery compartments are designed to accommodate one 3.0V BA-5567/U, or two 1.5V BA-3058/U simultaneously. Later designations such as the AN/PVS-4A use two common AA batteries (BA-3058/U) via a purpose-built adapter (PN A3009873) that attaches {{to one of the}} circular battery compartments. Use of the adapter negates the need for BA-5567/U and BA-3058/U. AN/PVS-4s still in use today are typically upgraded with the AA <b>battery</b> <b>adapter</b> even if they have not been upgraded to a third generation tube. Some AN/PVS-4A models made after 1984 feature an integral AA battery housing that does not require the use of an external AA <b>battery</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the 1980s Morley {{reduced the}} housing and treadle {{size of their}} pedals {{significantly}} and eventually changed the chassis to black. 9VDC battery power with an AC adapter jack (wall-wart jack) became standard as Morley pedals evolved {{in an effort to}} compete with the new compact pedals from companies like Boss, Ibanez, and DOD. Morley also manufactured some small non-treadle style effects for a while. Morley was sold to a Chicago based firm, Sound Enhancements, Inc., in 1989. The modern Morley company continues to use the electro-optical circuitry and basic pedal layout pioneered by Raymond and Marvin Lubow in the 1960s, albeit with some refinements. Original Morley pedals were strictly AC powered, whereas the current models are powered by a 9V <b>battery</b> with AC <b>adapter</b> capability. Tel-Ray Morleys used a small light-bulb to drive the LDRs; modern Morleys use LEDs.|$|R
40|$|The Waterproof Electrical Box was {{manufactured}} to an 8 inch internal diameter. It {{hosts the}} GPS, a sin-gle board computer, <b>battery</b> and <b>adapter</b> cable. Internal LED warning light prevents obstacle collision in nighttime operations. The Cover is designed from a 4 ” PVC Pipe and its total length is 5 feet which cal-culated through the steps below. The hydrophone and transmitter {{is designed to}} be positioned on the bot-tom section of the Cover for the acoustic network. It is going to be linked to the electrical dome by a tether cable and the adapter card. Conclusion The set of three buoys allows the Eco-Dolphin team to track the location of a group of AUV’s while they are submerged below water. The buoy system acts as the relay station from surface operations to underwater operations, which is a necessary link in communication required for navigation and spatial awareness of the plat-form design. This segment started with designing the three buoys, taking the product into manufacturing, and redesigning details to fulfill the tasks required of the network. Testing was performed on both the buoyancy and stability of the buoys in the ERAU pool through prior appointment. The acoustic component of the NSA System consumed all the financial resource that was in the budget such that the GPS component of the NSA System could not be worked on. Hence the GPS navi-gation remains to be a future research component for the organization...|$|R
2500|$|Initially some {{companies}} steered away from emulating the subtractive synthesis {{in the digital}} realm because {{it was difficult to}} model how a filter would respond to these complex signals. [...] By the early '90s some fairly good implementations were beginning to appear. [...] The Peavey DPM series also touted as the first keyboards that could import samples which were not 'sampling keyboards'. [...] They also were the first to use off the shelf DSP chips, which emulated the response of analog filters. This sample playback technology also spawned a vast number of inexpensive consumer units called [...] in electronics stores. [...] As the price of memory began to plummet every company was making keyboards of this type. Casio and Yamaha have led sales in these types of units which feature built in speaker systems, usually can run from <b>batteries</b> or power <b>adapters,</b> and have a library of samples with very limited editing if any.

50|$|Computer speakers, or {{multimedia}} speakers, are speakers {{sold for}} use with computers, although usually capable of other audio uses, e.g. for an MP3 player. Most such speakers have an internal amplifier and consequently require a power source, which may be by a mains power supply often via an AC <b>adapter,</b> <b>batteries,</b> or a USB port (able to supply no more than 2.5W DC, 500mA at 5V). The signal input connector is often a 3.5 mm jack plug (usually color-coded lime green per the PC 99 standard); RCA connectors are sometimes used, and a USB port may supply both signal and power (requiring additional circuitry, and only suitable {{for use with}} a computer). Battery-powered wireless Bluetooth speakers require no connections at all.
