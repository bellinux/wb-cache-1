AFC Wimbledon were Kingsmeadow sub-tenants <b>before</b> <b>buying</b> the lease in June 2003, making it their “home” until their move to Wimbledon was feasible. Kingstonian secured a 25-year sub-tenancy agreement, with customary break clauses. The clubs operated a ground-sharing arrangement, with Kingstonian receiving cheap rental terms. In 2015 AFC Wimbledon agreed plans to sell Kingsmeadow to Chelsea in order to help finance their plans to move back to a new stadium in Wimbledon. Chelsea have stated that they wish to use the ground for their own youth and ladies' teams and are unwilling to accommodate Kingstonian at Kingsmeadow.

Kain was understanding {{of the cost of the}} standalone as selling it cheaply would have affronted those who had bought a premium version of Infinite Warfare for the remaster, but had been [...] "almost certain" [...] that the game would have included the DLC. Subsequently, he wrote that doing so would have been [...] "a gesture of good will to the community" [...] and [...] "a smart move for the company". Mic's Jason Faulkner condemned Activision's previous business practices involving Remastered and found the standalone version to be [...] "a bad deal", criticizing that it was being sold for double that of its cost when bundled with Infinite Warfare, and found it [...] "ridiculous" [...] that with the DLC it amounted to almost full-price.

Another UK publication, The Games Machine, gave the game an 89% rating. The reviewer noted that the third-person arcade style combat view is a great improvement for SSI, as they had traditionally incorporated simplistic graphics in their role-playing games. The reviewer was critical that Pool of Radiance was not original in its presentation and that the colors were a little drab, but concluded that the game is [...] "classic Dungeons & Dragons which SSI have recreated excellently". A review from Zzap was less positive, giving the game a score of 80%.
