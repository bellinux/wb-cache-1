500|$|Justice David Souter {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. Souter noted that any suit against the United States required a clear waiver of sovereign immunity and held that a waiver was granted by the Indian Tucker Act if there were statutory grounds in another federal statute or regulation. Souter then noted the difference between a [...] "limited" [...] or <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> obligation, as was outlined in United States v. Mitchell I (Mitchell I), and those which could impose fiduciary duties and carry monetary damages, as outlined in United States v. Mitchell II (Mitchell II). In Mitchell I, the United States held the land in trust to prevent alienation and to exempt the land from state taxation, but the tribe occupied and controlled the property. [...] In such cases, the government did not have a fiduciary duty. In Mitchell II, the United States also held the land in trust, but actively controlled the property through comprehensive timber management regulations. [...] Here, the government did have a fiduciary duty to the tribe.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, {{authoritative}} treatise writers such as James Kent and Joseph Story represented Anglo-American trust law as a seamless web. But the transplantation of trust law from England to America was not a simple process of adherence. Rather, American courts and legislatures came to discard fundamental English trust doctrines. Restraints on anticipation and on alienation were embraced, and in key state jurisdictions <b>bare</b> <b>trusts</b> were abolished, or else displaced from the core of trust law. Irreducible settlor power over beneficiaries and the strong protection of beneficiaries from creditors under spendthrift trusts were two strikingly original American creations, which flowed from these basic doctrinal choices. The changes made to American trust doctrine yield a paradox for the legal, social and economic historian, namely that republican America {{ended up with a}} more dynastic property law, more wedded to dead hand control and more hostile to commercial creditors, than did aristocratic England with its unreformed system of common law and equity rooted in the feudal property system. The American abandonment of free alienability of beneficial interests and the corresponding reduction of the beneficiary's powers over trust assets may have been rooted in the volatility of credit in America and the desire of the wealthy to escape from the pressures of the market, though disparities between jurisdictions remain to be explained. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

60|$|The Bishop and Pasvorang, who {{had gone}} ashore together, beheld men, women, and {{children}} {{running up and down}} these ladders, and walking about the <b>bare</b> branches, <b>trusting</b> entirely to their feet and not touching with their hands. The Bishop, in his wet slippery shoes, did not think it right to run the risk of an accident: and though Pasvorang, who was as much at home as a sailor among the ropes of the 'Southern Cross,' made the ascent, he came down saying, 'I was so afraid, my legs shook. Don't you go, going aloft is nothing to it;' but the people could not understand any dread; and when the Bishop said, 'I can't go up there. I am neither bird nor bat, and I have no wings if I fall,' they thought him joking. At the same time he saw a woman with a load on her back, quietly walking up a ladder to another tree, not indeed so lofty as that Pasvorang had tried, but {{as if it were the}} most natural thing in the world, and without attempting to catch hold with her hands.|$|R
5000|$|... a <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> {{where the}} money involved, the trust fund, is held for the injured party {{outright}} with administrative powers being given to the trustees.

50|$|The <b>Bare</b> <b>Trust</b> Deed Trust Deed {{is a key}} document. Care is {{required}} to ensure there are no adverse GST, taxation or stamp duty consequences.

50|$|Although {{the rule}} is most often {{exercised}} {{where there is a}} sole trustee holding the trust fund on a <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> for a sole beneficiary (usually where the trusts were held for the benefit of a tenant for life, who has died, and the sole beneficiary is the remainderman), {{the rule is}} not limited to those circumstances. However, if {{there is more than one}} beneficiary, then all of them need to be adults and without any disability.|$|E
60|$|With {{fourteen}} companions {{he crosses}} the sea. There is an excellent bit of ocean poetry here (ll. 210-224), and we get a vivid idea of the hospitality of a brave people by following the poet's description of Beowulf's meeting with King Hrothgar and Queen Wealhtheow, and of the joy and feasting and story-telling in Heorot. The picture of Wealhtheow passing the mead cup to the warriors with her own hand is a noble one, and plainly indicates the reverence paid by these strong men to their wives and mothers. Night comes on; the fear of Grendel is again upon the Danes, and all withdraw after the king has warned Beowulf of the frightful danger of sleeping in the hall. But Beowulf lies down with his warriors, saying proudly that, since weapons will not avail against the monster, he will grapple with him <b>bare</b> handed and <b>trust</b> to a warrior's strength.|$|R
5000|$|The joint receivers' issued summons for {{determination}} {{claiming that}} (1) although the clause referred to [...] "equitable and beneficial ownership" [...] {{it did not}} have the effect of creating a <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> {{for the benefit of the}} sellers, but rather it created a floating equitable charge in favour of the sellers; and (2) such a floating charge was created by the buyer company would therefore registerable, and so was void if not registered (as was in fact the case).|$|E

This [...] "bag of rights", normally known as the [...] "discount", is deemed to be retained by the settlor. The remainder will be treated like any other gift into trust (a chargeable transfer (CT) {{in the case of a}} discretionary trust, or a potentially exempt transfer (PET) for a <b>bare</b> <b>trust),</b> leaving the IHT net after 7 years (or 14 years in some cases).|$|E
50|$|Vandervell donated {{a large sum}} {{of money}} to the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) to {{establish}} a chair. He implemented a complex tax avoidance scheme. He instructed a bank, orally, to transfer complete ownership of 100,000 A-shares in his company, Vandervell Products, which they held on <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> for him to the RCS and asked the RCS to grant an option simultaneously to purchase the shares to his trust company, Vandervell Trustees. He then instructed the VP to declare a dividend on the shares. The purpose of this was to avoid paying stamp duty by a written declaration of disposition of equitable ownership, and to avoid any liability for Vandervell to pay surtax on the dividends since the RCS was a charity and thus not liable to pay tax. This led to a leading case in English trusts law, Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners 1967 2 AC 291.|$|E

40|$|In {{commercial}} structures {{legal title}} to assets is often held in <b>bare</b> <b>trust.</b> There are various reasons for doing so. The motivation {{may be a}} desire for anonymity. An express trust <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> can be an efficient entity for pooling income yielding assets. In all instances it is intended {{that the benefits of}} ownership will pass more-or-less seamlessly to the beneficiary, {{who may or may not}} also be the settlor. The issue from a GST perspective is whether this goal may be attained. There are no statutory references to bare trusts in the GST Act. This raises the first issue. What is, or is not, a <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> largely depends on the statutory context in which the term appears. There are several possibilities. If the term does not appear in the GST Act, which meaning does it take for GST purposes? Further uncertainties are apparent. Can a bare trustee also be regarded as an agent at law? Is a bare trustee an entity for GST purposes? Can a bare trustee carry on an enterprise and hence be registered? Is the settlement of legal title in <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> "a supply" by the settlor? If so, is there consideration for that supply such that it could be a taxable supply? Can input tax credits be claimed on third party supplies to the bare trustee? If so, which entity can claim them? Further, what is the Australian Taxation Office's published view on these issues? There is, at least, a known answer to that question: it does not have one. Therefore, how does it administer the GST law...|$|E
40|$|Companies in International Private Law Private {{companies}} are {{acting in the}} international context much more intensively than in any time before. There are many ways how {{to act on the}} international market. One of the solutions is to establish a branch or a representation office instead of establishing a brand new company. The right to act in the international context using branch companies is known as the freedom of establishment. There were numerous discussions and cases concerning the topic of the freedom of establishment. The main dispute arose on the ground of the different approach between two main theories - the seat theory and incorporation theory. The diploma thesis in your hand covers main issues concerning the freedom of establishment and it also discusses the case law provided by the European Court of Justice.

40|$|New Zealand and Canadian {{courts are}} willing to reduce the {{liability}} of a fiduciary for breach of fiduciary duty {{to take account of}} the claimant’s contributory fault, whereas English and Australian courts are not. The picture is less clear as regards breaches of trust not involving a breach of fiduciary duty, such as merely careless breaches of trust. English courts have assumed that there is no scope in any case of breach of trust for reducing trustee liability to take account of the beneficiary’s contributory fault, but this paper demonstrates that there is no binding authority to that effect. In the absence of authority the matter falls to be determined as a matter of principle. There are a number of obstacles of principle in the way of apportionment of liability between trustee and beneficiary on the ground of contributory fault. One significant obstacle is the basic difference between the compensatory aim of tortious liability and the traditional aim of trustee liability to reinstate the trust fund by means of the action for account. Another is the exemplary nature of trustee liability, which favours the enforcement of trust obligations even where this might over compensate individual beneficiaries. Significant though these obstacles are, it is demonstrated that they can be overcome {{in the case of a}} careless breach by the trustee of a <b>bare</b> <b>trust.</b> In such a case there is no significant difference between the conceptual basis for, and remedies for, negligently caused harm in tort actions and actions for breach of trust. The trustee’s fault-based liability in such a case should therefore be capable of reduction to take account of the beneficiary’s own fault...|$|E
40|$|Choses {{in action}} are {{valuable}} assets. This has compelled (and been facilitated by) {{the development of}} legal devices such as equitable assignment to allow holders of choses to deal with them, inter vivos. This thesis makes two claims. First, equitable assignments are best conceived as a composite of a <b>bare</b> <b>trust</b> and an atypical agency where the assignee is authorised to invoke the assignor's entitlements against the obligor to the chose assigned, as the assignee pleases. On this conception, equitable assignments merely entail generation of {{a new set of}} jural relations as between assignor and assignee. Though these affect how the jural relations between assignor and obligor are to be discharged, those jural relations are left intact and unchanged, unless the requirements for 'statutory' assignments have been satisfied. Second, 'statutory' assignments are regulatory in effect. Where a debt or other chose in action has been validly equitably assigned and the requirements in s 136 (1) Law of Property Act 1925 are satisfied, the specific entitlements set out in sections 136 (1) (a), (b) and (c) will be passed from the assignor and transferred to the assignee. But that is only true with regards entitlements falling within those provisions, and the set of entitlements listed therein is not exhaustive. The composite model of equitable assignment, and the clarification of the nature of 'statutory' assignment, reduces confusion over their operation and effects. Accordingly, this thesis tempers the urge towards legislative reform of the law of assignment: reform may not be needed since the law is not incoherent, though it is certainly complex. And if targeted law reform to simplify the law on assignment be thought desirable, it is as well to know what one is reforming. </p...|$|E
