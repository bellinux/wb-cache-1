50|$|Sometimes, when {{a female}} golden-winged sunbird intrudes on a bronzy sunbird's territory, it {{performs}} a begging display by quivering its wings and spreading its tail. This causes the <b>bronzy</b> <b>sunbird</b> {{to tolerate the}} foraging of the golden-winged sunbird in its territory. Female sunbirds spread their feet apart on the stalk of a Leonotis plant and turn their bodies 90Â° to the stalk and fan their tail feathers to varying degrees.|$|E
50|$|Usually territories involve only {{a single}} {{resident}} individual. Occasionally, a female can coexist with a male on a large territory and participate in its defence. Such sharing may relate to a complex prolonged pattern of pair formation. Feeding territories may be defended by all age and sex classes of the golden-winged sunbirds, including juveniles. The birds defend their territories both intra-specifically and inter-specifically against all sunbird species in the area. The success of the defence depends {{in part on the}} dominance relationships of the intruding individual, where persistent individuals of larger bird species such as the <b>bronzy</b> <b>sunbird</b> may feed successfully. Territory sizes vary greatly, ranging from 6.7 to 2300 m2, but each territory contains about the same number of flowers.|$|E
