40|$|The {{results of}} visual and {{ultrasonic}} nondestructive tests (NDT) on a DC- 10 rudder constructed of Thornel 300 / 5208 graphite-epoxy are presented. A viscous couplant {{was used for}} both contact pulse-echo ultrasonics and the Fokker bondtester. Attention {{is given to the}} stiffness of cohesive bond structures (the rudder is assembled primarily in a basic six-ply pattern), and to possible delamination. A piezoelectric transducer is employed to sense changes in impedance and signal amplitude. In all, four <b>rudder</b> <b>units</b> were evaluated. The main problems found in the units were porosity and cracking. It is noted that <b>rudder</b> <b>unit</b> four was able to be sufficiently cured to permit static tests on all rib, spar, and skin panel interfaces...|$|R

2500|$|A {{powerful}} steam windlass {{was situated}} {{forward on the}} shelter deck for working the anchors, which were arranged to be stowed in hawse pipes, and two large capstans were fitted aft on the shelter deck for warping purposes. A combined steam and hand steering engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful steering gear situated forward, the purpose of which was to operate a <b>bow</b> <b>rudder</b> so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and hand gear.|$|R
5000|$|The Medina {{class were}} a {{development}} of the Rendel (or [...] "flat-iron") gunboat, {{a series of small}} vessels with low freeboards which mounted a small number of relatively large guns. Although the Medinas were exceptionally provided with masts to extend their range and independence, in essence they were available for similar operations to their un-masted sisters; offensive action against shore defences. Their ungainly appearance led them to be described by the naval historian Antony Preston as [...] "the most grotesque craft ever seen". [...] All 12 vessels of the class were named after rivers.

40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of the two-stage hypersonic SAeNGER {{transport system}} are examined {{by means of}} numerical integration of the preservation equations. First of all, a frictionless fluid is taken. The influence of interference between the HORUS and the ISIS aerial <b>rudder</b> <b>units</b> {{on the distribution of}} pressure in the ISIS aerial <b>rudder</b> <b>unit</b> is analyzed. Both a detailed parametrical study of a model geometry and the calculations for the actual aerial rudder- unit configuration show that there is only a low level of interaction between the flow fields of the HORUS and ISIS aerial <b>rudder</b> <b>units.</b> The subsequent investigations for the HORUS-ISIS separation procedure reveal that the dependence of the HORUS pitching moment on the relative angle of attack and gap width is different for a frictionless and viscose fluid. The differences are mainly caused in the impact boundary layer interaction which arose in the case of viscose flow. (orig.) Die Aerodynamik des zweistufigen hypersonischen Transportsystems SAeNGER wird durch numerische Integration der Erhaltungsgleichungen untersucht. Zunaechst wird fuer ein reibungsfreies Fluid der Einfluss von Interferenzen zwischen HORUS- und ISIS- Seitenleitwerk auf die Druckverteilung des ISIS-Seitenleitwerks analysiert. Sowohl eine ausfuehrliche Parameterstudie fuer eine Modellgeometrie als auch die Rechnungen fuer die reelle Seitenleitwerkkonfiguration zeigen, dass es lediglich zu einer geringen Wechselwirkung zwischen den Stroemungsfeldern der HORUS- und ISIS Seitenleitwerke kommt. Die anschliessenden Untersuchungen fuer den HORUS-ISIS Trennvorgang ergeben eine unterschiedliche Abhaengigkeit des Pitch Moments des HORUS vom relativen Anstellwinkel und von der Spaltweite fuer ein reibungsfreies und viskoses Fluid. Die Unterschiede werden vor allem durch die bei viskoser Stroemung vorhandene Stoss- Grenzschicht Wechselwirkung hervorgerufen. (orig.)

50|$|Waterwitch was an {{armoured}} gunboat of the breastwork type, with a hull {{constructed of}} iron. Her 4+1/2 in armour plating {{was backed by}} 10 in of teak and extended for about 60 ft amidships. The bottom of the armoured box extended 3 to 4 ft below the waterline {{and up to the}} upperdeck. The forward and aft ends of the box were similarly armoured, although the front end also extended upwards by a further 5 ft. In addition, a waterline armoured belt extended for the whole length of the vessel. She and her two sisters were the only armoured gunboats ever built for the Royal Navy.

5000|$|Regardless of {{armoring}} scheme used, battleships {{still had}} crucial areas {{that could not}} be protected such as the <b>bow,</b> <b>rudder,</b> and propellers. Bismarck, Hiei, and Kirishima were all lost by rudder damage; the relatively large and [...] "soft" [...] unarmored bow structures Japanese superbattleships of Yamato and Musashi proved to be their Achilles' heel as flooding there rendered them unstable and unmaneuverable long before they were actually in danger of sinking. The superstructure housing command facilities, communications, and radar also remained vulnerable; for example, Hiei was rendered ineffective by a saturation bombardment of small projectiles which set her superstructure afire, Tirpitz suffered extensive topside damage in Operation Tungsten, and USS South Dakota was forced to withdraw from a night battle when relatively superficial damage to her superstructure knocked out her radars and disrupted her already-compromised electrical systems.|$|R
2500|$|Princess Norah {{was built}} in 1929 at [...] the Fairfields {{shipyard}} in Govan, Scotland. [...] The ship was designed for service to the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island. The ship was 250 feet long, with a beam of 48 feet and 23-foot depth of hold. [...] The overall size of the ship was 2,731 gross tons. The powerplant, which drove a single propeller, was a triple expansion steam engine, with cylinder diameters ranging from high pressure to low, of 24, 38 and double low pressure cylinders, of 45 inches diameter each. [...] Engine stroke was 36 inches. [...] Norah was built with a <b>bow</b> <b>rudder</b> to assist in navigating in the narrow winding channels of the British Columbia coast. [...] The ship had a capacity for 700 day passengers. [...] There were an additional 179 berths in 61 staterooms for overnight travellers. [...] The official Canadian registry number was 154848.|$|R
25|$|The Seattle Times {{devoted a}} series of 37 {{articles}} to Boeing 737 loss of control malfunctions. The accident occurred {{in the middle of}} a controversy over the NTSB's role in accidents caused by the <b>rudder</b> control <b>unit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after {{clearing}} {{the mouth of}} Loch Ryan, the ship turned west towards Larne and exposed her stern to {{the worst of the}} high seas. Huge waves damaged the low stern doors, allowing water to enter the car deck. The crew struggled to close the doors again but they proved to be too badly damaged and water continued to flood in from the waves. The scuppers {{did not seem to be}} allowing the water to drain away. The ship took a list to starboard and at this point Captain Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Loch Ryan by going astern and using the <b>bow</b> <b>rudder.</b> This proved to be impossible, because the extreme conditions prevented the deckhands from releasing the securing pin on the <b>bow</b> <b>rudder,</b> and the Captain then made a decision to try to reach Northern Ireland by adopting a course which would keep the stern of the craft sheltered from the worst of the elements. At 09:46 AM, two hours after leaving Stranraer a message was transmitted in Morse code (the Princess Victoria did not have a radio telephone) by radio operator David Broadfoot to the Portpatrick Radio Station: [...] "Hove-to off mouth of Loch Ryan. Vessel not under command. Urgent assistance of tugs required". With a list to starboard exacerbated by shifting cargo, water continued to enter the ship. At 10:32 AM an SOS transmission was made, and the order to abandon was given at 14:00.Possibly the first warship in the area was HMS Launceston Castle, commanded by Lt. Cdr J M Cowling, a frigate which was en route to Derry. Searches were carried out but Launceston Castle was forced to leave when her condensers were contaminated by salt.Upon the upgrade of the assistance message to an SOS, the Portpatrick Lifeboat the Jeannie Spiers was dispatched, as was the destroyer HMS Contest. Contest, commanded by Lt Commander HP Fleming, left Rothesay at 1109hrs but, although she came close to her position at 1330hrs, poor visibility prevented the crew from seeing the sinking ship. The destroyer had been trying to maintain a speed of 31 kn to reach the listing ferry but, after sustaining damage from the seas, Captain Fleming was forced to reduce speed to 16 kn.|$|R
50|$|It was a twin-engined high-wing {{monoplane}} of plastic-bonded plywood construction {{with some}} spruce and metal parts. It had fixed tricycle undercarriage, three vertical tail and <b>rudder</b> <b>units,</b> one central and two as tailplane endplates, {{reminiscent of the}} Miles Messenger. A large fin area was required by the deep-sided forward fuselage, and a pod and boom fuselage. Two pilots were seated beneath a large clear perspex canopy which formed the front dorsal part of the pod, four or five circular windows providing a view for passengers on either side. The Aerovan was capable of lifting a family car, loaded through clamshell rear doors. Designed in 1944, the prototype was built at Miles factory at Woodley, Berkshire and was first flown there by Tommy Rose on 26 January 1945.|$|R

5000|$|In 1943, as {{the design}} of the Spiteful was developing, Supermarine {{presented}} a brochure to the Air Ministry describing a [...] "High-Performance Aeroplane for the Royal Navy", also known as the Supermarine 391. This design was intended {{to be used as a}} carrier-borne fighter, with a secondary role as a strike aircraft, able to carry an 18-inch (45.7 cm) Mark XV aerial torpedo. Bombs or rockets could also be carried and the fixed armament was four Hispano Mk. V 20mm cannon. The 391 used the Spiteful/Seafang wing and undercarriage mated to a wide centre-section incorporating leading edge air intakes feeding the coolant radiators for a 3,550 hp, 24 cylinder 46-H-24 (later known as the [...] "Eagle"); this engine drove contra-rotating, four-bladed propellers. The fuselage was longer with a redesigned fin and <b>rudder</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Propulsion was by an inclined, three-cylinder {{steam engine}} below the main deck {{with only the}} main bearing tops, upper parts of the valves and {{handling}} levers above the main deck. The engine was unique in using a Walschaert gear, normally used on locomotives, to drive a Corliss gear for the two low-pressure cylinders and the poppet type valves on the high-pressure portion. The speed guarantee of 22 mph was met by the engine's indicated horsepower of [...] at 31 revolutions per minute. The high-pressure cylinder, 66 in in diameter, was centered between the two low-pressure cylinders of 96 in diameter with steam provided by six single ended and three double ended Scotch boilers forward of the engine room delivering steam at 165 pounds per square inch. The single ended boilers were 14 ft inside diameter by 10 ft length and the double ended boilers were 14 ft mean diameter by 20 ft length. The two 32 ft diameter paddle wheels each had eleven steel buckets 14 ft long by 5 ft wide. Due to the restricted channels at both Cleveland and Buffalo additional maneuvering capability was required and a <b>bow</b> <b>rudder</b> and steam steering engine were provided.|$|R

2500|$|On 28 June 1943, {{the first}} Tempest Mk.II, LA602, flew {{powered by a}} Centaurus IV (2,520hp/1,879kW) driving a four-blade propeller. LA602 {{initially}} flew with a Typhoon-type fin and <b>rudder</b> <b>unit.</b> This {{was followed by the}} second, LA607, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: LA607 was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four blade propeller was replaced with a five blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to [...] "tropicalise" [...] all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.|$|R
25|$|The NTSB was {{initially}} unable {{to resolve the}} cause of the crash, but after similar accidents and incidents involving Boeing 737 aircraft, the crash was determined to be caused by a defect {{in the design of the}} 737's <b>rudder</b> power control <b>unit</b> (PCU).|$|R
40|$|Many {{shipboard}} loads requiring high torques at {{very low}} speeds, like capstans, <b>bow</b> thrusters, <b>rudders,</b> stabilizing fins, etc., are presently driven by hydrostatic actuators. This paper presents an innovative inverter-fed electric linear motor prototype conceived to replace hydrostatic drives with large expected benefits in compactness, maintenance, efficiency and reliability. The linear motor prototype has been designed through special optimization algorithms based on finite element analysis to maximize the force density. The electromagnetic and mechanical structure has been also selected to achieve superior reliability by means of structural simplicity, robustness and redundancy. Along with design criteria, the paper outlines the prototype technology and the construction issues and provides some testing results collected during the experimental performance assessment...|$|R
50|$|Other {{necessary}} modifications, {{apart from}} those already described, were replacing the <b>rudders</b> with strengthened <b>units,</b> all {{main landing gear}} tires were replaced and the main gear leg structures reinforced. APQ-13 radar sets had to be fitted. Finally, long range fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bays.|$|R

50|$|In {{the ensuing}} Battle of Makassar Strait, Marblehead {{successfully}} maneuvered through three attacks. After the third, an enemy plane spiraled toward the cruiser, but her gunners splashed it. The next minute a fourth wave of seven bombers released bombs at Marblehead. Two were direct hits {{and a third}} a near miss close aboard the port bow causing severe underwater damage. Fires swept the ship as she listed to starboard and began to settle by the <b>bow.</b> Her <b>rudder</b> jammed, Marblehead, continuing to steam at full speed, circled to port. Her gunners kept firing, while damage control crews fought the fires and helped the wounded. By 1100, the fires were under control.

50|$|The M-5 was of {{a wooden}} construction, the hull was covered in plywood and the wings and {{tailplane}} were covered in fabric. Aft of the step the hull tapered sharply into {{little more than a}} boom, supporting a characteristic single fin and <b>rudder</b> tail <b>unit,</b> which was braced by means of struts and wires. It was normally powered by a 100 hp Gnome Monosoupape engine mounted as a pusher between the wings, but some used 110 hp Le Rhône or 130 hp Clerget engines. The pilot and the observer were accommodated side-by-side in a large cockpit forward of the wings, the observer provided with a single 7.62 mm Vickers machine gun on a pivoted mounting.|$|R
25|$|Starting in 1991, several {{accidents}} and incidents involving the Boeing 737 {{were the result of}} uncommanded movement of their rudders.
