5|$|A second expedition, {{under the}} praetor Publius Varinius, was then {{dispatched}} against Spartacus. For some reason, Varinius {{seems to have}} split his forces {{under the command of}} his subordinates Furius and Cossinius. Plutarch mentions that Furius commanded some 2,000 men, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> strength of the remaining forces, nor whether the expedition was composed of militia or legions, appears to be known. These forces were also defeated by the army of escaped slaves: Cossinius was killed, Varinius was nearly captured, and the equipment of the armies was seized by the slaves.|$|E
5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, six {{aircraft}} without engines were {{fitted with}} Mikulin AM-35A engines, while VVS officials evaluated both the Charomskiy ACh-30 and Charomskiy M-40 aircraft Diesel engines. At least nine Pe-8s were fitted with Diesel engines in 1941, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> ACh-30 nor the M-40 were entirely satisfactory, despite greatly increasing {{the range of}} the aircraft. All surviving Pe-8s were re-engined with AM-35As by the end of 1941. Production continued slowly at Factory No. 124; most of the factory's resources were devoted to the higher-priority Petlyakov Pe-2, a successful light bomber. At this time, most of these aircraft, re-designated as the Pe-8 after Petlyakov was killed in a Pe-2 crash on 12 January 1942, were built with out-of-production AM-35A engines.|$|E

In the weeks and months following the introduction of Generacion 2012, Hijo del Espanto (unclear if it was I or II) publicly stated that he and his brother were the rightful holders of the rights to the Espanto name, given to them by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II. Hijo del Espanto demanded that Espanto Jr. changed his name, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> wrestler nor CMLL ever responded to the request.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Emperor, John V Palaiologos visited Louis in Buda {{in early}} 1366, seeking his {{assistance}} against the Ottoman Turks , who had {{set foot in}} Europe. This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to plead for a foreign monarch's assistance. According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at {{his first meeting with}} Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and to take off his hat, which offended Louis. John V pledged that he would promote the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to send him help, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises. Pope Urban encouraged Louis not to send help to Constantinople before the emperor guaranteed the Church union.|$|E

5|$|In September 1523, Leo Jud, Zwingli's {{closest friend}} and {{colleague}} and pastor of St. Peterskirche, publicly called {{for the removal of}} statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and iconoclastic activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the mass and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Zurich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Zurich, the dioceses of Chur and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on 26 October 1523 and lasted two days.|$|E
5|$|Of necessity, the RAAF's two northerly area {{commands}} {{were primarily}} responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare. Aircraft from Eastern Area flew over 400 patrol, anti-submarine, and convoy escort missions in January 1943. By April, the command was operating seven combat units: No.5 Squadron, flying army cooperation missions with CAC Wirraways out of Kingaroy, Queensland; No.23 Squadron, flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from Lowood, Queensland; No.24 Squadron, flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from Bankstown, New South Wales; No.32 Squadron, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions with Lockheed Hudsons from Camden, New South Wales; No.71 Squadron, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with Avro Ansons from Lowood; No.73 Squadron, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with Ansons from Nowra, New South Wales; and No.83 Squadron, flying fighter missions with Wirraways from Strathpine, Queensland. Area headquarters staff numbered 626, including ninety-nine officers. Bristol Beauforts of No.32 Squadron were credited with damaging a Japanese submarine on 19June, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> RAAF nor the Royal Australian Navy was able to destroy any enemy submarines in coastal waters during 1943.|$|E
5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, <b>but</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, working within the existing framework.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{has been that}} clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind {{to the type of}} treatment).
