50|$|The name Mantua Creek {{is derived}} from the Native American word “Manta”, meaning frog, and was so named because of the {{remarkable}} chorus effect produced by abundant frogs in its watershed. Mantua Creek and its two major tributaries, Edwards Run and Chestnut <b>Branch,</b> <b>drain</b> over 50 sq mi of Gloucester County.|$|E
5000|$|From {{at least}} the 18th century a sluice was used to reserve a water supply from Lough Conway for the nearby Corn Mill {{situated}} on Kilclaremore townland. This corn mill was “”, so [...] the <b>branch</b> <b>drain</b> between “” and Lough Conway was improved. The corn mill closed in the 20th century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{analysis}} of {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the DC system insulation monitoring principle, a new DC system insulation monitoring device is put forward, which is a combination of balanced bridge and switching resistance. Bus voltage detection circuit and <b>branch</b> <b>drain</b> current acquisition module are designed to monitor the insulating state of bus and branch, respectively. The STM 32 microcontrollers are used as master MCU and acquisition MCU. In this way, a decentralized modular multi-core detection structure is established. Further, the hardware and software parts of the DC system insulation monitoring device are designed in detail. By testing the prototype in a variety of ground states, the accuracy of ground resistance measurement, branch positioning and fault alarm is verified...|$|E

40|$|Beaverdam Branch, the Nanticoke River, Sowbridge Branch, and Stockley <b>Branch</b> <b>drain</b> small basins in the Delaware Coastal Plain {{that are}} {{characterized}} by similar climate, topography, geology, and land use. Withdrawals of ground water and surface water are very small, there is little urbanization, and other man-made effects, which include minor regulation on Sowbridge Branch and construction of drainage ditches in the Nanticoke basin, probably have had minimal effect on the natural hydrologic regimen. These are virtually natural-flow streams, which, because of similar basin characteristics, have nearly identical rates of evapotranspiration and runoff. During the 10 -year period, 1959 - 68, precipitation averaged 40 - 42 inches annually, runoff averaged 16 - 17 inches annually, and evapotranspiration averaged 23 - 25 inches annually. U. S. Geological Surve...|$|E

50|$|The Fork River {{is a short}} {{river in}} the far south of the West Coast Region in New Zealand. As the name suggests, the river has two branches, with the longer South <b>branch</b> <b>draining</b> a plateau. The larger Spoon River lies a couple of {{kilometres}} to the north.|$|R
50|$|Flaxton is in {{the middle}} of what was once the Rangiora swamp. Plans for the {{drainage}} of this swamp (4000 acres) were prepared, and the first two miles of main drain were cut in about 1860. Two years later another two and a half miles were added, and also several <b>branch</b> <b>drains.</b> These drains have had the effect of drying the land, and lowering the level of the ground in places by as much as eight feet.|$|R
50|$|The Pillersee Valley is characterised, {{like its}} {{neighbouring}} valleys, by a concise valley-floor watershed near St. Jakob in Haus, {{where the two}} river valleys of the Pillerseetal meet:The northern valley <b>branch</b> <b>drains</b> through the Grieselbach, Pillersee and Loferbach (Haselbach) streams into the Saalach/Salzach, and is bounded by the Öfenschlucht gorge (the Teufelsklamm), part of the Strubtal valley of the Loferbach stream near Waidring.|$|R

50|$|The west <b>branch</b> <b>drains</b> spruce {{forests of}} the {{southern}} part of the Maine North Woods, and drops 1174 ft to Medway from sources along the Maine-Quebec border. Logging of the west branch began in 1828. Logs were loaded onto sleds towed to the river by draft animals. Log drives would float the logs downstream as far as Bangor, Maine when the snow and ice melted. Sawmill business on the west branch peaked in 1872.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Little Main Restigouche River" [...] {{originates}} from {{a mountain}} stream of Madawaska County, {{located at the}} South of a watershed line to which the Caribou Creek (tributary of the Gounamitz West <b>Branch</b> River) <b>drains</b> the North side and the Main Branch (a tributary of the Little Forks <b>Branch</b> Green river) <b>drains</b> the West side.|$|R
50|$|The Brisbane Drainage Act of 1875, {{under which}} the colonial {{government}} agreed to set aside crown land for sale to finance Brisbane's drainage scheme, provided the impetus for construction of Brisbane's early arterial stormwater drains. The systems were designed by the colonial government's Engineer for Harbours and Rivers, William David Nisbet, and carried out by government contractors under government supervision. Upon completion they became the property and responsibility of the Brisbane Municipal Council, which was responsible also for laying <b>branch</b> <b>drains.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Hinds River is a {{river in}} the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Its north and south <b>branches</b> <b>drain</b> the eastern flank of the Moorhouse Range, part of the Southern Alps, and their {{confluence}} is near Anama and Mayfield. The river then flows across the Canterbury Plains towards the Pacific Ocean, passing through {{the small town of}} Hinds along the way. In Hinds, State Highway 1 and the Main South Line railway cross the river. The river's mouth is located between the localities of Longbeach and Lowcliffe.|$|R
50|$|Piney <b>Branch</b> <b>drains</b> a {{watershed}} of about 0.48 mi2 m2 or 2,500 acres. Its surface stream drainage is augmented by four {{combined sewer systems}} that discharge into it. About 5 percent of the watershed consists of forested parkland near its surface stream. The rest of the area is mainly residential, with some light industrial zones. The creek is listed as polluted by 10 chemicals and four metals: lead, copper, zinc, and arsenic. It is spanned by the 16th Street Bridge, the country's first parabolic arch bridge.|$|R
2500|$|NY52 leaves Dairyland, {{crossing}} southeast through Wawarsing {{into the}} residential hamlet of Greenfield Park and past Windsor Lake, {{the source of}} the West Branch of the Beer Kill, which it follows to Ellenville. East of the lake, the route bends northeastward for two more miles, crossing through some dense woods between steep hillsides and paralleling Old Greenfield Road. Both roads soon bend northward, as the woods recede to more residences. As the West <b>Branch</b> <b>drains</b> into the main Beer Kill, just outside Ellenville, NY52 reaches a junction with CR53 (Briggs Street).|$|R
50|$|In {{the center}} of the western lobe is the long, broad ridge of Owl's Head (4025 ft/1227 m), which rises {{abruptly}} from the valley of Lincoln Brook and extends north for roughly 3 miles (4.8 km) to a low saddle connecting it to Garfield Ridge. Almost completely encircling Owl's Head are two tributaries of the East Branch, Lincoln Brook and Franconia Branch; Lincoln Brook drains the east face of Franconia Ridge, while Franconia <b>Branch</b> <b>drains</b> the southern and western faces of the Twin and Bond Ranges through Twin, Redrock, and Hellgate Brooks.|$|R
25|$|Monkey River is {{a coastal}} {{watercourse}} in southern Belize that {{rises in the}} Maya Mountains and discharges to the Caribbean Sea near Monkey River Town. One of Belize's major rivers, Monkey River has northern headwaters which originate in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, where the Swasey <b>Branch</b> <b>drains</b> the East Basin of that wildlife sanctuary. Further south, the Bladen <b>Branch</b> watercourse <b>drains</b> the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains including the ancient Mayan settlement areas of Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit. These two watercourses join to form the Monkey River approximately 16 kilometres upstream {{from the mouth of}} the Monkey River. The Monkey River is readily navigated throughout the year using small boats, but navigation above the major confluence (of Bladen and Swasey Branches) becomes more difficult due to lack of depth when the dry season starts about February. Habitats in this watershed provide cover for such diverse species as the ocelot, jaguar, Guatemalan black howler, bare-throated tiger heron, Morelet's crocodile, fer-de-lance and manatee.|$|R

50|$|The Middle Brook's {{western and}} eastern <b>{{branches}}</b> <b>drain</b> the Washington Valley {{between the first}} and second Watchung Mountain ridges in Bridgewater Township and the western part of Warren Township. The two branches unite in the Bound Brook Gap and the Middle Brook runs southward where it enters the Raritan in Bound Brook. The total drainage area is 17.2 sq mi.The Western Branch is followed by the Middle Brook Trail, a public hiking trail. In Washington Valley Park, the brook forms an artificial lake, the Washington Valley Reservoir. The smaller Eastern Branch is also dammed and then cascades over the Buttermilk Falls in Washington Valley Park.|$|R

50|$|Dependent on the geology of the area, {{the river}} {{systems of the}} Monkey River {{watershed}} {{can be divided into}} two different categories - those rivers that drain granite and Santa Rosa Group metasediments (tributaries of South Stann Creek, Swasey Branch and Trio), and those that drain the Bladen volcanic rock and surrounding limestone (Richardson Creek and other southern tributaries of Bladen Branch). The water of rivers draining the granite and metasediments is rich in phosphorus, though with low nitrogen levels, low conductivity and a basic pH. Conversely Bladen <b>Branch,</b> <b>draining</b> the volcanic rock and adjacent limestone, is low in phosphorus, but has a higher level of nitrogen, high conductivity, and a neutral pH.|$|R
