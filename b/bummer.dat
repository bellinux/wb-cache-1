5|$|A rumor {{started by}} the devoted Norton caricaturist Ed Jump claims he had two dogs, <b>Bummer</b> and Lazarus, which were also San Francisco celebrities. Though he did not own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch {{counters}} where he shared his meals with the dogs.|$|E
25|$|In 1861 <b>Bummer</b> rescued another dog from a {{fight with}} a larger canine opponent. The rescued dog was badly injured, with a deep wound on his leg, and was not {{expected}} to live. <b>Bummer</b> coaxed him to eat, brought back scraps from his scavenging missions and huddled next to him to keep him warm during the night. The injured dog quickly recovered and within days was following <b>Bummer</b> {{as he made his}} begging rounds in the streets. His remarkable recovery earned him the name Lazarus, and he proved to be an even more prodigious ratter than <b>Bummer.</b> As a team {{they turned out to be}} exceptional, once finishing off 85 rats in 20 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. <b>Bummer</b> was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When <b>Bummer</b> was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: <b>Bummer</b> was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when <b>Bummer</b> recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bummer</b> {{was also}} mounted by the {{taxidermist}} {{and placed on}} display. In 1906, both specimens were donated to the Golden Gate Park museum (now the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum) where they remained in storage until they were destroyed in 1910.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bummer</b> and Lazarus {{were two}} stray dogs that roamed {{the streets of}} San Francisco, California, United States, in the early 1860s. Recognized for their unique bond and their prodigious rat-killing ability, they became a fixture of city newspapers, were {{exempted}} from local ordinances, and immortalized in cartoons.|$|E

25|$|The {{two dogs}} had {{the run of}} the streets, and when, on June 14, 1862, Lazarus was taken by a new dog catcher, a mob of angry {{citizens}} demanded his release, petitioning to have the pair declared city property so they could wander the streets unmolested. The city supervisors released Lazarus and declared he and <b>Bummer</b> were exempt from the city ordinance against strays. A week later the two were reported to have stopped a runaway horse. Despite their reputations, the two could be vicious: <b>Bummer</b> was a sheep killer and regularly fought other dogs in the street, occasionally assisted by Lazarus (although normally Lazarus would restrict himself to barking encouragement). They also ransacked shops when they had entered unnoticed and had been locked in by the owners.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bummer</b> was a {{black-and-white}} Newfoundland or Newfoundland cross who established himself outside the saloon of Frederick Martin in 1860 and quickly {{proved to be}} an exceptional rat-killer. His ratting talent spared him the fate of the former owner of the territory, Bruno, who had been poisoned with strychnine shortly before Bummer's arrival. He scraped a living begging scraps from passers-by and the patrons of the saloon and other establishments along Montgomery Street.|$|E
500|$|The album {{garnered}} mixed reviews. [...] Billboard {{called the}} album [...] "artfully absurd third-generation rock" [...] {{and the group}} [...] "the first stars of future rock". [...] John Mendelsohn gave the album a favorable review in Rolling Stone, writing that it [...] "represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers." [...] However, referring to [...] "Black Juju" [...] {{he also said that}} [...] "the one <b>bummer</b> on this album is so loud a <b>bummer</b> that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect" [...] of the other tracks. [...] Robert Christgau rated it B−, stating that he [...] "never would have figured this theatre type to come up with it" [...] and calling [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] "as archetypal a hard rock single as you're liable to hear in this flaccid year, or maybe ever".|$|E

40|$|The 3 ̆e 1000 km 2, 95 - 88 Ma Sonora Pass {{intrusive}} suite is {{the oldest}} and most northern of the four voluminous, normally-zoned Late Cretaceous suites of the Sierra Nevada batholith. It consists of the older, marginal, equigranular Kinney Lakes hornblende-biotite granodiorite and the inner, porphyritic to megacrystic Topaz Lake biotite granodiorite. The suite intruded the 109 Ma <b>Bummers</b> Flat biotite granodiorite, Jurassic diorites, and Pre-Cambrian to Cambrian metasedimentary rocks of the Snow Lake pendant. The Topaz Lake granodiorite records evidence of the development of a sizable magma chamber. The <b>Bummers</b> Flat and Kinney Lakes granodiorites were likely constructed by many increments, were capable of flow and disaggregation of host and co-magmatic mafic rocks, are marked by widespread schlieren, and may have not formed a single magma chamber. Accommodation of magmas was facilitated by multiple material transfer processes; stoping was the best documented process, followed by minor ductile flow and magmatic wedging of the Kinney Lakes granodiorite. There is no direct evidence for transfer processes during emplacement of the Topaz Lake granodiorite. Magmatic foliation within the study area records regional tectonic strain and complex internal magmatic processes. Solid-state structures including steep ductile shear zones, foliations, and lineations occur within the <b>Bummers</b> Flat granodiorite. One of these structures, the Toe Jam Lake shear zone, may extend for 10 s of km, likely formed during ENE-WSW shortening, and probably predated the Sonora Pass intrusive suite...|$|R

500|$|Several reviewers {{praised the}} film for being more subdued {{than most of}} Sci-Fi's gore-filled {{creature}} films and for its use of a live tiger rather than poor CGI effects. However, David Johnson of DVD Verdict, heavily criticized the film for [...] "its significant dearth of righteous tiger-attack action". He found the implied violence resulted in a boring film that will not satisfy more horror film buff: [...] "the gore-hounds that might be attracted to {{the promise of a}} big-ass tiger sinking his teeth into some hapless rednecks will be almost certainly disappointed. The big <b>bummer</b> is that we don't even get any tiger on human direct action until the very end, and that's boilerplate Lassie stuff with a stuntman fending off a laid-back stunt tiger". Conversely, unlike other reviewers, he praised the characters, feeling they were interesting and ended up being ones he [...] "somewhat cared about." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Your Body" [...] is a midtempo dance, electropop and R number, with dubstep and Eurodance influences.

According to Gregory Hicks from The Michigan Daily, [...] "Your Body" [...] is musically {{similar to}} Jessie J's 2011 song [...] "Abracadabra". Chris Martins from Spin {{commented that the}} song [...] "has a mellow thrust that hits muted transcendence for the chorus before dipping back down into that <b>bummer</b> bump". The chorus and the bridge features Aguilera's [...] "powerful" [...] vocals, provided by heavy synthesizers over a [...] "booming" [...] Eurodance beat. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Melissa Maerz noted that Aguilera's vocals are provided by too much synthesizers. Gregory Hicks of The Michigan Daily compared her [...] "synthesized" [...] voice on the song to those in Maroon 5's [...] "One More Night", which was also produced by Martin.|$|E
500|$|USA Todays Claudia Puig {{rated the}} short three stars out of four, and {{described}} the new song ("Making Today a Perfect Day") as [...] "pleasant".

[...] Writing for BBC, Natalie Jamieson called the new song [...] "catchy and fun". Dan Kois of the Slate called the film [...] "a real <b>bummer,</b> the first recent misfire from Disney's shorts program, and thus the first serious misfire from the Lasseter-led Disney." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin praised the song [...] "Making Today a Perfect Day", stating that [...] "it's a lip-smacking confection, dusted with pure icing sugar, and suggests that songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are capable of coming up with something special for the forthcoming feature-length Frozen sequel." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bummers</b> was a {{nickname}} applied to foragers of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's Union army during its March to the Sea and north through South Carolina and North Carolina during the American Civil War. The designation [...] "bummers" [...] was used, both by soldiers and civilians, to describe Sherman's soldiers, official and unofficial, who requisitioned food from Southern homes {{along the route}} of the Army's march. Often highly destructive in nature, <b>bummers</b> became notorious among Southerners for looting and vandalism, and they did much to shatter the illusion that the Confederate Army was successfully defending its territory on all fronts. The bummers' activities in Georgia and the Carolinas helped ensure that the South would be unable to sustain its war effort; additionally, bummers' destruction of industrial property rendered the garrisoning of southern cities largely unnecessary by destroying most, if not all, of those facilities in their path that replenished the Confederate war effort (such as cotton gins, farms, foundries, lumber mills, etc.).|$|R

500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — I mean, {{you know who}} Rihanna is, but would you recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a <b>bummer</b> that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E

He died a lingering death in November 1865 after being kicked by a drunk, Henry Rippey. <b>Bummer</b> was still popular enough that, to avoid violence, the city immediately arrested Rippey.

500|$|Sherman's advance through Georgia and South Carolina was {{characterized}} by widespread destruction of civilian supplies and infrastructure. Although looting was officially forbidden, historians disagree on how well this regulation was enforced. Union soldiers who foraged from Southern homes became known as <b>bummers.</b> The speed and efficiency of the destruction by Sherman's army was remarkable. The practice of heating rails and bending them around trees, leaving behind {{what came to be}} known as [...] "Sherman's neckties," [...] made repairs difficult.

The remainder of the song tells of many unrelated events, with the refrain of [...] "Blinded by the light, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night".|$|R

[...] The road leads away from his ensnaring family: [...] "Mama don't understand it/She wants to know where I've been/I'd {{have to be some}} kind of natural-born fool to want to pass that way again."
