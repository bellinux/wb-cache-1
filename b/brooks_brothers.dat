5000|$|The film {{predominantly}} comprises musical numbers, including {{performances by}} the principal actors Helen Shapiro and Craig Douglas themselves.

500|$|Through the years, she {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do you want me to go to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano.

5000|$|The <b>Brook</b> <b>Brothers</b> {{started out}} as a skiffle group in 1956 but, after winning a {{television}} talent show, changed their look and sound to approximate the style of The Everly Brothers. They signed to Top Rank Records in 1960 and released a cover of the song [...] "Greenfields" [...] by The Brothers Four the same year. The tune was a hit in Italy but attracted little notice in their home country. After a few more singles were released, they switched to Pye Records, and their second release for them, [...] "Warpaint" [...] (written by Howard Greenfield and Barry Mann), became a UK Top 5 hit. This song was also recorded by Bill Haley, among others.|$|R
500|$|The book explores {{a tension}} between {{originality}} and monoculture {{by focusing on the}} artist's relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products. Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's [...] "loyalty and love" [...] involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, [...] "simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of <b>Brooks</b> <b>Brothers,</b> who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul." ...|$|E
