40|$|The {{simulation}} {{of the process}} of finishing fixed plug pipe drawing and expansion of pipe in the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> cold-rolled steel pipes for steam generators for nuclear reactor fuel cladding. A comparative analysis of the accuracy of pipe sizes obtained in the production and in the simulation. Differences in values of the diameters and wall thicknesses are obtained within the limits according to the TU 14 - 159 - 293 - 2005, indicating the correctness of the mathematical model. Distributions of residual stresses {{on the wall of the}} pipe for the case of fixed plug pipe drawing and expansion of pipe in the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel.</b> The expediency of using expansion of pipe in the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> in the final stage of production of pipes from corrosion-resistant stainless steel...|$|R

40|$|The {{electroforming}} {{technique for}} producing X-ray mirrors is described, and results of X-ray tests performed on copies {{made from a}} simple <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> are reported. The design of the mandrel is depicted and the total reflectivity {{as well as the}} full-wave half modulation resolution are shown as a function of energy. The reported work has improved on previous studies by providing smaller grazing angles, making measurements at higher energies, producing about four times as many replicas from one mandrel, and obtaining better angular resolution...|$|R
40|$|Native semi-lunar {{heart valves}} are {{composed}} of a dense fibrous network that generally follows a curvilinear path along {{the width of the}} leaflet. Recent models of engineered valve leaflets have predicted that such curvilinear fiber orientations would homogenize the strain field and reduce stress concentrations at the commissure. In the present work, a method was developed to reproduce this curvilinear fiber alignment in electrospun scaffolds by varying the geometry of the collecting mandrel. Elastomeric poly(ester urethane) urea was electrospun onto rotating <b>conical</b> <b>mandrels</b> of varying angles to produce fibrous scaffolds where the angle of fiber alignment varied linearly over scaffold length. By matching the radius of the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> to the radius of curvature for the native pulmonary valve, the electrospun constructs exhibited a curvilinear fiber structure similar to the native leaflet. Moreover, the constructs had local mechanical properties comparable to conventional scaffolds and native heart valves. In agreement with prior modeling results, it was found under quasi-static loading that curvilinear fiber microstructures reduced strain concentrations compared to scaffolds generated on a conventional cylindrical mandrels. Thus, this simple technique offers an attractive means for fabricating scaffolds where key microstructural features of the native leaflet are imitated for heart valve tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this study}} powder coated samples were {{compared}} with liquid paint samples. These samples are used for high heat resistance coatings on mufflers used by automobile industry. The samples were prepared by silicone resins. Different physical mechanical tests were carried out to compare powder and liquid based samples. After performing the tests HR 600 sample has the highest adhesion strength, thickness, scratch and pencil hardness and HR 400 sample is followed by it among the remaining samples. The study shows that all the samples were free from blistering and peeling off after performing <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> and impact test...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCold {{tube drawing}} is a metal forming process which enables to produce tubes with high {{dimensional}} precision. It consists in reducing tube dimensions by pulling {{it through a}} die. Tube outer diameter is calibrated by a die and the tube inner diameter and thickness are calibrated by a mandrel. One of the major concern of metal forming industry is the constant improvement of productivity and product quality. In the aim of pushing the process to the limit {{the question is how}} far the material can be processed without occurrence of failure. In the present study, a long <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> with a small cone angle was designed in order to carry out drawing tests up to fracture with experimental conditions very close to the industrial process. The FEM of the process was built in order to access the local stress and strain data. A specific emphasis was put on the friction characterisation. For that purpose force measurement during the <b>conical</b> <b>mandrel</b> experiments enabled to characterise a pressure dependent friction coefficient constitutive law by means of an inverse analysis. Finally, eleven failure criteria were selected to study the drawability of cobalt-chromium alloy tubes. The assessment of failure criteria based on damage variables or damage accumulation variables involved their calibration on uniaxial tensile tests. The experimental studies were completed by SEM fractography which enabled to understand the fracture locus and the propagation direction of the fracture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{expansion}} ratio on the corrosion rate of the expanded tubes exposed to sea water {{as well as the}} microstructure changes caused by the expansion of Cr-Mo steel tubes to large permanent deformations. 2. 25 Cr- 1. 0 Mo steel (schedule 40 and schedule 80) tubes were subjected to various expansion ratios of 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % by pushing <b>conical</b> <b>mandrels</b> through them using a piston. The microstructure was also studied to determine {{the effect of}} the expansion on the grain structure of the material. Microscopic examination of the expanded tubes revealed that grains elongate along the direction of the hoop stress and this elongation increases with an increase of expansion ratio. Moreover, it was found that corrosion rate and hardness increase with an increase in expansion ratio...|$|R
