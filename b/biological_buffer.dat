The morphologies and compositions of surface layers formed during in vitro degradation tests for 15 – 3600 s were characterized. The effect of HEPES on the electrochemical behavior and corrosion tendency was determined by performing electrochemical tests. HEPES indeed retained the local pH, leading to intense intergranular/interparticle corrosion of magnesium made from powder and an increased degradation rate. This was attributed to an interconnected network of cracks formed at the original powder particle boundaries and grain boundaries in the surface layer, which provided pathways for the corrosive medium to interact continuously with the internal surfaces and promoted further dissolution.

Several of these compounds have pK a values that would indicate potential utility for buffering at pH levels below the normal physiological range (pK a values in the range of 3 to 6 without aqueous solubility problems) – a range that is problematic for currently available Good buffers. Unfortunately, the alkylaminomethanesulfonates were found to degrade (with loss of their buffering ability) at pH levels below the pK a value and were unstable at elevated temperature (as when autoclaving) – thus limiting their utility...|$|R
40|$|Uniformly sized superparamagnetic {{iron oxide}} {{nanoparticles}} (SPIONs) with inorganic diameters of 3 - 35 nm were synthesized. New surface ligand coatings were designed and synthesized, {{and the resulting}} hydrophilic SPIONs in <b>biological</b> <b>buffers</b> {{were found to be}} compact, stable, highly magnetic, and biocompatible. Furthermore, the hydrophilic SPIONs were stable in vitro in serums and cells as well as in vivo in mice. Functionalized SPIONs demonstrated the ability of specific labeling. Finally, the hydrophilic SPIONs have potential as a non-toxic alternative to Gadolinium based contrast agents for T₁-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and they have shown potential in multicolor MRI as well as magnetic particle imaging. by He Wei.

30|$|The {{demand for}} biologically {{compatible}} and stable noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) {{has increased in}} recent years due to their inert nature and unique optical properties. In this article, we present 11 different synthetic methods for obtaining gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) {{through the use of}} common <b>biological</b> <b>buffers.</b> The results demonstrate that the sizes, shapes, and monodispersity of the NPs could be varied {{depending on the type of}} buffer used, as these buffers acted as both a reducing agent and a stabilizer in each synthesis. Theoretical simulations and electrochemical experiments were performed to understand the buffer-dependent variations of size and morphology exhibited by these Au NPs, which revealed that surface interactions and the electrostatic energy on the (111) surface of Au were the determining factors. The long-term stability of the synthesized NPs in buffer solution was also investigated. Most NPs synthesized using buffers showed a uniquely wide range of pH stability and excellent cell viability without the need for further modifications.|$|R
