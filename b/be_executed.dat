The operation was initially planned to <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, {{but the lack of}} available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to <b>be</b> <b>executed</b> in August.|$|E
