5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed <b>by</b> <b>without</b> any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising violence between West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several years went <b>by</b> <b>without</b> a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties {{dating back to}} Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
5|$|The skyway was a {{constraint}} in {{the building}} of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge <b>by</b> , <b>without</b> shutting it to traffic.|$|E

5|$|Months went <b>by</b> <b>without</b> any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a {{stint in}} rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E

25|$|When {{the commanders}} had fled the scene, Scottish mercenaries {{overwhelmed}} the German artillery, seized {{the guns and}} took aim at the German cavalry. The German cavalry charged, hit by Scottish artillery fire on their way, and cut down the Scots. The result was 30 dead Germans and 1,500 dead Scots. The German and Swedish infantry stood <b>by</b> <b>without</b> taking action, neither did the Scottish cavalry intervene. Several Scottish officers were among the dead, including David Murray, Jacob Murray and George Michell.

25|$|It {{was first}} {{produced}} on the West Coast in 1981 by South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, California. The play's first international production was by London's Young Vic in 1981, with pop star David Essex {{in the title}} role and Simon Gipps-Kent as the young Byron. The Penguin Repertory Theater of Rockland County NY presented a well-reviewed revival in 1987.Scarcely a year goes <b>by</b> <b>without</b> a revival by a regional American theater or a university. Philadelphia's Wilma Theater produced the drama in 1986; Baylor University presented its version in 2003; a revival by the Players Club in Swarthmore was in 2005, while Drake University offered it in 2013, over thirty-five years following its premiere.|$|E

25|$|The first counter-protest {{was held}} on 23 June, in the {{vicinity}} of the National Palace of Culture. Counter-protests were said to be paid(see protests and counter protests in Ukraine – Euromaidan), a practice that had started earlier with the paid protesters of extreme right-wing party Ataka, which was documented by National Television of Bulgaria. The practice of paid counter protesting started almost as soon as the large protests against Oresharski occurred (early August 2013) and had its peak with the massive counter-protest that was organized by the BSP and DPS with priorly scheduled trains for the paid protesters on 16 November in Sofia and even against Plevneliev who showed democratic sympathies and as seen by some on the side of the anti-Oresharski protesters, with the number of participants estimated as close to 50,000 by the Bulgarian Ministry of Internal Affairs. During the 16 November counter-protest, there were some concerns mainly expressed by pro-protest activists that the government sympathizers (especially those from the MRF, many of whom have Turkish heritage) could come into close proximity with the Levski Sofia and CSKA Sofia football fans who were expected to attend The Eternal Derby (first leg of a Round 2 Bulgarian Cup match), which could spark a confrontation, but the day passed <b>by</b> <b>without</b> any serious incidents. The amicable hug between Lyutvi Mestan and Sergei Stanishev at Eagle's Bridge came to be widely interpreted as a symbolic gesture of forgiveness on the part of MRF, bearing in mind the BSP predecessor party's role in the orchestration of the Process of Rebirth in the 1980s. For this and other reasons, former vice-chairman of the MRF and Ahmed Dogan right-hand man Osman Oktay has been highly critical of the nature of the BSP-MRF relationship dynamics.|$|E
25|$|In 1970-71, the Combined Islands {{registered}} {{their first}} win in five years, but still finished last behind Guyana - despite beating Guyana by 50 runs, the team lost their other three matches, and Guyana finished two points ahead. The 1971-72 season went <b>by</b> <b>without</b> a single win, although they gained a lead on first innings, but in 1972-73 the Combined Islands beat Jamaica to finish fourth after Elquemedo Willett took six for 40 {{in the second}} innings - which stood as a team record for two seasons - to help bowl Jamaica out for 132. By this time, {{most of the players}} that were to become team regulars for the remainder of its history had debuted - in addition to the Shillingford cousins, there was Vance Amory, Jim Allen, Mike Findlay, Norbert Philip, Viv Richards (who went on to play 121 Tests for the West Indies), Andy Roberts, Lockhart Sebastien and the aforementioned Willett, who all played for the Combined Islands until 1978, and four of them until the end in 1981. However, the team still failed to win more than one match a season. In 1973-74 they lost three of the four games and finished last again, despite Roberts and Philip both taking more than three wickets a match at a bowling average less than 20. That season also included their only List A game, a five-run win over the touring England side representing MCC. The Islands batted first, making 204 for 6 in 50 overs with 102 from Jim Allen and 78 from Livingstone Sargeant. Dennis Amiss made 114 for the tourists, but Grayson Shillingford (six overs for 7) and Andy Roberts (ten overs for 27) limited the scoring. Three wickets fell for 12 near the end, and the MCC finished on 199 for 6.|$|E

500|$|Political {{literature}} became Johnson's mainstay in the 1790s: {{he published}} 118 works, which amounted to 57% of his total political output. As Chard notes, [...] "hardly a year went <b>by</b> <b>without</b> {{at least one}} anti-war and one anti-slave trade publication from Johnson". In particular, Johnson published abolitionist works, such as minister and former slave-ship captain John Newton's Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade (1788), Barbauld's Epistle to William Wilberforce (1791), and Captain John Gabriel Stedman's Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) (with illustrations by Blake).
