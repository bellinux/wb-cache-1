40|$|SUMMARY: Four morphologically {{different}} types of the bifid bacteria can be distinguished, and a classification of these bacteria on morphological basis agrees rather well with earlier groupings based on biochemical and serological character-istics. Morphological features may thus have a taxonomic value as regards the bifid bacteria. A cornpaxison of the morphological characteristics of the bifid bacteria with those of representatives of the genera Co ynebactm'um, Actinomyces, Propioni-bacterium, Butydmter ium and Lactobacillus revealed that {{three out of four}} mor-phological subtypes showed closest resemblance to the genus Butyribacterium, whereas the fourth subtype (the one referred to in the literature as Lactobacillus biww var. pmmylvanicus) may be related to Actinomyces. Thus, the designation Lactobacillus biwus for these bifid bacteria seems clearly wrong. The taxonomic relationships of the Gram-positive, anaerobic, asporogenous bacteria of intestinal origin, which are {{often referred to as the}} bifid bacteria, seem not to have been clearly defined. Most current schemes of <b>bacterial</b> <b>taxonomy</b> <b>include</b> these organisms in the genus Lactobacillus (viz.

40|$|The {{number of}} species of Bacteria and Archaea (ca 5000) is {{surprisingly}} small considering their early evolution, genetic diversity and residence in all ecosystems. The bacterial species definition accounts in part for {{the small number of}} named species. The primary procedures required to identify new species of Bacteria and Archaea are DNA–DNA hybridization and phenotypic characterization. Recently, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have been applied to <b>bacterial</b> <b>taxonomy.</b> Although 16 S phylogeny is arguably excellent for classification of Bacteria and Archaea from the Domain level down to the family or genus, it lacks resolution below that level. Newer approaches, including multilocus sequence analysis, and genome sequence and microarray analyses, promise to provide necessary information to better understand bacterial speciation. Indeed, recent data using these approaches, while meagre, support the view that speciation processes may occur at the subspecies level within ecological niches (ecovars) and owing to biogeography (geovars). A major dilemma for bacterial taxonomists is how to incorporate this new information into the present hierarchical system for classification of Bacteria and Archaea without causing undesirable confusion and contention. This author proposes the genomic–phylogenetic species concept (GPSC) for the taxonomy of prokaryotes. The aim is twofold. First, the GPSC would provide a conceptual and testable framework for <b>bacterial</b> <b>taxonomy.</b> Second, the GPSC would replace the burdensome requirement for DNA hybridization presently needed to describe new species. Furthermore, the GPSC is consistent with the present treatment at higher taxonomic levels...|$|R
40|$|Classifications {{cannot be}} final, {{and the same}} group of organisms may be sorted and {{arranged}} in many different ways. The species is man-made, and since it cannot be defined the creation of taxa of higher categories based on species makes an absurd situation. The type method (a nomenclatural device) is inapplicable to bacteriology, and more use should be made of the population concept. Bacteriological nomenclature is full of absurdities, many derived from the Botanical Code. In particular, the principles of priority and the retroactive applica-tion of new rules are criticized, especially when they are applied to the names of well-established taxa. Two new principles of heretical <b>taxonomy</b> are described. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>taxonomy</b> Taxonomy is written by taxonomists for taxonomists; in this form the subject is so dull that few, if any, non-taxonomists are tempted to read it, and presumably even fewer try their hand at it.
