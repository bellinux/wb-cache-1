5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the <b>broaching</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>broaching</b> <b>machine</b> elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|Slot broaches (G & H) are {{for cutting}} slots of various {{dimensions}} at high production rates.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach.

500|$|<b>Broaching</b> <b>machines</b> are {{relatively}} simple as {{they only have}} to move the broach in a linear motion at a predetermined speed and provide a means for handling the <b>broach</b> automatically.

The choice of machine is primarily dictated by the stroke required. Vertical <b>broaching</b> <b>machines</b> rarely have a stroke longer than [...]|$|R
5|$|Horizontal {{machines}} {{used to be}} {{much more}} common than vertical machines; however, today they represent just 10% of all <b>broaching</b> <b>machines</b> purchased. Vertical machines are more popular because they take up less space.|$|R
5|$|Horizontal <b>broaching</b> <b>machines</b> are {{designed}} for pull broaching, surface broaching, continuous broaching, and rotary <b>broaching.</b> Pull style <b>machines</b> are basically vertical machines laid on the side with a longer stroke.

5|$|Vertical {{broaching}} machines {{can be designed}} for push broaching, pull-down broaching, pull-up broaching, or surface broaching.

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a <b>broaching</b> <b>machine,</b> which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
25|$|The {{method by}} which Glock barrels are rifled is {{somewhat}} unusual; instead of using a traditional <b>broaching</b> <b>machine</b> to cut the rifling into the bore, the Glock process involves beating a slowly rotating mandrel through the bore to obtain the hexagonal or octagonal shape. As a result, the barrel's thickness {{in the area of}} each groove is not compromised as with conventional square-cut barrels. This has the advantage of providing a better gas seal behind the projectile as the bore has a slightly smaller diameter, which translates into more efficient use of the combustion gases trapped behind the bullet, slightly greater (consistency in) muzzle velocities, and increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{broaching}} {{can be traced}} back to the early 1850s, with the first applications used for cutting keyways in pulleys and gears. After World War I, broaching was used to rifle gun barrels. In the 1920s and 30s the tolerances were tightened and the cost reduced thanks to advances in form grinding and <b>broaching</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive <b>broach,</b> which completely <b>machines</b> the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the <b>broach</b> <b>machines</b> outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|R

50|$|Samuel Bentham {{developed}} a shaper between 1791 and 1793. However, Roe (1916) credits James Nasmyth with {{the invention of}} the shaper in 1836. Shapers were very common in industrial production from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th. In current industrial practice, shapers have been largely superseded by other machine tools (especially of the CNC type), including milling machines, grinding <b>machines,</b> and <b>broaching</b> <b>machines.</b> But the basic function of a shaper is still sound; tooling for them is minimal and very cheap to reproduce; and they are simple and robust in construction, making their repair and upkeep easily achievable. Thus they are still popular in many machine shops, from jobbing shops or repair shops to tool and die shops, where only one or a few pieces are required to be produced and the alternative methods are cost- or tooling-intensive. They also have considerable retro appeal to many hobbyist machinists, who are happy to obtain a used shaper or, in some cases, even to build a new one from scratch.|$|R
5000|$|Planers and shapers are now , {{because other}} machine tools (such as milling <b>machines,</b> <b>broaching</b> <b>machines,</b> and {{grinding}} machines) have mostly eclipsed them as the tools of choice for doing such work. However, {{they have not yet}} disappeared from the metalworking world. Planers are used by smaller tool and die shops within larger production facilities to maintain and repair large stamping dies and plastic injection molds. Additional uses include any other task where an abnormally large (usually in the range of 4'×8' or more) block of metal must be squared when a (quite massive) horizontal grinder or floor mill is unavailable, too expensive, or otherwise impractical in a given situation. As usual in the selection of machine tools, an old machine that is in hand, still works, and is long since paid-for has substantial cost advantage over a newer machine that would need to be purchased. This principle easily explains why [...] "old-fashioned" [...] techniques often have a long period of gradual obsolescence in industrial contexts, rather than a sharp drop-off of prevalence such as is seen in mass-consumer technology fashions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrecise force {{measurements}} {{are often used}} {{for the development of}} machining processes. A key measure thereby is the specific cutting force, which comprises several factors such as cutting and work piece material as well as the cutting edge geometry. Therefore, it is vital for cutting tests to be as close to the real application as possible in order to guarantee a good alignment and transferability of the results. In many cutting tests carried out in a laboratory environment this cannot sufficiently be ensured. This paper presents two specific processes being applied in aeronautic industry for which force measurement systems were specially developed to satisfy the mentioned requirements. On the one hand, a 4 -Component-High-Speed Rotating-Cutting-Force-Dynometer is employed for machining Aluminium parts on a machining center.
