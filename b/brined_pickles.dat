40|$|Salted fish (salt fish) {{are treated}} by <b>brining,</b> dry-salting, <b>pickle</b> curing or a {{combination}} of these treatments, increasing the amount of salt in the fish substantially beyond that ordinarily found in the fresh product. Brining is the process of placing fish in a solution of salt (sodium chloride) in water for a period of sufficient length for the fish tissue to absorb the required amount of salt. Dry-salting is the process of mixing fish with dry salt and allowing the resultant brine (from dissolution of the salt in the water present in the fish) to drain away. Pickling or pickle curing is the process whereby fish is mixed with salt and is stored under the <b>brine</b> (<b>pickle)</b> which is formed when the salt dissolves in the water extracted from the fish tissue. Pro cesses for the preparation of salted fish have been reviewed by the FAO/WHO Codex AIimentarius Commission (1983). The following general description is taken from that review, unless otherwse noted. Salt acts upon fish as upon other foods by withdrawing water from the tissue. Fish f 1 esh contains 75 - 80 % water On the case of very fatty fish, 60 - 65 %), and this water can be replaced partIy by salt ln the preparation of salted fish, water diffsing from the fish becomes saturated with the surrounding salt and is termed 'pickle'...|$|R

Fresh egg controls and <b>brine</b> <b>pickled</b> eggs were evaluated for flavor, texture and color by a panel consisting of about equal numbers of American and Thai ethnic origin. Albumen quality, microbial growth and pH were determined. American panel members preferred flavor, texture and color of control eggs and rejected or disliked flavor, texture and color of salt brined eggs. Thai panel members preferred flavor, texture and color of all salt brined eggs, especially those held in brine for four weeks at 21 ° C. Halophilic bacteria were enumerated in eggs after four weeks in salt brine, followed by four weeks at 3 ° C. out of brine. No halophilic organisms were detected in control eggs. Counts in uncooked eggs were lower than in those eggs cooked before brine immersion. After four weeks out of brine, counts in raw eggs reached 6. 0 x 103, whereas those cooked before brine treatment reached 1. 7 x 105...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{injection}} and brining as {{the first}} step in heavy salting of cod increases weight yields of the products through both salting and rehydration, compared to other pre-salting methods, like <b>brining</b> only and <b>pickling.</b> This is interesting since salt content of the muscle exceeds 20 % NaCl, in all procedures. Therefore, the dissimilarities in yield were presumed to depend on the degree of protein denaturation and aggregation as influenced by the different salting procedures. This hypothesis was studied and confirmed with the aid of SDS-PAGE and DSC-analysis. Higher water retention of injected products was explained by stronger salting-in effects on proteins during pre-salting, reducing aggregation of muscle proteins during the dry salting step. The degree of protein aggregation during salting increased in the following order with regard to the different pre-salting methods: injection and brining < <b>brining</b> < <b>pickling.</b> These effects were still observed after rehydration. Furthermore, differences in denaturation/aggregation were assigned to both myosin and collagen. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of heavy-salted cod (Bacalao) {{has changed from}} being a single-step process (kench) salting to a multistep procedure varying between producers and countries. Presalting by injection, <b>brining,</b> or <b>pickling</b> is increasingly applied prior to pile (dry) salting. This article describes the effects of different presalting methods (injection and brining, <b>brining</b> only, and <b>pickling)</b> on yield and chemical composition of salted cod fillets, in comparison to a single-kench salting step. The procedures used influenced the weight yields and chemical composition of the products. Injection was significantly different from other methods in increasing weight yields throughout brining, dry salting, and rehydration. The yield of nitrogenous compounds tended to be lower for injected and brine-salted fillets, mainly due to higher losses of nonprotein nitrogen. Practical Application Salting procedures for cod have changed rapidly in recent years. Injection is increasingly used as a presalting method.

40|$|The {{production}} of heavy salted cod (bacalao) {{has changed from}} being a single-step process salting to a multistep procedure. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain a deeper understanding of water retention and yields of heavy salted cod as influenced by salting procedures. The effects of different pre-salting methods (injection and brining, <b>brining</b> only, and <b>pickling)</b> were compared to a single kench salting step. The products were evaluated at different stages of the process: after pre-salting, dry salting, storage and rehydration, with regard to changes in yields, chemical content and salt-induced changes in muscle proteins and microstructure. Injection was significantly different from other methods in increasing weight yields through brining, dry salting and rehydration. Salt concentrations of the brine did not influence the weight yields of dry-salted and rehydrated products. However, salt concentrations > 20 % had negative effects on the colour and commercial quality of the salted products. Addition of phosphates increased weight yield of salted but not of rehydrated products. Effects on quality varied between trials; both negative and positive effects were observed. Strong salting-out effects on proteins were seen due to high salt contents in the salted products regardless of the procedures applied. The effects of salting procedures on yields and quality of heavy salted cod products were related to the pathway of solubilisation, denaturation and aggregation of proteins in the muscle. Myosin was less aggregated when injection was applied during pre-salting. A greater degree of protein aggregation correlated with higher initial salt concentrations and dehydration during the first days of salting, which was obtained with <b>brining,</b> <b>pickling</b> and kench salting. In addition, these methods resulted in stronger enzymatic degradation of proteins, shown as an increase in lower molecular weight subunits. The connective tissue in the muscle was believed to play an important role in water retention of the muscle. Microstructural analysis of the dry-salted fillets showed that the intercellular spaces in injected and brined fillets were increased compared to only brining. However, the cross-sectional area of the fish fibres was similar in both groups. Based on this, the main reason for higher weight yields of injected products after salting and rehydration were believed to result from irreversible effects on the connective tissue in the muscle and better retention of myosin structure, thereby better water-holding. The drawback of the wet-salting methods (brining and injection) was that the yield of nitrogenous compounds was lower for injected and brine-salted fillets. However, the main changes were due to higher losses of non-protein nitrogen, which is more likely to influence the organoleptic properties of the products than the weight yields...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and characteristics of}} water in the muscle of various commercially available Icelandic heavily salted Atlantic cod products were analyzed with proton magnetic resonance methods. The products varied in choice of catching method, in pre- or post-rigor processing, flattening or filleting cut, and pre-salting technique (brine injection with salt with/without polyphosphates, <b>brining</b> and <b>pickling)</b> and choice of brine-injection instruments. All products had heterogeneous water distributions, but the level of heterogeneity was dependent on the handling during processing. Brine injection led to salt-induced swelling, which effect remained after the kench dry salting step. Double brine injection induced needle traces in the muscle, even after kench salting. Relaxation time analysis indicated that pickle salted products had the highest degree of protein denaturation in the muscle amongst the analyzed pre-salting methods.
