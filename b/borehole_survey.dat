The distribution of rock types and sedimentary facies contributed to the reconstruction of three periods' sedimentary facies maps of the Middle Jurassic in the Saishiteng coalfield, namely, the Dameigou age, the early Shimengou age and the late Shimengou age.

The analysis of the stability and structure of coal seams based on sedimentary facies maps showed that the preferred coal-forming facies in the Saishiteng coalfield were inter-delta bay and interdistributary bay of lower delta plain in the Dameigou age.

40|$|Unexpectedly weak signal levels, in both {{radar and}} cross-hole modes, were {{obtained}} {{during a recent}} VHF borehole radar experiment in an arid, alluvial environment. An investigation revealed that the kaolinitic strata, which hosted the vertical boreholes, were moistened by drilling fluid during site preparation. It was therefore conjectured that the weak received signals were due to attenuation caused by wet, conductive annuli surrounding the boreholes in an otherwise dry medium. To examine this premise, the VHF electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) of representative dry and wet samples from the different strata were measured. These data were then used in a 3 D, electrodynamic Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) code to model different annular configurations of dry and wet strata in and around boreholes of different dimensions. In the model, a 1. 2 m center-fed dipole was placed coaxially in the various boreholes and excited by a Gaussian pulse.

Besides, a hydraulic rotary drill R- 20 instrumented with a drilling process monitoring (DPM) system has been used for site investigation on weathered granite formation-, and drilling energy is further analyzed based on the monitored data. The result shows that the penetrating energy in drilling is mainly kinetic energy dependant. The distribution of energy for rock failure is related with the strength characteristics of the penetrated formation. The kinetic energy is more than 98 percent and energy from effective thrust force is less than 2 percent when drilling in slightly weathered rock or fresh rock. However, the energy from the effective thrust force reaches to more than 22 percent, apparently increases with the increase in weathered degree of rock when drilling in soil or very strongly weathered rock. It shows that kinetic energy of drilling system and energy of effective thrust force can reflect the characteristics of the penetrated formation, which can provide theoretical foundation for identification of formation using penetrating energy in real-time. 旋轉鉆進是巖土工程鉆探的主要鉆進方式,從能量守恒原理出發,對旋轉鉆進的能量進行分析。同時,在R- 20 液壓式回轉鉆機上安裝數字式鉆孔過程監測(DPM) 系統,在風化花崗巖地基工程中進行試驗,并在監測數據的基礎上對鉆進能量進行分析計算。研究結果表明,鉆進過程中用于破碎巖石的能量主要來自鉆進系統的動能,鉆進系統用于破碎巖石的能量分配與地層強度特性有關。在風化程度較低或新鮮巖層中鉆進時,破碎巖石 98 %以上的能量來自系統的動能,而軸壓力推動鉆頭位移所給出的能量不到 2 %;在土層或全風化巖層中,軸壓力所做的功達到 22 %以上,且明顯隨風化程度的增高而增大,說明鉆進系統動能與軸力功可用以表征地層的可鉆性,這為實時鉆進能量用于地層的識別提供理論依據。link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Excavations for a storm-drain allowed sampling at points along a longitudinal traverse of the main Clacton Channel. Analysis of these samples has provided new palaeontological information, including data pertaining to the rise in relative sea level during the interglacial represented. Systematic studies of molluscs and ostracods, the latter undertaken at Clacton for the first time, have been particularly valuable. Information from the Butlin’s site supplements evidence previously gathered from the West Cliff section and from other localities at Clacton. The calcareous clay (‘marl’) that underlies the Clacton golf course extends beneath Butlin’s, where it was found to be part of the Freshwater Beds, not the Estuarine Beds, as hitherto supposed. The Clacton Estuarine Beds, restricted to the eastern end of the site, have their base just below 2 m O.

The latter has yet to be identified in the archaeological record and targeted excavation is therefore underway to test this finding. The development of the Iron Age industry had a major impact on the hydrological regime of the valley and its sedimentological history, with evidence for accelerated alluviation arising from floodplain erosion at salt production sites and modification of the local fluvial regime due to briquetage accumulation on the floodplain.

Eight sites west of the Canadian cordillera, were examined for long-term SAT and GST changes. At seven of these sites precise borehole tem-perature profiles are used {{for the first time}} since the 1960 s, thereby explor-ing the linkage between GST and SAT.

Observations of GST at those sites, however, showed no obvious cli-mate induced perturbations. Therefore, we believe that a trend in our area towards an increase in SAT temperatures only over the winter and spring is being masked by freeze thaw and latent energy effects.

Methods and techniques of obtaining this information, at little additional expense, are described and reviewed.

Both the location of the seismic array and the borehole are covered with the same Motoyama tuff on the ground (Nagai and Kobayashi 2015), which suggests that there is no large difference in the underground structure. Probably, the high-velocity layer found by the seismic array at a depth of 100 – 180  m is a layer of lava. The low-velocity layer beneath the high-velocity layer is thought to consist of thick tuff rocks due to an unknown previous caldera-forming eruption. The high-velocity layer beneath the low-velocity layer may correspond to high-density intruding rocks suggested by a high gravity anomaly at the center of Motoyama by Ehara (1985).|$|E

40|$|Although river confluences have {{received}} geomorphic attention {{in recent years}} {{it is difficult to}} upscale these studies, so confluence-dominated reaches are commonly presumed to be either: (1) braided; or (2) meandering and characterized by laterally migrating channels. If the geomorphology of a confluence zone is to be considered over longer timescales, changes in river style need to be taken into account. This paper uses a combination of remote sensing techniques (LiDAR, GPR, ER), <b>borehole</b> <b>survey</b> and chronometric dating to test this differentiation in the confluence-zone of a medium-sized, mixed-load, temperate river system (Trent, UK), which on the basis of planform evidence appears to conform to the meandering model. However, the analysis of ‘confluence sediment body stratigraphy’ demonstrates that the confluence does not correspond with a simple meander migration model and chronostratigraphic data suggests it has undergone two major transformations. Firstly, from a high-energy braid-plain confluence in the Lateglacial (25 – 13 [*]K[*]yrs cal BP), to a lower-energy braided confluence in the early to middle Holocene (early Holocene- 2. 4 kyr BP), which created a compound terrace. Second, incision into this terrace, creating a single-channel confluence (2. 4 – 0. 5 kyr cal BP) with a high sinuosity south bank tributary (the River Soar). The confluence sediment-body stratigraphy is characterized by a basal suite of Late Pleistocene gravels bisected by younger channel fills, which grade into the intervening levee and overbank sediments. The best explanation for the confluence sediment body stratigraphy encountered is that frequent switching (soft-avulsions sensu Edmonds et al., 2011) of the tributary are responsible for the downstream movement of the channel confluence (at an average rate of approximately 0. 5 [*]m per year) dissecting and reworking older braid-plain sediments. The late Holocene evolution of the confluence {{can be seen as a}} variant of the incisional-frequent channel reorganization (avulsion) model with sequential downstream migration of the reattachment point...|$|E

Values for the API variable were obtained by summing daily API values over the time between <b>borehole</b> <b>surveys,</b> if the daily API value exceeded some threshold, The coefficient of determination, r 2 8 was maximized by calculating a series of regressions with various API recession factors and thresholds. The "best " regressions had a recession factor of 0. 99 and a zero threshold. Results suggest that creep and earthflow rates increase in response to precipitation and that graywacke and schist terrain respond to similar mechanisms of movement, Creep and earthflow are important natural erosional processes in deeply weathered cohesive soil on steep terrain. The movement of earthflows and mudflows is related to amount and frequency of precipitation, but this relationship is complex.

40|$|The {{classical}} borehole Induced Polarization (IP) for {{mineral exploration}} {{is using a}} lateral probe where the two potential electrodes and one current electrode are deployed in one probe and {{used to measure the}} voltage in the drill-hole while the other current electrode is placed on the ground at infinity. Classical borehole IP has several limitations including an investigation radius that is restricted by borehole depth, depth of measurements limited by borehole depth, sensitivity to in-hole mineralization,and data are not suited to 3 D inversion. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, numerical modelling and inversion methods for the measurements of a novel IP <b>borehole</b> <b>survey</b> design have been investigated. The new survey design called, hole-to-hole lP, has been introduced by Abitibi Geophysics and aims to compensate the limitations of classical borehole IP especially in providing data that are suitable for 3 D modeling and inversion. The geophysical modelling package "DCIP 3 D" provided by Geophysical Inversion Facility of the University of British Columbia has been used for forward modelling and inversion of hole-to-hole IP data. Different combinations of receivers and boreholes have been examined to obtain the economically optimum survey design including the minimum number of boreholes and receiver locations for a successful imaging of the chargeable ore body in a mineral exploration project. Also, a weighting function has been applied to improve the imaging of the mineral deposit located between boreholes. In the second part of the thesis, a 3 D numerical modeling techniques based on integral equation methods for modelling of DC resistivity and IP data has been developed. The pivotal novelties in the code are, first, the application of unstructured meshes which is more flexible to complicated geometry with respect to the structured mesh. Second, the 3 D code has been developed to allow both constant and linearly variable charge inside each cell and this enables us to simulate the charge accumulation over the boundary surface more precisely. Therefore, the developed code will enable numerical modelling to be done for more complicated ore bodies than was previously the case. ...|$|E
40|$|This data {{qualification}} report uses technical {{assessment and}} corroborating data methods according to Attachment 2 of AP-SIII. 2 Q, Rev. 0, ICN 2, ''Qualification of Unqualified Data and the Documentation of Rationale for Accepted Data'', to qualify flowing interval data. This report was prepared {{in accordance with}} Data Qualification Plan TDP-NBS-GS- 000035, Revision 1. Flowing interval location data from borehole tracejector surveys and fracture dip data from acoustic televiewer logging are evaluated in this report. These data were collected {{under the direction of}} the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). The data qualification team considers the data collection protocols of the USGS during the time period of data acquisition to be state-of-the-art. The acoustic televiewer continues to be an important tool for fracture logging and the early methodology for that technique has evolved with little change into the current fracture logging procedure that supports the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) [...] approved USGS Quality Assurance Program Plan (QAPP). Consequently, the data collection methods, documentation, and results are reasonable and appropriate in view of standard practice at the time the data were collected. Extensive independent corroborative evidence is available from other <b>borehole</b> <b>survey</b> and logging techniques as well as from independent hydrological pump and injection testing. This evidence supports the conclusion that the tracejector surveys adequately detected the more significant flowing intervals in the system and that the acoustic televiewer data are representative of the dips of major fracture sets at Yucca Mountain. The parallels in time, location, purpose, personnel and technique in testing the boreholes that were sources for the flowing interval data support the application of corroborative evidence to all boreholes in the series. The data qualification team has concluded that the tracejector and acoustic televiewer data are adequate for generalized use and can be appropriately used in a wide variety of applications, so long as consideration is given to accuracy, precision and representativeness of the data for an intended use in a technical product. This qualification report addresses the specific flowing interval data sets selected to support the flowing interval studies in the Analysis and Modeling Report (AMR) ''Probability Distribution of Flowing Interval Spacing'' (Kuzio 1999). This AMR presents an analysis of the spacing of flowing intervals in the saturated volcanic rocks beneath Yucca Mountain. Based on a preponderance of evidence, the flowing interval data used in the AMR are recommended to be qualified for inclusion in technical products in support of the Site Recommendation for generalized uses as described in this report...|$|E
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 512. Tight gas {{is one of}} the {{unconventional}} gas accumulations. In tight reservoir, natural gas is trapped in impermeable sedimentary rock. Industry defines tight gas reservoir as a maximum 10 % matrix porosity and maximum 0. 1 mD permeability (excluding fracture permeability) sedimentary rock (Haines 2006). Gas is trapped by low permeability of the reservoir. Down-dip water contact and reservoir trap do not appear. Tight reservoir rock should be characterized by poor reservoir properties - low porosities, extremely low permeability and also small flow rates (Law 2002). Tight gas accumulations are expected to originate in deeper parts of Polish Permian Basin within Rotliegend sandstones (Kiersnowski et al. 2010). Depth of burial associated with time could allow occurrence of advanced diagenetic processes amending primary porosity. Area of research is located in the center of Polish Permian Basin - western Poland. It is a natural gas field Pxyz, where hydrocarbons are accumulated within aeolian Rotliegend sandstones characterized by low reservoir properties. Core samples from well Pxyz- 2 from depth interval 3511. 5 - 3626. 0 m were selected for investigation. The porosimetric analysis (AutoPore 9220 mercury porosimeter) of 115 samples granulometric analysis of 20 samples (sieve measurements and SediGraph 5100 device) were performed in Polish Oil and Gas Company. <b>Borehole</b> <b>survey</b> revealed gas saturation in whole 172 m sandstone profile. Obtained results allowed quantitative characteristics of samples, both grain size and pore space. Average diameter of sand grain was in the range from 0. 171 mm to 0. 643 mm. Based on the above results, studied sandstones were classified as fine, medium and coarsegrained (Pettijohn et al. 1972). Porosimetric studies showed poor reservoir quality of sandstones. Weak filtration of samples was proved by low values of average capillary diameter and insufficient 45 % percentage of pores with diameter greater than 1 jj. m. Average porosity samples is 7. 575 %, wherein samples from the upper part of sandstone complex have lower porosity values than those from the base. Total pore area ranged from 0. 01 m /g to 2. 73 m /g in whole profile. Research showed no total porosity and total pore area dependence on burial depth. It is connected with the domination of mechanical compaction in sandstones (Such et al. 2010). Changes in porosity and total pore volume showed the vertical variation in sandstones. Based on these results, zones predisposed to tight gas accumulations were distinguished. Granulometric and porosimetic studies performed on Rotliegend samples from the area of Pxyz deposit allowed better understanding of deep buried sandstones petrophysics. Parameters received from analysis confirmed possibility of tight gas accumulations in Rotliegend sandstones in the area of Pxyz gas field. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|Growing {{interest}} in extraterrestrial subsurface exploration has prompted {{an examination of}} advanced technologies for drilling slim holes and obtaining geophysical data in these holes. The <b>borehole</b> <b>surveys</b> with geophysical measurements called "logging", complement, and under favorable conditions, replace soil sampling. Very shallow drilling systems were used extensively during the Apollo lunar missions, and are {{in the planning stages}} for use on Mars. The prime objective is to gather scientific data, but these data could eventually provide a basis for the commercial use of space mineral resources. Given the strong scientific {{interest in}} water on Mars and the Moon, subsurface characterization with geophysical methods is attractive, because these methods can cover a much larger volume than soil sampling. Space technology has boosted the development of borehole geophysical instruments because both in space and in boreholes the instruments have to function in hostile environments, in confined spaces, {{and to be able to}} withstand large g-forces. This paper reviews oil industry drilling and geophysical borehole techniques that could be adopted for space applications. Coiled tubing drilling has many advantages because the surface facilities are compact, and an electrical cable in the tubing can transmit power and data. Moreover geophysical sensors can be embedded in the drill collars, which ensures that measurements are carried out while drilling, and this avoids risky reentry of geophysical tools in the hole. If kevlar is used for the coiled tubing, a laser beam could be transmitted via optic fibers in the coiled tubing wall. Using this beam to cut the rock would virtually eliminate mud and downhole motor requirements, and save a lot of weight. The quest for water and the strict [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{groundwater}} recharge process of heterogeneous hard rock aquifer in the Moole Hole experimental watershed, south India, is being studied {{to understand the}} groundwater flow behaviour. Significant seasonal variations in groundwater level are observed in boreholes located at the outlet area indicating that the recharge process is probably taking place below intermittent streams. In order to localize {{groundwater recharge}} zones and to optimize implementation of <b>boreholes,</b> a geophysical <b>survey</b> was carried out {{during and after the}} 2004 monsoon across the outlet zone. Magnetic resonance soundings (MRS) have been performed to characterize the aquifer and measure groundwater level depletion. The results of MRS are consistent with the observation in boreholes, but it suffers from degraded lateral resolution. A better resolution of the regolith/bedrock interface is achieved using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). ERT results are confirmed by resistivity logging in the <b>boreholes.</b> ERT <b>surveys</b> have been carried out twice—before and during the monsoon—across the stream area. The major feature of recharge is revealed below the stream with a decrease by 80 % of the calculated resistivity. The time-lapse ERT also shows unexpected variations at a depth of 20 m below the slopes that could have been interpreted as a consequence of a deep seasonal water flow. However, in this area time-lapse ERT does not match with borehole data. Numerical modelling shows that {{in the presence of a}} shallo...|$|R
