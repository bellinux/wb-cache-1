5|$|The war {{was still}} ongoing, and since {{transporting}} masses of {{people into a}} combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) would <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews {{from the rest of}} Europe.|$|E

He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years before, has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E

5|$|Army {{commitments}} intervened {{during the}} 1943 season. Lindwall {{had attempted to}} enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force, but he was rejected because the employees of his firm were exempted from military service.

As part of his Anti-aircraft and Fortress Signal unit, he was deployed in May 1943 to New Guinea as the Japanese reached the Kokoda Trail close to Port Moresby.

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{campaign}} against the Catholic Church, hundreds of monasteries in Germany and Austria were confiscated by the Gestapo and their occupants were expelled. In 1941 the Catholic Bishop of Münster, August von Galen, publicly protested against this persecution and against Action T4, the Nazi non-voluntary euthanasia programme under which the mentally ill, physically deformed, and incurably sick were to <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> <b>In</b> a series of sermons that received international attention, he criticised the programme as illegal and immoral. His sermons led to a widespread protest movement among church leaders, the strongest protest against a Nazi policy up until that point. Bormann and others called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels concluded that Galen's death would only {{be viewed as a}} martyrdom and lead to further unrest. Hitler decided {{to deal with the issue}} when the war was over.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
