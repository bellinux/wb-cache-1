60|$|The {{world to}} which he {{introduces}} us is, as before said, blackguardly and bleak. Paris swarms before us, full of famine, shame, and death; monks and the servants of great lords hold high wassail upon cakes and pastry; the poor man licks his lips before the baker's window; people with patched eyes sprawl all night under the stalls; chuckling Tabary transcribes an improper romance; bare-bosomed lasses and ruffling students swagger in the streets; the drunkard goes stumbling homeward; the graveyard is full of bones; and away on Montfaucon, Colin de Cayeux and Montigny hang draggled in the rain. Is there nothing <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> than sordid misery and worthless joys? Only where the poor old mother of the poet kneels in church below painted windows, and makes tremulous supplication to the Mother of God.|$|E
50|$|The Slavery Debate: The {{debate on}} slavery takes place {{early on in}} the novel, after Zeluco gains a {{plantation}} in Cuba (one location in the novel that Moore notably did not visit) and becomes a cruel master of the slaves there. The titular villain is unsurprisingly pro-slavery, while an educated physician - possibly provided as a stand-in for Moore’s own opinions on the subject - makes the arguments against slavery. These arguments cover the differing perspectives of the time, including whether or not the slaves were better off in slavery than they were in their own countries. They also argue whether the African people are equal to Europeans, and notions of property and the right to own people as property. This debate eventually leads {{to the question of whether}} it is <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as “the distributor of happiness” or the “inflictor of pain”, a problem that will follow Zeluco throughout the story, both in his military career and eventual marriage to the virtuous Laura.|$|E
50|$|By 1910, the Metropolitan Opera began touring through Atlanta and the South began a 76 year {{love affair}} with its Yankee brethren. The summer Met tours became an annual week-long event that drew many of Dixie's wealthiest {{citizens}} and even more socialites. It was so popular that it began to attract an international celebrity crowd. It is reported that during Atlanta's golden age of opera, {{the majority of the}} social elite would attend the first act and then leave at intermission for drinks and an evening of party-going. It was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> than to hear. Eager young students would often crowd outside the theater in hopes of gaining partially used tickets and catch the remainder of the show. As the yearly event outgrew all of Atlanta's existing theaters - even the Fabulous Fox, city aristocrats lobbied and construction began on the Atlanta Civic Center. Currently, the building holds the title as the world's largest opera house. The yearly Met shows thrived there until the Met disbanded its touring program in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Macmillan {{toyed with}} an offer to succeed Duff Cooper as MP for the safe Conservative seat of Westminster St George's. Criticised locally for his long absence, he {{suggested}} that Lady Dorothy stand for Stockton in 1945, {{as she had been}} nursing the seat for five years. She was apparently willing. However, it was thought <b>better</b> for him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> defend his seat, and Lord Beaverbrook had already spoken to Churchill to arrange that Macmillan be given another seat in the event of defeat.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the view}} of the Volunteer Movement leaders, the entire Protestant {{missions}} enterprise seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sagging {{in the last years of}} the nineteenth century. Harlan Beach wrote to Mott in 1896: [...] "Sometimes it seems as if the missionary spirit of the churches had received a permanent setback. The panic is far enough in the background now to have lost its power. No immediate prospect of <b>better</b> times <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> What then can be done?" [...] Increasingly, the Movements task <b>was</b> not only <b>to</b> recruit missionaries but also, through educational methods, to encourage financial support of the mission boards. There were far more recruits than positions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filled but the SVM justified its continued recruiting activity on the grounds that a wider pool for the boards to select from would result in more highly qualified missionaries.|$|R
60|$|Putting spurs {{to their}} horses, the seven knights and their {{followers}} dashed at the French. The latter were also mounted, unlike {{the majority of}} their companions, who before attacking had dismounted, and handed their horses to their pages. The party were fully double the strength of the English, but the impetus of the charge broke their line, and in a moment a fierce mêlée began. Edgar and Albert fought side by side. The former, as no missiles were flying, had thrown up his vizor, the <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what <b>was</b> passing round him. He was fighting with a battle-axe, for a sword was a comparatively poor weapon against knightly armour. His three first opponents fell headlong, their helmets crushed in under the tremendous blows he dealt them. Then warding off a blow dealt at him, he turned swiftly and drove his horse at a French knight who was on the point of striking at Albert with a mace while the latter was engaged with another opponent.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} impodlnt qualities of a project manager is a mature {{understanding}} of the way projects develop.

40|$|BackgroundExtracorporeal {{membrane}} oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving resource-intensive {{technology for}} patients with respiratory and/or circulatory failure. We aimed to evaluate outcome data from three Nordic paediatric centres comparing with data from the International Registry of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) and selected high-volume single-centre studies. MethodsOne-hundred nineteen patients < 19 years from 2002 <b>to</b> 2012 <b>were</b> enrolled. Data on demographics and outcome were collected using a standardised registration form. Outcome data were compared with the ELSO registry and high-volume single-centre studies. ResultsDemographics, indications and diagnosis <b>were</b> similar <b>to</b> the ELSO register. Survival after ECMO <b>was</b> similar <b>to</b> outcome data from the ELSO register, apart from paediatric cardiac ECMO, where a significantly <b>better</b> survival <b>to</b> discharge <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in the Nordic centres (68 % vs. 49 %; P= 0. 03). Comparison with high-volume centres in the period after 2005 demonstrated a significantly better survival after cardiac ECMO in a single high-volume centre study, whereas four studies had significantly lower survival after cardiac ECMO. No significant difference <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> in children receiving respiratory ECMO in the Nordic centres and high-volume centres. ConclusionsSurvival after ECMO in three low-volume Nordic centres demonstrated comparable outcome data with ELSO data and data from high-volume centres. We believe regular quality assurance surveys, as the present study, should be performed {{in order to maintain}} excellent therapy within the individual ECMO centres...|$|R
60|$|August 30th.--I {{have been}} {{two or three times}} to the Exhibition since my last date, and enjoy it more as I become {{familiar}} with it. There <b>is</b> supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{about a third of the}} good pictures here which England contains; and it is said that the Tory nobility and gentry have contributed to it much more freely and largely than the Whigs. The Duke of Devonshire, for instance, seems to have sent nothing. Mr. Ticknor, the Spanish historian, whom I met yesterday, observed that we should not think quite so much of this Exhibition as the English do after we have <b>been</b> <b>to</b> Italy, although it is a good school in which to gain a preparatory knowledge of the different styles of art. I <b>am</b> glad <b>to</b> hear that there <b>are</b> <b>better</b> things still <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> Nevertheless, I should suppose that certain painters are better represented here than they ever have been or will be elsewhere. Vandyke, certainly, can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> nowhere else so well; Rembrandt and Rubens have satisfactory specimens; and the whole series of English pictorial achievement is shown more perfectly than within any other walls. Perhaps it would <b>be</b> wise <b>to</b> devote myself to the study of this latter, and leave the foreigners <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied on their own soil. Murillo can hardly have done better than in the pictures by him which we <b>see</b> here. There <b>is</b> nothing of Raphael's here that is impressive. Titian has some noble portraits, but little else that I care to see. In all these old masters, Murillo only excepted, it is very rare, I must say, to find any trace of natural feeling and passion; and I am weary of naked goddesses, who never had any real life and warmth in the painter's imagination,--or, if so, it was the impure warmth of an unchaste woman, who sat for him.|$|R
40|$|Theopolis Americana: An Essay on the Golden Street of the Holy City was {{published}} in Boston in 1710. It {{is based on a}} sermon delivered to the Massachusetts General Assembly on May 9, 1709, by Cotton Mather (1663 – 1728) who was then (along with his father Increase Mather) pastor of the Second or Old North Church in Boston. The work is an extended interpretation of Revelations 21. 21 : “The street of the city was pure gold. ” Mather makes a twofold application of the verse—“publishing” (as he says) “A TESTIMONY against the CORRUPTIONS of the Market-Place. With Some Good HOPES of <b>Better</b> Things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> yet <b>seen</b> in the AMERICAN World. ” Mather enumerates and condemns all forms of commercial dishonesty and business corruption—including the kidnapping of Africans into slavery. He also gives us a sense of the accommodations of the old theocracy (20 years after the Glorious Revolution and 18 years after the witchcraft crisis) with the new horizons of the eighteenth century, telling the Assembly: “In two or three too Memorable Days of Temptation that have been upon us, there have been Errors committed. You <b>are</b> always ready <b>to</b> Declare unto all the World, That you Disapprove those Errors. You <b>are</b> willing <b>to</b> inform all Mankind with your DECLARATION; That no man may be Persecuted, because he is Conscientiously not of the same Religious Opinions, with those that are uppermost. And; That Persons <b>are</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> judg’d Confederates with Evil Spirits, meerly because the Evil Spirits do make Possessed People cry out upon them. ” Finally, and as expected, he applies the lesson to the place of America in the grand drama of redemption, holding out the hope that the churches of New England will play the leading role in the accomplishment of the new heavens and new earth. The text of this online electronic edition was prepared by Reiner Smolinski and appeared in his The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory: The Millennial Impulse in Early American Literature (Dubuque, IA: Kendall-Hunt, 1998). It is based on, and preserves all the features of, the first printing of 1710.
