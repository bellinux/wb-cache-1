50|$|The {{first stage}} in the {{manufacturing}} of aluminium boats was to cut out the hull skins and the other sheet metal parts such as the seats using templates under a radial arm router. Sections were then formed by a <b>brake</b> <b>press</b> and swaging, to form the gunwales and hull folds. Stiffening of sheet metal panels was {{by means of a}} 3,000 ton rubber press. Extruded gunwale, keel and strake sections of the hull were initially formed in a half-hard condition for ease of working and drop hammering, later being placed in a curing oven to bring them to full-hard condition. The skin sections were welded on wooden jigs on which the seats, gunwales, decks and extruded sections were positioned and riveted into position. The boat was then tested in a pressure tank to reveal any water leaks. The finished craft was then painted in a temperature-controlled paint shop. de Havilland also produced the polyurethane flotation material used in the boats which shaped and fitted into position. The company was noted for its use of rivets to join sections of the craft, together with the more common use of welding. In its advertisements, de Havilland Marine referred to this riveting process by the Sealomatic name.|$|E

50|$|Bending is a {{manufacturing}} process {{that produces a}} V-shape, U-shape, or channel shape along a straight axis in ductile materials, most commonly sheet metal. Commonly used equipment include box and pan <b>brakes,</b> <b>brake</b> <b>presses,</b> and other specialized machine presses.

40|$|Participants drove a {{simulated}} vehicle while completing an n-back task of {{high or low}} cognitive demand. Concurrently, they responded via <b>brake</b> <b>press</b> to signals presented in either a single modality (auditory, visual or tactile) or a bimodal combination. Participants {{were asked to indicate}} the perceived urgency of each signal by adjusting the force applied in their brake response. Signals were designed to be of “high ” or “low ” urgency based on previous research for both unimodal and bimodal combinations. Participants were capable of subjectively judging perceived urgency independent of response time and responded to bimodal (relative to unimodal) and high (relative to low) urgency stimuli with significantly greater brake force. However, both factors interacted with cognitive demand indicating that the magnitude of these differential responses was reduced under high demand.

40|$|Active force {{feedback}} in robots {{has been developed}} in the 1970 s as {{an answer to the}} limitations of the passive solutions, like the RCC (Remote Center Compliance), offered as an add-on for peg-into-hole assembly operations. Generic solutions of {{force feedback}} and impedance control have been developed in laboratory environments, but their industrial use has been very limited ever since. This situation has recently changed and it becomes feasible now to provide off-the-shelf industrial robots with real-time force feedback capabilities. In the paper, two convincing case-studies of tasks with force control will be presented. One is the synchronisation of a <b>brake</b> <b>press</b> with a plate-handling robot for sheet metal bending applications. Synchronisation is assured in two ways: (i) through a geometric bending model, and (ii) through active force feedback. The second case study deals with forcecontrolled assembly of rotary compressors. Here passive RCC-like aids are compared with force-feedback solutions. In some critical cases, active force feedback is the only solution, while in other cases passive aids suffice. status: publishe...|$|E
