50|$|A <b>bearer</b> <b>stock</b> certificate, as {{its name}} implies is a bearer instrument, and {{physical}} possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock. <b>Bearer</b> <b>stock</b> certificates are becoming uncommon: they were popular in offshore jurisdictions for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer beneficial title to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of stamp duty. International initiatives have curbed the use of <b>bearer</b> <b>stock</b> certificates in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice.|$|E

A registered stock certificate is normally only evidence of title, and {{a record of the}} true holders of the shares will appear in the stockholder's register of the corporation.|$|E

When he was ordered back to New York, Pennoyer tucked in his pocket the <b>bearer</b> <b>stock</b> certificates of French cosmetics company Lanvin, allowing Lanvin to operate outside Europe throughout the war. In 1960, Pennoyer reopened the Paris office.|$|E
40|$|Diplomas {{are like}} stock {{certificates}}. Stock certificates are possessed by people to prove partial ownership through corporate shares.

In both cases {{the value of the}} stock is directly proportional to the perceived value of the enterprise and its work.
