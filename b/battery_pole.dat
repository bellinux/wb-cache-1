The graduated galvanic <b>battery</b> with <b>poles</b> patent {{was an early}} form of electrotherapeutics and was touted by Coad and others {{as a way to}} help cure various diseases through the use of electricity and magnetism as medical treatment. Many prominent people of the day championed Coad’s invention including Thomas Dent Mutter, Henry Nes, Governor John Fairfield, Robley Dunglison, and Joseph Pancoast.|$|R
40|$|A car {{mechanic}} {{sustained a}} deep partial thickness burn {{of the wrist}} when his metal watch strap short circuited the battery of a car upon which he was working. CASE REPORT A twenty-eight year old car mechanic {{was seen in the}} skin clinic of the Chaim Sheba Medical Centre on January 30 th, 1975 with a burn of the left wrist sustained four days previously. He had been handling the engine of a vehicle which had two 12 volt batteries connected in series (i. e. a 24 volt unit) and two supporting iron rods connecting the back of the engine frame to its front. Inadvertently the patient's stainless steel watch strap touched both the positive <b>pole</b> of one <b>battery</b> and the adjacent iron rod causing a short circuit through the watch strap (Fig. 1). The patient experienced pain but was unable to pull away his hand for several seconds until the heat generated caused melting of the watch strap which broke and freed his hand. The patient immediately noticed a linear bracelet-like black burn involving the strap area of the watch but sparing the area under the watch itself. The burn seemed worse {{on the sides of the}} wrist than on the volar aspect where the metal clip was located. Fig. 1. Car battery, short-circuited through patient's stainless-steel watch-strap, which touched <b>battery's</b> <b>pole</b> and a supporting iron rod above it. Patient demonstrates accident...|$|R
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand <b>Battery,</b> the <b>Poles</b> abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|R
6000|$|... 502. If {{the wires}} of a {{galvanometer}} be terminated by plates, and these be immersed in dilute acid, {{contained in a}} regularly formed rectangular glass trough, connected at each end with a voltaic <b>battery</b> by <b>poles</b> equal to {{the section of the}} fluid, a part of the electricity will pass through the instrument and cause a certain deflection. And if the plates are always retained at the same distance from each other and from the sides of the trough, are always parallel to each other, and uniformly placed relative to the fluid, then, whether they are immersed near the middle of the decomposing solution, or at one end, still the instrument will indicate the same deflection, and consequently the same electric influence.|$|R

The {{instantaneous}} {{charge of}} a Leyden <b>battery</b> by the <b>poles</b> of a voltaic apparatus is another proof of the tension, and also the quantity, of electricity evolved by the latter. Sir H. Davy says[A], [...] "When the two conductors from {{the ends of the}} combination were connected with a Leyden battery, one with the internal, the other with the external coating, the battery instantly became charged; and on removing the wires and making the proper connexions, either a shock or a spark could be perceived: and the least possible time of contact was sufficient to renew the charge to its full intensity." ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Button battery {{ingestion}} {{is considered}} an emergency situation in pediatric patients {{that needs to be}} managed promptly; otherwise, it may lead to serious and potentially lethal complications, especially when it is impacted in the esophagus. Less attention has been given in cases where the battery passes into the stomach, with guidelines for emergency intervention being based on the presence of symptoms. Case Report. We present a case of an 18 -month-old male patient who presented to our emergency department after button battery ingestion. He did not have any symptoms and no pathological findings were encountered during clinical examination. X-ray investigation revealed the presence of the battery in the stomach. The patient was admitted for observation and two hours later he had two episodes of vomiting. He underwent urgent endoscopic removal of the battery where multiple acute gastric mucosal erosion in place of direct contact of the <b>battery’s</b> negative <b>pole</b> with the mucosa of the gastric antrum was found. Conclusion. In specific cases the urgent endoscopic intervention for removal of an ingested button battery that is located in the stomach even in asymptomatic patients should be suggested...|$|R
5000|$|One lead-wire {{from each}} group of the {{division}} — i.e., eight in all — was connected with one <b>pole</b> of the <b>battery.</b> The other <b>pole</b> was then connected with a brass pin, penetrating through a wooden horizontal disc, which, being let go by the run, would cause the brass pin to enter a cup filled with mercury, planted in a second wooden horizontal disc fixed in position. If the eight return-wires of the same group were then connected with the brass cup containing mercury, it is evident, that, when the brass pin entered the mercury-cup, the circuit would be closed, and explosion would result. Obviously, if, instead of one pin and one mercury-cup, twenty-three pins and twenty-three cups were attached respectively to the two discs, and the same connections as just described made for each and every division of a hundred and sixty mines, a simultaneous explosion would result {{at the moment when}} the upper disc should fall upon the lower.|$|R
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the <b>battery</b> onto a <b>pole</b> and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|R
40|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{found by}} the older workers in using ink-filled pens for writing on recording surfaces {{were associated with the}} large amount of friction between the pen and the paper, viz., failure to record small movements., marked diminution in all other movements, particularly rapid ones, and a poor tracing due mainly to an inadequate and discontinuous flow of ink. Con-sequently, smoked paper came into general use as a recording surface, in spite of its obvious disadvantages. In working with the Thompson sphygmanograph (1) we found the disadvantages to be a great hindrance, especially when continuous records taken over a period of an hour or more were required. Attention was therefore directed to the evolution of some other means of recording. It was essential that the appara-tus should possess the following properties: (a) Simplicity; (b) faithful recording of all excursions of the float; (c) formation of a good tracing. Experiments were first of all conducted, using paper impregnated with potassium iodide and starch in suitable proportions, the drum upon which the paper was wound being connected to one pole of a small <b>battery,</b> the other <b>pole</b> being attached to a fine wire suspended vertically which was in contact with a small piece of platinum wire fused into the stem of the glass float, and which therefore served the double purpose of making electrical contact and keeping the platinum wire in position against the paper. The platinum wire was shaped to form a writing point. The apparatus fulfilled the three essential conditions stated above. It was found to be very efficient in recording rapid excursions of a lever-e. g., muscle twitches; but for the recordin...|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, {{following}} {{the launch of}} Radio Caroline, Screaming Lord Sutch said he would start his own station. On 27 May Radio Sutch began broadcasting on 194 metres (announced as 197), 1542 kHz, from the south tower of Shivering Sands. It was a low-powered, low-budget operation.The transmitter, from a Handley Page Halifax bomber, was powered with a cascade of car <b>batteries,</b> a scaffold <b>pole</b> with a skull-and-crossbones flag as an antenna. By September 1964 Sutch had become tired of it and sold it to his manager Reginald Calvert for a reported £5,000. Calvert bought new equipment and expanded the station into other towers. One of the original seven towers had been destroyed when a ship collided with it, leaving the northernmost tower isolated. The remaining five were connected by catwalks in an irregular star shape. Calvert's team repaired the catwalks and refurbished the facilities and living quarters. New studios were built, a more powerful transmitter installed, and the station experimented with new antenna configurations and frequencies (1034 and eventually 1003 kHz). Initially antenna wires were strung around {{the periphery of the}} towers. This was unsuccessful due to poor insulation. Later a vertical mast was erected on the central tower, supported by guy wires on three of the surrounding towers, and the station adopted the nickname [...] "your tower of power". Although output never exceeded 2 kW, the efficiency of the antenna combined with its location over water (a reflector of radio waves) gave it the coverage of a more powerful land-based station, and Radio City claimed a power of 10kW for the purpose of attracting advertisers.|$|R
40|$|Pupils 2 ̆ 7 {{ideas about}} {{electric}} current {{in a simple}} circuit composed of a battery, a bulb and wires has beenintensively studied. It has been revealed that pupils hold a variety of ideas concerning how electric currentflows in the circuit. Some authors have claimed that pupils construct these ideas prior to formal teaching ofelectric circuit and that frequently these are not replaced with the correct one by teaching. The present author reviewed the reports and concluded that pupils 2 ̆ 7 ideas about electric current, which areincorrect from scientific viewpoint, are induced through formal science teaching and/or by questions in thequestionnaire. When pupils are asked to describe their image of electric current for the first time, most of themwill consider that current is consumed in the bulb. This belief is firmly grounded on their dairy experiences. A variety of incorrect models of electric current are composed or selected by pupils through their efforts toaccommodate propositions about the electric circuit (the <b>battery</b> has two <b>poles,</b> the current flows unidirectionallyetc.), which are given by the teacher, to their unaltered belief that the current is consumed in the bulband is not conserved. The author argues that above mentioned pupils 2 ̆ 7 belief is to be challenged by telling them what is consumedinstead of current. Demonstration of current conservation with ammeters by itself, without such comments,will be unconvincing for many of pupils, though they can do nothing other than accepting the 2 ̆ 7 correct 2 ̆ 7 conclusion. Some descriptions of electric circuits in Japanese elementary-school textbooks seem to be inadequate forpupils without preknowledge. Guide books authored by Japanese Ministry of Education shares the sameproblems with the textbooks. Elementary-school pupils, as well as ones of higher schools and adults, desire composing convincingmodels of phenomena around them and are equipped with intellectual faculties for rational thinking. Theyonly lack suitable framework of concepts in which the faculties operate meaningfully. Without the framework,pupils should be lead to undirected and fragmentary thinking and after all to noncritical acceptance ofconclusions given by the teacher. The author also argues that those who claim that teachers should help individual pupils to construct theirown models of electric current unreasonably neglect {{the fact that the}} framework of concepts concerningelectric circuits is the essence of practical and theoretical activities of innumerable persons over a long periodof time...|$|R
