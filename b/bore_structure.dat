40|$|The diffractive {{resolution}} on a collisionless shock formed along the spatial {{profile of a}} beam in a nematic liquid crystal is considered, this material being {{an example of a}} self-focusing, nonlocal medium. It is found that the shock is resolved through the formation of an undular <b>bore</b> <b>structure</b> which persists for experimentally relevant propagation distances due to nonlocality delaying the onset of modulational instability. Both 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensional bores with circular symmetry are considered (termed line and circular bores, respectively). A semianalytical solution is developed for the line undular bore, approximating it as a train of uniform solitary waves. The predictions of this semianalytical theory are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical solutions of the governing equations, both for line and circular bores. The method presented here yields semianalytical results for a bore in focusing media...|$|E
40|$|The run-up of non-{{breaking}} {{and breaking}} solitary waves on a uniform plane beach {{connected to a}} constant-depth wave tank was investigated experimentally and nu-merically. If only the general characteristics of the run-up process and the maximum run-up are of interest, for {{the case of a}} breaking wave the post-breaking condition can be simplied and represented as a propagating bore. A numerical model using this <b>bore</b> <b>structure</b> to treat the process of wave breaking and subsequent shore-ward propagation was developed. The nonlinear shallow water equations (NLSW) were solved using the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) shock capturing scheme employed in gas dynamics. Wave breaking and post-breaking propagation are handled automatically by this scheme and ad hoc terms are not required. A com-putational domain mapping technique was used to model the shoreline movement. This numerical scheme was found to provide a relatively simple and reasonably good prediction of various aspects of the run-up process. The energy dissipation associated with wave breaking of solitary wave run-up (excluding the eects of bottom friction) was also estimated using the results from the numerical model. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between classical hydraulics and modern turbulence modelling is discussed {{for the case}} of two-dimensional open channel flow down an inclined plane. A second order turbulence model describing the flow is treated asymptotically for the parameter range F ≥ O (1), δ ≪ 1, β ≪ 1, and δ = O (β 2), where F is the Froude number, δ is the aspect ratio, and β is the square root of a characteristic drag coefficient. The Chezy law formulation of mathematical hydraulics is derived as the lowest order approximation to the solution for the flow outside bore regions, and the transverse variation of the longitudinal velocity component is determined at {{the next stage of}} the analysis. It is shown that flow discontinuities calculated using the equations of mathematical hydraulics are resolved in bore regions of transverse length scale O (H o), where H o is the characteristic fluid depth. The <b>bore</b> <b>structure</b> is found to consist of a highly turbulent outer region with transverse length scale O (H o) in which the turbulence intensity is O (1), and a bottom boundary layer of transverse length scale O (β 2 H o), in which the turbulent stresses decrease rapidly to satisfy the bottom boundary conditions. The jump conditions of mathematical hydraulics at flow discontinuities are verified, and it is inferred that classical hydraulics provides an acceptable approximation to the flow outside bore regions for the parameter range considered in the theory...|$|E

Based on observed bore environments, we assume initial long-wave perturbations having sinusoidal form and large amplitudes. Results indicate that close proximity of a duct to reflecting boundaries enhances bore development, that both thermal and Doppler ducts support bore development for long-wave perturbations of sufficiently large amplitudes, and that <b>bore</b> <b>structures</b> and evolutions exhibit both features anticipated by idealized bore theory and departures that remain to be explored in detail...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} the run-up of non-breaking and breaking solitary waves on a smooth sloping beach. A non-linear theory and a numerical model solving the non-linear shallow water equations (NLSW) {{were developed to}} model this physical process. Various experiments to obtain wave amplitude time-histories, water particle velocities, wave free surface profiles, and maximum run-up were conducted {{and the results were}} compared with the analytical and numerical models. A higher order theoretical solution to the non-linear shallow water equations, which describes the non-breaking wave characteristics on the beach, was sought and is presented in this study. The solution was obtained analytically by using the Carrier and Greenspan (1958) hodograph transformation. It was found that the non-linear theory agreed well with experimental results. The maximum run-up predicted by the non-linear theory is larger than that predicted by Synolakis (1986) at the order of the offshore relative wave height for a given slope. This correction for non-breaking waves on beach decreases as the beach slope steepens, and increases as the relative incident solitary wave height increases. A unique run-up gage that consists of a laser and a photodiode camera was developed in connection with this study to measure the time-history of the tip of the run-up tongue of a non-breaking solitary wave as it progresses up the slope. The results obtained with this run-up gage agree well with other measurements, and this technique provides a simple and reliable way of measuring run-up time-histories. The run-up of breaking solitary waves was studied experimentally and numerically since no fully theoretical approach is possible. The wave characteristics such as wave shape and shoaling characteristics, and, for plunging breakers, the shape of the jet produced are presented. The experimental results show that wave breaking is such a complicated process that even sophisticated numerical models cannot adequately model its details. Two different plunging wave breaking and resultant run-up were found from the experiments. The point where the tip of the incident jet produced by the plunging breaking wave impinges determines the characteristics of the resulting splash-up. If the jet impinges on a dry slope, no splash-up occurs and the plunging breaker simply collapses. If the impingement point is located on the free surface, splash-up including a reflected jet is formed, which further increases the turbulence and energy dissipation associated with wave breaking. It is hypothesized that both clockwise and counterclockwise vortices may be generated by the impinging plunging jet and the reflected jet associated with the splash-up when the jet impinges on the front face of a breaking wave or on the still water surface in front of the wave. If only the run-up process and maximum run-up are of interest, the wave and the water flow produced after breaking can be simplified as a propagating bore, which is analogous to a shock wave in gas dynamics. A numerical model using this <b>bore</b> <b>structure</b> to treat the process of wave breaking and propagation was developed. The non-linear shallow water equations were solved using the weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) shock capturing scheme employed in gas dynamics. Wave breaking and propagation is handled automatically by this scheme and no ad-hoc term is required. A computational domain mapping technique proposed by Zhang (1996) is used in the numerical scheme to model the shoreline movement. This numerical scheme is found to provide a somewhat simple and reasonably good prediction of various aspects of the run-up process. The numerical results agree well with the experiments corresponding to the run-up on a relatively steep slope (1 : 2. 08) as well as on a more gentle slope (1 : 19. 85). A simple empirical estimate of maximum run-up based on energy conservation considerations is also presented where the energy dissipation associated with wave breaking was estimated using the results from the numerical model. This approach appears to be useful and the maximum run-up predicted agrees reasonably well with the experimental results. The splash-up of a solitary wave on a vertical wall positioned at different locations on a gentle slope was also investigated in this study to understand the degree of protection from tsunamis afforded by seawalls. It was found that the effect of breaking wave kinematics offshore of the vertical wall on the splash-up is of critical importance to the maximum splash-up. The maximum slope of the front face of the wave upon impingement of the wave on the wall, which represents the maximum water particle acceleration, was important in defining the maximum sheet splash-up as well as the trend for splash-up composed of drops and spray...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{eddy current}} {{techniques}} {{for the detection}} of outer diameter damage in tubing and many complex aerospace structures often requires the use of an inner diameter probe {{due to a lack of}} access to the outside of the part. In small <b>bore</b> <b>structures</b> the probe size and orientation are constrained by the inner diameter of the part, complicating the optimization of the inspection technique. Detection of flaws through a significant remaining wall thickness becomes limited not only by the standard depth of penetration, but also geometrical aspects of the probe. Recently, an orthogonal eddy current probe was developed for detection of such flaws in Space Shuttle Primary Reaction Control System (PRCS) Thrusters. In this case, the detection of deeply buried stress corrosion cracking by an inner diameter eddy current probe was sought. Probe optimization was performed based upon the limiting spatial dimensions, flaw orientation, and required detection sensitivity. Analysis of the probe/flaw interaction was performed through the use of finite and boundary element modeling techniques. Experimental data for the flaw detection capabilities, including a probability of detection study, will be presented along with the simulation data.

This analysis examined the microstructural changes produced in these layers by examining the retained austenite content, residual stress, texture, diffracting particle size, microhardness, cone <b>bore,</b> and metallographic <b>structure.</b> A postproduction cryogenic thermal treatment was used to alter the retained austenite profile on selected cones. ^ The results of this research have shown that postproduction cryogenic thermal treatment results in a reduction of the as-produced retained austenite profile due to its transformation to martensite, a reduction in the surface compressive residual stress in the martensite, an increase in the surface tensile residual stress in the austenite, and an increase in cone bore diameter. In addition, the diffracting particle size of the austenite was also reduced. ^ Assessment of as-produced and cryogenically treated test cones as a function of simulated service mileage indicated that cryogenically treated cones experienced less transformation of retained austenite during rolling contact loading but developed compressive surface residual stresses of similar magnitude as the as-produced cones. Subsurface residual compressive stresses were significantly less in the cryogenically treated cones, but cone bore growth was reduced. ...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{disasters}} usually occur {{without any}} warning. They can leave trail of destruction and cause much tragedy. We {{are at a}} time when we witness fast technological advances; hence, we need to apply the force of scientific advancements to decrease economic losses and the number of human deaths. Tsunami is one of the extreme environmental events that leaves nothing but a path of death and destruction, and as a result, it is essential to understand this phenomenon and identify the mitigation strategies. Several mitigation strategies have been proposed so far; however, more investigations are still required to achieve an acceptable solution. Researchers around the world are studying different aspects of this phenomenon. One of the proposed solutions that has received much attention is designing tsunami-resistant structures which can withstand the force of a tsunami bore. Various studies have been done so far to understand the base shear force of tsunami <b>bore</b> on <b>structures.</b> The focus of this thesis is to improve and better understand the characteristics of the tsunami base shear forces on structures. Hence, in this thesis, two numerical studies were proposed and performed with the main goal of estimating the total tsunami forces on structure under two different conditions. Those include structures with various cross sections, as well as positioning a mitigation wall at an appropriate location relative to the structure. The first study focused on developing a numerical model to study the relationship between tsunami forces and the geometry of the structure. The main goal of this study was to define a numerical model capable of simulating this case precisely. To ensure the accuracy of the model, a comparison was carried out between the results of the numerical model and experimental test performed at the NRC-CHC (National Research Council- Canadian Hydraulics Center) laboratory in Ottawa, Canada and Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Belgium, which revealed a very good agreement between the results of the experimental test and numerical model. Further, the validated model was applied to investigate the tsunami force on structures with various cross sections. The second study focus was on developing a numerical model for understanding the role of mitigation wall (a novel idea proposed as a mitigation strategy by the second author of technical paper 2) on reducing the exerted force of tsunami on structures. After developing various models and applying several turbulence models, a valuable result was obtained which demonstrated that a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model seems to be an excellent approach for predicting the tsunami forces on the structure with a mitigation wall in the direction of the flow. The results of this study will be used to better estimate the tsunami forces exerted on coastal structures which will light the path to the main goal of designing tsunami resistant-structures...|$|R
40|$|As proposed, {{the third}} year program will {{continue}} and expand upon the Kansas elements of the original program, and provide improved on-line access to the prototype atlas. The third year of the program {{will result in a}} digital atlas sufficient to provide a permanent improvement in data access to Kansas operators. The ultimate goal of providing an interactive history-matching interface with a regional data base will be demonstrated as the program covers more geographic territory and the data base expands. The atlas will expand to include significant reservoirs representing the major plays in Kansas, and North Dakota. Primary products of {{the third year}} prototype atlas will be on-line accessible digital data bases and technical publications covering two additional petroleum plays in Kansas and one in North Dakota. Regional databases will be supplemented with geological field studies of selected fields in each play. Digital imagery, digital mapping, relational data queries, and geographical information systems will be integral to the field studies and regional data sets. Data sets will have relational links to provide opportunity for history-matching, feasibility, and risk analysis tests on contemplated exploration and development projects. The flexible "web-like" design of the atlas provides ready access to data, and technology at a variety of scales from regional, to field, to lease, and finally to the individual well <b>bore.</b> The digital <b>structure</b> of the atlas permits the operator to access comprehensive reservoir data and customize the interpretative products (e. g., maps and cross-sections) to their needs. The atlas will be accessible in digital form on-line using a World-Wide-Web browser as the graphical user interface. Regional data sets and field studies will be free-standing entities that will be made available on-line through the Internet to users as they are completed. Technology transfer activities will be ongoing from the earliest part of this project, providing data information sets to operators prior to the full digital atlas compilation...|$|R
