The company had removed the apostrophe after signs using the apostrophe were interpreted by some to <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> the language sign laws of the Province of Quebec in 1993. The removal of the apostrophe allowed the company to have one common sign image across Canada.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 Schlaich {{accused the}} German Vice Consul Dr. Eugen Büge (1859–1936) in Jaffa to <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> {{consular}} secrets {{in return for}} gifts. So Büge was transferred for disciplinary reasons to Aleppo, however, the German Foreign Office urged also Schlaich's transfer, since it considered Schlaich and not Büge to have damaged its reputation abroad. The , the executive board of the Prussian state church, pressurised Jerusalem's Association to release Schlaich {{from his office in}} Jaffa, thus he was appointed for another pastorate in Germany. The Jaffa congregation gave Schlaich a farewell on 25 December 1905, and Georg Johannes Egger (1842) thanked Schlaich and his wife for 9 years of successful pastoral work.|$|E

25|$|Ben Wilson (born 1963) is an English {{wood carver}} and {{outsider}} artist. The {{son of an}} artist, Wilson {{grew up in a}} creative environment and attended art school. His distaste for industrial waste, cars and rubbish eventually turned into an art form. He creates tiny works of art by painting chewing gum stuck to the pavement. Initially, his work garnered him unwanted attention from the authorities, but because he is not defacing private property but merely painting rubbish, he was found to <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> no law. In addition to the chewing gum art, Wilson paints and sculpts. He has exhibited his paintings and sculptures in England, the United States, Germany, Ireland, Finland, France and Serbia.|$|E
25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
25|$|At the Dachau Trials, {{the issue}} of whether the donning of enemy uniforms to {{approach}} the enemy without drawing fire was within the laws of war was established under international humanitarian law at the trial in 1947 of the planner and commander of Operation Greif, Otto Skorzeny. Skorzeny was found not guilty by an American military tribunal of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms. He had passed on to his men the warning of German legal experts, that if they fought in American uniforms, they would <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> the laws of war, but they probably were not doing so just by wearing American uniforms. During the trial, a number of arguments were advanced to substantiate this position and that the German and U.S. military seem to be in agreement on it. In its judgement, the tribunal noted that the case did not require that the tribunal make findings other than those of guilty or not guilty, so consequently, no safe conclusion could be drawn from the acquittal of all accused.|$|E

Ekotaksi taxi company stated how Uber would <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> state laws about offering passenger transport service, saying how Uber drivers have no obligation to maintain passenger safety and service quality. Cammeo taxi service stated how if they themselves invest in their drivers, issue fiscalized receipts, pay VAT, that in that case they consider Uber to be unfair competition that is breaking many laws. Večernji list reported ORaH and the taxi services were planning an open letter to the Zagreb city council to prevent Uber from coming to the Croatian capital. In October 2015, Uber initiated service in Zagreb. In June 2016, the service also started operating in the coastal cities of Split and Dubrovnik, two important tourist locations. In September 2016, Jutarnji list reported that a group of taxi drivers attacked a Uber driver who was waiting for a passenger at the Zagreb Airport. The Uber driver canceled the drive before the passenger arrived and drove away, with the attackers following him. The attack was filmed by the victim and reported to the police.|$|E
500|$|The band {{intended}} {{to play a}} 2013 fall US tour headlined by Dying Fetus and supported by Exhumed, Waking the Cadaver and Abiotic, but dropped off the tour roughly three months in advance. This caused speculation that the band had broken up or would <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> up due to it being Devourment's second planned line of concert appearances that year that went abandoned. The rumors that the band had broke up were later dispelled by Majewski, with the statement, [...] "Just to squash rumors, Your ol pals Devo are not broken up!" ...|$|E

Principal photography was slated to originally begin in July 2003, before being bumped up to August 6, 2003.|$|E

However, a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies. The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.|$|E

500|$|Despite all {{the glowing}} reviews, FreeSpace 2 sold poorly. The April 2000 issue of PC Gamer stated that only 26,983 copies {{had been sold}} {{in the first six}} months of its release. These figures were {{acknowledged}} as disappointing, and described as awful by Kulas. [...] He, however, stated that as the team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule, Volition should at least <b>be</b> <b>breaking</b> even with the estimated final sales of the game. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition, he stated that this could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were [...] "going out of fashion" [...] because more modern first-person shooters, such as Quake, were [...] "very much about the mouse and [...] keyboard". He went further on to state [...] "Before that, when we did Descent for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks – we sold a lot of copies of Descent.
