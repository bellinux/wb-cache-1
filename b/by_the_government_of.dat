5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009.

One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> Geir H. Haarde but also carried out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>of</b> Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E
