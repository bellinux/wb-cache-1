40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the power {{characteristics of the}} Bluetooth technology when supporting low-power modes. We provide accurate power consumption measurements for different Bluetooth operating modes. Such information {{could be used to}} drive technical decisions on battery type and design of Bluetooth-based end systems. Finally, we examine the trade-off between power consumption and performance for a commercial off-the-shelf Bluetooth device. We find that the use of the sniff mode could be quite compatible with the use of multi-slot data packets. However, when the channel conditions require selecting single slot data packets, the sniff mode highly impact performance, and so the power/delay trade-off must be taken into consideration. 2 Bluetooth Power Consumption Characterization In this section we perform a detailed analysis of the power characteristics of the Mitsumi WML C 11 [4] class 1 <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>module,</b> which is based on the CSR BlueCore 2 chipset, and is a fully qualified transceiver compliant with the Bluetooth 1. 1 Specification.
