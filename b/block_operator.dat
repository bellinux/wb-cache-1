40|$|The {{growth of}} the Internet has made it {{possible}} to query data in all corners of the globe. This trend is being abetted by the emergence of standards for data representation, such as XML. In face of this exciting opportunity, however, there are several changes that need to be made to existing query engines to make them applicable for the task of querying the Internet. One of the challenges is providing partial results of query computation, based on the initial part of the input, because it may be undesirable to wait for all of the input. This is due to (a) limited data transfer bandwidth (b) temporary unavailability of sites and (c) intrinsically long-running queries (e. g., continual queries or triggers).
