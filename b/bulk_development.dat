40|$|The {{development}} of a polymeric resist by dissolution may {{be described as a}} two-step process (1). First, the smaller solvent molecules must diffuse into the polymer matrix. The resulting increase in internal pressure causes the rigid, interpenetrating polymer molecules to loosen and swell. The increased mobility of the polymer mole-cules typically causes an i crease in the mobility of the sol-vent molecules, in which case the diffusive penetration of the solvent will autoaccelerate. Second, the polymer mole-cules become sufficiently separated from each other to dif-fuse into the solvent. Since the mobility of the solvent molecules depends upon both the concentration of the solvent and the length of time the polymer molecules have been loosening, the diffusion step generally cannot be described by Fick's law unless the diffusion coefficient has both a concentra-tion and history dependence. There a other effects which add to the difficulty of developing a widely applicable, theoretical model of the development process, such as sur-face induction (2) and adhesion (3). Because of the compli-cation arising from these effects, the development process is usually described by an empirical model in which a <b>bulk</b> <b>development</b> rate is modified to include the necessary depth dependence (3 - 4). One type of development behavior that appears to be very non-Fickian is Case II or relaxation-balanced diffu-sion, in which the solvent polymer interface travels into the polymer at a constant velocity with little diffusion of solvent beyond the interface (Fig. 1). The dissolution of PMMA by MIBK, a resist-solvent combination frequently used in electron-beam lithography, is probably the most important example of this behavior. Model and Solution For Case II diffusion, a one-dimensional model of the solvent-polymer system will be considered (Fig. 2). The solvent concentration c in the polymer is described b...|$|E

Although formation of well defined deformation fibre(s) could not be identified, overall developments in deformation texture were best captured through Taylor type models incorporating only prismatic slip. Strain localisations were observed as single or double walled dislocation structures at approximately 45 and 60 degrees to the rolling direction. Such strain localisations were always associated with significant lattice reorientations or misorientation developments.

The grains or orientations with dominant presence of strain localisations could be indirectly related to negative textural softening...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} findings {{of an investigation}} on the age development of interfacial properties of polyethylene fibers in a cementitious matrix. It is found that the interface bond strength matures much faster, in less than 7 days, in comparison with <b>bulk</b> property <b>development,</b> which typically takes 14 to 28 days. A parallel ESEM study of the microstructure development in the interface transition zone provides support that the rapid early age saturation of the interfacial adhesive bond strength {{is associated with the}} growth of a CH rim around the fiber periphery. Formation of the CH layer appears to complete much earlier than the hydration process of the bulk material. The slipdependent friction after initial debonding is found to develop over age up to 28 days, gradually converting from a slip-weakening to a slip-hardening behavior. These findings should be useful in interpreting early age fiber reinforced cementitious composite properties...|$|R

Textural developments were characterized by X-ray Orientation Distribution Function (ODFs) and the same were simulated using different Taylor type deformation texture models. A strong difference in <b>bulk</b> texture <b>developments</b> was observed at respective strain paths. The textural differences largely explain the changes observed in normal anisotropy values obtained by mechanical testing. The new deformation texture simulation model, Lamel, was quite successful in predicting quantitatively such textural differences. Microscopically, the significant features of the substructures were "strain localizations "first generation dense dislocation walls (DDWs) and micro bands (MBs).

40|$|In-situ {{weathered}} bedrock, saprolite, is locally {{found in}} Scandinavia, {{where it is}} commonly thought to represent pre-Pleistocene weathering possibly associated with landscape formation. The age of weathering, however, remains loosely constrained, which {{has an impact on}} existing geological and landscape evolution models and morphotectonic correlations. Here we provide new geochronological evidence that some of the low-altitude basement landforms on- and offshore southwestern Scandinavia are a rejuvenated geomorphological relic from Mesozoic times. K-Ar dating of authigenic, syn-weathering illite from saprolitic remnants constrains original basement exposure in the Late Triassic (221. 3 ± 7. 0 – 206. 2 ± 4. 2 [*]Ma) through deep weathering in a warm climate and subsequent partial mobilization of the saprolitic mantle into the overlying sediment cascade system. The data support the <b>bulk</b> geomorphological <b>development</b> of west Scandinavia coastal basement rocks during the Mesozoic and later, long-lasting relative tectonic stability.

40|$|Hot band Fe- 3 %Si steel (CRGO or {{cold rolled}} grain oriented) was cold rolled with {{different}} reductions. The main {{objective of this}} study was an overall understanding of deformation texture and microstructure development. Hot band CRGO had a strong alpha-fiber (RD//[110]) texture. Cold reduction strengthened the alpha and gamma (ND//[111]) fibers, but weakened theta (ND//(100)). All Taylor type deformation texture models were reasonably successful in predicting these <b>bulk</b> texture <b>developments,</b> and the Lamel model seems to be the 'best-fit' model, both in terms of a 'deviation' parameter (indicating differences between experimental and simulated values of idealized texture components) and a 'trend' parameter (indicating the relative change(s) in texture components with strain). The striking feature of the microstructure was the 'selective' appearance of grain interior strain localization's. These appeared at approximately 37 degrees with the rolling direction (RD). Though 37 degrees bands appeared only in orientations with high Taylor factor (M), the absolute value of the Taylor factor alone, was not enough for the appearance of such bands. Negative textural softening or (dM/depsilon) values, on the other hand, were always associated with the appearance of 37 degrees bands, justifying or explaining their formation {{on the basis of a}} macroscopic plastic instability theory. status: publishe...|$|R

This is particularly beneficial when the architecture has been planned to (or already does) support a whole product family, or a set of products that share common requirements, architecture, components or code. As the family requirements evolve and new products are added, the need to assess the evolvability of the existing architecture is vital.
