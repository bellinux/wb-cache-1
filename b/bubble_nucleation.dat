25|$|In the {{theoretical}} {{physics of the}} false vacuum, the system moves to a lower energy state– either the true vacuum, or another, lower energy vacuum– through {{a process known as}} <b>bubble</b> <b>nucleation.</b> In this, instanton effects cause a bubble to appear in which fields have their true vacuum values inside. Therefore, the interior of the bubble has a lower energy. The walls of the bubble (or domain walls) have a surface tension, as energy is expended as the fields roll over the potential barrier to the lower energy vacuum. The most likely size of the bubble is determined in the semi-classical approximation to be such that the bubble has zero total change in the energy: the decrease in energy by the true vacuum in the interior is compensated by the tension of the walls.|$|E
40|$|Helium <b>bubbles</b> <b>nucleation</b> {{and growth}} in metals or metal tritide is a long-standing problem {{attracting}} considerable attention in nuclear industry but the mechanism remains indistinct and predicting {{the growth rate}} of helium bubble is inexistence still up to new. Here, the rate of helium <b>bubbles</b> <b>nucleation</b> and growth in metal tritide is developed based on a dynamical model, which describes the diameter of helium bubbles increasing linearly as t**(1 / 3) in titanium tritide at room temperature, agreeing quite well with the experimental phenomenon. The way of reducing storage temperature from 300 to 225 K or increasing the helium atoms diffusion barrier from 0. 81 to 1. 1 eV can effectively restrain bubbles growth and prolong lifetime of titanium tritide more than 4 times, which provides a useful reference to relevant experiment exploration and applications. This model also can be used to predict lifetime of new tritium-storage materials and plasma facing materials in nuclear industry. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} vapor <b>bubbles</b> <b>nucleation</b> in single-component liquids {{developed}} in [J. Phys. Chem. B 116, 9445 (2012) ] {{for the case}} of high viscosity (the (V,/rho,T) - theory) is extended {{to the case of}} arbitrary viscosity. For this purpose, Langevin's approach in the theory of Brownian motion, or Kramers' model of chemical reactions, is employed. The obtained expression for the <b>bubbles</b> <b>nucleation</b> rate is valid for arbitrary relations between the kinetic parameters controlling the nucleation process: viscosity, inertia of a liquid, the rate of evaporation into a bubble and the rate of heat exchange between the bubble and ambient liquid. So, the presented theory together with the (V,/rho,T) - theory gives a complete description of the vapor-bubbles nucleation kinetics in one-component liquids. Limiting cases with respect to the mentioned parameters are considered, in particular, the low viscosity limit. It is shown that the low- and high-viscosity nucleation rates differ from each other qualitatively and quantitatively. The possibility of application of the theory to cavitation in superfluid helium- 4 is discussed. Comment: 22 pages, no figure...|$|R

2500|$|The {{conversion}} of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents {{out of the}} container. Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the activation energy for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like <b>bubble</b> <b>nucleation</b> depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (homogeneous nucleation), and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface (heterogeneous nucleation). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form {{on the sides of}} the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy dissolution into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol−1. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water to foam, ultimately generating the [...] "jet"—or [...] "geyser"—or eruption-like nature of the effusion. The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke, and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy, all which influence the nature of water's surface tension and degree to which it can foam.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} kinetics of {{a bubble}} population {{driven by a}} uniform production of gas in a yield-stress fluid matrix is investigated in this paper. The context concerns the long time swelling of bitumen drums in which radioactive salts have been dispersed (salts suspensions in a bitumen matrix). Radioactivity generates uniform volume production of hydrogen by radiolysis of bitumen chains. Since the production rate of gas occurs on very long time scales (more than a hundred years), one needs to develop theoretical models to predict the material swelling. It has been shown previously that bitumen is a yield stress fluid and that, {{in the case of}} a motionless population (no migration due to buoyancy), the yield stress disturbs the classical scenario of <b>nucleation,</b> <b>bubble</b> growth and Ostwald ripening observed in a Newtonian fluid.

50|$|If {{the heating}} process is {{relatively}} slow, the liquid has {{enough time to}} relax to an equilibrium state and the liquid follows the binodal curve, the Clausius-Clapeyron relation is still valid. During this time heterogeneous evaporation occurs in the substance with bubbles nucleating from impurity sites, surfaces, grain boundaries etc. On the other hand, if the heating process is fast enough that the substance cannot reach binodal curve through heterogeneous boiling, the liquid becomes superheated with its temperature above boiling point at a given pressure. System then shifts away from the binodal and continues to follow the red curve and thus approaches towards spinodal. Near the critical temperature thermodynamic properties like specific heat, density varies rapidly as shown on the figure at right. Density and entropy undergoes largest fluctuation. During this time {{it is possible to}} have a large density fluctuation in a very small volume. This fluctuation of density results in the nucleation of a bubble.
