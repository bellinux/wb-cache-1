5000|$|... is tanned using tannins {{and other}} {{ingredients}} found in different vegetable matter, such as tree bark prepared in bark mills, wood, leaves, fruits, and roots. It is supple and brown in color, with the exact shade {{depending on the}} mix of chemicals {{and the color of}} the skin. It is the only form of leather suitable for use in leather carving or stamping. Vegetable-tanned leather is not stable in water; it tends to discolor, so if left to soak and then dried it shrinks and becomes harder. This is a feature of oak <b>bark</b> <b>tanned</b> leather that is exploited in traditional shoemaking. In hot water, it shrinks drastically and partly congeals—becoming rigid, and eventually brittle. Boiled leather is an example of this, where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in hot water, or in boiled wax or similar substances. Historically, it was occasionally used as armour after hardening, and it has also been used for book binding.|$|E
5000|$|Tanning. This was a <b>bark</b> <b>tanning</b> process, {{similar to}} much other tanning.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bark</b> is <b>tan</b> in color, with lenticels on slender stems {{which have}} a pattern {{resembling}} fishbone.|$|R
50|$|Only {{after the}} fall of the customs {{barriers}} and the building of the Rhine-Nahe Railway (1856-1859) was there once again an appreciable economic upswing. Leathermaking began to recover once the tanners, both those using <b>bark</b> <b>tanning</b> and those using mineral tanning, set up shop - sometimes jointly - in the area between the Nahe, the Hahnenbach and the millpond, after traditionally keeping their tanneries along the bank of the Hahnenbach.|$|R
50|$|The state {{consists}} {{mainly of}} an undulating plain, {{with the land}} mostly barren; it is interspersed with rocky hills, especially in the southwest. Granite and laterite are quarried, red ochre is worked, and silk and cotton fabrics, bell-metal vessels and perfumes are among the principal manufactures. There is also some export trade in groundnuts and <b>tanning</b> <b>bark,</b> with the <b>tanning</b> <b>bark</b> used in religious rituals due to its unique texture and scent.|$|R
5000|$|Vogel {{concentrated}} on the leather company (known after 1876 as Pfister & Vogel Leather Co.), eventually building it into the largest leather goods maker in the world. Vogel was the firm's expert on <b>bark</b> <b>tanning,</b> serving as vice-president and general manager. He died on October 23, 1892 aboard a transatlantic steamer during the return leg of a vacation in Europe; he had been ill for some time. The Vogel share of the company passed {{into the hands of}} his sons Frederick Jr. and August H. Vogel.|$|R
50|$|In 1891, Fayette Shaw {{started a}} tannery in Rib Lake, which used tannic acid from locally {{harvested}} hemlock <b>bark</b> to <b>tan</b> hides {{from as far}} away as South America to make leather. The tannery operated until 1923.|$|R
25|$|The {{forest was}} quickly {{turned into a}} {{shrubbery}} area prone to flooding and fires after loggers turned the trees into lumber, shingles, tool handles, and other wood products. Tanneries used the white pine and hemlock <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> leather. The forests were gone by the early 20th century, with some farmers clearing and tilling the land.|$|R
50|$|The valley {{woodlands}} {{were carefully}} managed to produce mature trees for shipbuilding, or by coppicing for charcoal, {{and to provide}} <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning.</b> The valley industries were also massive consumers of timber. A ship of 150 tons, for example, required 3,000 wagonloads of timber to complete - and in 1824, 13 ships were launched at Brockweir alone.|$|R
40|$|Clare Fowler {{grew up on}} Bell Island. She {{spent time}} working in fish plants and other food {{processing}} plants before moving to Ontario in 1999 to do the Chiropody Program at the Michener Institute for Applied Health.  She moved to St. John’s in 2004 and worked for a decade before switching gears and following her passions for art and craft.  She completed the Textile: Craft and Apparel Design program with College of the North Atlantic in 2016 {{and is now a}} full time crafts person and maker with an open studio at the Quidi Vidi Village Craft Plantation.  Her body of work focuses on the use of seal fur and seal leather. We talk about her journey as a craftsperson and maker, her work with seal fur and leather, the craft program at the Anna Templeton Centre in St. John’s, National Seal Products Day, and future work on seal art and documenting and learning <b>bark</b> <b>tanning</b> and sealskin boot making on the Northern Peninsula...|$|R
50|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries {{economic}} {{activities in the}} village included tanning, turnery and coopery. Local timber supplies provided raw materials for these industries, such as oak <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning.</b> Products such as tanned hides, bowls, ladles and cheese vats were sent for sale {{as far away as}} Bristol, and subsidiary trades evolved to support the village's population, which reached 600 in 1851.|$|R
50|$|The vine-culture {{occupied}} {{a space of}} about 30000 acre, about half of {{which was in the}} valley of the Mosel, a third in that of the Rhine itself, and the rest mainly on the Nahe and the Ahr. In the hilly districts more than half the surface was sometimes occupied by forests, and large plantations of oak are formed {{for the use of the}} <b>bark</b> in <b>tanning.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cumberland Valley Railroad {{station in}} Inwood also {{included}} a grain elevator, which ensured {{that much of the}} local agricultural products would be brought to Inwood to be shipped elsewhere. Other products shipped from Inwood via the CVRR were wood products, such as <b>bark</b> (for <b>tanning)</b> and railroad ties from the area west of the town. The station at Inwood {{was one of the most}} profitable stations on the CVRR line.|$|R
50|$|Colours for dyeing muka were sourced from {{indigenous}} materials. Paru (mud high in iron salts) provided black, raurekau bark made yellow, and tānekaha <b>bark</b> made a <b>tan</b> colour. The colours {{were set}} by rolling the dyed muka in alum (potash).|$|R
50|$|Regardless, tourism soon {{shifted to}} the new highest peak, and a local woodsman, Jim Dutcher, who knew the {{mountain}} well from his days peeling hemlock <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning,</b> built a hotel and did a regular business escorting visitors to the summit up a trail he built in 1880. While it runs over privately owned land and has been abandoned since 1941 save for the final section leading across the summit ridge from the west, it still exists and can be followed.|$|R
50|$|The {{red cross}} {{on the silver}} field refers to the municipality’s centuries-long history with the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. The wavy blue pallet (narrow {{vertical}} stripe) symbolizes {{the source of the}} river Alf. The green oakleaf refers to the interpretation of the placename as meaning “mountain forest”, and also to the harvest of oak <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> in the rural cadastral area Gebrannter Berg that was once undertaken. The red flame is Saint Brigid’s attribute, thus representing the municipality’s patron saint.|$|R
50|$|After the sawmill closed, the U.S. Leather Company's tannery ran until 1915, using local hemlock <b>bark</b> for its <b>tanning</b> process. And {{more and}} more farmers settled on the {{surrounding}} cut-over lands left by logging. Around 1903 a creamery in town began buying milk from them and selling butter.|$|R
2500|$|Masten {{was founded}} as a lumber mill town in 1905 by Charles W. Sones. Sones owned the mill and town and worked under a {{contract}} with the Union Tanning Company, which needed hemlock <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> leather and also sold hardwoods from the area. The village was served by two railroad lines: the Susquehanna and New York Railroad and the Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad. The railroads passed through many cuts and fills, and the grades built {{at the height of the}} lumber era in Pennsylvania today carry the Old Loggers Path.|$|R
50|$|Krippner {{encouraged}} further Bohemian {{immigration in}} the hope that the colonial regime would reward him. Consequently, in 1866 a second group of Bohemians arrived and in 1873 a third and final bunch. Although Krippner lived at Orewa he kept a strong proprietorial interest in Puhoi and utilised his government contacts to secure money for roadworks in the area: this helped provide employment and immediate cash for the newcomers. Krippner often thought up additional economic sources of income: at his suggestion the Puhoi colonists gathered tanekaha (celery pine) <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> and fungus for the Chinese export market.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} process may have originated from {{the practice of}} pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of Paper Mulberry was particularly valued and high quality paper {{was developed in the}} late Han period using the <b>bark</b> of <b>tan</b> (檀; sandalwood). In the Eastern Jin period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After printing was popularized during the Song dynasty the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.|$|R
5000|$|Most of {{the upper}} {{landscape}} is temperate deciduous forest dominated by sugar maple, American beech, and red oak. At one time, the forests had much more eastern hemlock, but this was logged out to produce <b>bark</b> for the <b>tanning</b> industry. [...] Now, large hemlock stands are uncommon. Most forests are less than a century old.|$|R
5000|$|The major early {{industry}} was {{the production of}} sawlogs, lumber, and shingles. [...] Large sawmills were at Medford and Rib Lake. Medford, Perkinstown and Rib Lake had tanneries, which used local hemlock <b>bark</b> in the <b>tanning</b> process. Whittlesey had an early brickyard. [...] Industry has diversified since, into creameries, window manufacturers, plastics, and food processing - mostly at Medford.|$|R
5000|$|D. bholua var. {{gracilis}} 'Ghurka' [...] - [...] this variety {{was collected}} as seed on the Milke Danda ridge, Nepal, at around 3200 m; {{it is particularly}} tolerant of low temperatures, becoming deciduous at temperatures below about -10 °C. 'Ghurka' has a distinctive bright <b>tan</b> <b>bark,</b> with mauve-purple buds that open to pale pink flowers; it flowers between January and March.|$|R
50|$|With a large {{natural harbour}} {{at the mouth}} of Twenty Creek, Jordan and Jordan Station became busy {{shipping}} centres for the export of logs for masts, <b>tan</b> <b>bark,</b> hides, ashes used in industrial centres for the manufacture of soap, as well as grain, flour, fruit and fruit products. A small ship building industry existed for a time {{on the banks of the}} Twenty.|$|R
5000|$|He is Hailed as the [...] "Leather king" [...] for {{the virtue}} of his {{knowledge}} and experience in various grades of East India Tanned Leather. He owned and managed 27 tanneries in India and over 100 Raw Skin purchasing centers throughout India, <b>Tanning</b> <b>bark</b> and Myrobalam. There were branches at Rangoon, Mandalay, Singapore, Surabaya and sales branches at Japan and England.|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} East Indian leather {{industry}} a search {{was made for}} <b>tan</b> <b>barks</b> and other <b>tanning</b> products, and their suitability and productivity per ha were assessed. At first (1917 - 1924) the study concentrated on tanning products already locally used, including those from mangrove forest, but considered also some promising local and exotic (some well known) products. For all species considered botanical data, geographic distribution and, where possible, information on bark production and quality, and on culture of the trees were discussed. Other topics were trade in leather and tanning substances in the Netherlands East Indies, trade in mangrove bark and catch and tanned hides in the Malayan Straits Settlements, leather dressing and working in the Netherlands East Indies, research on tanning substances, experiments on practical tanning and on methods of collecting bark. Finally followed the main conclusions for supply of tanning substances for the home industry. An appendix included {{a key to the}} tree species of mangrove forest...|$|R
5|$|Farming has {{traditionally}} been the basis of Cardiganshire's economy, with dairying and stock-rearing being the main occupations. Before the first railway was built in 1866, the stock used to be herded over the mountains to England, where Rugby, Northampton and London were important destinations. At one {{time there was a}} sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire, but the reserves of lead, silver and zinc became unprofitable to mine by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Shipping was also important in the county, with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels, and mineral ores and oak <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> being exported. Shipbuilding was an important industry with most of Wales' sailing vessels being built in Cardiganshire.|$|R

25|$|Hunter, unlike Slide, {{was located}} close to {{settlements}} and saw considerable exploitation of its forest resources. Retired Colonel William Edwards {{was so successful}} harvesting hemlock <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> during the mid-19th century {{in what is now}} the ski area that not only was the ridge named the Colonel's Chair in his honor, the village of Hunter was briefly renamed Edwardsville. On {{the other side of the}} mountain, the West Virginia-based Fenwick Lumber Company logged Hunter and Southwest Hunter so thoroughly between 1903 and 1917 that it is hard to find virgin forest anywhere in the lands they once owned. Some of the roads and railroads they built on the mountains still serve as trails today, and other remnants of their operations are in the nearby woods.|$|R
50|$|The city of Leeuwarden, Friesland, the Netherlands has had {{at least}} 130 {{windmills}} over the centuries. Only one, the Froskepôlemolen survives today within Leeuwarden. Six other mills which have stood in Leeuwarden survive elsewhere in the Netherlands. The mills had {{a wide range of}} industrial and agricultural uses. The industrial uses include the processing of <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> leather, the fulling of cloth, the production of cement, the production of dyes, the extraction of oil (including the production of paints), the grinding of tobacco to produce snuff, the production of gunpowder, and the sawing of timber. Agricultural uses include the milling of buckwheat, oats, rye and wheat, the processing of chicory, the production of pearl barley, and the pumping of water.|$|R
5000|$|The {{houses were}} {{constructed}} on mostly open land opposite the southern {{walls of the}} castle, between 1805 and 1822, by an unknown builder or builders probably in two stages. [...] In 1816, the row, not yet completed, was named as Castle Parade, and the street which had previously been known as St Anne's Street was renamed Bridge Street to mark {{the opening of the}} new Wye bridge {{at the foot of the}} hill. The terrace was built at a time when Chepstow was a prosperous and developing port, particularly for the export of timber and <b>bark</b> (for <b>tanning),</b> used by the British navy. At one time there was a local tradition that every bow-windowed house in the terrace was occupied by a sea captain.|$|R
60|$|Haywood {{walked down}} into the village. He was human, after all, and his {{prospective}} millions weighed upon him. Wealth had wreaked upon him its direfullest. He {{was the product of}} private tutors. Even under his first hobby-horse had <b>tan</b> <b>bark</b> been strewn. He had been born with a gold spoon, lobster fork and fish-set in his mouth. For which I hope, later, to submit justification, I must ask your consideration of his haberdashery and tailoring.|$|R
5000|$|The January 1888 {{issue of}} Orchard and Garden {{mentions}} the American chestnut as being [...] "superior in quality to any found in Europe."The wood is straight-grained, strong, {{and easy to}} saw and split, and it lacks the radial end grain found on most other hardwoods. The tree was particularly valuable commercially since it grew {{at a faster rate}} than oaks. Being rich in tannins, the wood was highly resistant to decay and therefore used for a variety of purposes, including furniture, split-rail fences, shingles, home construction, flooring, piers, plywood, paper pulp, and telephone poles. Tannins were also extracted from the <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> leather. Although larger trees are no longer available for milling, much chestnut wood has been reclaimed from historic barns to be refashioned into furniture and other items.|$|R
5000|$|The region, {{historically}} {{known as}} [...] "Kingsborough", {{was acquired by}} Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet. In 1752, Arent Stevens bought land. Puritans from New England settled {{there at the end}} of the 18th century. The proximity of hemlock forests to supply <b>bark</b> for <b>tanning</b> made the community a center of leather production early in its history. It earned its name for being the center of the American glovemaking industry for many years. Upon the establishment of a United States post office in 1828, [...] "Gloversville" [...] became the official name of the community. Prior to that Gloversville had been known as [...] "Stump City" [...] because of the large number of trees that had been cut down. In 1890-1950, 90% of all gloves sold in the United States - were made in Gloversville.|$|R
