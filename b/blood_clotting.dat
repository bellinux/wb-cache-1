5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components. Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
5|$|The bat’s saliva, {{left in the}} victim's {{resulting}} bite wound, has a key {{function in}} feeding from the wound. The saliva contains several compounds that prolong bleeding, such as anticoagulants that inhibit <b>blood</b> <b>clotting,</b> and compounds that prevent the constriction of blood vessels near the wound.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses <b>blood</b> <b>clotting),</b> {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these. The disease may be complicated by raised intracranial pressure, which may warrant surgical intervention such as the placement of a shunt.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>clots</b> are a {{relatively}} common occurrence {{in the general}} population and are seen in approximately 1-2% of the population by age 60.

A very small number of people who develop <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> have a more serious and often life-threatening condition, known as Thrombotic Storm (TS). TS is characterized by the development of more than one <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> {{in a short period of}} time. These clots often occur in multiple and sometimes unusual locations in the body and are often difficult to treat. TS may be associated with an existing condition or situation that predisposes a person to <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> such as injury, infection, or pregnancy.

5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States.

These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} behind RVT is {{no different}} from other types of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> {{in other parts of the}} body. Rudolf Virchow, was the first to describe the physiological mechanism behind venous thrombosis (<b>blood</b> <b>clots)</b> using three related factors, known as Virchow's Triad; damage to the blood vessel (endothelial damage), decrease in blood flow (stasis) and increased coagulability of the blood (thrombophilia or hypercoagulability). it is possible for one of these factors alone to cause a <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> but in most cases, a combination or all of these factors induce the formation of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot.</b> Decreased urine output or renal function may be the only observable symptoms caused by a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> renal vein. Other less common causes include hypercoagulable state, invasion by renal cell cancer, renal transplantation, behcet syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or blunt trauma to the back or abdomen.|$|R
25|$|Thrombosis prevention, {{also known}} as {{thrombosis}} prophylaxis, are treatments to prevent the formation of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> inside a <b>blood</b> vessel. Some people are at a higher risk {{for the formation of}} <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> than others. Prevention measures or interventions are usually begun after surgery as people are at higher risk due to immobility. There are medication-based interventions and non-medication-based interventions. The risk of developing <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> can be modified by life style modifications, the discontinuation of oral contraceptives, and weight loss. In those at high risk both interventions are often used. The treatments to prevent the formation of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> is balanced against the risk of bleeding.|$|R
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (<b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

40|$|The {{first step}} in bone healing is forming a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> at injured bones. During bone implantation, {{biomaterials}} unavoidably come into direct contact with blood, leading to a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation on its surface prior to bone regeneration. Despite both situations being similar in forming a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> at the defect site, most research in bone tissue engineering virtually ignores {{the important role of}} a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in supporting healing. Dental implantology has long demonstrated that the fibrin structure and cellular content of a peri-implant clot can greatly affect osteoconduction and de novo bone formation on implant surfaces. This paper reviews the formation of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> during bone healing in related to the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gels. It is implicated that PRP gels are dramatically altered from a normal clot in healing, resulting conflicting effect on bone regeneration. These results indicate that the effect of clots on bone regeneration depends on how the clots are formed. Factors that influence <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> structure and properties in related to bone healing are also highlighted. Such knowledge is essential for developing strategies to optimally control <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation, which ultimately alter the healing microenvironment of bone. Of particular interest are modification of surface chemistry of biomaterials, which displays functional groups at varied composition for the purpose of tailoring blood coagulation activation, resultant clot fibrin architecture, rigidity, susceptibility to lysis, and growth factor release.
