EPTC degradation was not affected in Scottsbluff soil following three annual carbofuran (2, 3 -dihydro- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 7 -benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) applications, but was partially enhanced in Clay Center soil. The reversion rate of soil enhanced for EPTC degradation was gradual and varied with location, year, {{and number of}} prior EPTC applications. <b>Butylate</b> degradation was normal or only partially enhanced in soil previously treated with EPTC compared to previously untreated soil and soil previously treated with <b>butylate.</b> Self- and cross- enhanced degradation of EPTC and <b>butylate</b> did not change regardless of number of prior annual applications of either herbicide. ^ The {{degradation rate}}s of EPTC and <b>butylate</b> were not affected by pretreating soil with <b>butylate</b> sulfone, but were enhanced by pretreating soil with the sulfoxides of each herbicide. ^ Rotation of EPTC + dietholate; (O,O-diethyl O-phenyl phosphorothioate) and EPTC + fonofos (O-ethyl S-phenyl ethylphosphonodithioate) in soils with three prior annual treatments of each combination did not improve weed control compared to continuous use. SC- 0058 S-ethyl di-(3 -chlorallyl) thiocarbamate was effective in slowing EPTC degradation in soils pretreated with EPTC, EPTC + dietholate, EPTC + fonofos, or EPTC + SC- 0058.

The role of nucleotide excision repair, the SOS response, and the adaptive response in both the reduction and the production of the biological effects of these chemicals was tested. The effects of ethyl-nitrosoguanidine are similar in nucleotide excision repair-proficient and -deficient strains, but both the mutagenicity and the toxicity of alkyl groups larger than two carbons are significantly reduced by the presence of this repair system. Similarly, when alkyl groups are larger than two carbons, the umuC gene product is essential for the production of a fraction of the mutations that these lesions produce.

40|$|Purple nutsedge Cyperus rotundus is an {{important}} weed in cotton (Gossypium spp.) production in Arizona. It is estimated that 15 % of the crop acreage is infested. The technology available for selective control of purple nutsedge is not adequate and the infestation level of this weed is increasing. In 1986, the thiocarbamate herbicides, vernolate (Surpass), EPTC (Eptam, Genep) and <b>butylate</b> (Swan +, Genate plus) were evaluated as preplant and postemergence incorporated applications for selective control of purple nutsedge in cotton. There were 25 different trials conducted in Arizona cotton fields. <b>Butylate</b> was more selective to seedling cotton than EPTC and vernolate but all were capable of unacceptable cotton injury. Where preplant irrigations require every furrow irrigation, this concentrated the thiocarbamates in the seed row and resulted in less selectivity. Preplant treatments controlled purple nutsedge for 1 or 2 postemergence irrigations. Postemergence applications were most effective following preplant treatments but were not consistent in controlling nutsedge season -long. This research indicates that purple nutsedge lowered yields only when the cotton was stunted in growth by severe early season infestations. Wherever cotton established dominance over the weeds, yields were not affected.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{nitrogen}} fertilizers and selected pesticides on {{the persistence of}} soil-applied herbicides alachlor, <b>butylate,</b> and atrazine, and the insecticide carbofuran were evaluated in laboratory and field experiments. Nitrogen fertilizer had a greater effect on pesticide persistence in a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (Typic Argiudoll) at pH 5. 8 than at pH 6. 7. Persistence of alachlor and carbofuran increased with ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate concentrations in soil. Urea had less effect on alachlor and <b>butylate</b> persistence than nitrogen salts at pH 6. 7. At pH 5. 8 carbofuran degraded more rapidly in urea amended soil than in untreated soil, while urea increased carbofuran persistence at pH 6. 7. Sodium chloride applied {{at the same rate}} as nitrogen increased pesticide persistence, but the effect was less than that of the nitrogen salts. A strong inverse correlation existed between pesticide persistence and soil pH changes due to addition of ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and urea. Changes in soil pH alone did not account for all observed differences in pesticide degradation. Sodium chloride and sodium nitrate treatments lowered soil pH slightly yet differed in effects on pesticide degradation. Atrazine persistence was not affected by nitrogen fertilizers in the Sharpsburg silty clay loam at pH 5. 8 or 6. 8. <b>Butylate</b> persistence was not affected by simultaneous nitrogen application, but persistence increased when nitrogen was applied several days before the herbicide. ^ Carbofuran persistence was increased by the presence of 2, 4 -D in laboratory incubation studies. Terbufos and glyphosate decreased alachlor persistence and <b>butylate</b> increased atrazine persistence in the laboratory incubation studies. These interactions were not confirmed in field studies conducted at two locations with differing soil properties. Pesticide-pesticide and pesticide-fertilizer interactions appeared to be dependent on initial soil pH and form and rate of nitrogen fertilizers. Other variables may include microbial populations, osmotic potential, and organic amendments. Predictions of pesticide-fertilizer and pesticide-pesticide interactions may be difficult without site-specific measurements. ...|$|E

Three preemergence treatments followed by hand weeding or a directed application of paraquat were compared to systems in which the hand weeding was done first and then the preemergence herbicides were directed in cassava 40 days old. Three hand weedings or 3 directed paraquat applications were also included. Best results (highest yields) were obtained when diuron was applied either before or after a hand weeding and when the traditional system of 3 hand weedings was used.

The male courtship behaviour was high-speed video-recorded and analysed. The {{costs and benefits}} of male-male sexual approaches were evaluated. Concerning host-seeking behaviour, the P. concolor innate preferences for different hosts or visual cues were investigated, as well as its ability to prefer a given stimulus after a training experience (i. e. sensitization, associative learning). As regards to olfactory cues, the parasitoid preferences for different tephritid-infested fruits were tested using still-air arenas. The behavioural responses of the parasitoid under choice-conditions were analyzed comparing different fruits (both healthy and infested) and specially made fruit dummies. Volatiles emitted by healthy and medfly-infested fruits were SPME-sampled and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The attractiveness of the identified volatiles was assessed and their electrophysiological activity was analyzed through gas-chromatography coupled with electroantennography (GC-EAD). P. concolor preferred infested peaches and apples over healthy ones, either when visual and olfactory or only olfactory cues were given. Nine compounds were found as exclusive of infested peaches, with respect to healthy ones, and seven of them evoked electrophysiological responses. In apples only quantitative changes in volatile emissions were observed after the medfly infestation. The emissions of 1 -butyl <b>butylate,</b> 1 -hexyl acetate and 1 -butyl esanoate increased in infested apples, whereas 1 -hexyl (E) - 2 -methyl butenoate decreased significantly. Among apple volatiles, 1 -butyl <b>butylate,</b> 2 -methyl- 1 -butyl acetate, 1 -hexyl acetate, 2 -methyl- 1 -butyl 2 -methylbutanoate, 1 -butyl hexanoate and 1 -hexyl (E) - 2 -methyl butenoate elicited responses in female antennae. Synthetic blends reproducing the odors emitted by infested peaches and apples elicited strong attraction towards P. concolor females. For both fruits, the blend attractiveness was mainly due to some specific electrophysiological active chemicals: ethyl octanoate, decanal and 4 -decanolide for peach, and 1 -butyl <b>butylate</b> and 1 -butyl hexanoate for apple. The responses induced by the identified fruit volatiles to P. concolor females allow us to suppose that they play a role as short-range kairomones during host location and, therefore, have the potential to improve biological control programs.

This technique involves passing 100 milliliters of sample water through a 3 cm pre-column, packed with 5 micron ODS sorbent, at flow rates varying from 5 - 10 mUmin. By the use of a valve apparatus, the HPLC system is then switched to a gradient mobile phase program consisting of acetonitrile and water. The analytes, Propoxur, Carbofuran, Carbaryl, Propham, Captan, Chloropropham, Barban, and <b>Butylate,</b> which are pre-concentrated on the pre-column, are eluted and separated on a 25 cm C- 8 analytical column and determined by UV absorption at 220 nm. The total analytical time is 60 minutes, and the pre-column can be used repeatedly for the analysis of as many as thirty samples. The method is highly sensitive as 100 percent of the analytes present in the sample can be injected into the HPLC. No breakthrough of any of the analytes was observed and the minimum detectable concentrations range from 10 to 480 ng/L. The developed method is totally automated for the analysis of one sample. When the above mobile phase is modified with a buffer solution, Aminocarb, Benomyl, and its degradation product, MBC, can also be detected along with the above pesticides with baseline resolution for all of the analytes. The method can also be easily modified to determine Benomyl and MBC both as solute and as particulate matter. By using a commercially available solid phase extraction cartridge, in lieu of a pre-column, for the extraction and concentration of analytes, a completely automated method has been developed with the aid of the Waters Millilab Workstation. Sample water is loaded at 10 mL/min through a cartridge and the concentrated analytes are eluted from the sorbent with acetonitrile. The resulting eluate is blown-down under nitrogen, made up to volume with water, and injected into the HPLC. The total analytical time is 90 minutes. Fifty percent of the analytes present in the sample can be injected into the HPLC, and recoveries for the above eight pesticides ranged from 84 to 93 percent. The minimum detectable concentrations range from 20 to 960 ng/L. The developed method is totally automated for the analysis of up to thirty consecutive samples. The method has proven to be applicable to both purer water samples as well as untreated lake water samples...|$|E
