25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised that it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, {{one of the group}} members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, {{in a manner similar to}} the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
500|$|In March 1993, {{military}} incursions by Azeri {{forces and}} artillery barrages {{were reported to}} have been coming from the region, prompting military leaders to announce an offensive against the rayon. [...] However, a different reason was given by the Armenians' most successful commander of the conflict, Monte Melkonian. [...] According to Melkonian, the commander of the southern front in Martuni (Khojavend), the decision to take the town was a matter of certainty rather than choice. He stated, [...] "This is a historical issue... of course this is historical Armenia... And we'll vindicate that reality [...] with our guns. Unfortunately! It would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> the Azeris would understand that reality is reality, agree and say OK, it's yours, and that's that." [...] Questioned on the possibility of a large expulsion of civilians if the region was captured, Melkonian responded, [...] "A lot of blood has been spilled on both sides... The emotions are high and that isn't conducive to living together in near or medium future." ...|$|E
500|$|Flower was {{developed}} as a spiritual successor to Flow, a 2006 Flash game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the University of Southern California. Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature".|$|E

500|$|After Thomas G. W. Settle's record {{flight in}} the Piccards Century of Progress, the balloon was again {{returned}} to the Piccards, who decided to fly it to the stratosphere on their own. Jean would concentrate on the science, while Jeannette would pilot the balloon. DeVorkin wrote that, [...] "Energetic and forceful, {{she seemed to have}} a better chance of obtaining a pilot's license than Jean, who was preoccupied with restoring the gondola and balloon and convincing scientists to provide instruments to fly". She studied at Ford Airport in Dearborn, Michigan under Edward J. Hill, a balloonist and Gordon Bennett Cup winner, who agreed to serve as flight director for the Piccards' planned stratospheric flight. Henry Ford offered the use of his hangar and brought Orville Wright (with his brother Wilbur, inventor of the airplane and first human to fly a heavier-than-air powered aircraft) to observe a flight of Jeannette's in 1933. Her son Don was a crew member that day and shook hands with Wright, [...] "I was a little kid and he [...] attention to me." [...] On June 16, 1934, Jeannette flew her first solo flight. Later that year, the National Aeronautic Association made her the first woman licensed balloon pilot in the U.S. Auguste wrote to Jean in June 1934, [...] "Hopefully you will make your flight ahead of other competitors. It would <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> <b>if</b> the name of Piccard through Jeannette, would once more be placed on the record list of the F.A.I." ...|$|E
500|$|The next game, Flower, was Chen and Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game {{outside the}} safety net of academia". Chen was the {{creative}} director {{in charge of the}} game, while Santiago was the producer and Clark was the lead designer. The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development. Flower was intended by Chen to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on a [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature." [...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.â€“ including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E

2500|$|A June 27, 1950, {{movie of}} a [...] "flying disk" [...] over Louisville, Kentucky, {{taken by a}} Louisville Courier-Journal photographer, had the USAF Directors of counter{{intelligence}} (AFOSI) and intelligence discussing in memos how to best obtain the movie and interview the photographer without revealing Air Force interest. One memo suggested the FBI be used, then precluded the FBI getting involved. Another memo said [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> OSI could arrange to secure {{a copy of the}} film in some covert manner," [...] but if that wasn't feasible, one of the Air Force scientists might have to negotiate directly with the newspaper. In a recent interview, the photographer confirmed meeting with military intelligence and still having the film in his possession until then, but refused to say what happened to the film after that.|$|E
2500|$|Four {{days after}} the attack, the White House team that visited Beirut, led by Vice President of the United States, George H. W.

Jerry Falwell's [...] "Baptist Fundamentalism '84" [...] convention, in Washington, DC. During the {{delivery}} of the speech, President Reagan was interrupted by a small group of protestors, armed with pre-printed banners, chanting, [...] "Bread, not bombs." [...] Reagan, {{at the height of his}} powers as [...] "the great communicator," [...] deftly handles the situation, at one point commenting, [...] "Wouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> a little bit of that Marine spirit would rub off, and they would listen [...] about brotherly love?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2014, Spirit bassist Mark Andes and a trust {{acting on}} behalf of California filed a {{copyright}} infringement suit against Led Zeppelin and injunction against the [...] "release of the album containing the song" [...] in an attempt to obtain a writing credit for California, who died in 1997. A lack of resources was cited as {{one of the reasons that}} Spirit did not file the suit earlier; according to a friend of California's mother, [...] "Nobody had any money, and they thought the statute of limitations was done ... It will <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> <b>if</b> Randy got the credit." [...] If the Spirit lawsuit had been successful, past earnings due to the songâ€”estimated at more than US$550 millionâ€”would not have been part of the settlement, but the publisher and composers may have been entitled to a share of future profits.|$|E
2500|$|... "She was {{the ideal}} mother", Billingsley {{said of her}} {{character}} in 1997 in TV Guide. [...] "Some people think she was weakish, but I don't. She was the love in that family. She {{set a good example}} for what a wife could be. I had two boys at home when I did the show. I think the character became kind of like me and vice versa. I've never known where one started and where one stopped." [...] As for the idealized TV family on Leave It to Beaver, which continues in reruns on cable {{more than half a century}} after its debut, Billingsley had her own explanation for the Cleavers' enduring appeal. [...] "Good grief," [...] she told TV Guide, [...] "I think everybody would like a family like that.

Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture praised Bianca stating: [...] "Bianca and Rickyâ€™s return {{has been one of the}} best things about [...] in the past year [...] and even when Bianca and co don't have storylines as big as the Whitney/Tony one, they still give good telly." ...|$|E

Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it!
