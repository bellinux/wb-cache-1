500|$|Retta said acting {{during the}} first season was {{stressful}} because it was unclear how long the show would stay on the air, due to the poor reviews and ratings. Likewise, Chris Pratt {{said there was a}} constant feeling among the Parks staff that the show could be canceled at any time: [...] "At the end of season one Parks and Rec, you hug the people really, really fucking tight <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> {{want to go out and}} have fun with your friends and sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Marge {{believes}} she has higher morals {{than most other}} characters, once leading a family values crusade against the violent The Itchy & Scratchy Show and being a prominent member of the [...] "Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene." [...] She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, {{but many of the}} townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her frequent failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms. Marge is {{the only member of the}} family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] (season four, 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him [...] "don't make me choose between my man and my God, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> can't win.". Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with her daughter, Lisa, who is a feminist. For example, in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] (season one, 1990) When she was waiting for Ms. Botz, the babysitter, Bart, Lisa and Maggie asked Marge for some grub, but she quickly refused and they ran away.|$|E
6000|$|I find that, {{classified}} altogether, {{there are}} seventeen reasons advanced in Scotland for taking whiskey. They run as follows: Reason one, {{because it is}} raining; Two, {{because it is not}} raining; Three, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> are <b>just</b> going out into the weather; Four, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have <b>just</b> come in from the weather; Five; no, I forget the ones that come after that. But I remember that reason number seventeen is [...] "because it canna do ye any harm." [...] On the whole, reason seventeen is the best.|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Radio Times in January 2015, Linehan revealed {{that he wanted to}} revive Father Ted as a musical stage production. He stated that he would never revive the television series itself, [...] "because of the risk you poison people's memories of the original", but that the completely new format would make the project worthwhile. Linehan mentioned the possibility of a dance number with [...] "spinning cardinals". He said that the musical would have to reference the Catholic child abuse scandals, stating, [...] "The jokes would have to have a little bit more edge, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> can't ignore this stuff." [...] Mathews was [...] "not as convinced" [...] of the musical idea, though Linehan still insisted it could work.|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E
2500|$|The {{approval}} {{came after}} nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the {{executive vice president of}} Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. [...] Trevino later recalled: [...] "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved." [...] Wallenda later remarked [...] "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> never know [...] ". [...] Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. [...] After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. [...] Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. [...] The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{does not}} advance you much in your inquiry," [...] he went on. [...] "And in truth your {{question}} is unanswerable; but facts have a certain positive value, and I will tell you a fact. One day I met a cornered man. I use the word because it expresses the man's situation exactly, and <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> used it yourself. You know what that means?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{do think}} hardly of you," [...] I said; [...] "and I'll tell you why--not {{so much because}} you refused to give me shelter, or {{regarded}} me as an impostor, as <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> now made it a species of reproach that I had no 'brass' and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; {{and if you are}} a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dave Moody of the Motor Racing Network {{said that}} because fans and drivers don't want NASCAR to show {{discretion}} but enforce down to {{the letter of the}} law, they should [...] "be careful what you wish for. <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> got it." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{conservative}} Democrat by Hawaii standards, Case {{sought to}} change the current way state government operated and repeatedly warned that Hawaii was not addressing long-term fiscal challenges.

But if you have the right contact, maybe you met someone who knows that person, sort of informal channel, then it’s more likely that you can share their data. Still {{there is a lot of}} data sharing that just has to come from direct contacts.” [...]...|$|R

5000|$|Banks' voice, singing style, {{and lyrics}} have been {{strongly}} compared to, most notably, Ian Curtis of Joy Division.

5000|$|In 2008, {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a 1979 video that showed Sergeant Arthur Hutchinson addressing a group of police recruits. He used the terms “ni**ers,” “beaners,” “greasers” and “homos" [...] to describe them.

500|$|In February 1971, after a one off {{performance}} at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs. [...] "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained. [...] "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like.

5000|$|Billionaire Peter Thiel told Dowd “I’m a {{capitalist}}. Star Wars is {{the capitalist}} show. Star Trek is the communist one". He further stated “There {{is no money}} in Star Trek <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have the transporter machine that can make anything you need”. “The whole plot of Star Wars starts with Han Solo having this debt that he owes and so the plot in Star Wars is driven by money.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Thomason {{said about}} the lack of {{character}} transparency in Lost, [...] "That's kind of difficult as an actor, but also freeing in a way, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to play the scenes as they're written. And then if you find out if you're a big villain or whatever, then you play that... you know when that worked really brilliantly? On 24 with Nina Myers. She didn't have a clue - Sarah Clarke, the actress - and that made it really brilliant, because she played Nina honestly. Really honestly. And then she was a villain. Genius. That was such a great one." ...|$|E

5000|$|Carrie Fisher, who in {{addition}} to making headlines as a judge on the FOX show On the Lot is also a highly paid script doctor, tells how she got started re-writing screenplays: [...] "It was Spielberg that asked me to rewrite Hook - just to rewrite Tinker Bell. But that makes no sense <b>because</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>just</b> write one character. There is another character that they speak to. Although, you know, it was Robin’s character mostly, so I would improvise with Robin Williams. Well, he and I do that anyway. So now you have two people that desperately need medication, but it's fine if they're off and you’re taking notes. And {{we had a very}} good time." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to LBT, by syllogizing one's {{behavioral}} and emotional reasoning {{in terms of}} the practical syllogism, one is {{in a better position to}} find one's irrational premises, refute them, and replace the unsound reasoning with sound [...] "antidotal" [...] reasoning. For example, the first premise in the above syllogism is irrational <b>because</b> <b>you</b> are exaggerating <b>just</b> how bad the divorce is (thinking of it as though it were on the level of a catastrophic disease or natural disaster).|$|R
5000|$|Stevie Nicks {{explained}} her {{reluctance to}} record another album with Fleetwood Mac. [...] "Is {{it possible that}} Fleetwood Mac might do another record?

In Louisiana, where pregnant women are already required to view ultrasounds of their fetuses before receiving an abortion, lawmakers proposed a bill that would require them to listen to the embryonic/fetal heartbeat as well. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett drew criticism when he said of his state's new mandatory transvaginal ultrasound law that [...] "You can't make anybody watch, okay? <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> have to close your eyes.

Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. When asked in 2007 about expanding the menu, Steve Ells said, [...] "It's important to keep the menu focused, <b>because</b> if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> do a few things, you can ensure that you do them better than anybody else."
