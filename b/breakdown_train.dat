The headcode used while pulling the special was one disc {{on each side of}} {{the locomotive}}'s smokebox, and a third in the middle of the bufferbeam—a 'V' formation evoking Churchill's 'V for Victory' sign.

25|$|Christmas 1942 saw {{the genesis}} of the {{character}} that grew to become the most famous fictional locomotive in the world. Awdry constructed a toy tank engine for Christopher, which gained the name Thomas. Stories about Thomas were requested by Christopher, and 1946 saw the publication of Thomas the Tank Engine. This was illustrated by Reginald Payne, whom Wilbert felt to be a great improvement over Middleton. Like its predecessor, this book was a success and Awdry was asked to write stories about James, a character who first appeared in Thomas and the <b>Breakdown</b> <b>Train,</b> the final story in Thomas the Tank Engine. The book James the Red Engine appeared in 1948, the year in which the railways in Britain were nationalised, and from this point onwards the Fat Director was known by his familiar title of the Fat Controller.|$|E

50|$|A {{goods train}} had left Toowoomba {{on the night}} of 29 January 1913, and had derailed near the Murphys Creek railway station on the Main line, about one mile from the station yard limits, on the range side near the 84-mile (139 km) mark. No members of the crew were injured, but a {{considerable}} amount of damage was caused to the goods vehicles and the track. A breakdown gang was sent from Toowoomba and <b>breakdown</b> <b>trains</b> were also despatched from Brisbane and Toowoomba to clear wreckage from the line. The spot where the derailment had taken place was in a relatively inaccessible area and workers had to prise the wreckage apart. Several trips were made by <b>breakdown</b> <b>trains</b> to the derailment site.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the maintenance of}} all locomotives, some Bahnbetriebswerke are also responsible for looking after special duty trains. The most important units are <b>breakdown</b> <b>trains</b> (for re-railing derailed rolling stock) and rotary snow ploughs. There are also fire fighting trains to enable fires in the area to be put out as quickly as possible. And for the smooth running of a Bahnbetriebswerk tractors and shunters are needed in order to move wagons and locomotives that are unable to move under their own power. Finally almost every Bahnbetriebswerk has a variety of special vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were all}} still providing good reliable service when {{the class was}} withdrawn en-bloc during November and December 1962, apparently {{as part of an}} accountancy exercise 'to keep in line with the Southern Regions' withdrawal programme'. Most spent several months in store at Hove railway station before being broken up, and at least one had to be briefly resurrected to help run <b>breakdown</b> <b>trains</b> during the severe Winter of 1962-1963. [...] The early Bluebell Railway had hoped to purchase one example for preservation, but could not afford to do so since the time when they were available coincided with the years when all money had to be channelled into the purchase of the freehold of the line.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in Mt Darwin District of Zimbabwe to {{evaluate}} the sustainability of a rural water supply project in terms of reliability of the system, local institutional, and human capacity development, as well as financing mechanisms. Study methods included focus group discussions, questionnaires, and field observations. Some 38 % of the boreholes studied were not functioning. The average downtime for the boreholes was 3 weeks. Water Point Committees (WPCs) existed and functioned for all boreholes and, in 90 % of the cases, the community made contributions for operation and maintenance only when there was a <b>breakdown.</b> <b>Trained</b> personnel were perceived to have inadequate skills. It was concluded that the average downtime was long compared to recommended durations. WPCs appeared functional while the financing mechanisms were found to be poor for effective maintenance of boreholes. In future projects, training should be prolonged and user payment for maintenance encouraged. Key words: boreholes, financing mechanisms, human capacity development, institutional capacity...|$|R

40|$|The most {{recognized}} and powerful demonstration of electrostatics {{in the natural}} world is a lightning discharge. The misoperation of several equipment and circuits would not only be caused by a direct contact with the lightning flash, but also by an indirect effect of a lightning channel. Appropriate information about lightning signature parameters can provide precise knowledge of lightning discharge that can be essential for the design of more improved detection and protective system. In this paper, the preliminary <b>breakdown</b> pulse <b>train</b> and the first return stroke of cloud to ground lightning discharge signatures observed in south of Malaysia are analyzed. Statistical analyses of the ratio between the maximum preliminary <b>breakdown</b> pulse <b>trains</b> amplitude and the first return stroke amplitude (BP/RS ratio), and the time duration between the high active part of the pulse train, and the return stroke (BP/RS separation) are presented. Observations on the statistical analyses show that about 94 % of lightning signals have detectable breakdown pulses. The arithmetic means of BP/RS ratio and the BP/RS separation are 36. 3 % and 26. 4 ms, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A hundred {{lightning}} flash {{was observed}} in Padang city, West Sumatera at January until Mei 2013. The lightning that use to analyze is proceeding with preliminary <b>breakdown</b> pulse (PBP) <b>train</b> and followed by first negative return stroke (RS). Fast antenna capacitive was used to record electric field that produced of lightning flash. PBP-RS separation and pre-return stroke duration was used to analyze. Arithmetic and geometric mean of PPB-RS separation is 50, 62 ms and 31, 73 ms respectively. Arithmetic and geometric mean of pre-return stroke duration is 54, 44 ms and 33, 92 ms respectively. We have find two type of preliminary <b>breakdown</b> pulse <b>train</b> are; (1) the pulse train that dominant positive pulse at first half cycle (2) the pulse train that dominant negative pulse at first half cycle. The first type of pulse train have the PPB-RS separation and pre-return stroke duration that longer than the second type.
