5000|$|The Color StyleWriter 2500 was a {{performance}} color inkjet printer manufactured and sold by Apple in 1996. It {{was based on}} a Canon-developed <b>Bubble</b> <b>Jet</b> <b>printer,</b> but was repackaged with a new housing, firmware, and Apple's proprietary 8-pin mini-DIN serial port. The printer is similar in appearance and functionality to the StyleWriter 2400, but featured faster printing speeds: 5 PPM black, 0.66 color, vs the 2400's 3 PPM black, 0.3 color. As with the 2400, the 2500 was compatible with the Apple Pippin console gaming system. Apple offered LocalTalk and EtherTalk networking upgrades in the form of external print server devices. Also offered was a [...] "PhotoGrade" [...] kit, which included a special monobloc (heads and ink in one unit) cartridge with lighter photo-oriented inks and coated paper.|$|E
50|$|The Color StyleWriter Pro was a color {{inkjet printer}} {{manufactured}} and sold by Apple in 1994. It {{was based on}} the Canon BJC-600 series of <b>Bubble</b> <b>Jet</b> <b>printers,</b> with which it shares ink cartridge compatibility. Its distinguishing feature among Color StyleWriter printers is its use of separate ink cartridges for each of three colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) plus black. In contrast, other Color StyleWriters used a combined color cartridge plus a black cartridge.|$|R

In other words, this invention enables one to inkjet print a food-grade color photograph on a birthday cake's surface. Many bakeries now carry {{these types of}} decorations, which are printable using edible inks and dedicated inkjet printers. Edible ink printing can be done using normal home use inkjet <b>printers</b> like Canon <b>Bubble</b> <b>Jet</b> <b>printers</b> with edible ink cartridges installed, and using rice paper or frosting sheets.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the colour}} of parts {{made by the}} Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process depends on the colour of the {{material}} used. SLS cannot make multiple coloured prototypes because only homogeneous powder (or powder composites) can be used during the process. In this paper, an ink-jet based mechanism is designed to print multiple colours onto the prototypes. The surface tension of conventional ink used in <b>bubble</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printers</b> is so high that it cannot penetrate into the SLS powders. To reduce the surface tension, ethanol is added to it. The ratio of ink to ethanol for necessary penetration is determined by experiments. This paper {{will go on to}} describe how the ink affects the structure of SLS materials. The effect of temperature on the penetration of ink into powders will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{exponential}} growth of microelectrome-chanical systems (MEMS) {{in a variety}} of technological applications has provided impetus for the development of energy conversion methods directly related to the operation of these systems. It is often the case that this conversion should produce at the end mechanical work, as needed, for example, for the operation of micropumps, microactuators, microswitches and micro-valves,) all already popular MEMS applications. In this lecture, the employment of microheaters to induce explosive vaporization of a liquid and through this vaporization to achieve direct conversion from electrical to thermal and to mechanical energy, is discussed with the help of two microheater geometries: a rectangular film heater of the kind widely used in <b>bubble</b> <b>jet</b> <b>printers</b> and an ultrathin platinum wire. The measurement results presented are based on two recent papers by Poulikakos and co-workers [1, 2]. The obvious advantage of the above mentioned energy conversion process lies in its simplicity: No complicated (micro-) machinery is involved, as a matter of fact, n...|$|R
50|$|South Africans Philip Copeman and Michael Cartwright {{worked on}} {{redesigning}} the product. Roy Abrams and Philip Copeman introduced {{it to the}} United Kingdom markets as TurboCAD in late 1986. This release was made under the brand Pink Software, with other stake holders; John Glennie, Digby Prior, and Janine Copeman. Support was added for more video cards (EGA, Olivetti, etc.), input devices (Summagraphics digitizer, and later, the first Microsoft Mouse). The cost was £99. TurboCAD was a DOS product with limited device support, whereas Generic CADD was strong in this area. The turning point for the product came after Martin Sacks, the first US distributor, {{was able to get}} Digby Prior, a ton of plotters and printers, and a driver writing utility in the same room in Los Angeles. Sacks also created the first CAD symbols included with the product. Initially, {{in order to be able}} to support dot matrix printers, FPlot was sold as an add-on to TurboCAD. Later, TurboCAD included native printer drivers for a variety of dot matrix, <b>bubble</b> <b>jet,</b> and laser <b>printers.</b> During this period, Rob Berry began working on the product as a Technical Writer.|$|R

40|$|Retinal {{photography}} and angiography {{is the process}} of documenting a person 2 ̆ 7 s retina, the inside lining of the eye, using a specially designed camera. Traditionally, these images have been recorded on both color slide and black and white film. Recent technological advances in electronic /digital imaging have led to new means of recording these retinal images. These images may be viewed on a computer monitor, but typically these images are printed to a high resolution /addressability output device. By utilizing a high resolution /addressability ink <b>jet</b> <b>printer</b> {{it may be possible to}} produce output of these images at a quality equal to those produced by a dye sublimation printer. This thesis project investigates the possibility that a 720 x 720 dots per inch ink <b>jet</b> <b>printer</b> can be used as an alternative to a far more expensive 300 dots per inch black and white dye sublimation printer. A total of two different retinal angiograms were printed on each device. The standard output from the dye sublimation printer was judged with three different substrates from the ink <b>jet</b> <b>printer,</b> plain paper, coated paper, and photographic quality paper. Each angiogram has four separate pages. These pages are 8. 5 inches x 11 inches with 1, 4, 9, and 16 images per page. Each page was printed on the follow substrates: Kodak Ektatherm print paper, Hammermill plain paper, Canon HR 101 high resolution paper, and Kodak Photographic Quality Ink Jet Paper. The study involved visual evaluation of the images by fifteen ophthalmologists experienced at looking at and interpreting angiograms. Under standard /normal viewing conditions, the fifteen judges compared the four pages (1 up, 4 up, 9 up and 16 up) generated from the Kodak dye sublimation printer and the identical images printed on the Canon BJC 620 ink <b>jet</b> <b>printer</b> on the three different substrates. They judged each series and rated each output acceptable or unacceptable for use in the following areas: diagnosis and treatment, chart copy, and referral copy. Their evaluations were recorded using a response sheet. The results of this experiment are be shown as a percentage of acceptable or unacceptable for each substrate and image layout (1 up, 4 up, 9 up and 16 up) ...|$|R
