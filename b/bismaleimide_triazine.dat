40|$|High-Q copper {{inductors}} were fabricated on low-cost and low-loss <b>bismaleimide</b> <b>triazine</b> (BT) {{and glass}} substrate using electroplating process. A differential LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) circuit was designed using these high-Q inductors at 2. 4 GHz. Flip chip and multichip module (MCM) technologies {{were applied to}} assemble the active chips on BT and glass substrate. The inductors exhibited Q-factor as high as 25 at 2. 4 GHz. VCOs with copper inductors on BT and glass substrate had phase noise of - 108 dBc/Hz at 600 kHz offset for a 2. 4 -GHz carrier, which is 6 -dB improvement compared with the one with on-chip Al inductors. There was almost no substrate loss for inductors on BT and glass substrates. The effect of fabrication defects and solder joint resistance were also investigated. This technique can be extended to other building blocks, thus realizing integration of the whole RF system...|$|E
40|$|Woven glass fabric/BT (<b>bismaleimide</b> <b>triazine)</b> {{composite}} laminate (BT core), copper (Cu), and photoimageable solder resist (PSR) {{are the most}} widely used materials for semiconductors in electronic devices. Among these materials, BT core and PSR contain polymeric materials that exhibit viscoelastic behavior. For this reason, these materials are considered to have time-and temperature-dependent moduli during warpage analysis. However, the thin geometry of multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) film makes it difficult to identify viscoelastic characteristics. In this work, a vibration test method was proposed for measuring the viscoelastic properties of a multilayer PCB film at different temperatures. The beam-shaped specimens, composed of a BT core, Cu laminated on a BT core, and PSR and Cu laminated on a BT core, were used in the vibration test. The frequency-dependent variation of the complex bending stiffness was determined using a transfer function method. The storage modulus (E&# 39;) of the BT core, Cu, and PSR as a function of temperature and frequency were obtained, and their temperature-dependent variation was identified. The obtained properties were fitted using a viscoelastic model for the BT core and the PSR, and a linear elastic model for the Cu. Warpage of a line pattern specimen due to temperature variation was measured using a shadow Moire analysis and compared to predictions using a finite element model. The results provide information on the mechanism of warpage, especially warpage due to temperature-dependent variation in viscoelastic properties.

40|$|Wire bonding is {{a widely}} used {{interconnection}} technology in electronic packaging. Due to the advantages of fast bonding process, high productivity, good electrical and thermal performance, Au wire bonding has been widely applied to various electronic packaging applications, such as Multi chip module (MCM), B all grid array (BGA) and Chip-on-board (COB). The organic substrates for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) have a low glass transitional temperature, Tg, typically 130 Â°C. This imposes limitations on the wire bonding process because wire bonding must be performed at temperatures far below the Tgof the substrate to avoid softening of the materials. Meanwhile, a substrate with a high Tg incurs additional cost arising from material and fabrication processes. The objective of this thesis is to optimize metallization and process variables to enhance wire bondability and product yields of low temperature Au wedge thermosonic bonding. The wire bond strength with various metallization characteristics were correlated to establish the process window for successful low temperature wire bonding. The technological understanding acquired in this thesis {{can be used as}} a practical guideline for PCB metallization plating and processing conditions. The research was carried out in four stages. The first stage examined the surface characteristics of various metallization schemes on conventional FR- 4 PCBs. The second stage investigated the interrelation between the metallization characteristics and the wire bonding process variables. The third stage studied the improvement in wire bonding by plasma cleaning. The last stage was a study of high temperature wire bonding on <b>Bismaleimide</b> <b>triazine</b> (BT) substrate. Based on the bond tests and process windows established, optimizing bonding parameters for acceptable wire bond strengths at low temperatures were identified. Specific recommendations were made on the optimum surface and elemental characteristics of metallization that can improve wire bondability.
