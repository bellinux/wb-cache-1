5|$|Although {{guarantees}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> {{and organization}} indicated a return for 2007–08, many fans in New Orleans were still skeptical {{of a permanent}} return due to {{the popularity of the}} team in Oklahoma City.

5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>League,</b> the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, the Progressive League {{was plagued}} by {{internal}} conflict between Progressives (former Moderate Conservatives) and Historicals (former Liberals). All of the cabinets formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> after 1862 were short-lived. The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected, increasing tensions within the party. By 1868, a rift had opened between the Marquis of Caxias (then Commander-in-Chief of Brazilian forces in the war) and the Progressive Cabinet. With its credibility for prosecuting the war now vanished, the Cabinet resigned and the Emperor called the Conservatives back into power on 16 July 1868. Once again Paranhos—who was extraordinary member of the Council of State since 18 August 1866—became Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
