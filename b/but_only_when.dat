5|$|Fruiting begins {{about six}} weeks after the initial {{inoculation}} on the agar plate, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow {{very close to the}} initial site of inoculation—within 3mm—and take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{has a duty}} to enforce state laws, and the power to approve or veto bills passed by the Pennsylvania Legislature and to convene the legislature.

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the twelve}} LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, {{but they could not}} be risked further, for without them, the {{reconnaissance}} force could not be evacuated. The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire. Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as glaucoma. It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E

5|$|In March 1864, Dixon {{accompanied}} Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to {{an audience}} with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks {{into the ranks of}} the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession {{was little more than a}} face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the end of the Civil War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Purring {{may have}} {{developed}} as an evolutionary advantage {{as a sign}}alling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr {{as a sign of}} contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound. It was, until recent times, believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr. However, felids of the Panthera genus (tiger, lion, jaguar, and leopard) also produce sounds similar to purring, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> exhaling.|$|E
5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown on the {{aircraft}} carrying the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister {{on a visit}} to a foreign country. Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the train is stationary or approaching a railway station.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} {{conditions}} {{were the most}} controversial, though after {{one and a half}} years, a compromise was reached: only buildings actually in use would be repaired, and pensions would be paid, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the officers actually retired. The British authorities authorised minimal repairs, to be made as cheaply as possible. The transfer was intended to be completed by the end of 1885, but was not finalised until 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern Stormwater Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> {{there is a risk}} of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
5|$|Only Phoronis ovalis {{naturally}} builds colonies by budding or by splitting into top {{and bottom}} sections which then grow into full bodies. In experiments, other species have split successfully, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> both parts have enough gonadal (reproductive) tissue. All phoronids breed sexually from spring to autumn. Some species are hermaphroditic (have {{both male and female}} reproductive organs) but cross-fertilize (fertilize the eggs of other members), while others are dioecious (have separate sexes). The gametes (sperms and ova) are produced in the swollen gonads, around the stomach. The gametes swim through the metacoelom to the metanephridia. Sperm exit by the nephridiopores and some are captured by the lophophores of individuals of the same species. Species that lay small fertilized eggs release them into the water as plankton, while species with larger eggs brood them either in the body's tube or stuck {{in the center of the}} lophophore by adhesive. The brooded eggs are released to feed on plankton when they develop into larvae.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the competition, Jenny Roesler of Cricinfo {{suggested}} England and New Zealand, along with Australia, as the favourites to win the competition. The final was a repeat of the 1993 final, when England won at Lord's. Both sides had won the World Cup previously, <b>but</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> hosting the tournament. New Zealand achieved the feat in 2000, while England were winners in both 1973 and 1993. In addition to losing the 1993 final to England, New Zealand were also finalists in 1997, losing to Australia in India. England had contested five previous finals; losing to Australia in subsequent tournaments in 1978, 1982 and 1988. England all-rounder Gunn aggravated a calf-strain during the warm-up, and was replaced by the team's vice-captain Nicky Shaw, who had previously been omitted from the side. Huw Richards, writing for the International Herald Tribune, described both England and New Zealand as worthy finalists, and noted that he was disappointed with the performance of Australia, who finished fourth.|$|E
