5|$|Pearl's {{favorite}} {{activities are}} socializing at the Bikini Bottom Mall, and using her father's credit card to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> {{that is in}} style. Mr. Krabs disapproves of Pearl's prodigal spending, but nonetheless pays for her items to avoid disappointing his daughter. Pearl is employed as an assistant at Grandma's Apron, a store for elderly residents {{on the ground floor}} of the shopping center. Beatrice, her boss at Grandma's Apron, is voiced by actress Betty White.|$|E
5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The City of Her Dreams is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Ella Brown, who is sent {{to live with her}} aunt who living in a boarding house when her father heads to Alaska to prospect for gold. Ella's life at her aunt's home is miserable and she dreams of going to New York City. She dreams that she is in the city and has all money to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> which she fancies. Then she receives word that her father has returned from Alaska with a fortune and wants to give her everything she wants. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film includes scenes of New York City. The film was released on November 18, 1910 and saw a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is similar}} to {{conspicuous}} consumption except {{that it does not}} involve <b>buying</b> <b>anything.</b> Additionally, rather than showing off wealth, conspicuous expression is used to show off social status.

40|$|Consumers are {{becoming}} increasingly skeptical of marketing promises: {{more and more people}} avoid <b>buying</b> <b>anything</b> unless they first read others' opinion on the Internet. Advertising makeup is no longer effective: consumers no longer listen to the company, but they listen to each other.

25|$|In this theory, {{sovereign}} {{government is}} not financially constrained {{in its ability to}} spend; it is argued that the government can afford to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a debt ceiling law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E

When the ship made its final voyage, it was under-crewed by a third. The ship was decommissioned 18 April 1946. As of 2015, the final fate of the ship has not been determined. There was a huge push to convert the U.S. economy from a war basis to a peace time basis. People were flush with money but could not <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> and people wanted houses and cars.

2500|$|Freeganism is a {{practice}} and ideology of limited {{participation in the}} conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources, particularly through recovering wasted goods like food. The word [...] "freegan" [...] is a portmanteau of [...] "free" [...] and [...] "vegan".

25|$|Some items, such as {{clothes and}} children's toys, often become {{unwanted}} before they wear out due {{to changes in}} their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental freecycling organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the Red Cross, United Way, Salvation Army, and Goodwill which give these items to {{those who could not}} afford them new. Other organizations such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact, whose members promise not to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces landfill inline with the waste minimization program but can help raise money for a good cause.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{had many}} other duties: {{as well as}} acting as a bodyguard, {{he was sent to}} <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> they needed, such as suits, boots, meals, or drinks. If Lennon said [...] "Socks, Mal", Evans would have to rush to a local store and buy pairs of cotton socks for him. In 1967, Evans wrote in his diaries that he [...] "bought Ringo [...] some undies for his visit to the doctor". Although Beatles' memorabilia is in {{continuous}} demand, a full set of autographs by all four could be forgeries: Evans and Aspinall used to sign many of them when Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr were too busy.|$|E
500|$|The 32-song soundtrack {{from the}} film was {{released}} on July 6, 1994. With {{the exception of a}} lengthy suite from Alan Silvestri's score, all the songs are previously released; the soundtrack includes songs from Elvis Presley, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aretha Franklin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Three Dog Night, The Byrds, The Beach Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Doors, The Mamas & the Papas, The Doobie Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Seger, and Buffalo Springfield among others. Music producer Joel Sill reflected on compiling the soundtrack: [...] "We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically." [...] The two-disc album has a variety of music from the 1950s–1980s performed by American artists. According to Sills, this was due to Zemeckis' request, [...] "All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn't <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> but American." ...|$|E

500|$|Nursing {{during the}} war {{provided}} Olga and her sister Tatiana with exposure to experiences they had not previously had. The girls enjoyed talking with fellow nurses at the hospital, women {{they would never have}} met if not for the war, and knew the names of their children and their family stories. On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went into a store where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store. Yet other stories tell of a regular salary of nine dollars the girls received each month, and how they used it to purchase such items as perfume and notepaper. They had also been shopping with their Aunt, Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana ...|$|E
500|$|White {{was only}} able to offer his writers one cent per word, which was {{substantially}} lower than the leading magazines in the field—Analog Science Fiction and Fact paid five cents, and Galaxy and Fantasy & Science Fiction paid three. [...] Most stories would only be submitted to White once the higher-paying markets had rejected them, but among the rejects White was sometimes able to find experimental material that he liked. [...] For example, Piers Anthony {{had been unable to}} sell an early fantasy novel, Hasan; White saw a review of the manuscript and promptly acquired it for Fantastic, where it was serialized starting in the December 1969 issue. [...] White also took care to establish relationships with newer writers. [...] White bought Gordon Eklund's first story, [...] "Dear Aunt Annie", it appeared in the April 1970 issue and was nominated for a Nebula award. [...] Eklund was unwilling to become a full-time writer, despite this success, because of the financial risks, so White agreed to <b>buy</b> <b>anything</b> Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. [...] The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years. [...] In addition to experimental work, White was able to obtain material by some of the leading sf writers of the day, including Brian Aldiss and John Brunner. [...] White also acquired some early work by writers who became better known in other fields: Roger Ebert sold two stories in the early 1970s to Fantastic; the first, [...] "After the Last Mass", appeared in the February 1972 issue; and in 1975 White bought Ian McEwan's second story, [...] "Solid Geometry". [...] It was included in First Love, Last Rites, McEwan's first short story collection, which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|The {{universal}} {{currency in}} Kongo {{and just about}} all of Central Africa was shell money known locally as nzimbu. One hundred nzimbu could purchase a hen; 300 a garden hoe and 2000 a goat. Slaves, which were always a part of Kongo's economy but increased in trade after contact with Portugal were also bought in nzimbu. A female slave could be purchased (or sold) for 20,000 nzimbu and male slave for 30,000. Nzimbu shells were collected from the island of Luanda and kept as a royal monopoly. The smaller shells were filtered out so that only the large shells entered the marketplace as currency. The Kongo would not trade for gold or silver, but nzimbu shells, often put in pots in special increments, could <b>buy</b> <b>anything.</b> Kongo's [...] "money pots" [...] held increments of 40, 100, 250, 400, and 500. For especially large purchases, there were standardized units such as a funda (1,000 big shells), Lufuku (10,000 big shells) and a kofo (20,000 big shells).|$|E
