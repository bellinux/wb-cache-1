5|$|The Hank Aaron Award {{is given}} {{annually}} to the Major League Baseball (MLB) players {{selected as the}} top hitter in each league, as voted on by <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> {{and members of the}} media. It was introduced in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron's surpassing of Babe Ruth's career home run mark of 714 home runs. The award was the first major award to be introduced by Major League Baseball in 19 years.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E

The Hilda is awarded annually, on the Shrine of the Eternals Induction Day.|$|R

5|$|The Hank Aaron Award {{is given}} {{annually}} to the Major League Baseball players {{selected as the}} top hitter in each league, as voted on by <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> {{and members of the}} media. It was introduced in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron surpassing Babe Ruth's 714 career home runs. The award was the first major award to be introduced by Major League Baseball in more than 25 years. Each team's radio and television play-by-play broadcasters and color analysts vote for three players in each league. Their first place vote receives five points, the second place vote receives three points, and the third place vote receives one point. Beginning in 2003, fans were given the opportunity to vote via Major League Baseball's website. Fans' votes account for 30% of the points, while broadcasters' and analysts' votes account for the other 70%. The 2017 winners of the Hank Aaron Award are Jose Altuve of the Houston Astros and Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins.|$|E
5|$|During Hershiser's streak he posted 59 IP, 0 runs, 31 hits, 38 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits, while Drysdale had posted 58 IP, 0 runs, 28 hits, 45 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 3 extra-base hits. Drysdale {{maintained}} {{the record for}} consecutive shutouts (6) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted 16 innings. Hershiser's record was overshadowed because the 1988 Summer Olympics {{and the start of}} the 1988 National Football League season occurred at the same time. Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time (Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders). Additionally, <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> were more concerned with pennant races. Furthermore, four of the final five games in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone, limiting the games' visibility {{to the rest of the}} country. Controversially, KTTV did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched the NL West or the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record. Instead, it showed Friday the 13th and The Funhouse on September 26 and 28, respectively. The record-setting game drew an attendance of 22,596.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to mention his death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey number was not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose number was retired but who is unfamiliar to <b>baseball</b> <b>fans.</b>|$|E

25|$|The osteomyelitic {{condition}} of Mantle's left leg had exempted {{him from being}} drafted for military service since he was 18 in 1949, but his emergence as a star center fielder {{in the major leagues}} during the Korean War in 1952 led to questioning of his 4-F deferment by <b>baseball</b> <b>fans.</b> Two Armed Forces physicals were ordered, including a highly publicized exam on November 4, 1952 which was brought on by his All-Star selection, that ended in a final rejection.|$|E

25|$|Automobile {{parking is}} {{at a premium}} in Lakeview, {{especially}} during special events such as Chicago Cubs home games at Wrigley Field.

25|$|In 1999, MLB {{created the}} Hank Aaron Award, {{to commemorate the}} 25th anniversary of Aaron's surpassing of Babe Ruth's career home run mark of 714 home runs and to honor Aaron's {{contributions}} to baseball. The award is given annually to the baseball hitters voted the most effective in each respective league. That same year, <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> named Aaron to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

25|$|His {{first major}} act was to {{institute}} the Wild Card and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst <b>baseball</b> <b>fans.</b> Those against the Wild Card {{see it as}} diminishing {{the importance of the}} pennant race and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.|$|E
25|$|These {{injuries}} {{left the}} Opening Day start to Joe Saunders, who pitched a dominating {{game against the}} Oakland Athletics to start the season. Two days later, Nick Adenhart made his first start of the season, pitching six shutout innings before being pulled from the game. Hours later, he and two other friends {{were killed in a}} hit-and-run crash. Adenhart's death was a shock to the team and to all <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> nationwide. It caused the next day's game to be postponed, and the Angels' April 10 game against the Boston Red Sox became a tribute to Adenhart.|$|E
25|$|Fan voting (8 NL players; 9 AL players): <b>Baseball</b> <b>fans</b> {{vote on the}} {{starting}} position players for the All-Star Game, with ballots formerly distributed at Major League Baseball games before mid-season and, as of 2015, exclusively on the Internet. In games with the designated hitter, the American League DH is also selected in this manner (and the National League DH is selected by the manager). Fan voting has been recently criticized because most of {{the starting}} players can come from teams that have large fan bases or passionate fan bases such as the Kansas City Royals and the Chicago Cubs.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 season remains notable in {{the minds}} of <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> for two inexplicable oddities.

Three days later, the 22nd, in the first game of a doubleheader at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, {{defeating}} the Baltimore Orioles 30â€“3. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day MLB record. Wes Littleton gained probably the easiest save in Major League historyâ€“ entering the game {{in the bottom of the}} seventh, with his team already ahead 14â€“3, he pitched three innings finishing the game, and gave up just two hits and a walk.|$|E
25|$|The {{rivalry with}} fellow Ohio team the Cincinnati Reds {{is known as}} the Battle of Ohio or Buckeye Series and {{features}} the Ohio Cup trophy for the winner. Prior to 1997, the winner of the cup was determined by an annual pre-season baseball game, played each year at minor-league Cooper Stadium in the state capital of Columbus, and staged just days before the start of each new Major League Baseball season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, with the Indians winning six of them. It ended with the start of interleague play in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among <b>baseball</b> <b>fans</b> in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.|$|E
