5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E
5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with Manche, under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on her. Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, {{it was obvious that}} Windham would reach Manche first.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed over the side one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead {{in the bowels of the}} ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E

5000|$|Gun {{drilling}} - The {{cutting tool}} is a fluted solid rod {{that has a}} hole <b>bored</b> <b>down</b> the center. Coolant is pumped {{through a hole in}} the inside of the drill. It flows back outside the drill, through the flute, bringing the chips with it.|$|R
30|$|The hole S 6 was <b>bored</b> <b>down</b> to 5 [*]m of depth, in {{correspondence}} {{with the small}} positive nucleus located at {{the centre of the}} lower half of the zone. The most significant archaeological layer was found between 0.7 and 1.47 [*]m of depth with abundant brick fragments. In particular, the first strata are worthy of note because remnants similar to those found in the S 5 hole were detected in the same depth range, allowing for a connection between them. The S 7 hole, instead, was <b>bored</b> <b>down</b> to 5 [*]m of depth in an area where the geoelectrical tomography did not put in evidence any relevant positive nucleus. The hole confirmed such a result, since only very rare fragments were there detected [13].|$|R
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered to watch as Imo <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The galley tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the galley and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> off the Giglio Island {{in a line}} astern {{with the}} galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the lightness of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch it between two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
25|$|Pushing down {{further into}} the Plain of Jars with their {{heaviest}} yet forces of the war, the communists <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on the main Hmong bases of Long Chieng and Sam Thong. When they came within ten kilometers of the bases, all able-bodied males within them were armed. Dependent Hmong families began {{to sleep in the}} woods at night, hoping to evade any ground assault.|$|E
25|$|At about 08:00 the Allies, {{being to}} windward, ran down {{together}} in line abreast, elongated {{in order to}} cover the whole French fleet and prevent doubling at either end. The Dutch squadron <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on the leading French squadron to engage on a parallel course but left the leading division of Château-Renault's squadron unmarked. This division cut across Evertsen's path and doubling on the Dutch squadron, was able to inflict much loss.|$|E
60|$|The well had, of course, been <b>bored</b> <b>down</b> {{as far as}} the bed-rock, {{leaving an}} opening from eight to ten inches in {{diameter}} and quite twelve hundred feet deep, which was nearly filled with the water that had flowed in and the oil that had been poured in to give some slight resistance {{at the top of the}} cartridge.|$|R

25|$|At 11 pm in the moonlight, Equino {{had cleared}} for battle, stood in and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> upon the three English ships. The English were {{surprised}} with many still on shore {{in the dark}} but as the Spanish approached, they placed and anchored themselves in seven fathoms of water just off a sandbar. Spanish combat tactics during this time {{was an attempt to}} grapple and then board. English tactics on the other hand was the heavy use of firepower to batter opponents into submission.|$|E
25|$|Forbes {{was given}} command the 80-gun third-rate HMS Norfolk in 1742 and saw {{action at the}} Battle of Toulon on 11 February 1744 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He {{followed}} the example of Admiral Thomas Mathews, who was aboard the second-rate HMS Namur, {{and was one of}} the few captains who really <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on the enemy. In Summer 1746 he was called upon to give evidence at the court-martial of Vice-Admiral Richard Lestock during the recriminations after the battle.|$|E
25|$|Deploying on {{both sides}} of the main highway, Milhaud charged Blake's cavalry and routed it. As the Spanish {{horsemen}} galloped away, they disrupted their own infantry formations. When the French dragoons and Polish lancers <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on the surprised and shaken Spanish foot soldiers, the men scattered in flight. Milhaud's horsemen cut Blake's vanguard to pieces, cutting down many soldiers and capturing many prisoners. But when the French encountered the second Spanish division drawn up in rough terrain, they refrained from attacking. Blake immediately ordered a retreat to Cúllar.|$|E

25|$|The Jesuits {{had many}} who opposed them. The Jansenists were {{numerous}} among {{the enemies of}} the orthodox party. The Sorbonne joined the Gallicans, the Philosophes, and the Encyclopédistes. Louis XV was weak; {{his wife and children}} were in favor of the Jesuits; his able first minister, the Duc de Choiseul, played {{into the hands of the}} Parlement, and the royal mistress, Madame de Pompadour, to whom the Jesuits had refused absolution for she was living in sin with the King of France, was a determined opponent. The determination of the Parlement of Paris in time <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> all opposition.|$|E
25|$|At 04:00 on 24 June, at {{position}} , almost the midpoint between Menorca and Toulon, the frigate squadrons sighted one another. Dido, the leading British ship, sent coded {{signals to the}} French, who failed to answer, confirming their nationality. As the British advanced, the French tacked away, and rapidly outdistanced the British ships. At 08:00 however with visibility improving, the diminutive size of the British ships became apparent and the French squadron turned back and <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on Dido and Lowestoffe. At 08:30, Minerve {{was close enough to}} Dido to fire a broadside, although Towry elected not to return fire until Minerve had closed further. By 08:45 he had successfully manoeuvered into a position in front of Perrée's bow and fired at close range.|$|E
25|$|Having {{brushed aside}} Ney, the Russians <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on Bernadotte's corps. On 24 January, Markov mauled a French unit at Liebstadt (Miłakowo), {{capturing}} 300 Frenchmen. Bernadotte quickly assembled General of Division Pierre Dupont's division and General of Brigade Jacques Léonard Laplanche's dragoons at Preussisch Holland (Pasłęk) {{on his left}} flank in the northwest. On his own initiative, Bernadotte's chief of staff General of Brigade Nicolas Joseph Maison alerted the I Corps center and right flank. Maison directed General of Division Olivier Rivaud to concentrate his division at Osterode on the right, while General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet gathered his troops at Saalfeld (Zalewo) in the center. Maison held General of Brigade Michel Marie Pacthod's 8th Light Infantry Regiment at Mohrungen, while calling Sahuc's other dragoon brigade from the right flank toward the center.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Opuntia rufida, Opuntia macrorhiza var. macrorhiza, Opuntia stricta var. stricta and Opuntia lindheimeri var. lindheimeri. Larvae of {{the first}} {{generation}} are gregarious and bore into young cladodes of the host plant. Older larvae are solitary and feed on older cladodes, entering near the top and <b>boring</b> <b>down</b> through the center. The tunnel itself is filled with frass causing the stem to swell where injured. Pupation takes place in debris on the soil surface. Second generation larvae feed during winter, and pupate in January.|$|R

25|$|On {{the stage}} to Geneva the frigid weather and several {{mechanical}} issues <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second {{for the last two}} years). It appeared {{that this was going to}} be his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque. Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first to win the Tour de France without winning a stage.|$|E
25|$|Forest's tactic {{was simply}} to run Fort Diamond into the {{privateer}} {{at a rate of}} about nine knots. As Fort Diamond <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> on them, the schooner's crew fired a broadside and discharged some small arms before all 50 or 60 crewmen jumped overboard and swam ashore. (The shore battery, not entirely distracted, also fired on Fort Diamond.) The impact of Fort Diamond hitting the privateer broke the chain that anchored the privateer to shore; the boarding party then cut two cables to free her. Fort Diamonds casualties amounted to two men wounded. The privateer turned out to be the Mosambique, armed with ten 18-pounder carronades, though she was pierced for 14 cannon. She was from Guadeloupe, provisioned for a three-month cruise and was under the command of Citizen Vallentes.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine {{attack was}} fierce {{and it was}} not long before the Bulgarians began slowly to retreat. The Byzantine cavalry charged the {{infantry}} in the centre killing many Bulgarians. The Bulgarian position became desperate as they could not manage to hold the heights to the south of the river and began a hasty retreat to the north. Elated, the Byzantines started a bitter chase and their battle formations soon began to break, especially as a rumour spread that their commander, Leo Phocas, had been killed. At this point, Simeon, who had detected the disarray in the Byzantine formation, ordered his army to stand, and, at the head of his heavy cavalry corps, attacked the Byzantine left wing from behind the hills. With an irresistible onslaught the cavalry <b>bore</b> <b>down</b> at the confused enemy who immediately bent under their attack, panicked and took to their heels.|$|E
25|$|Necrobia rufipes, {{commonly}} known as the red-legged ham beetle, is of particular importance in stored product entomology. N. rufipes infests dried or smoked meats, especially those products that are stored unwrapped for long periods of time. Adults feed {{on the surface of the}} products, while the larvae damage the meat by <b>boring</b> <b>down</b> usually in the fatty parts. N. rufipes has been recorded to have fed upon a large variety of items ranging from hides and dried figs to Egyptian mummies. In addition, products such as wool and silk can become infested, but not destroyed.|$|R
