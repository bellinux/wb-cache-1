500|$|The {{television}} advert for Homme by David Beckham, {{which was}} directed by Anthony Mandler, opens to see Beckham [...] "showing off his physical prowess" [...] as he runs topless along a platform. As he reaches {{the edge of the}} platform, Beckham dives into a vat of the fragrance. In the next scene he is fully dressed in one of his trademark tailored suits. Beckham appeared in a sketch on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to promote the fragrance. In the sketch he is [...] "almost unrecognisable" [...] as he stood in the cosmetics aisle at a Target store, offering passing customers a sample spray of the scent. Homme by David Beckham was included in Esquires list of the best colognes for men in 2011. Digital Spy included the fragrance in their 2012 Christmas gift guide, commenting that: [...] "The man in your life may not look like Mr Beckham– <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> can smell like him".|$|E
2500|$|Nishihara {{retired from}} the film {{industry}} in 1985. In 2002 he published , his memoirs which recounted his eventful life and encounters with criminals. In September 2009, the 1960s careers of Nishihara and actress Tamaki Katori—working together and separately—were {{the subject of a}} retrospective at the Kobe Planet Film Archive. Summarizing Nishihara's career, Allmovie writes, [...] "No one ever accused Nishihara of being the most subtle filmmaker in the world, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> manages to keep the tawdry proceedings lively." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alam and my father, Abolfath Mirza Mahvi Kajar, {{were the}} Shah's two closest friends, {{and they both}} wrote about every details of their accounts. [...] Alam wrote about his life {{for the last ten}} years of his reign. These memoirs were posthumously {{published}} several years after Alam's death. Because of the level of its detail, this book is probably the greatest source of information about the life and deeds of the Shah. [...] Alam admired the Shah greatly and his writing is therefore not impartial, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> expresses the Shah's perception of the national and international politics accurately. This results in the closest possible look at the way the Shah thought and how he made his decisions.|$|E
5000|$|Indeed, Councillor, I am well {{pleased with}} Blädner, but with Seifert not <b>at</b> all; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> better than Blädner.|$|R
50|$|Colin — The Baskervilles' talking house, {{like all}} houses in Underworld, {{instead of giving}} shelter to his family, he is {{secretly}} trying to bump them off; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> polite about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I!" [...] her visitor after {{a moment}} breathed. [...] "You've had to vacate the house--that was inevitable. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> here <b>he</b> doesn't funk." ...|$|R
2500|$|Zimbabwe {{resisted}} for {{a session}} {{on the fourth}} day against the Indian spinners, but Harbhajan and Anil Kumble chipped away with wickets, first by removing Blignaut for a well-struck 26, and then Taibu and Dabengwa in quick succession. Needing only one more wicket for the win, India attacked, but the fielder at short leg dropped Gavin Ewing early on and he answered by smashing the spin bowlers around. Ewing and Mahwire added 47 runs in 13 overs before Harbhajan finally got a ball to spin back into Ewing's pads – gone for 34, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> got a somewhat useful score. Nevertheless, Zimbabwe were all out for 185, and they suffered yet another innings defeat.|$|E
2500|$|F. Homes Dudden {{declared}} The Temple Beau as [...] "a {{fairly good}} comedy of intrigue" [...] {{and says that}} [...] "The plot of the comedy, though rather too complicated, is more skilfully constructed than that of Love in Several Masques, {{and some of the}} situations are diverting. One of the best things in the piece is the interview between the deluded Sir Harry [...] young Wilding [...] and Pincet". Robert Hume believed that [...] "Fielding had begun to master the mechanics of intrigue comedy. The results are not wonderful, but they show distinctly more technical competence. Fielding still employs more characters than he can comfortably control [...] <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> involves them in related complications." [...] Albert Rivero believed that [...] "The initial rejection of The Temple Beau, however, convinced Fielding that his future success would depend on his ability to satisfy the town's taste for less conventional entertainments." [...] Harold Pagliaro describes the play by saying, [...] "Though the dramatic structure of The Temple Beau is improved over that of Fielding's first play, it has some obvious weaknesses. The lovers are too nearly perfect to engage us in what is or ought to be their burdensome complication of distress. They are so sure of each other and of themselves that they are unassailable, however threatened by the loss of love, freedom and financial self-sufficiency." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{astonished}} that {{he summoned}} energy {{to visit us}} at all," [...] declared Mrs. Montrose. [...] "He may be weak and ill, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> is grateful." ...|$|E
5000|$|When I was a nipper I {{felt that}} the guitar was all I had. I wasn't tough enough {{to be in a}} gang, I wasn't good looking enough to be in with the birds, not clever enough to make it at school, not good enough on my feet to be good {{football}} player, I was a fucking loser. I think everyone feels that way at some point. And somehow being a Mod - even though I was too old to be a Mod really - I wrote this song with that in mind. Jimmy, the hero of the story, is kinda thinking he hasn't got much going for him <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> one.|$|R
60|$|Was she dead now? or, {{after all}} these years, had he broken the chain, and run from home like a schoolboy? I could not {{discover}} which; <b>but</b> here <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> {{was out on the}} adventure, and still one of the bravest and most youthful men on board.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004 she {{supported}} John Kerry for president. She canvassed for Kerry in Pennsylvania, but {{wrote for}} OpenDemocracy.org (November 3, 2004), [...] "we all thought Kerry {{had a very}} good chance, even though everyone admitted {{it was hard to get}} really enthusiastic about him.... The man isn't the most charismatic ever to walk the earth. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> not a proto-fascist or a go-it-aloner, and that's what we seem--apart from a last-minute miracle--to be stuck with now. With four years clear ahead of him and no re-election to worry about, I fear Bush and the ghastly neo- con/neo-liberals around him will now go on the rampage. They can continue with impunity their attacks on the Constitution and on hard-won freedoms..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The lad did {{not speak}} boastfully, {{when he said he}} was a fair swordsman," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "He does not fight in our fashion, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> knows what he is about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he IS," [...] {{admitted}} Miss Cornelia rather sadly. [...] "And {{of course}} there is no hope of making a Conservative of him. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> is a Presbyterian. So I suppose I shall have to be satisfied with that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean Mason's case?" [...] said Prout heavily. [...] "That always {{struck me}} as peculiarly scandalous. I thought the Head should have taken up the matter more {{thoroughly}}. Mason may be misguided, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> is thoroughly sincere and means well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{here comes}} Leigh! After supper I shall {{go in and}} {{have a talk with}} my father. I have very little hope of having much success with him; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> when <b>he</b> sees the steps that I am taking, it cannot but make him think seriously of his own position, and that of my mother and sisters." ...|$|R
500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I can see him being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> willing to pull the trigger. You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do {{you know}} she doesn't care for you?" [...] asked Mary. A woman may be {{critical}} of her lover's shortcomings, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> the very <b>least</b> <b>he</b> {{is good enough for}} every other woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{other three}} have gone," [...] I said, and I {{happened}} {{to be looking at}} Johnson as I spoke. Was it the shadow of a satisfied smile that crossed his thin lips? I do not know; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> did not weep.|$|E
60|$|Matarazzo, I confess, {{is worthy}} of no more credit than any other of the {{contemporary}} reporters of common gossip. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> {{is worthy of}} no less. And it is undeniable that in Sforza's case a strong motive for the murder was not lacking.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you have}} no objection,' I said, 'no. I don't {{want to talk to}} you, Mr Fisher. I don't like you, and I don't like your way of earning your living. Buck MacGinnis was bad enough, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> was a {{straightforward}} tough. There's no excuse for you.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Hannibal {{was brought}} to the United States as early as 1824 {{according}} to early sources, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> by 1831. <b>He</b> was first called [...] "Timour the Tartar" [...] and renamed by Raymond, Weeks & Co. in 1833 as [...] "War Elephant Hannibal".|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{send out}} a dozen runners to my friends," [...] he said, [...] "and beg them to be here {{tomorrow}} morning, early. Then, when I have talked matters over with them, I shall ride to Roxburgh and lay the matter before the governor. I know that I shall get no help from him; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> when <b>he</b> hears of a gathering here, he will know that 'tis with no evil intention against the English." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his free}} time, {{he was a}} male prostitute. He {{had a heart attack}} in 1992 from too much [...] "activity". His heart was overworking, trying to pump more blood to the body to create energy. He died without getting paid, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> we know <b>he</b> died in pleasure.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> was {{the only}} traitor. The rest of the Goths agreed {{unanimously}} that Hypatia was a very foolish person, who was wasting her youth and beauty in talking to donkey-riders; and Pelagia remounted her mule, and the Goths their horses, for a triumphal procession homeward.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{should think}} she was not," [...] said the girl, gravely. She looked hurt, {{as if she had}} been unfairly forced to the logic of her postulate, and Hewson was not {{altogether}} pleased with himself; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> had had his revenge in making her realize the man's vacuity.|$|E
60|$|He {{had loved}} her before, now he worshipped her. He {{knew that he}} might never possess her now, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> might see her. From a {{distance}} he might look upon her. Perhaps he might serve her; but never must she guess {{that he had found}} her or that he lived.|$|E
6000|$|The object {{referred}} to was a man, <b>but,</b> in appearance <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> was not many degrees {{removed from the}} monkey. He was a black, squat, hideous-looking native, and his whole costume, besides the little strip of cloth usually worn by natives round the loins, consisted of a black silk hat {{and a pair of}} Wellington boots! ...|$|R
50|$|Mike {{has been}} seeing a {{hypnotherapist}} {{to try to}} remember details {{of his relationship with}} Monique. He now recalls how they first met—she needed a plumber. She hit on him {{and he said he was}} seeing someone. She said she was too, but he's married and she's drunk. He had to go to the store for a tool, leaving his toolbox behind. When he came back, he saw someone else was there, but, in his hypnotic state, he can only remember seeing yellow rubber gloves. He doesn't know who the murderer is, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> now <b>he</b> knows it is not him.|$|R
50|$|Won-Jun KangWon-Jun {{is a quiet}} boy. He is also {{popular with}} girls {{but no one ever}} {{approaches}} him because he always looks so cold, although no one really knows if that is true. He is a smart person who has done a couple of things in the past that he regrets and cannot ever turn back, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> that's what <b>he</b> thinks.|$|R
6000|$|... "That he would," [...] Doctor Michaeloff said warmly. [...] "You {{are right}} there, young sir. The czar {{may not be}} a soldier, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> is a man, which is more than can be said for the officer who ordered sixty {{thousand}} men to lay down their arms to eight thousand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Archibald {{opened his}} eyes very wide. [...] "Your friend is {{certainly}} a remarkable young man," [...] said he, [...] "but we must not have any bad feeling in camp, so let everything remain {{as it is for}} to-night. I suppose he wished to be near his sister, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> might have asked permission." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'm sure of it, too," [...] Elma answered, {{with the}} instinctive {{certainty}} of feminine conviction. [...] "But still I know, for all that, he did it. Perhaps {{it was all}} done {{in a moment of}} haste. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> did it. And nothing on earth that anybody could say will ever make me believe he didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before I Self Destruct has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 15 reviews. Allmusic called it [...] "a fantastic juggernaut of a 50 album if you exit early, {{and a very}} good one even if you don't". Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Growling violent threats over hard beats, 50 sounds the hungriest he has in years. Of course, there’s nothing remotely original about the formula <b>he’s</b> returning to, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he’s</b> going through the motions with gusto". The A.V. Club said that, [...] "If Destruct qualifies as a pleasant surprise, it’s only because 50 Cent’s last few releases set the bar so low. Still, {{for the first time since}} The Massacre, it’s once again intermittently fun to root for the bad guy" [...] Pitchfork Media wrote that, [...] "After initially promising a return to form, 50 doesn't have the ability or initiative to hold the listener's interest over the long run." [...] PopMatters said that, [...] "With surprisingly little filler, renewed energy, and the unique glimpse Before I Self Destruct offers into the psyche of a public figure as intriguing as Curtis Jackson, 50 Cent has crafted easily his best album since [...] "Get Rich or Die Trying." ...|$|R
5000|$|Karmen Fox from The Baltimore Sun wrote {{positively}} {{about the}} episode, stating: [...] "Was the doomed sidekick/heroic sacrifice trope necessary to help lift the guilt-ridden Jim's spirits {{so he could}} escape prison? Sure. Could the prison escape have been less over the top, without Jim running back into the infirmary to rescue Puck? Yes. Yes, please. In {{spite of all the}} schmaltziness, the episode wraps up nicely with the sun rising over Gothams skyline. It echoed Elijah's optimistic advice to Penguin: 'The sun will come up tomorrow'. With a new day breaking, will Jim find Leigh? How will he prove his innocence? We're not sure, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> not in the World’s End." [...] Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: [...] "Really, Gotham? How long are you going to add drama to the drama of Jim's tortured soul? There are no redeeming qualities to Jim Gordon. Forget about him saving Gotham City. He'll be lucky if he can save himself. Yes, I get the whole point of Jim's overblown drama this hour, but it still doesn't make it any less infuriating. So, Puck had to die and Lee's baby had to die just so the story could move forward, and Jim could have some new anger with which to wrap his pathetic life around? Whatever." ...|$|R
60|$|But here Miss Phemie {{broke in}} saucily with the {{assertion}} that Mr. Parmlee might not have a railroad in his pocket, <b>but</b> that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>he</b> didn't {{have to wait for}} the Flood to call on young ladies, nor did he usually come in pairs, for all the world as if he had been let out of Noah's Ark, but on horseback and like a Christian by the front door. All this provokingly and bewitchingly delivered, however, and with a simulated exaggeration that was incited apparently more by Mr. Lawrence Grant's evident enjoyment of it, than by any desire to defend the absent Parmlee.|$|R
