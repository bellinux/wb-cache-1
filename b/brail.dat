6000|$|... "That will do. Slack the <b>brail</b> off, Jack. Now haul in {{the sheet}} a bit. You had better let the {{foresail}} down, Tom; {{the wind is}} heavy, and {{there is too much}} sea on here to drive her through it too fast." ...|$|E
60|$|The boys lent {{a hand at}} the windlass, and {{the anchor}} was soon hanging from the bow. Then the <b>brail</b> of the {{mainsail}} was loosed, and the great sail shaken out. The foresail was hoisted, {{and in a few}} minutes the Sarah and Jane was running before a brisk wind down Sea Reach.|$|E

50|$|Another {{use of the}} gaff vangs was {{to steady}} the gaff on a boomless gaff rig like a bawley when the sail is <b>brailed</b> up.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, Jack. I {{am always}} glad {{when we get}} that buoy; it is the hardest to find of any of them. We shall have to jibe going round it. You stand by to <b>brail</b> the sail up when I give the word; we might carry away the gaff at the jaws if we let the sail go over all {{standing}} now." [...] As soon as they neared the buoy Tom Hoskins got in the oar with which the mainsail was boomed out. [...] "Now, Jack, <b>brail</b> up the sail as she comes round. Haul in the sheet {{as fast as you}} can, Tom, and pay it out again handsomely as it comes over. That is the way. Now fasten the sheet and throw off the main-tack and trice the sail up pretty near to the throat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Call him--call the mate, I say," [...] {{cried out}} Jack, {{in a voice}} that proved how much he was in earnest. [...] "These puffs come heavy, I can tell you, and they come often, too. Call him--call him, at once, Miss Rose, for it is time to tack if we wish to recover the boat. Tell him, too, to <b>brail</b> the foresail, while we are in stays--that's right; another call will start him up." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{order was}} now given to <b>brail</b> the spanker, and to clap on and weigh the kedge, which {{was done by}} the run. As soon as the ship was free of the bottom, the fore-topmast-stay-sail was set flying, like a jib-top-sail, by hauling out the tack, and swaying upon the halyards. The sheet was hauled to windward, and the helm put down; of course the bows of the ship began to fall off, and, as soon, as her head was {{sufficiently}} near her course, the sheet was drawn, and the wheel shifted.|$|E
6000|$|... "And who is {{this gentleman}} ahead of us, with his main-topsail to the mast, his courses in the <b>brails,</b> and his helm a-lee?" [...] asked Paul.|$|R
50|$|This {{fine control}} of the sail without need for the crew to leave the deck, is {{achieved}} by <b>brailing</b> up. Rather than lowering the mainsail, it is gathered up against its own luff and head by means of lines called <b>brails.</b> This technique is an effective way of stowing the mainsail and gives fine control over the power obtained from the sail. In narrow channels, the mailsail. foresail and mizzen are <b>brailed</b> and the bowsprit topped up, and she sails on topsail alone. However, {{it means that the}} sail is stowed aloft and unreachable from the deck. It also means that the sail cannot easily be covered when it is stowed, and thus protected from the elements. But in any case, the crews of working vessels did not trouble with such dainty ways. In keeping with the general philosophy of working boats, all sails would therefore be traditionally treated with red oxide and other substances.|$|R

60|$|It is {{scarcely}} necessary {{to say that}} Mulford sailed a boat well. He held the sheet in his hand, as the little craft came up under the lee-quarter of the brig, while Jack stood by the <b>brail.</b> The eyes of the mate glanced over the hull of the vessel to ascertain, if possible, who might be stirring; but {{not a sign of}} life could he detect on board her. This very silence made Mulford more distrustful and anxious, for he feared a trap was set for him. He expected to see the head of one of the blacks at least peering over the bulwarks, but nothing like a man was visible. It was too late to pause, however, and the sheet was slowly eased off, Jack hauling on the <b>brail</b> at the same time; the object being to prevent the sail's flapping, and the sound reaching the ears of Spike. As Mulford used great caution, and had previously schooled Jack on the subject, this important point was successfully achieved. Then the mate put his helm down, and the boat shot up under the brig's lee-bow. Jack was ready to lay hold of one of the bow-sprit shrouds, and presently the boat was breasted up under the desired port, and secured in that position. Mulford quitted the stern-sheets, and cast a look in upon deck. Nothing was to be seen, though he heard the heavy breathing of the blacks, both of whom were sound asleep on a sail that they had spread on the forecastle.|$|E
6000|$|... “Why {{here the}} wind has been all day at the south, and now there’s a lull, as if the last blast {{was out of the}} bellows; and there’s a streak along the mountains, to the northard, that, just now, wasn’t wider than the bigness of your hand; and then the clouds drive afore it as you’d <b>brail</b> a mainsail, and the stars are heaving in sight, like so many lights and beacons, put there to warn us to pile on the wood; and, if so be that I’m a judge of weather, it’s getting to be time to build on a fire, or you'll have half of them there porter bottles, and them dimmyjohns of wine, in the locker here, {{breaking}} with the frost, afore the morning watch is called.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{foresail}} {{was lowered}} and the mainsail partly brailed up, {{so that she}} had only way on her sufficient to stem the tide. As they entered the broken water Jack was obliged {{to take a step}} back and hold on to the mast. Her motion had before been violent, but to a certain extent regular; now she was tossed in all directions so sharply and violently that he expected every moment that the mast would go. Tom looked round at Ben. The latter pointed to the sail and waved his hand. Tom understood him, and going to the mast loosened the <b>brail</b> a little to give her more sail, for the waves completely knocked the way out of her. When she forged ahead again, Tom returned to his post.|$|E
6000|$|Just at {{this moment}} Ned hailed them from the top. [...] "There is a ship nearly ahead of us, sir; she is lying with her sails <b>brailed</b> up, evidently waiting." ...|$|R

60|$|The top-gallant sails were got in, {{and when}} the courses had been <b>brailed</b> up and secured, the hands were called down. Presently the captain, after going to his cabin, rejoined Mr. Green.|$|R
6000|$|Ben still hesitated, {{when another}} bright flash was seen. It was an appeal for aid {{he could not}} resist. [...] "Put down the helm, Tom," [...] he said. [...] "Now, Jack, help me to rouse in the sheet. That will do. Now then for a pull on the jib-sheet. Now we will put the last reef in the {{foresail}} and hoist it, slack the <b>brail</b> and haul down the main-tack a bit. We must keep good way on her crossing the tide." [...] Now that they were nearly close-hauled instead of running before the wind, Jack recognized much more strongly than before how heavy was the sea and how great {{the force of the}} wind. Lively as the boat was, great masses of water poured over her bow and swept aft as each wave struck her. Her lee bulwarks were completely buried.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{leaped to}} his feet, {{lifted his head}} above the upper deck, shouted [...] "Let her go free, Jerry!" [...] and then turned gratefully to his passenger. [...] "Look yer! A {{wash-out}} is a wash-out, I reckon, put it any way you like; it don't put anything back into the land, or anything back into your pocket afterwards, eh? No! And yer well out of it, pardner! Now there's a right smart chance for locatin' jest back of Santy Barbara, where thar ain't no God-forsaken tules to overflow; and ez far ez the land and licker lies ye 'needn't take any water in yours' ef ye don't want it. You kin start fresh thar, pardner, and <b>brail</b> up. What's the matter with you, old man, is only fever 'n' agur ketched in them tules! I kin see it in your eyes. Now you hold on whar you be till I go forrard and see everything taut, and then I'll come back and we'll have a talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She has {{got quite}} enough on her, Jack, and is walking {{along at a}} grand pace. Always leave well alone, lad. The squalls come up very strong sometimes, and I would not carry as much sail as we have got {{if she were a}} cutter with a heavy boom. As it is, we can <b>brail</b> it up at any moment if need be. We sha'n't be long getting down off Clacton. Then you must keep a sharp {{look-out}} for the Spitway Buoy. It comes on very thick at times, {{and it is difficult to}} judge how far we are out. However, I think I know pretty well the direction it lies in, and can hit it to within a cable's length or so. I have found it many a time on a dark night, and am not likely to miss it now. It will take us an hour and a half or so from the time we pass Walton till we are up to the buoy." ...|$|E

60|$|This was {{the order}} {{the men were}} expecting to receive, but they were {{surprised}} when, just as the last light was abreast of them, Francis gave the order for the <b>brails</b> to be loosed again.|$|R
60|$|Bob and Joe watched these {{maneuvers}} {{in silence}} without heeding Jim's announcement that breakfast was ready, {{and much to}} the astonishment of both, the sail was <b>brailed</b> up when the boat reached a point nearly opposite the steamer.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{increased}} {{again after}} sunrise, and {{being unable to}} reef the sail single handed he managed partially to <b>brail</b> it up. All day the craft flew along with the wind on the quarter, making six or seven miles an hour; and he felt that by morning he would be well beyond pursuit. On the run he passed several craft engaged in fishing, but these gave him no uneasiness. He had in the morning, with some old sails he found, constructed three rough imitations of human figures, one with the Arab dress and another with the bernouse, and had placed them against the bulwarks, so that at a short distance {{it would appear that}} there were three men on board. Feeling confident that the deception would not be noticed, he kept his course without swerving, and passed some of the fishing boats within hailing distance, waving his hand and shouting the usual Arab salutation to their crews.|$|E
60|$|Down to this moment, {{the only}} sail that was loose {{on board the}} Swash was the fore-topsail, as mentioned. This still hung in the gear, but a hand had been sent aloft to {{overhaul}} the buntlines and clewlines, and men were also at the sheets. In a minute the sail was ready for hoisting. The Swash carried a wapper of a fore-and-aft mainsail, and, what is more, it was fitted with a standing gaff, for appearance in port. At sea, Spike {{knew better than to}} trust to this arrangement; but in fine weather, and close in with the land, he found it convenient to have this sail haul out and <b>brail</b> like a ship's spanker. As the gaff was now aloft, it was only necessary to let go the brails to loosen this broad sheet of canvas, and to clap on the out-hauler, to set it. This was probably the reason why the brig was so unceremoniously cast into the stream, without showing more of her cloth. The jib and flying-jibs, however, did at that moment drop beneath their booms, ready for hoisting.|$|E
60|$|Tier now {{communicated to}} the mate his own {{proposed}} manner of proceeding. The brig tended to the trades, the tides having very little influence on her, in the bight of the reef where she lay. As the wind stood at about east south-east, the brig's stern pointed to about west north-west, while the boat was coming down the passage from a direction nearly north from her, having, {{as a matter of}} course, the wind just free enough to lay her course. Jack's plan was to pass the brig to windward, and having got well on her bow, to <b>brail</b> the sail, and drift down upon her, expecting to fall in alongside, abreast of the fore-chains, into which he had intended to help Biddy, and to ascend himself, when he supposed that Mulford would again make sail, and carry off his mistress. To this scheme the mate objected that it was awkward, and a little lubberly. He substituted one in its place that differed in seamanship, and which was altogether better. Instead of passing to wind-ward, Mulford suggested the expediency of approaching to leeward, and of coming alongside under the open bow-port, letting the sheet fly and brailing the sail, when the boat should be near enough to carry her to the point of destination without further assistance from her canvass.|$|E
60|$|The wind now freshening, and {{the rent}} sails like to blow from the yards, we brought the {{brigantine}} to the wind, and <b>brailed</b> up the canvas. This left us {{at liberty to}} examine the craft, though, unfortunately, the night was growing hazy.|$|R
60|$|As {{they entered}} the haven the head sails were dropped and the {{mainsail}} <b>brailed</b> up. The tide was running in strong, and, as the men had said, {{they had nothing to}} do but to keep the barge in the deepest part of the channel.|$|R
60|$|The pattering of {{the rain}} on the water raised no slight noise, and this was {{favorable}} to us. Our tiller had been lashed, so {{that there might be}} no possibility the rudder-head would creak in its socket, and every rope was <b>brailed</b> to guard against its flapping.|$|R
5000|$|Brails, in a sailing ship, {{are small}} lines used {{to haul in}} or up the edges (leeches) or corners of sails, before furling. On a ship rig, these brails are most often found on the mizzen sail. The command is, hale up the brails, or, <b>brail</b> up the sails. The word <b>brail</b> comes from Middle English brayle, from Anglo-French braiel belt, strap, <b>brail,</b> {{alteration}} of Old French braiuel belt, probably ultimately from Latin braca pant.|$|E

60|$|With all haste we {{proceeded}} to furl the sails, which, {{owing to the}} calm, had been hanging loose in the <b>brails.</b> And by help of a spare boom, used on the forecastle-deck sit a sweep or great oar, we endeavored to cast the brigantine's head toward the foe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is Captain Gar'ner on deck?" [...] asked Daggett, who had now drawn {{close up}} on the lee-quarter of his consort, Hazard having <b>brailed</b> his {{foresail}} and laid his topsail sharp aback, to enable him to do so--"If he isn't, I'd advise you {{to give him a}} call at once." ...|$|R
60|$|The schooner, at this time, {{was under}} her mainsail, jib, and fore-top-sail. The {{foresail}} was <b>brailed,</b> and the foot stopped, and the flying-jib was stowed. None of the halyards were racked, nor sheets stoppered. This was a precaution we always took, {{on account of}} the craft's being so tender.|$|R
