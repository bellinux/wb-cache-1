5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>careful</b> instead.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the Ministry of Transport and Public Works {{considered}} in December 1969 that the broadcast of Howl contravened the licence of operation of Yleisradio: it was neither educational nor useful.

Dr. Andrew J.

However, his electrical experiments {{had a tendency to}} blow fuses, causing building-wide blackouts.

25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{court martial}} reprimanded Sykes {{for failing to}} order frequent soundings and for relying {{too much on the}} pilot. It ordered Lieutenant John Fisher, the officer of the watch, to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>careful</b> in the future, especially in keeping the captain aware of his ship's situation. It severely reprimanded the master, Joseph Forster, for not taking continuous sounding and for not informing the captain about his reservations concerning the course being steered. Lastly, the court martial severely reprimanded the pilot, Thomas Robinson, for countermanding the captain's order, and for sailing too close to the shore and without taking soundings. It ordered the pilot to lose all pay due him.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode 8 out of 10, saying it {{delivered}} [...] "a solid and traditional Whovian tale, albeit one at its best", {{though it was}} [...] "nothing groundbreaking" [...] yet. He went on to praise the supporting cast that [...] "managed to sell both their flawed human originals and their progressively bonkers ganger counterparts" [...] {{as well as the}} setting. However, he questioned Rory's willingness to protect Jennifer, as he thought Rory would have learned from his experiences with death to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>careful.</b> Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, saying that [...] "The Rebel Flesh" [...] "strikes a satisfying balance between the humorous and the horrific" [...] from the cold open. He commended Graham for handling the two-part structure by using extra time to explore the characters and themes, and thought the highlight of the episode were Rory's scenes with Jennifer. However, he criticised the CGI used in some scenes, although he called the prosthetics used for the Gangers [...] "impressive", as well as the episode for ending in [...] "a damp squib of a cliffhanger" [...] that was [...] "clearly too telegraphed throughout the episode".|$|E
500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This is all too much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>careful</b> in the future. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he had done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E

500|$|Singapore has a one person, {{one vote}} system: plural voting– that is, voting {{more than once}} in the electoral {{division}} that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division– is illegal. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>careful,</b> voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."
