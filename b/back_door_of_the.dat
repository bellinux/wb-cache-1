5|$|As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's {{artifact}} flies over William and hovers {{above his}} head. Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house {{with a box of}} dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

50|$|Fisk {{eventually}} bought Mansfield {{an elegant}} home at 18 West 24th, furnished it, and supplied her with everything she desired. The four-story brownstone (after some $65,000 worth of improvements) had four servants, a wardrobe filled with dresses, and a jewelry case accented by real jewels. The {{home was a}} few doors down from Fisk's Grand Opera House and Erie Railroad headquarters at 359 W. 23rd, and Fisk had a covered passage built linking <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> headquarters and Mansfield's brownstone.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> {{interior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{machine was}} very complicated {{and designed to}} mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, <b>the</b> front <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. <b>The</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line <b>of</b> vision through <b>the</b> machine. Underneath <b>the</b> robes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine.

He would later bury her naked body in the yard close to the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flat, and although he remained adamant he had not dismembered this particular victim, a subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip (although this damage may {{have been caused by}} building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976). In addition, several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this would prove to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).|$|E
25|$|Jugan {{was born}} in Glassport, Pennsylvania on October 16, 1957. He became {{interested}} in pro wrestling as a child after attending a live event at the McKeesport Palisades. Jugan later became a regular studio audience member on the famed Saturday night television program Studio Wrestling. Although the show was restricted to people over 18, Jugan was often sneaked in through the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WIIC-TV studio by Bruno Sammartino's manager {{and sat in the}} back row of the bleachers. Jugan was studying photography in school at the time and began taking pictures at the matches. An official ringside photographer during the final years of Studio Wrestling, he eventually started submitting photos and writing for various wrestling magazines and newsletters. He was also president of a fanclub for Luis Martinez.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{above-mentioned}} mechanism, on many cars there are also window locks. These window locks prevent the windows in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> two <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car from opening all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. The windows only open to about three quarters.

50|$|A {{founder member}} (one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first 50) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian National Fascist Party, he became outspokenly {{critical}} of fascism, {{which led to}} a violent dispute with Benito Mussolini, necessitating his subsequent fleeing to France. In an era of volatile politics he always carried a hand grenade. In 1919 three members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fascist youth entered a trattoria looking for him, but as they shot the two owners he threw the grenade and ran out <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fascists was killed and Lago fled to Paris, reportedly never returning to Italy.|$|R
25|$|The gang {{attempted}} to rob {{the bank in}} Northfield at about 2pm. To carry out the robbery, the gang divided into two groups. Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square. The robbers inside the bank were thwarted when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a time lock even as they held a Bowie knife to his throat and cracked his skull with a pistol butt. Assistant cashier Alonzo Enos Bunker {{was wounded in the}} shoulder as he fled through the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank. Meanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door and raised the alarm. The five bandits outside fired into the air to clear the streets, driving the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. They shot two bandits dead and wounded the rest in the barrage. Inside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter but have not reached consensus.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E
500|$|While Korn {{was looking}} for a place to record their debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record the majority of the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E

40|$|Community {{radio labeled}} variedly as {{alternative}} media, grassroots media, local media or radical media is symbolic of democratization {{of communication with}} intangible power to enhance participation <b>of</b> masses in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> development and social change. India, with a liberal media policy hesitated to open its broadcasting spectrum to the private ownership citing reasons of internal security, communal riots, terrorism and militant conflicts. However, <b>the</b> historic judgment <b>of</b> Apex Court in 2002 freed air signals from government clutches opening doors to private commercial radio. Ironically, <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> social justice suffered as mass media were driven by market forces compelling government to embrace the community radio movement and issue licenses to anybody to establish radio to serve the local people. This paper critically reviews the vital issues viz., ownership, participation, programming and financial sustainability concerning operating CRS in India. The study concludes that <b>the</b> vision <b>of</b> Government of India to establish CRS since 2007 every mile in thousands has failed to materialize as the policy suffers from many shortcomings. Privatization of broadcasting has paradoxically brought the private players <b>back</b> to <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government for financial succor, says the study...|$|R
500|$|The Battle of Noordhorn, {{fought on}} 30 September 1581, was a pitched {{battle of the}} Dutch Revolt, fought between a Spanish army {{commanded}} by Colonel Francisco Verdugo – consisting of Walloon, German, Spanish and Albanian soldiers – and a Dutch States rebel army under the Englishman John Norreys – comprising English, Scottish, Dutch and Walloon troops – {{in the province of}} Friesland. In 1580, the Dutch stadtholder of Friesland, George van Lalaing, Count of Rennenberg, had shifted its allegiance from the Dutch to the Spanish side. [...] This opened a new front at the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Republic, forcing the States-General to dispatch forces to the north. That year the Dutch, under the leadership of John Norreys, succeeded in relieving the town of Steenwijk. In July 1581, Rennenberg died and was replaced by the Spaniard Francisco Verdugo, whose arrival in Friesland with reinforcements changed the situation. On 30 September Verdugo forced Norreys to give battle using a strategy of attrition.|$|E
500|$|Scant {{details are}} {{known about the}} early history of the Dumas Brothel; however, two early {{boarders}} of the house listed their occupations as [...] "gambler" [...] and [...] "saloon man" [...] in census records. By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis, her servant, a Chinese cook and four prostitutes. The cost of sex in the brothel {{at the turn of the}} 20th century was fifty cents, with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount. [...] Despite the size of the brothel, by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment. In 1903 the Dumas and businesses like it in Butte's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures. These businesses were frequented by miners from the local Anaconda Copper Mining Company. That year, traffic grew to a point where the Dumas's operations had to be expanded, building [...] "cribs" [...] (tiny cubicles where the girls worked) in the basement of the house. There were several ways potential clients could access the brothel. A <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley, near South Wyoming Street, which was the busiest section of Butte's red light area. The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk. Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts, by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there. Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley, and commuted to the brothel for their shifts. In Butte, the activities of the city's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street. From the windows of their street-facing cribs, the girls would attract prospective clients in varying states of undress. The Butte Miner, a local newspaper, explained how the girls did this: ...|$|E
2500|$|There was {{a special}} case {{established}} under the State Management Scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973, most notably in Carlisle. During the 20th century elsewhere, both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed, and there were differences between parishes; in the 1960s, at closing time in Kensington at 10:30pm, drinkers would rush over the parish boundary {{to be in good}} time for [...] "Last Orders" [...] in Knightsbridge before 11pm, a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries. Some Scottish and Welsh parishes remained officially [...] "dry" [...] on Sundays (although often this merely required knocking at the <b>back</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pub).

50|$|He {{asks her}} to help him find his love and in return {{promises}} her to tell details about Subbalakshmi's whereabouts. Added advantage to Krishna {{is a set of}} love letters received by Subbalakshmi from Errababu which are presently in his custody and Meenakshi is hell bent to recover them back. Meanwhile, Krishna's friend Srinu (Chitram Srinu) is caught red handed who, after execution of brutal force by Neelakanta's men, reveals that the couple is in Vishakhapatnam. At Vishakhapatnam, Krishna manages to send the couple Guntur without <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> Neelakanta's henchmen and later at the pent house, he reveals that he is the mastermind behind <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> Subbalakshmi eloping with Errababu which is heard by Meenakshi who hid there and escapes through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Because <b>of</b> her, <b>the</b> truth is revealed and Krishna too finds out that his love is none other than Meenakshi.

All of them start searching for the couple and meanwhile Krishna earns <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> Neelakanta, his henchmen, and Meenakshi by saving her from a bunch of goons who try to molest her, and she slowly starts reciprocating his love, though never confesses it.

The first house was owned by Rodolfo Cázares Garza. The kidnappers were wearing military-style uniforms and ski-masks, but the victims noticed that they were sporting white-colored sneakers, speaking vulgarities, and looking for valuable house possessions, which suggested they were not law enforcement or military personnel. They stormed each of the bedrooms in the house to round up the victims before blindfolding them (except for two children). Once the kidnappers ordered the patriarch to open the family's safe, they forced all the family into their vehicles before taking off. By 7:00a.m., the Gulf Cartel kidnappers reached the second home of the Cázares in neighborhood Río and forced the family to open their front door.
