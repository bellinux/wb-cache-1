A critical element in these dive series is to show prior-dive search coverage, so that a successive dive can be targeted at a previously unvisited area. This is done by producing a cumulative coverage plot of the dive site (figure 4C). The plot, which is updated after every dive, is displayed as a <b>background</b> <b>map</b> on the navigation screen thus providing guidance for the ongoing dive.

40|$|Teachers usually {{illustrate}} major pedagogical concepts with graphics and/or images and/or tables and, {{in doing}} so, take {{a considerable amount}} of time in explanation. Despite the availability of many text extraction methods, they are limited such as when background is noisy, degraded, multicolored or containing graphics. This work presents an illustration extraction method for video streams to increasing learning efficiency among students. The proposed method separates the foreground from video streams. Above limitations of text extraction methods are solved by using contexture between image sequences in video streams and extracting illustrations from video streams. Two stages of the proposed method are training and extraction. Shot boundaries are detected to resample a video stream in a non-redundancy training set during the training phase. A <b>background</b> <b>map</b> together with a set of colors used frequently is then constructed based on the training set, subsequently used for illustration extraction. Next, a foreground map is generated according to the <b>background</b> <b>map</b> and frequent color set for each frame of the video stream during the extraction phase. Finally, illustrations are extracted by region labeling and geometric verification. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method...|$|E

The reason for this is to early foresee the running condition for the detector for the nominal LHC luminosity and beyond, in view of the super-LHC upgrade.

40|$|Saliency {{detection}} is {{an important}} preprocessing step in many application fields such as computer vision, robotics, and graphics to reduce computational cost by focusing on significant positions and neglecting the nonsignificant in the scene. Different from most previous methods which mainly utilize the contrast of low-level features, various feature maps are fused in a simple linear weighting form. In this paper, we propose a novel salient object detection algorithm which takes both background and foreground cues into consideration and integrate a bottom-up coarse salient regions extraction and a top-down background measure via boundary labels propagation into a unified optimization framework to acquire a refined saliency detection result. Wherein the coarse saliency map is also fused by three components, the first is local contrast map which is in more accordance with the psychological law, the second is global frequency prior map, {{and the third is}} global color distribution map. During the formation of <b>background</b> <b>map,</b> first we construct an affinity matrix and select some nodes which lie on border as labels to represent the background and then carry out a propagation to generate the regional <b>background</b> <b>map.</b> The evaluation of the proposed model has been implemented on four datasets.

40|$|The {{number of}} web {{services}} providing cartographic data is increasing. A main {{challenge is to}} enable a user to combine these services, not only from a technical perspective, but also from a cartographic one. One common use case for these services is to create mashups based on thematic polygons on top of background maps. In this study we compare four cartographic designs of thematic polygons: only boundaries, transparencies, hatches and icons. The aim of the comparison is to investigate whether the designs are good for identifying {{the extent of the}} polygons and if the design disturbs the reading of the <b>background</b> <b>map.</b> The comparison is based on an eye-tracking study, where 24 participants performed polygon identification tasks as well as background search tasks. The study revealed that hatches were more efficient than the other designs for polygon identification. Hatches had significantly shorter total fixation times as well as scanpath lengths, possibly since the participants were able to identify the extent of the polygon solely based on the interior (i. e. the hatches), while for the other designs the participants were extensively reliant on the boundaries. However, the results also indicate that the hatches design disturbs the reading of the <b>background</b> <b>map</b> more than the other designs; hatches also appear visually unpleasant for many users. Since each design had its strengths and weaknesses, we recommend producers of services for thematic data to provide several designs so users can select an appropriate design for their own use cases...|$|E

We create lensed microwave <b>background</b> <b>maps</b> using clusters drawn from numerical cosmological simulations. A distinctive dipole-like temperature fluctuation pattern is formed aligned with the underlying microwave temperature gradient. For a massive cluster, the characteristic angular size of the temperature distortion is a few arcminutes and the characteristic amplitude a few micro-Kelvin. We demonstrate a simple technique for estimating the lensing deflection induced by the cluster; microwave background lensing measurements {{have the potential to}} determine the mass distribution for some clusters with good accuracy on angular scales up to a few arcminutes.

The correlation function of peaks above a certain threshold depends only on the threshold and the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} computationally efficient saliency extraction method for detecting dim small target from single frame in heterogeneous background. The proposed method is based on background subtraction (BS), which identifies targets from the portion of a image that differs significantly from a background model. A set of horizon-directional filters (HDF) with multi-scales are first implemented to effectively recover the <b>background</b> <b>maps</b> from the input image. As a result, the foreground maps are extracted by computing the absolute difference between the input image and the estimated <b>background</b> <b>maps.</b> Then the foreground maps are fused into the total saliency map using a simple scheme. Finally, the experimental results of various cluttered background images show that the proposed method is efficient and has an outstanding performance in dim small target detection just by thresholding the saliency map.
