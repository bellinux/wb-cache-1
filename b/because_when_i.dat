500|$|I was {{surprised}} by how people reacted to [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did that song, to me, I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way—brand-new and fresh—and everyone interpreted it as I don't {{want to be a}} virgin anymore. Fuck my brains out! That's not what I sang at all. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was always absolutely ambiguous.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God.

2500|$|After his crash at Spa, Stewart {{became an}} outspoken {{advocate}} for auto racing safety. Later, he explained, [...] "If I have any legacy {{to leave the}} sport I {{hope it will be}} seen to be an area of safety <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> arrived in Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical." [...] By Stewart's reckoning, a driver who raced for five years had a two-thirds chance of being killed in a crash.|$|E
2500|$|... "After I stabbed Lauren, I ran up {{the bank}} to where I tied Nichole up. She must have heard what I had done to Lauren <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got to her she said, 'you're going to kill me, aren't you.' I said 'shut up' and walked around to her left side and I cut her throat two or three times. This was across her throat. The knife was in my left hand. Nichole was sitting down when I cut her throat.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} this song follow {{a series of}} {{different}} themes, as Grohl noted himself, [...] "Oh, my God, that song's about 15 different things! The only reason why it's called 'Hey, Johnny Park!' is <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young, my best friend was this kid who {{lived across the street}} from me called Johnny Park and we were like brothers from the age of 5 to 12. I haven't heard from him since I was about 14 years old and I thought if I named a song after him he might call." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can understand, my dear, and am {{glad you}} enjoyed your {{stay in the}} city, <b>because</b> {{sometimes}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> count your birthdays I can't help a fancy {{that you are not}} young enough," [...] she said.

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to forgive," [...] she {{returned}} gently.

2500|$|... "I {{really enjoyed}} playing tennis, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was {{six or seven}} years old and winning tournaments it felt good", said Ram. [...] "From when I was 8 or 10 I {{knew it was going to}} be a career for me. [...] It's a tennis life so it wasn't so easy. [...] You have to give up many things. When all my friends were playing outside I had to practice. I didn't go to all the school trips. But I was focused from a very young age. I grew up {{practicing}} at the Jerusalem tennis center. I spent most of my childhood there, practicing five days a week. I never regretted it and I enjoyed every moment. Now I am reaping the rewards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guerrero was {{regarded}} as one of the great in-ring performers. In a poll of the WWE roster, he was ranked the 11th greatest professional wrestler of all time. Ric Flair ranked Guerrero as one of his top 10 opponents, while Chris Jericho said he was the best performer in the world when he was [...] "on". Kurt Angle named Guerrero as the second greatest professional wrestler of all time, behind Shawn Michaels, stating: [...] " [...] could have been the absolute greatest of all time <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wrestled, he was still in that top three we were talking about, so Eddie had it all. He was so entertaining, but he also had all the technique. He was such a great wrestler and he got it. He got finishes. He knew how to structure them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton {{would later}} utilize a studio {{built at the}} Frederick Douglass Academy. Hamilton would spend countless hours in the studio, {{developing}} his craft and his own signature sound. Hamilton stated, [...] "The Lab (FDA's studio) means so much to me, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> literally didn't have anywhere else {{to go in the}} world, I can just go into my beloved alma mater and purge myself creatively." [...] The studio in the Frederick Douglass Academy is where most of Charles Hamilton's music is made. Hamilton has also stated, regarding FDA's studio, that [...] " [...] can do my thing in other studios. It's just something about home that makes my music breathe." [...] Hamilton attended Rice High School in Harlem, we're he would also participate in freestyle rap battles.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{agreement}} was never fully implemented, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> World War <b>I</b> broke out in July, Albania collapsed. Although short-lived, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus left behind a substantial historical record, such as its own postage stamps.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] said Okiok. [...] "When {{my father}} named me I was very small, {{and could not}} ask his reason. He never told any one.

60|$|But I {{never could}} settle it before, <b>because</b> always <b>when</b> <b>I</b> called at the Foreign Office in Vienna {{to talk about}} it, there wasn't anybody at home, {{and that is not}} {{a place where you can}} go in and see for {{yourself}} whether it is a mistake or not, because the person who takes care of the front door there is of a size that discourages liberty of action and the free spirit of investigation. To think the ausgleich is abgemacht at last! It is a grand and beautiful consummation, and I am glad I came.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{for many}} years Mona had made it a {{practice}} to enroll in occasional college-level courses, {{it was in the}} mid 1960s that she completed both a bachelor’s and a master's degree from Queens College. [...] She then taught remedial reading at two Queens elementary schools for eight years. [...] As she recalled, “Every time I would feel mentally stagnant, I would just go take a course at Hunter or [...] [...] [...] any school downtown. And I loved anthropology, I took a lot of courses in that; I loved psychology and I took a lot of courses in that; anything that I felt like that I wanted to do. So it was not until later years that one of the teachers at Queens College talked me into matriculating. And I’m glad he did <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did graduate, I graduated magna cum laude.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite winning on the undercard, a {{fight between}} Briggs and Haye didn't materialize. Brigg's {{continued}} to call out Haye, asking him to honor {{his end of the}} agreement. Briggs also chased Haye down in Brooklyn when both were in attendance for the Frampton vs. Santa Cruz fight. In October, Haye spoke out about the fight not taking place {{due to the fact that}} Briggs wanted the fight to be on ppv, [...] "Because the fight can't happen on pay-per-view ...

But at the moment the fight can't happen because he will only fight me if the fight is on pay-per-view. I would fight him on [...] DAVE, but he doesn't want to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I hear {{everything}} at once – melody, lyrics, {{it just comes}} in. There's a feeling that comes over me and I know that there's a song trying to come through. It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. <b>Because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
50|$|His {{turbulent}} life didn't end there, <b>because</b> <b>when</b> King Louis <b>I</b> died in 1382, Władysław again raised {{hopes to}} recover his patrimony.

However, and for unknown reasons, he never made another attempt to recover his Polish lands.|$|R

Yeo was delighted with her results, considering the injury sustained to her leg only eight weeks prior. She said [...] "I was devastated <b>because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got injured, {{we were on the}} verge of giving up these SEA Games for the good of my long-term competitive future. We had just two weeks of training and it took a toll on me not just physically but also mentally, because there was also the fear of a recurrence of the injury." [...] Her coach, David Lim revealed that Yeo's training regime was increased to three times a day in the last week to make up for lost time in terms of fitness.|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. <b>Because</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E

When you study Scripture, it's not out of the boundaries of God to punish a nation for sin and <b>because</b> of sin. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> look at our country, at what's happening, and what's happening in New Orleans in particular, it's not beyond the realm of possibility." ...|$|R
