The route was realigned slightly within Syracuse between 1938 and 1940 to use portions of Hiawatha <b>Boulevard</b> <b>and</b> West Genesee Street (as well as a new portion of State Fair Boulevard) to meet NY5 at the modern intersection of Erie <b>Boulevard</b> <b>and</b> Genesee Street.|$|E

5|$|SBS {{implementation}} on {{the corridor}} {{is planned for}} November 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops will be consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service will continue to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay <b>Boulevard</b> <b>and</b> 5th Road will be discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach <b>Boulevard</b> <b>and</b> Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay <b>Boulevard</b> <b>and</b> East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven <b>Boulevard,</b> <b>and</b> at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) would be new stations that {{were built in the}} median by the NYCDOT.|$|E
