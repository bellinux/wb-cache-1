30|$|X-ray {{radiography}} (Fig.  1 b, c) {{revealed the}} presence of an underlying portrait of a standing man executed at a 180 ° angle in comparison to the visible Ecce Homo composition. The man is slightly turning his head to the right facing the viewer. His facial characteristics are clearly defined. He is a middle-age adult man with wrinkles and bags under his eyes. He has a broad and straight nose, broad forehead and piercing eyes directly engaging the viewer. He appears to have short hair and a short moustache can be tentatively identified. His tight lips and posture add to an overall firm expression. The man is wearing a vest or jacket resembling a doublet (a jacket type worn from the late medieval period through the 17 th century in Europe). A broad collar and cuffs appear over the neck of the jacket and the ends of the sleeves, respectively. A textured belt with a semi-circular buckle is depicted around the figure’s waist. The sitter appears to be wearing pants or some form of breeches made of a garment decorated with floral patterns. The man is depicted in front of a desk; his left hand extended touching what could be a document or a book. A ring is clearly depicted on his left index finger. With his right hand, he is holding a quill as if he is ready to sign or write on what is placed on the desk. An ink bottle with another quill is depicted {{at the edge of the}} desk. Behind the standing figure, evidence of heavy drapery, possibly curtains, suggests the setting of a richly furnished interior room which could be the depicted man’s study considering {{the presence of}} the desk. Thin chains, seemingly decorated with beads or pearls, appear to support a lighting device hanging behind the left side of the man’s head. Overall, the portrait depicts a middle age professional man, possibly a merchant, a banker or an account keeper of some sorts, posing in his study with the attributes of his status and occupation, <b>book,</b> <b>ink,</b> quill as well as his upper class attire, clearly represented.|$|E
