40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analysis in attachment spacing of tower cranes. Both the support spacing under the <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> and the flexible support are obtained for this purpose. For deriving the <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> spacing, differential equation is used. The principle {{is used for}} calculating the support spacing, which the extended segment has the same Euler critical force with the independent segment. The flexible support distance is obtained by setting the integrated stiffness matrix zero, which is equivalent to structural instability. The order of the overall stiffness matrix is big when the tower crane is attached many times. In order to calculate more convenient for solving the matrix determinant, a transfer matrix method is adopted. To verify {{the influence of the}} flexibility caused by the support device, an example is carried out by both <b>rigid</b> and flexible <b>support</b> situations for this purpose, and the support spacing is computed numerically. Numerical results for the support distances of a tower crane will be presented and discussed...|$|R

The {{choice of a}} dual cantilever deformation favors the shear strain of the less stiff material between the more <b>rigid</b> <b>supports.</b> A theoretical model demonstrates that the less stiff material response is mainly recorded and moreover amplified. An exceptional sensitivity to the soft material is therefore observed. This method does not require any special sample (only stacking of coated supports or sample sandwiching) whilst it enables to characterize in situ polymer coating, even nanocoating. This characterization is of prime interest in technological coating developments such as paints, fiber sizings, glues, [...] . This possible measurement of thermal transitions peculiar to nanocoatings also opens more fundamental studies as the probing of interface influence on thermal transitions.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{improving}} {{the performance of}} the <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> cantilevered momentum wheel assemblies (CMWA) by soft suspension support. A CMWA, supported by two angular contact ball bearings, was modeled as a Jeffcott rotor. The support stiffness, before and after in series with a linear soft suspension support, were simplified as two Duffing's type springs respectively. The result shows that the <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> CMWA produces large disturbance force at the resonance speed range. The soft suspension CMWA can effectively reduce the force on the bearing (also disturbance forces produced by the CMWA) at high rotational speed, and also reduce the nonlinear characteristic of the stiffness. However, the instability of the soft suspension CMWA will limit the maximum rotational speed of the CMWA. Thus, a "proper" stiffness of the soft suspension system is a trade-off strategy between reduction of the force and extension of the speed range simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe major {{purpose of}} this study is to predict the dynamic {{behavior}} of an on-board rotor mounted on hydrodynamic journal bearings in the presence of <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> movements, the target application being turbochargers of vehicles or rotating machines subject to seismic excitation. The proposed on-board rotor model is based on Timoshenko beam finite elements. The dynamic modeling takes into account the geometric asymmetry of shaft and/or rigid disk as well as the six deterministic translations and rotations of the rotor <b>rigid</b> <b>support.</b> Depending on the type of analysis used for the bearing, the fluid film forces computed with the Reynolds equation are linear/nonlinear. Thus the application of Lagrange's equations yields the linear/nonlinear equations of motion of the rotating rotor in bending with respect to the moving <b>rigid</b> <b>support</b> which represents a non-inertial frame of reference. These equations are solved using the implicit Newmark time-step integration scheme. Due to the geometric asymmetry of the rotor and to the rotational motions of the support, the equations of motion include time-varying parametric terms which can lead to lateral dynamic instability. The influence of sinusoidal rotational or translational motions of the support, the accuracy of the linear 8 -coefficient bearing model and the interest of the nonlinear model for a hydrodynamic journal bearing are examined and discussed by means of stability charts, orbits of the rotor, time history responses, fast Fourier transforms, bifurcation diagrams as well as Poincaré maps...|$|R

All three models also yield relatively realistic values for Young's modulus. In terms of results, therefore, there is no clear choice between the models.
