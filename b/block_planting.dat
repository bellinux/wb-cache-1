50|$|Diploknema butyracea (Nepali:चिउरी, Chiuri), the Indian butter tree, is a {{multi purpose}} tree. The main {{product of the}} tree is ghee (butter), {{extracted}} from the seeds and named chiuri ghee or phulwara butter. D. butyracea is useful for <b>block</b> <b>planting</b> and also to be grown in the ravines of hills. The latex yielding plant such as D. butyracea suits to different edapho climatic conditions and thus does not compete with the traditional crops. It is a large tree of family Sapotaceae, flowers during cold season and fruit ripens in June-July. It commonly occurs in the sub Himalayan tract between 300-1500m from sea level.The chiuri tree has been utilised for many uses by rural households in Nepal. Ghee is used in daily cooking, as fuel for lamps, and body lotion; the fruit is eaten fresh and use for alcohol distillation, oil-cakes are utilised as manure, and the tree itself is used as firewood, etc. It has significant cultural and livelihood associations with the Chepang community (Nepali:चेपांग) of Nepal.This is not commercially farmed though. Recently bath soap using butter of Diploknema butyracea going to be popular. The fruit has creamy sweet taste with hint of condensed milk. The seed is oval shaped and produces aromatic oils which solidifies at normal room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Pollen {{source is}} known to affect the fruit size and quality of 'Imperial' mandarin, but no study has {{determined}} the appropriate orchard design to maximize the beneficial effects of pollen source. We determined the parentage of seeds of 'Imperial' mandarin using the isozyme shikimate dehydrogenase to characterize pollen flow and the effect on fruit size in an orchard setting. Two blocks were examined: 1) a block near an 'Ellendale' pollinizer block; and 2) an isolated pure <b>block</b> <b>planting.</b> Fruit size and seed number were maximum at one and three rows from the pollinizer (P 0. 05). Isozyme results were consistent with all seeds being the result of fertilization by the 'Ellendale' pollinizer.

40|$|Recent rising {{demand for}} timber in Northern Mindanao, Philippines has driven {{smallholder}} farmers to plant fast-growing timber species, mostly Gmelina arborea, within their farms. The trees are commonly planted in portions of farms as <b>block</b> <b>planting,</b> along farm boundaries, or established along contour strips. Both natural vegetation strips (NVS) and tree cropping systems are examined here from biophysical and economic perspectives. In this paper, farmer surveys are reported {{with the aim}} of determining how livestock are raised in relation to the agricutural and tree components in both NVS and Gmelina <b>block</b> <b>planting</b> systems. The contribution of the animals to the productivity of each cropping system is established. Following the survey, the computer model, Soil Changes Under Agroforestry, is used to predict crop and tree yields for a number of years. These yields, in combination with the economic data collected, are input to a benefit-cost analysis that determines the long-term economic productivity of the cropping systems, with and without the animal component. The integration of livestock within both cropping systems was found to enhance economic productivity. The Gmelina system was the more profitable of the two systems but required a greater investment...|$|E
40|$|Perennial pigeon peas {{were grown}} as a {{multipurpose}} tree species in strips or blocks with annual crops (sorghum, Sorghum bicolor; sunflowers, Helianthus annuus; and chickpeas, Cicer arietinum) on a shallow Vertisol at ICRISAT (Andhra Pradesh) from 1987 to 1989. In the <b>block</b> <b>planting,</b> pigeon peas and annual crops were spatially separated {{with a single}} interface between them. The strip planting had 4 pigeon pea strips 4 m wide alternating with annual crop strips 8 m wide, providing 7 interfaces. Spacing was the same in both planting patterns, i. e. 1 × 1 m for pigeon peas and 45 × 15 cm for annual crops. Crops were planted (and harvested) in the order sorghum (planted with the pigeon peas), chickpeas (first cropping), sunflowers, chickpeas (second cropping). Growth of the perennial pigeon peas was compared at the tree-crop interface (TCI) {{and in the middle}} of the <b>block</b> <b>planting.</b> Perennial pigeon pea plants at the interface had significantly more branches and larger stems than those in the middle of the <b>block</b> <b>planting</b> at the onset of the following rainy season. The greater number of flowers and grains in interface pigeon pea plants was partly due to a better lateral light level and partly due to better access to water. There was a negative effect on growth of annual crops at the TCI, which extended to 1. 5 m during the rainy season and to 2. 5 m during the post-rainy season. Significant reduction in the growth of annual crops occurred 30 - 40 days after sowing and was associated with shading by the taller pigeon pea plants. Measurements of the root profile of pigeon pea at the interface indicated that competition for moisture was the major cause of yield reduction of chickpeas during the post-rainy season, but an allelopathic effect may also have been involved. The results are compared with other TCI studies (especially with Leucaena leucocephala) and the possible mechanisms for moisture interaction at the TCI are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} a {{pioneering}} attempt to assess the socio-economic impact of the <b>Block</b> <b>Planting</b> Scheme (BPS) from {{the angle of the}} beneficiaries,implementing agencies and the policymakers. The report is based on the primary information gathered from 480 households drawn from <b>Block</b> <b>Planting</b> Units with mature (Mature BPUs) and immature (Immature BPUs) area under Natural Rubber (NR) as well as households attached to Group Processing Scheme (GPUs) with mature area under NR during the year 2008. The tripartite BPS involving the Rubber Board, the State Government of Tripura and the beneficiaries has been unique in its contents and mode of implementation since 1992. The average household income of mature BPUs was Rs. 99168 compared to Rs. 46824 of immature BPUs. Therefore, an annual income difference of Rs. 52344 (112 %) was observed between households with and without income from rubber (mature and immature BPUs). The compositions of income showed that rubber was the major source of income for GPUs (75 %) and mature BPUs (66 %). For immature BPUs,employment was the major source of income (77 %). In the long-run, the concerned agencies of the state government may initiate skill oriented programmes for empowering the unemployed/underemployed youth along with improvements in the infrastructural facilities. Such policy initiatives will enable diversification of the sources of income and ensure sustainability of NR cultivation as observed in the case of Kerala and FELDA in Malaysia. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} ICRISAT Center, Patancheru, India from June 1984 to April 1988 on a shallow Alfisol {{to determine whether the}} productivity of annual crop systems can be improved by adding perennial species such as Leucaena leucocephala managed as hedgerows. Except in the first year, crop yields were uppressed by Leucaena due to competition for moisture. The severity of competition was high in years of low rainfall and on long-duration crops such as castor and pigeonpea. Based on total biomass, sole Leucaena was most productive; even on the basis of land productivity requiring both Leucaena fodder and annual crops, alley cropping had little or no advantage over <b>block</b> <b>planting</b> of both components. Application of hedge prunings as green manure or mulch on top of 60 kg N and 30 kg P 2 O 5 ha - 1 to annual crops did not show any benefit during the experimental period, characterized by below average rainfall.

40|$|Operational family <b>block</b> <b>planting</b> with {{loblolly pine}} (Pinus taeda L.) was begun by Weyerhaeuser Company in the mid- 1970 ’s (Gladstone 1981) {{and has been}} one of the most {{significant}} forest management decisions made with southern pines. After more than 30 years, planting of individual open-pollinated families, and more recently full-sib families and clones, has become standard practice in the southern United States. In the early 2000 ’s, 59 % of the loblolly pine plantations were established as single open-pollinated (OP) family blocks (McKeand et al. 2003). About 80 % of the regeneration on company lands was with OP families, and 48 % of seedlings used for market sales were as OP families. Fourteen companies used family blocks for deployment of loblolly pine. On average, a company deployed 47 different families on its own land, but there was tremendous variation in the number of families deployed in a region, ranging from as few as 4 to as many as 90. Although these survey results have not been updated since 2002, the percentage of plantations established with individual families as opposed to seed orchard mixes has increased. Companies sell very few mixed seedlots, and state agencies have begun to sell individual OP families. We believe that about 75 % of the loblolly pine plantations are now established a...|$|E

Permanent research plots were established to evaluate features and dynamics of the Mediterranean maquis as well as mortality and development of 1 -year-old italian stone pine (ca. 500 ha - 1) seedlings. Two different plantation systems were applied: blocks of three seedlings at 8 x 8 m distance; one seedling at 5 x 5 m distance.

40|$|MillionTreesNYC, {{which has}} the goal of {{planting}} one million trees in New York City by 2017, is intended to make New York City a greener, more sustainable city and {{is part of the}} Mayor’s comprehensive long term strategic plan, PlaNYC. Through planting a tree at every suitable sidewalk location in the city, the City of New York is transforming blocks and communities, and providing a variety of environmental, social and aesthetic benefits. This article examines the large scale municipal planting of new street trees and the reaction by some of the pubic to this planting. Trees offer benefits to the city overall, but the public may not understand these benefits or the street tree planting process. Between 2007 and 2009, the Department of Parks & Recreation planted 53, 235 new street trees, and received 4, 108 items of correspondence from the public. The majority of this correspondence consisted of public comments about the City’s new street tree planting policies and processes including placement objections, maintenance concerns, reports of resultant damage from tree planting operations, requests for new street trees and reports of tree conditions. This study describes the operational policies that guide New York City's municipal street tree planting, and results of content and spatial analysis of the correspondence. Qualitative analysis of the correspondence revealed the public perceptions and concerns related to the MillionTreesNYC program. Spatial analysis explored the relationship between the planting locations of new street trees and the locations of the citizen correspondence. Public reactions to this large scale municipal planting are related to the dual public and private nature of the sidewalk, issues of territoriality, responsibility, aesthetics and place attachment. Correspondence volume was associated with the scale of the new street tree <b>block</b> <b>planting</b> program, and the effectiveness of NYC’s 311 Customer Service Center. The discussion suggests that increased public education on tree benefits and notification of planting processes could change perceptions of new street tree planting, and identified the potential for targeted research studies to further investigate public reactions to new street tree planting...|$|E

Even so, the numbers of blackbirds migrating through the northern Great Plains can overwhelm non-lethal techniques. That is, in some circumstances there are too many blackbirds for non-lethal techniques to be effective. One avicide, DRC- 1339, is registered for use as a lethal bait in the U. S. and North Dakota. The avicide is usually mixed with brown rice at a ratio of 1 : 25 (treated rice kernel to untreated rice kernels). Normally, the rice mixture is broadcast {{on the ground in the}} ripening or sprouting crop. Non-blackbirds are plentiful in ripening sunflower fields, causing a potential risk to these species with the use of DRC- 1339. These granivorous non-blackbirds might eat treated rice, causing an unintentional loss. A number of species of songbirds and sparrows could be at risk. Also, ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are species of high concern. One potential method of avoiding non-blackbirds is to put live decoys (blackbirds) in cages in areas devoid of habitat to attract free-living blackbirds to bait trays attached to the top of the decoy cages. The intent is to reduce large concentrations of blackbirds that cannot be otherwise dispersed by non-lethal means. The objective of this study is to identify and quantify the avian species visiting the bait trays. Our goal is to develop an effective and environmentally-safe method for managing locally abundant blackbird populations...|$|E
