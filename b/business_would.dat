5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting new technologies. Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a <b>business</b> <b>would</b> need to be discarded. Finally, a <b>business</b> <b>would</b> need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of new technologies {{tend to be the}} need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his capture and {{imprisonment}} in York, Montagu escaped participation in the biggest and probably bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses which took place on 29 March 1461 at Towton in Yorkshire. This decisive Yorkist victory led to Montagu being released the next day, when the son of the Duke of York – and England's de facto new king – Edward IV entered York in triumph. Montagu and Warwick then missed the King's coronation in April, as they stayed in the north to attempt the recapture of northern castles still in Lancastrian hands; as John Gillingham has put it, 'the 'unfinished military <b>business</b> <b>would</b> have to be left to the Nevilles.' And on 10 May 1461 Montagu was commissioned to raise troops against both the Lancastrian remnants and the king of Scotland. One of Montagu's first actions was to successfully raise the siege of Carlisle, 'with prompt action.' Carlisle had had its suburbs burnt and been under siege from June by a Scottish-Lancastrian force, but was easily relieved by him, apparently killing 6,000 Scots and Lord Clifford's brother in the process, before Warwick had even arrived.|$|E
5|$|In {{composing}} the Savoy operas, Sullivan {{wrote the}} vocal {{lines of the}} musical numbers first, and these {{were given to the}} actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage <b>business</b> <b>would</b> be. He left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants, often adding his suggestions or corrections. Those Sullivan wrote himself include Thespis, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, The Gondoliers, The Grand Duke and probably Utopia Limited. Most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard are written in a modified sonata form. The overtures from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas remain popular, and there are many recordings of them. Sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights.|$|E

25|$|Until 1989 in Scotland and 1990 in England and Wales, local councils {{raised their}} own revenue through a tax known as rates.

40|$|The U. S. Congress is {{considering}} several strategies {{to reform the}} federal income tax system. The most widely discussed strategy, a flat tax, would tax income received by businesses and individuals at the same low, flat rate. Flat tax proposals would eliminate most tax deductions and tax credits but would increase the personal exemption for individual taxpayers. While the debate continues over whether a flat tax {{would be fair to}} individual taxpayers, assessing the effect of a flat tax on economic growth and business activity is also important. > Most economists who analyze tax incentives conclude that a flat tax would encourage economic growth, which would {{have a positive effect on}} businesses in general. The effects on <b>businesses</b> <b>would</b> not be uniform, however, and many small <b>businesses</b> <b>would</b> be affected differently than large businesses. Small businesses are an important component in the U. S. economy, producing about half of private sector output and employing over half of the work force, so tax reformers need to understand how a flat tax would affect the small business sector of the economy. > Golob examines the effects of a flat tax on businesses in general and on small businesses in particular. He concludes that businesses in general are likely to benefit from a flat tax and that small businesses are likely to benefit more than large <b>businesses.</b> Most <b>businesses</b> <b>would</b> benefit from higher economic activity associated with a flat tax. Small <b>businesses</b> <b>would</b> benefit even more than large businesses, due in part to reduced compliance costs. In addition, a flat tax would eliminate tax deductions and tax credits less widely available to small businesses, thereby leveling the playing field between large and small businesses. Moreover, lower interest rates under a flat tax would offset more of the loss of interest deductibility for small businesses than for large businesses. Small business; Flat-rate income tax...|$|R
