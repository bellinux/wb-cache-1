50|$|ECM aims to {{make the}} {{management}} of corporate information easier through simplifying storage, security, version control, process routing, and retention. The benefits to an organization include improved efficiency, better control, and reduced costs. For example, many banks have converted to storing copies of old cheques within ECM systems {{as opposed to the}} older method of keeping physical cheques in massive paper warehouses. Under the old system, a customer request for a copy of a cheque might take weeks, as the bank employees had to contact the warehouse where the right <b>box,</b> <b>file,</b> and cheque, would need to be located. The cheque would then need to be pulled, a copy made and mailed to the bank where it would finally be mailed to the customer. With a suitable ECM system in place, the bank employee might simply query the system for the customer’s account number and the number of the requested cheque. When the image of the cheque appears on screen, the bank is able to mail it immediately to the customer, usually while the customer is still on the phone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the role of {{materiality}} in research on identity formation has been marginalized. We bring materiality to the fore of identity formation, through a posthumanist performative (Barad, 2007) reading {{of the way in which}} ‘agential cuts’ - specific material-discursive practices which determine particular boundaries and properties of ‘entities’, including of one’s identities - are made within and through material and human intra-actions. Through analysis of interview texts of a disabled academic’s everyday work experiences that refer to mundane material artefacts and practices such as <b>box</b> <b>files,</b> chairs, and standing in meetings, we intend to “critically reflect on [...] . the seemingly insignificant and all-too-mundane [...] . realities of everyday organizational life” (Ybema et al., 2015) for disabled people, to explore “the boundary-making practices that distinguish ‘disabled and ‘non-disabled’ people...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and implemented multi-agent strategies for manipulation tasks by distributing mechanically-based sequential algorithms across several autonomous spatially-separated agents, such as mobile robots. Our experience using mobile robots for {{the manipulation of}} large objects (couches, <b>boxes,</b> <b>file</b> cabinets, etc.) leads us to recommend a minimalist architecture for multi-agent programming. In particular, our methodology has led us to derive asynchronous distributed strategies that require no direct communication between agents, and very sparse geometric and dynamic models of the objects our robots manipulate. We argue for a design principle called supermodularity, which is orthogonal both {{to the notion of}} modularity in cognitive AI and also to horizontal decomposition (the non-modularity advocated in the subsumption /connectionist literature.) Finally, we discuss a simple mobot-Scheme infrastructure to implement supermodular architectures. In the past few years we have programm [...] ...|$|R

Over {{a year after the}} enactment of the Bill, the DCSF had not undertaken the consultation process which would establish the regulatory framework defining Independent Educational Institutions. This has theoretically meant that it has been possible for Tyndale to continue without any substantive changes to its provision. Draft versions of the Regulations state that the Department is minded to count breaktimes, assemblies and lunch hours as [...] "time during which education is provided". This would break with the criteria that is strictly applied to all state run and independent schools.The Department for Children Schools and Families held 11 <b>box</b> <b>files</b> of material on Tyndale the bulk of which it refused to release, arguing legal and ministerial exemptions.http://www.tes.co.uk/Article.aspx?storycode=6024110.|$|R
