5|$|In addition, {{some circles}} within the US State Department viewed Arafat as an able diplomat and {{negotiator}} {{who could get}} support from many Arab governments at once. An example of that, we find in March 1973 that Arafat tried to arrange for a meeting <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Iraq and the Emir of Kuwait in order to resolve their disputes.|$|E

5|$|In late September 2010, the Supreme Court {{considered}} removing presidential immunity. In October, Chief Justice Chaudry {{met with}} his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded. In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the judiciary by strengthening {{the power of the}} Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.|$|E

50|$|A Unified Political Command (Arabic قيادة سياسية موحدة, qiyāda siyāsiyya muwaḥḥada), also {{translated}} as Joint Political Command or Unified Political Leadership, was agreed in 1964 <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> of Egypt and Iraq (Gamal Abdel Nasser and Abdul Salam Arif) {{as well as}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> of Egypt and North Yemen (Nasser and Abdullah as-Sallal). Both projects were parallel but not linked with each other. The Unified Political Command was meant {{as a kind of}} transitional government which should prepare the gradual merger of Iraq with Egypt and North Yemen with Egypt in a new United Arab Republic.|$|R
5|$|On July 11, 1969, Kouandété accused Alley of {{plotting}} to kidnap and murder him. Facing the death penalty, Alley {{was sentenced to}} ten years of hard labor at an open trial held on October 4. Zinsou had intervened for Alley, and it strained relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and Kouandété. The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10. In the aftermath, Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army. In July 1968, he was named Secretary General of National Defence. Kouandété ended up becoming Alley's adjutant.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Jackson {{moved to}} reorganize {{the agency in}} line with the {{recommendations}} of the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report. They streamlined procedures for gathering and disseminating intelligence. On 10 October, Smith was asked to prepare estimates for the Wake Island Conference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and General Douglas MacArthur. Smith insisted that the estimates be simple, readable, conclusive, and useful rather than mere background. They reflected the best information available, but unfortunately, one estimate concluded that the Chinese would not intervene in Korea, another major intelligence failure.|$|E
5|$|The Presidency was {{established}} in 1990 and the President would, according to the altered constitution, be elected by the Soviet people by direct and secret ballot. However, {{the first and only}} Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev, was elected by the democratically elected Congress of People's Deputies. In connection with the dissolution of the Soviet Union national elections for the office of President never took place. To be elected to the office a person must have been a Soviet citizen and older than thirty-five but younger than sixty-five years. The same person could not be elected president for more than two terms. The Presidency was the highest state office, and was the most important office in the Soviet Union by influence and recognition, eclipsing that of Premier and General Secretary. With the establishment of the Presidency executive power was shared <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Prime Minister. The Presidency was given broad powers, such as being responsible for negotiating the membership of the Cabinet of Ministers with the Supreme Soviet; the Prime Minister, however, was responsible for managing the nomenklatura and economic matters.|$|E

This provision of the constitution is an occasional source of conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and the government. The president decides on the establishment of diplomatic missions and consular offices of the Republic of Croatia abroad, at the Government's proposal and with the countersignature of the prime minister. The president, following prior countersignature of the prime minister, appoints and recalls diplomatic representatives of the Republic of Croatia, at the proposal of the Government and upon receiving the opinion of an applicable committee of the parliament. The president receives letters of credence and letters of recall from foreign diplomatic representatives.|$|E
5|$|Franklin died on April 12, 1945 after {{suffering}} a cerebral hemorrhage at the Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia. Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, Vandenberg's {{position}} on American foreign policy changed radically.

Despite Romania's admission into NATO in 2004, and into the European Union in 2007, the political situation remained unstable, with recurrent institutional clashes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> Prime Minister and Parliament, such as in 2007 and 2012 and tough austerity measures that fuelled social tensions.|$|E
25|$|In May 1945, {{after a year}} {{of growing}} hostility <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> and the assembly, which was vainly {{awaiting}} deeds to substantiate Velasco's rhetorical advocacy of social justice, the mercurial chief executive condemned and then repudiated the newly completed constitution. After dismissing the assembly, Velasco held elections for a new assembly, which in 1946 drafted a far more conservative constitution that met with the president's approval. For this brief period, Conservatives replaced the left as Velasco's base of support.|$|E

25|$|The 1891 Chilean Civil War {{brought about}} a {{redistribution}} of power <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors.

25|$|A {{political}} fight {{which began}} as a conflict <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> and the Supreme Court turned into a battle between Roosevelt and the recalcitrant {{members of his own}} party in the Congress. The political consequences were wide-reaching, extending beyond the narrow question of judicial reform to implicate the political future of the New Deal itself. Not only was bipartisan support for Roosevelt's agenda largely dissipated by the struggle, the overall loss of political capital in the arena of public opinion was also significant.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of February 22, {{telegraph}} lines to Baltimore were cut at Pinkerton's behest to prevent communications from passing between potential conspirators in Pennsylvania and Maryland.

The most dangerous link in the journey was in Baltimore, where a city ordinance prohibited night-time rail travel through the downtown area.
