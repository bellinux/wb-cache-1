5|$|Another letter {{allegedly}} written <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Bo to {{his wife}} was sent to Sing Tao Daily on 17 January, the day Gui Minhai's confession was aired, in which Lee denounced his colleague's reprehensible lack of morals in connection with his car accident, and blamed Gui for the fate that had befallen him. In it, Lee {{also said that he}} had become good friends with his captors.|$|E

5|$|Burnside, {{against the}} advice of the president, prematurely {{launched}} an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> at Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Fate of Atlantis {{was praised}} by critics and {{received}} several awards for best adventure {{game of the}} year. It became a million-unit seller and {{is widely regarded as}} a classic of its genre today. Two concepts for a supposed sequel were conceived, but both projects were eventually canceled due to unforeseen problems during development. They were later reworked into two separate Dark Horse Comics series <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Marrs and Elaine Lee, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated film {{produced}} by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Written {{and directed by}} Andrew Stanton with co-direction <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Unkrich, the film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, and Willem Dafoe. It {{tells the story of}} the overprotective ocellaris clownfish named Marlin who, along with a regal blue tang named Dory, searches for his abducted son Nemo all the way to Sydney Harbour. Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.|$|E
5|$|Hooker was routed <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee {{to do the same}} in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development team should have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E

5|$|In South Korea, the No Gun Ri story {{inspired}} {{works of}} nonfiction, fiction, theater, and other arts. In 2010, a major Korean studio, Myung Films, released a No Gun Ri feature film, A Little Pond, {{written and directed}} <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Saang-woo and featuring Song Kang-ho, Moon So-ri and other Korean stars who donated their work. Besides commercial release in South Korea, the movie was screened at international film festivals, including in New York and London.|$|E
5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued <b>by</b> <b>Lee,</b> but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} at 12:30p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was fatally shot while {{traveling}} {{with his wife}} Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found {{that as many as}} 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004 Presidential campaign, President Chen Shui-bian {{publicly}} campaigned with Lee Teng-hui {{and developed}} a campaign platform, including a call for a new constitution adopted by referendum, which {{could be interpreted as}} an opportunity to make the symbolic changes which Lee supports. There was concern in the United States and in the People's Republic of China that Chen would be supportive of Lee's positions, a belief which was reinforced <b>by</b> <b>Lee's</b> own actions while President and <b>by</b> <b>Lee's</b> public statements that Chen Shui-bian agreed with him.|$|R

On February 10, Marvel Comics {{released a}}nother comic prelude, a single-issue infinite comic set between The Winter Soldier and Civil War. Written again by Pilgrim, the comic is told {{from the perspectives of}} Barnes, Rumlow, and Rogers, showing how each ended up where they begin Civil War. Art for each character's perspective is provided <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> Ferguson, Goran Sudžuka, and Guillermo Mogorron, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Sony Entertainment {{originally}} conceived The Spectacular Spider-Man as {{a series}} of four DVDs, and asked Weisman and Cook to develop it. The central idea was to follow Spider-Man in his younger years in the comics; Weisman and Cook wanted to incorporate the styles of the early comic publications <b>by</b> <b>Lee</b> and Ditko. Reviewers have cited other influences in the themes, such as the live action film series and the Ultimate Spider-Man continuity.|$|E
