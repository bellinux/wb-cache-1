5|$|During John's {{persecution}} of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose {{to him as}} a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal {{does not seem to have}} embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.|$|E
5|$|If the Parliament Act 1949 {{were found}} not to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> Parliament {{on any of}} the above grounds, all {{legislation}} passed using the Parliament Acts since the introduction of the 1949 Act, including the Hunting Act, would also not be valid Acts of Parliament, being passed only in accordance with the 1949 Act (rejection in two successive sessions and a delay of one year) as opposed to the more onerous requirements of the 1911 Act (rejection in three successive sessions and a delay of two years).|$|E
5|$|Students {{initiated}} a major demonstration in 1968 over two main issues. The first was Columbia's proposed gymnasium in neighboring Morningside Park; this {{was seen by}} the protesters to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> aggression aimed at the black residents of neighboring Harlem. A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in the Pentagon's weapons research think-tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside Low Library, Hamilton Hall, and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} {{hypothesis is}} {{linked with the}} above-mentioned acceptance of the veracity of Gero's invasion of Poland.

25|$|The Norfolk {{hotel in}} Nairobi, {{owned by a}} {{prominent}} member of the local Jewish community, was bombed on 31 December 1980. The bomb flattened the western wing of the hotel, killing 20 people, of several nationalities, and wounding 87 more.

25|$|It also {{refers to}} {{separating}} {{things that are}} desirable from undesirable ones.

25|$|Also, in {{addition}} to this combination of clauses being used to uphold federal laws affecting economic activity, they also were used to justify federal criminal laws. For example, Congress in the Federal Kidnapping Act made it a federal crime to transport a kidnapped person across state lines, because the transportation would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> interstate activity over which the Congress has power. It has also provided justification {{for a wide range of}} criminal laws relating to interference with the federal government's rightful operation, including federal laws against assaulting or murdering federal employees.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, on January 6, 1980, he {{was killed}} by the Mafia in Palermo. Initially {{believed}} to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> neo-fascist terrorism, his assassination was spurred by his strong commitment against the relationships of numerous Sicilian politicians (mostly members of DC itself) with the Mafia. While in office, Mattarella had decided to launch a moral renewal of the Sicilian Christian Democracy. He wanted to clean up the government’s public contracts racket that benefited Cosa Nostra, passing a law enforcing the same building standards used in the rest of Italy, thereby making the Mafia's building schemes illegal.|$|E

25|$|Violence {{during the}} Rwandan Genocide of 1994 took a gender-specific form when, {{over the course}} of 100 days, up to half a million women were raped, sexually mutilated, or murdered. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) handed down the first {{conviction}} for the use of rape as a weapon of war during the civil conflict, and, because the intent of the mass violence against Rwandan women was to destroy, in whole or in part, a particular ethnic group, {{it was the first time}} that mass rape during wartime was found to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> genocidal rape.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear. The idea that something, or someone, might be destroying intelligent life in the universe has been explored in the scientific literature. A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator, as are humans.|$|E
25|$|I, Liliuokalani of Hawaii, by {{the will}} of God named heir {{apparent}} on the tenth day of April, A.D. 1877, and {{by the grace of}} God Queen of the Hawaiian Islands on the seventeenth day of January, A.D. 1893, do hereby protest against the ratification of a certain treaty, which, so I am informed, has been signed at Washington by Messrs. Hatch, Thurston, and Kinney, purporting to cede those Islands to the territory and dominion of the United States. I declare such a treaty to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> wrong toward the native and part-native people of Hawaii, an invasion of the rights of the ruling chiefs, in violation of international rights both toward my people and toward friendly nations with whom they have made treaties, the perpetuation of the fraud whereby the constitutional government was overthrown, and, finally, an act of gross injustice to me.|$|E

25|$|Jean-Paul Akayesu {{became the}} first person convicted for using rape as form of genocide. Initially, gender based {{violence}} had not {{been included in the}} indictment against Akayesu; however, following pressure by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the indictment was amended. During the trial of Akayesu, the ICTR affirmed that sexual violence, including rape, fell under paragraph B of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as the rapes had been carried out with the sole intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a specific group. The ICTR also found that the sexual violence against Tutsi women was a systematic part of the genocide. To this extent, the finding against Akayesu, that rape can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> genocide, represented a major change in international jurisprudence and prosecutions of genocide. On 2 September 1998, Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape.|$|E
25|$|Giant, segmented, insect-like, {{antennae}} {{rise over}} a distant mountain range. There is no direct {{connection between the}} antennae and the aliens, but the newly discovered race is named Ark Megaforms. The demonstration of the antennae appears to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> intimidation. It soon becomes apparent that Ark Megaforms want the humans to leave the planet as soon as possible. The Megaforms use the Kid as their negotiator with the humans. The Kid visits the base of ER-2 several times. He allows the humans to study him and question him about his foster parents {{in exchange for the}} promise to leave. The communication does not proceed smoothly as the Kid exhibits the mixture of human and alien psychological traits. His very way of thought seems inconceivable to humans. Though he can speak, most of the questions he is either unable or unwilling to answer. Moreover, there is a conflict of interest as the humans want to find out about Ark Megaforms as much as possible while the Kid just wants them to leave.|$|E
25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to be pleased with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar was giving him bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E
