As a result, {{even the most}} efficient IPv 4 lookup scheme can not meet the demand in IPv 6. In this paper, we make a thorough study of real world IPv 4 /IPv 6 routing tables and find out the useful characteristic of leaf nodes for the first time. The leaf nodes can be arranged in a single <b>balance</b> <b>tree</b> and thus change the LPM (longest prefix matching) model to exact matching one in routing lookup. This exact matching model can not only {{reduce the number of}} searching keys, but can also reduce the memory cost and support fast update. What's more, the searching procedure can stop immediately when meeting a match. The <b>balance</b> <b>tree</b> in our scheme is a general concept. Here, we implement with three typical trees: B-tree, red black tree and avl tree and make a detailed comparison from every aspect. The experimental results show that its average lookup speed and memory cost is less than one third of the newly proposed rangebased algorithm PIBT[1]. And among these three <b>balance</b> <b>tree</b> schemes, avl tree has the best lookup speed and memory consumption while B-tree scheme has the least update time...|$|E

Recent researches on overlay networks have revealed that user-perceived network performance, such as end-to-end delay performance, could be improved by an overlay routing mechanism. However, these studies only consider end-to-end delay, or only bandwidth, and there are few works focusing on delay variation constraint. We proposed an algorithm, which defines an optimal <b>balance</b> <b>tree</b> to optimize a trade-off between delay and bandwidth consumption with constraints on both delay and delay variation. Furthermore, we introduce a new Delayâ€“Variation Estimation Scheme and core selection strategies for multicast routing in leased overlay networks...|$|E

The algorithm is then improved, exploiting particular properties of S.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzed}} {{the dynamics of}} tree radial growth at different time-scales in relation to climate and drought in two tropical dry forests (TDFs) from Colombia (TuluÃ¡) and Bolivia (INPA). The specific objectives were: (i) To assess intra-annual patterns of radial growth (radial- increment dynamics and xylogenesis) in ten coexisting tree species from TuluÃ¡ and INPA and determine their relationship with climate and leaf phenology. (ii) To analyze the effects of climate and drought on long-term radial growth at different time-scales using dendrochronology in seven coexisting deciduous tree species from INPA. (iii) To evaluate the long-term radial growth responses to changes in climate water balance and determine their relationship with sapwood density in seven coexisting deciduous tree species from INPA. At intra-annual scales it was found that: (i) cambium reactivation and xylem growth of tree species occurred during the wet season, reflecting the influence of high precipitation and a positive water balance {{on the development of}} new xylem cells. (ii) In the semi-deciduous tree species from TuluÃ¡ the xylem growth period overlapped with the wet season, whereas, in the deciduous tree species from INPA, the growth period started at the mid wet season, when the tree crowns were fully developed. (iii) Temperature, as a determinant factor in the hourly fluctuations of both the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the evapotranspiration rate, could exert a huge influence on tree radial growth dynamics during the growing season. In TuluÃ¡, the growing season was particularly associated with low temperatures and hence low VPD, while in INPA the growing season was related to high temperatures and VPD. Nevertheless, the high temperatures registered throughout the day at both TDFs negatively affected radial increment at hourly scales. Tree species could face the adverse dry conditions by restricting growth to periods of the day when temperatures are low. (iv) Stem shrinkage and swelling occurred at hourly to daily scales in all tree species, and most INPA tree species registered strong reversible shrinkage at monthly scales. Particularly, the climate controls on radial-increment dynamics varied between daily and monthly scales. At daily scales, there was a positive effect of high precipitation and positive water balance and a negative effect of VPD on the increment phase, while at monthly scales the precipitation was the main variable affecting radial increment positively. At inter-annual scales it was found that: (i) The tree radial growth showed a positive relationship with precipitation and climate water balance and a negative association with temperature, indicating that the tree species studied share high common growth variability in response to local climate. Nevertheless, the strongest response of growth to climate was species-specific, indicating that there was a differential sensitivity among tree species to these climate variables. (ii) The radial growth of all tree species responded positively to water balance during the wet season, but such responses differed among species as a function of their stem sapwood density. Specifically, sapwood density was negatively related to growth variability explained by water <b>balance.</b> <b>Tree</b> species with low-density wood and high production of sapwood were the most sensitive to water balance, whereas species with the opposite characteristics were the least sensitive ones. (iii) Tree species tolerated short-term droughts while they were particularly sensitive to long-lasting droughts. This indicates that tree species from the INPA site are predominantly sensitive in terms of growth reduction to long-lasting droughts. The most temperature-sensitive tree species, also showed the highest growth sensitivity to long-lasting droughts. In contrast, growth of the tree species with the lowest sensitivity to water balance, did not respond to long-term drought variability. Esta tesis evaluÃ³ la dinÃ¡mica del crecimiento radial a diferentes escalas temporales y determinÃ³ su relaciÃ³n con el clima y la sequÃ­a en dos bosques secos tropicales de Colombia (TuluÃ¡) y Bolivia (INPA). A escalas intra-anuales se encontrÃ³ que: (i) la reactivaciÃ³n del cambium y el crecimiento del xilema ocurre durante la Ã©poca hÃºmeda del aÃ±o en ambos bosques. Esto refleja la influencia de las altas precipitaciones y los valores positivos del balance hÃ­drico atmosfÃ©rico en el desarrollo de las nuevas cÃ©lulas del xilema. (ii) El perÃ­odo de crecimiento en TuluÃ¡ estuvo asociado a temperaturas bajas y, por ende, a un dÃ©ficit de presiÃ³n del vapor (DPV) bajo, mientras que en INPA la estaciÃ³n de crecimiento estuvo asociada a valores altos de temperatura y DPV. Sin embargo, en ambos sitios de estudio, las temperaturas altas registradas a lo largo del dÃ­a afectaron negativamente el incremento radial a escalas horarias. Las especies pueden hacer frente a estas condiciones adversas, por ejemplo, restringiendo el crecimiento a perÃ­odos del dÃ­a que registren temperaturas bajas, ya que la pÃ©rdida de agua asociada a la evapotranspiraciÃ³n tambiÃ©n serÃ­a baja. A escalas inter-anuales se determinÃ³ que: (i) el crecimiento radial de todas las especies de INPA presentÃ³ una asociaciÃ³n positiva con la precipitaciÃ³n y el balance hÃ­drico atmosfÃ©rico y una relaciÃ³n negativa con la temperatura. Esto indica que todas las especies comparten una seÃ±al comÃºn de la variabilidad del crecimiento en respuesta al clima local. No obstante, la fuerza de la respuesta fue especie-especÃ­fica. Esto indica que existe una sensibilidad diferencial entre las especies al clima. (ii) El crecimiento radial de todas las especies de INPA respondiÃ³ positivamente al balance hÃ­drico atmosfÃ©rico durante la estaciÃ³n hÃºmeda, pero esa respuesta fue diferente entre las especies en funciÃ³n de la densidad de la albura. La densidad de la albura fue negativamente relacionada a la variabilidad del crecimiento explicada por el balance hÃ­drico. (iv) Las especies de INPA fueron resilientes a las sequÃ­as de corto plazo (estaciÃ³n seca anual), mientras que el crecimiento fue particularmente sensible a las sequÃ­as de larga duraciÃ³n (sequÃ­as multi-anuales), excepto en las especies con alta densidad de la albura...|$|E
