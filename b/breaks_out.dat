This paper focuses on the {{challenges}} associated with <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> of cycles of violence and why futures thinking may provide a potential solution. Research suggests that people living in violence lack the ability to think about a peaceful future, or any future for that matter. Addressing this inability may hold a critical key to <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> of cycles of violence. While there is mounting theory to support this idea, evidence based research is still lacking...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} keep shared access {{computers}} secure and stable system administrators resort to locking down the computing environment {{in order to prevent}} intentional and unintentional damage by users. Skilled attackers are often able to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down computing environments and intentionally misuse shared access computers. This misuse has resulted in cases of mass identity theft and fraud, some of which have had an estimated cost ranging in millions. In order to determine if it is possible to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down computing environments an assessment method is required. Although a number of vulnerability assessment techniques exist, none of the existing techniques are sufficient for assessing locked down shared access computers. This is due to the existing techniques focusing on traditional, application specific, software vulnerabilities. <b>Break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities (which are exploited by attackers in order to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down environments) differ substantially from traditional vulnerabilities, and as a consequence are not easily discovered using existing techniques. Ontologies {{can be thought of as}} a modelling technique that can be used to capture expert knowledge about a domain of interest. The method for discovering <b>break</b> <b>out</b> paths in locked down computers can be considered expert knowledge in the domain of shared access computer security. This research proposes an ontology based assessment process for discovering <b>break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities in locked down shared access computers. The proposed approach is called the ontological lockdown assessment process. The ontological lockdown assessment process is implemented against a real world system and successfully identifies numerous <b>break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities...|$|R
