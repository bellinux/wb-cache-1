5000|$|There are {{numerous}} {{reports and studies}} regarding the negative impacts associated with single-use plastic <b>bags.</b> A summary of two reports with relevance to this case are provided here. The first is a staff report to the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors on plastic <b>bags</b> which identified several findings including plastic carryout <b>bags</b> being a significant contributor to litter and having detrimental impacts on marine wildlife and the environment. The report also concluded that biodegradable carryout <b>bags</b> were not a practical solution to the issue as there are no local composting facilities available to process biodegradable <b>bags.</b> The final two findings of the report focused {{on the benefits of}} reusable <b>bags</b> over plastic as well as paper <b>bags</b> and that the acceleration of the widespread use of reusable <b>bags</b> will lessen the amount of litter from plastic <b>bags.</b> [...] The second report is a comprehensive compilation of information and literature regarding single-use <b>bags</b> found in the Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) on Single Use and Reusable <b>Bags.</b> The intent of the MEA is to provide a comprehensive reference available to cities and counties {{that can be used to}} help in understanding the impacts associated with actions targeted at cutting the use of single-use <b>bags.</b> The MEA reports several findings specific to plastic <b>bags,</b> including that ”nearly 20 billion single-use high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic grocery <b>bags</b> are used annually in California, and most end up in landfills or as litter. In fact, of the four types of <b>bags</b> considered, plastic <b>bags</b> had the greatest impact on litter.” The MEA reports that single-use paper <b>bags</b> are recycled more than plastic <b>bags,</b> but considering lifecycles, paper <b>bags</b> contribute to larger greenhouse gas emission, water consumption and ozone production as compared to plastic <b>bags.</b> In comparing plastic <b>bags</b> to biodegradable <b>bags,</b> the MEA found that biodegradable <b>bags</b> had a higher environmental impact at the manufacturing stage and that biodegradable <b>bags</b> may degrade only under composting conditions and will have similar effects on aesthetics and marine life when littered.|$|R
