25|$|The {{day after}} Siegel's death, the Los Angeles Herald-Express carried a {{photograph}} on its front {{page from the}} morgue of Siegel's <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> foot with a toe tag. Although Siegel's murder occurred in Beverly Hills, his death thrust Las Vegas into the national spotlight as photographs of his lifeless body were published in newspapers throughout the country. The day after Siegel's murder, David Berman and his Las Vegas mob associates, Sedway and Gus Greenbaum, walked into the Flamingo and took over operation of the hotel and casino.|$|E
500|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{for lunch}} Gordon-Cumming {{returned to the}} witness box, where he was cross-examined by Russell. During the session Russell provided {{a model of the}} table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had [...] "lost my head... on that occasion. If I had not lost my head I would not have signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the witness box lasted until 1pm. The Illustrated London News considered that [...] "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the <b>bare</b> <b>right,</b> perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".|$|E
500|$|MacNeil {{hoped to}} take what he {{considered}} to be the best elements of the two versions of the obverse which had been accepted by the Mint the previous year. [...] The figure of Liberty would be taken from the second version; all other elements would come from the first. [...] No change was to be made to Liberty's <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> breast, but the dolphins would not regain their place. [...] However, Morgan proved unable, given engraving technology at the time, to combine the two obverses, meaning the coin would have to be entirely redone by MacNeil. [...] His new version, completed in mid-February, for the first time covered Liberty's breast, giving her a chain mail shirt. [...] Burdette suggests that this change was not unusual for MacNeil, who was increasingly cladding female figures in garments which covered their breasts, as with his statue Intellectual Development, sculpted around that time, and also reflected the deterioration of the international situation in February 1917, as the United States moved towards war with Germany. [...] The reverse saw modifications to the eagle, which was raised in its position on the coin; three of the thirteen stars on the reverse were placed between the bird and the words [...] "Quarter Dollar". [...] Also a dot between the words [...] "QUARTER DOLLAR" [...] and between the words [...] "UNITED STATES" [...] was removed.|$|E

5000|$|Under Margaret Thatcher's government, {{a policy}} of deregulating housing markets, {{supposedly}} to improve quality and increase supply, took place. The hallmark was abolition of rent regulation, primarily so that landlords could increase rents to whatever was possible in the market, based {{on the theory that}} supply and demand would self-regulate appropriate prices. Security of tenure, where tenants would have to be given good reasons before eviction, was decreased, so that the <b>bare</b> <b>rights</b> under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 remained unless people had contracted for better rights.|$|R

60|$|The {{first five}} {{players on the}} list for the Grays were left-handed batters, and against a {{right-handed}} pitcher whose most effective ball for them was a high fast one over the outer corner they would naturally hit toward left field. It was no surprise to see Hanley bat a skyscraper out to left. Red had to run to get under it. He braced himself rather unusually for a fielder. He tried to catch the ball in his <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> hand and muffed it, Hanley got to second on the play while the audience roared. When they got through there was some roaring among the Rochester players. Scott and Captain Healy roared at Red, and Red roared back at them.|$|E
60|$|Then, one morning, as Kayerts and Carlier, {{lounging}} {{in their chairs}} under the verandah, talked about the approaching visit of the steamer, a knot of armed men {{came out of the}} forest and advanced towards the station. They were strangers to that part of the country. They were tall, slight, draped classically from neck to heel in blue fringed cloths, and carried percussion muskets over their <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> shoulders. Makola showed signs of excitement, and ran out of the storehouse (where he spent all his days) to meet these visitors. They came into the courtyard and looked about them with steady, scornful glances. Their leader, a powerful and determined-looking negro with bloodshot eyes, {{stood in front of the}} verandah and made a long speech. He gesticulated much, and ceased very suddenly.|$|E
60|$|He {{had walked}} {{straight}} out of town with the news, straight out before him in the noonday sun on the white road, and his feet had brought him {{face to face with}} her in the hall of the ruined palazzo, a room magnificent and naked, with here and there a long strip of damask, black with damp and age, hanging down on a bare panel of the wall. It was furnished with exactly one gilt armchair, with a broken back, and an octagon columnar stand bearing a heavy marble vase ornamented with sculptured masks and garlands of flowers, and cracked from top to bottom. Charles Gould was dusty with the white dust of the road lying on his boots, on his shoulders, on his cap with two peaks. Water dripped from under it all over his face, and he grasped a thick oaken cudgel in his <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> hand.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Bronze {{statuette}} {{of a girl}} {{wearing a}} short tunic. This type of figurine was manufactured in Sparta. [...] The single-shouldered garment, <b>baring</b> the <b>right</b> breast, was the characteristic dress of competitors in the Heraean Games, suggesting {{that she is a}} runner.

6000|$|... "Go ahead, then! I'll back you," [...] said Rattling Bill, {{without the}} least touch of bravado, as he <b>bared</b> his <b>right</b> {{arm to the}} shoulder.

50|$|Jansson {{wrote and}} {{illustrated}} a black-and-white comic strip version for newspapers. The 86-day story {{does not follow}} the book's plot; for example, the Moomins get their news from a radio, not {{a trip to the}} observatory, and Little My appears throughout the story, albeit often observing.

5000|$|The crest {{which the}} new Lord Kirkcudbright adopted was 'an erect right arm {{grasping}} a dagger, {{on the point of}} which was Black Morrow's head (later representations show a blackamoor's head) 'couped proper', tag on the bottom with the family motto [...] "think on".

60|$|But he {{left the}} room with Razumov, {{shutting}} the door behind him. The landing was prolonged into a <b>bare</b> corridor, <b>right</b> and left, desolate perspectives of white and gold decoration without a strip of carpet. The very light, pouring through a large window at the end, seemed dusty; and a solitary speck reposing on the balustrade of white marble--the silk top-hat of the great feminist--asserted itself extremely, black and glossy in all that crude whiteness.|$|R

At center, {{the creek}} is shown {{from the surface of}} the water, looking towards the outlet pipe that dumps water in from the bank at <b>right.</b> <b>Bare</b> trees line the banks to either side, and a {{structure}} that appears to be a grain silo can be seen above the tops of the trees in the center distance...|$|R
50|$|Most Locke {{scholars}} roundly reject this reading, as it {{is directly}} {{at odds with the}} text. The extent of Locke's involvement in drafting the Fundamental Constitutions is a matter of some debate, but even attributing full culpability for its contents and for his having profited from the Atlantic slave trade, the majority of experts will concede that Locke may have been a hypocrite in this matter, but are adamant that no part of the Two Treatises can be used to provide theoretical support for slavery by <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> of conquest.|$|E

Wright, {{retreating}} quickly with his back to home plate, extended his <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> hand and caught the ball cleanly while crashing to the field. Wright maintained control of the ball after landing hard on the outfield grass. The sellout crowd at Petco Park acknowledged the splendor of the catch with a standing ovation lasting several minutes. This play was voted the [...] "This Year in Baseball Play of the Year." ...|$|E

5000|$|Like the men's competition, Heraea {{originally}} {{consisted of}} foot races only. The Heraea champions won olive crowns, cow or ox {{meat from the}} animal sacrificed to Hera {{and the right to}} dedicate statues inscribed with their names or painted portraits of themselves on the columns of Hera's temple. It is still apparent where the portraits were attached on the temple, though the artwork itself has disappeared. [...] The women competed in three age groups, on a track in Olympic Stadium that was 5/6 the length of the men's track. Pausanias describes their appearance for the races such that, [...] "their hair hangs down, a tunic (chiton) reaches to a little above the knee, and they <b>bare</b> the <b>right</b> shoulder as far as the breast.".|$|R

5000|$|Wrigley Field shares {{its name}} with the Wrigley Company, as {{the park was}} named for its then-owner, William Wrigley Jr., the CEO of the Wrigley Company. As early as the 1920s, before the park became officially known as Wrigley Field, the {{scoreboard}} was topped by the elf-like [...] "Doublemint Twins", posed as a pitcher and a batter. There were also ads painted on the <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> field wall early in the ballpark's history, prior to the 1923 remodeling which put bleachers there. After that, the Doublemint elves were the only visible in-park advertising. The elves were removed permanently in 1937 when the bleachers and scoreboard were rebuilt. It would be about 44 years before in-park advertising would reappear.|$|E
5000|$|This {{painting}} was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote; [...] "183. Cornells Guldewagen (who died in 1663), Burgomaster of Haarlem in 1642. M. 36. Half-length. A man of sixty with moustache and imperial, seated, facing the spectator. He is in black {{with a white}} collar and wristbands, and wears a black cap. His <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> hand is on his breast. His gloved left hand holds the other glove. Probably a small picture, painted between 1655 and 1660. Described from a water-colour copy by C. van Noorden in the Haarlem archives, which occurred in the sale Ekama of Haarlem, Amsterdam, April 8, 1891. See Moes, Iconographia Batava, No. 2994. Exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, London, 1871. Then in the Schwabe collection, London.|$|E
5000|$|The Boy {{with the}} Leaking Boot is a statue showing a young boy, with a <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> foot, {{holding up his}} right boot and looking at it. The statue is about 4 ft tall, {{and in many cases}} forms a fountain, with water {{emerging}} from the toe of the boot. There are at least 24, and reportedly [...] "hundreds" [...] of examples. The origins of the statue are obscure. The boy is reported to be a young Italian newspaper seller who drowned, or an American army drummer-boy who carried water in his leaking boot to help fallen comrades, or a young fire-fighter either using his boot in a bucket chain or emptying his boot after an incident, or possibly none of these. The statue has also been called The Boy with the Leaky Boot, Boy Immigrant and Unfortunate Boot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts a}} young woman as a bride. According to the museum it depicts Laura di Noves. [...] Like Giorgione's other works, it is unsigned, {{but it is one}} of the less controversial attributions to Giorgione. An inscription on the reverse, accepted as early 16th-century, identifies Giorgione as the painter and provides the date, making this the only work by the artist bearing a reliable date. Behind the young woman is a branch of laurel (Laurus), symbol of chastity, and carrying the nuptial veil. The gesture of opening the fur mantle uncovers the bosom. This may indicate fecundity (and, therefore, maternity) as an offer of love and a marriage blessed with children. As the laurel symbolized virtue, so the visible breast could symbolize the bride's conjugal fidelity.It is only from the prudish perspective of the 19th or early 20th century that the baring of a breast would be viewed as meretricious. In the 16th century, nudity did not provoke disapproval, but was shown publicly and uninhibitedly. This painting, too, was publicly shown, probably by a proud noble who wished to celebrate his bride's attractiveness - her full build was entirely in keeping with contemporary Venetian ideals of beauty - as well as her virtue and chastity. The laurel was considered a symbol of virtue, as seen in Lorenzo de' Medici's [...] "", where it was accompanied by the motto: [...] "Ita ut virtus". The veil wound about her shoulders and upper body is a bridal veil, and her <b>bared</b> <b>right</b> breast alludes to the proverbial chastity of the Amazons, who, according to antique legend, tolerated men only as a means of sexual reproduction, not, however, as a means of sexual gratification. Since contemporary morality permitted sexual reproduction only within the institution of marriage, the allusion to the Amazons implied a wife's commitment to conjugal fidelity.|$|R

5000|$|The Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards {{wrote in}} his 2010 {{autobiography}} that [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] had a huge effect on him. Beyond Presley's singing itself, it was the total effect of his sound and his silence that so totally affected Richards: Then, [...] "Since my baby left me"âit was just the sound...That was the first rock and roll I heard. It was a totally different way of delivering a song, a totally different sound, stripped down, no bullshit, no violins and ladies' choruses and schmaltz, totally different.

50|$|Erwin {{pulled the}} pin and {{released}} a bomb into the chute, but the fuse malfunctioned and ignited the phosphorus prematurely, burning at 1,100 degrees. The canister flew {{back up the}} chute and into Erwin's face, blinding him, searing off one ear and obliterating his nose. Smoke immediately filled the aircraft, {{making it impossible for}} the pilot to see his instrument panel. Erwin was afraid the bomb would burn through the metal floor into the bomb bay. Completely blind, he picked it up and feeling his way, crawled around the gun turret and headed for the copilot's window. His face and arms were covered with ignited phosphorus and his path was blocked by the navigator's folding table, hinged to the wall but down and locked. The navigator had left his table to make a sighting. Erwin couldn't release the table's latches with one hand, so he grabbed the white-hot bomb between his <b>bare</b> <b>right</b> arm and his ribcage. In the few seconds it took to raise the table, the phosphorus burned through his flesh to the bone. His body on fire, he stumbled into the cockpit, threw the bomb out the window and collapsed between the pilot's seats.|$|E

The details in the features, like the fingertips and facial features, is noticed more because of {{the simplicity of the}} robe. The contrast gives the smaller details more importance.|$|R

After losing by unanimous decision to Richard [...] "The Alien" [...] Grant, Butler had his gloves removed before {{the announcement of the}} winner, Grant then went to Butler's side of the ring for an expected exchange of congratulations. Instead, Butler sucker punched Grant, nailing a <b>bare</b> handed <b>right</b> hook to his jaw. Grant suffered a temporarily dislocated jaw and a lacerated tongue that required 26 stitches.
