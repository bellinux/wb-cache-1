40|$|While {{earlier studies}} focus on credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> {{advanced}} and emerging market countries, this paper examines the characteristics and determinants of credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> developing countries. The results find that credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> {{developing countries are}} less likely to be associated with systemic banking crises. Rather, they are more likely to be the result of financial deepening than of dangerous buildups of financial risks; the prevention of credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> developing countries may thus be associated with higher opportunity costs in terms of foregone growth opportunities. Random effect probit and tobit regressions find some evidence that size of financial system and favorable macroeconomic conditions are among the determinants of credit booms. Although monetary and fiscal policies do not help <b>in</b> preventing credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> developing countries, we find that prudential regulations and supervision can play a much more effective role <b>in</b> preventing “bad” <b>booms,</b> while incurring substantially lower costs. Although “bad” booms are hard to identify ahead of time, the duration and size of booms, as well as the level of credit aggregates, appear to be useful indicators in determining them.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for measuring credit booms and {{uses it to}} identify credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> emerging and industrial economies {{over the past four}} decades. In addition, we use event study methods to identify the key empirical regularities of credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> macroeconomic aggregates and micro-level data. Macro data show a systematic relationship between credit booms and economic expansions, rising asset prices, real appreciations, widening external deficits and managed exchange rates. Micro data show a strong association between credit booms and firm-level measures of leverage, firm values, and external financing, and bank-level indicators of banking fragility. Credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> industrial and emerging economies show three major differences: (1) credit booms and the macro and micro fluctuations associated with them are larger in emerging economies, particularly in the nontradables sector; (2) not all credit <b>booms</b> end <b>in</b> financial crises, but most emerging markets crises were associated with credit booms; and (3) credit <b>booms</b> <b>in</b> emerging economies are often preceded by large capital inflows but not by financial reforms or productivity gains. ...|$|R

5|$|There was at {{the time}} a <b>boom</b> <b>in</b> shares in South American mining companies. Spain was losing its South American colonies in the face of rebellions. At the urging of George Canning the British {{government}} recognised the new independent governments of Argentina (1824), Colombia and Mexico (both 1825). With no money of his own, Disraeli borrowed money to invest. He became involved with the financier J. D. Powles, who was prominent among those encouraging the mining <b>boom.</b> <b>In</b> the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies. The pamphlets were published by John Murray, who invested heavily in the boom.|$|E

A large portion of Virginia Tech's bowl-game proceeds were devoted toward improving athletic facilities at the school, and more money was generated by a <b>boom</b> <b>in</b> merchandise sales that followed the game.

5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a <b>boom</b> <b>in</b> atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic theory) that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
