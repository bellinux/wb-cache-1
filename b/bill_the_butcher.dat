Griet assumes that Vermeer's widow wishes to settle the household's unpaid fifteen-guilder <b>bill</b> with <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> shop. Pieter laughs and says that he didn't mind losing the fifteen guilders because they bought him Griet as a wife. At the Vermeer house, Griet learns that even though Vermeer had made no effort to see or speak to her, he had {{remained}} very fond of the painting. In addition, Vermeer's will had included a request that Griet receive the pearl earrings that she wore when he painted her. However, Griet realizes that she could no more wear pearl earrings as a butcher's wife than she could as a maid. She then pawns the earrings for twenty guilders and pays fifteen guilders to her husband, claiming that Vermeer's widow had given her the coins to settle a debt with <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> shop, but keeps five guilders to herself and never spends them.|$|R

40|$|Abstract] When in 1928 Herbert Asbury {{published}} his acclaimed book Gangs of New York, he presented a panoramic and retrospective {{view of the}} most significant gangs that prowled the Five Point’s area. His gangsters were villains of the past who had no influence in the present. However, in Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York gangsters such as <b>Bill</b> <b>the</b> <b>Butcher</b> seem to have certain continuity into the present. This paper explores the role violence and power play in the foundation of modern New York according to Scorsese and Asbury in their respective versions of Gangs of New York...|$|E
40|$|First a confession: I’m {{a sucker}} both for costume drama {{and a good}} romance. And I love a good {{adventure}} story. Loved ‘Pride and Prejudice’; when Mr Darcy finally professes his love to Miss Elizabeth Bennett, I get tearful. Adore almost any Merchant and Ivory film. And I can handle violence, whether the cartoonish sort of ‘Batman ’ and ‘Pulp Fiction ’ or the realism of ‘Saving Private Ryan’. So, ‘Gangs of New York ’ should have been right up my alley. It was not. Frankly, I could tolerate the romance as a modern-day love affair. Cameron Diaz is easy to look at, and I suspect DiCaprio has his admirers. But the dramatic core of the film belongs to the anti-hero, <b>Bill</b> <b>the</b> <b>Butcher,</b> played by Daniel Day-Lewis. The costumes – which I thought caricatured individuals – were nonetheless evocative of the era, especially in the gangs’ stovepipe hats and dead rabbits. And the cinematography made it all look beautiful – albeit, borrowing from {{the title of a}} book about New York in the 1920 s by the historian Robert Allen, it is a ‘horrible prettiness’. 1 For the hear...|$|E

60|$|It is {{a summer}} evening, {{down in a}} green hollow, {{at the corner of}} a wall. I meet <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> by appointment.

The preliminaries are adjusted, and <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> and myself stand face to face. In a moment <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> lights ten thousand candles out of my left eyebrow. In another moment, I don't know where the wall is, or where I am, or where anybody is.

Sometimes I see <b>the</b> <b>butcher,</b> bloody but confident; sometimes I see nothing, and sit gasping on my second's knee; sometimes I go in at <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> madly, and cut my knuckles open against his face, without appearing to discompose him at all. At last I awake, very queer about the head, as from a giddy sleep, and see <b>the</b> <b>butcher</b> walking off, congratulated by <b>the</b> two other <b>butchers</b> and <b>the</b> sweep and publican, and putting on his coat as he goes; from which I augur, justly, that the victory is his.|$|R
