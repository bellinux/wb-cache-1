5|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois, Piccard {{was one of}} nine {{children}} born to Emily Ridlon and John Ridlon, who {{was president of the}} American Orthopaedic Association. She had a lifelong interest in science and religion. When she was 11, her mother asked her what she wanted to <b>be</b> <b>when</b> she grew up. Piccard's reply"a priest"sent her mother running out of the room in tears.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would <b>be</b> <b>when</b> dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would <b>be</b> <b>when</b> they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial stone walls were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{levels in the}} {{covariation}} model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> many people can agree on an event or area of interest. Low consensus <b>is</b> <b>when</b> very few people can agree. High distinctiveness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest is fairly common. High consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the event or area of interest goes away quickly.|$|R

5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered {{over what he}} has learned, and Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to <b>be</b> <b>when</b> the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would <b>be</b> <b>when</b> one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would <b>be</b> <b>when</b> either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{transportation}} {{management strategies}} {{are aimed at}} keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first would <b>be</b> <b>when</b> that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees, deliberately {{limiting the number of}} spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.|$|E

5|$|The novel centres on the {{character}} of Katinka Bai, a quiet, sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. The marriage is barren, and she remains isolated. Almost subconsciously, she passionately longs after something undefinable. Even after the arrival of Huus, a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship, she is unable to fulfill her passion, although {{for the first time in}} her life she falls in love. In the small provincial community where they live, neither she nor Huus dares to break the conventions they know, sad as it all may <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> they realize they cannot take their attachment any further, they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country. At the end of the novel, as at the beginning, Katinka stands by the wayside, observing life glide by.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment.

It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment <b>is</b> <b>when</b> there <b>is</b> a lack of attachment behavior.|$|R

25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball will <b>be</b> <b>when</b> it reaches him or her. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in his assessment of the ball and give away their wicket.|$|E

50|$|Resonant {{systems are}} said to be tightly coupled, loosely coupled, {{critically}} coupled or overcoupled. Tight coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the coupling coefficient is around 1 as with conventional iron-core transformers. Overcoupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the secondary coil is so close and the formation of mutual flux is hindered by the effect of antiresonance, and critical coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the transfer in the passband is optimal. Loose coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the coils <b>are</b> distant from each other, so that most of the flux misses the secondary. In Tesla coils around 0.2 is used, and at greater distances, for example for inductive wireless power transmission, it may be lower than 0.01.|$|R
50|$|According to {{cognitive}} dissonance theory, {{there are three}} types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant relationships.

Dissonant relationships <b>are</b> <b>when</b> two elements <b>are</b> not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant relationships <b>are</b> <b>when</b> two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.|$|R
