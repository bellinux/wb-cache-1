50|$|The term {{is applied}} {{primarily}} {{in relation to}} the ISDN access interfaces (PRA or PRI and BRA or BRI), since deeper in the PSTN network an ISDN <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> is essentially indistinguishable from any other <b>bearer</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{well known}} {{example of a}} <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> is the ISDN B channel.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> is a DS-0 {{that carries}} call content i.e. {{one that does}} not carry {{signaling}}. In the common-channel signaling scheme for telecommunications, signaling is sent out-of-band, while all other traffic rides bearer channels. When a call is set up, the Bearer Capability is negotiated, and this is used to determine what type of traffic is sent across the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common-channel {{signaling}} (CCS) {{employs a}} signaling channel which conveys signaling {{information relating to}} multiple <b>bearer</b> <b>channels.</b> These <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> therefore have their signaling channel in common.|$|R
50|$|ANSI T1.413 is a {{technical}} standard {{that defines the}} requirements for the single asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) for the interface between the telecommunications network and the customer installation {{in terms of their}} interaction and electrical characteristics. ADSL allows the provision of voiceband services including plain old telephone service (POTS) and data services up to 56 kbit/s, and a variety of digital channels. In the direction from the network to the customer premises (downstream), the digital <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> may consist of full-duplex low-speed <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> and simpler high-speed bearer channels; in the other (upstream) direction, only low-speed <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> are provided.|$|R
5000|$|Primary rate {{interface}} (ISDN) - Provided over T1 (23 <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> and 1 signaling channel) or E1 carriers.|$|R
50|$|Channel-associated {{signaling}} (CAS) {{employs a}} signaling channel which {{is dedicated to}} a specific <b>bearer</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Combined {{voice and}} data, wherein {{the data is}} {{multiplexed}} with voice onto the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The logical {{alternative}} to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), {{in which each}} <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> has a signaling channel dedicated to it.|$|E
5000|$|Basic rate ISDN, {{known as}} ISDN-BRI, has two 64 kbit/s [...] "bearer" [...] or [...] "B" [...] {{channels}}. These channels {{can be used}} separately for voice or data calls or bonded together to provide a 128 kbit/s service. Multiple ISDN-BRI lines can be bonded together to provide data rates above 128 kbit/s. Primary rate ISDN, known as ISDN-PRI, has 23 <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> (64 kbit/s each) for a combined data rate of 1.5 Mbit/s (US standard). An ISDN E1 (European standard) line has 30 <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> and a combined data rate of 1.9 Mbit/s.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all other}} ISDN basic rate {{interface}}s, the U interface carries two B (<b>bearer)</b> <b>channels</b> at 64 kbit/s and one D (data) channel at 16 kbit/s for a combined bitrate of 144 kbit/s (2B+D).|$|R
5000|$|V5.1 (ETS 300 324-1) {{in which}} there is a 1 to 1 {{correspondence}} between subscriber lines and <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> in the aggregate link to the exchange. A V5.1 interface relates to a single aggregate E1 (2 Mbit/s) link between a multiplexer and an exchange.|$|R
5000|$|Data over signalling, or DoS, wherein data is {{multiplexed}} {{onto the}} signalling channel and voice {{is dedicated to}} the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Before {{telecommunication}} networks began to support data related services, the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> was dedicated solely to voice information. When support for data related services was originally released, the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> was switched between being dedicated to voice information or dedicated to primary data information, {{depending on the}} subscriber's needs at any given time. Eventually, support for simultaneous voice and data transmission was added to [...] modems and mobile devices, to enable subscribers to use voice and data services at the same time.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, data over signalling, or DoS, a {{technique}} in which primary data is sent over a signalling channel {{instead of the}} subscriber's <b>bearer</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|V5.2 (ETS 300 347-1) which {{provides}} for concentration {{where there are}} not enough <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> in the aggregate link(s) to accommodate all subscribers at the same time. A single V5.2 interface can control up to 16 E1 links at once and can include protection of the signalling channels.|$|R
50|$|The {{entry level}} {{interface}} to ISDN is the Basic Rate Interface (BRI), a 128 kbit/s service delivered over {{a pair of}} standard telephone copper wires. The 144 kbit/s payload rate is broken down into two 64 kbit/s <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> ('B' channels) and one 16 kbit/s signaling channel ('D' channel or data channel). This is {{sometimes referred to as}} 2B+D.|$|R
50|$|The CN can be {{connected}} to various backbone networks, such as the Internet or an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telephone network. UMTS (and GERAN) include the three lowest layers of OSI model. The network layer (OSI 3) includes the Radio Resource Management protocol (RRM) that manages the <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> between the mobile terminals and the fixed network, including the handovers.|$|R
50|$|DoS was {{designed}} so that mobile telephony subscribers could maintain a voice session on their <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> while still accessing data related services, such as text messaging.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> (B) is a {{standard}} 64 kbit/s voice channel of 8 bits sampled at 8 kHz with G.711 encoding. B-Channels {{can also be used}} to carry data, since they are nothing more than digital channels.|$|E
50|$|In telephony, {{multi-frequency}} signaling (MF) is a {{signaling system}} that was introduced by the Bell System after World War II. It uses a combination of tones for address (phone number) and supervision signaling. The signaling is sent in-band over the same channel as the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> used for voice traffic.|$|E
50|$|A T1 circuit {{typically}} carries 24 individual timeslots. Each timeslot in turn {{carries a}} single telephone call. When a T1 circuit {{is used to}} carry Primary Rate ISDN one of the timeslots is used to carry the D channel. A single Primary Rate ISDN circuit is thus sometimes described as 23B + D. There are 23 <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> carrying voice or data, and one D channel carrying the Common Channel Signaling.|$|R
50|$|PRI is the {{standard}} for providing telecommunication services to enterprises and offices. It is based on T-carrier (T1) transmission in the US, Canada, and Japan, while the E-carrier (E1) is common in Europe and Australia. The T1 line consists of 23 <b>bearer</b> (B) <b>channels</b> and one data (D) channel for control purposes, for a total bandwidth of 24x64-kbit/s or 1.544 Mbit/s. The E1 carrier provides 30B- and two D-channels for a bandwidth of 2.048 Mbit/s. The first timeslot on the E1 is used for synchronization purposes and is {{not considered to be}} a B- or D-channel. The D-channel typically uses timeslot 16 on an E1, while it is timeslot 24 for a T1. Fewer active <b>bearer</b> <b>channels,</b> sometimes called user channels, may be used in fractional T1 or E1 services.|$|R
50|$|The BRI {{configuration}} provides 2 data (<b>bearer)</b> <b>channels</b> (B channels) at 64 kbit/s {{each and}} 1 control (delta) channel (D channel) at 16 kbit/s. The B channels {{are used for}} voice or user data, and the D channel is used for any combination of data, control/signaling, and X.25 packet networking. The 2 B channels can be aggregated by channel bonding providing a total data rate of 128 kbit/s. The BRI ISDN service is commonly installed for residential or small business service (ISDN PABX) in many countries.|$|R
50|$|SS5 {{and earlier}} systems used in-band signaling, {{in which the}} call-setup {{information}} was sent by playing special multi-frequency tones into the telephone lines, known as bearer channels. As the <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> was directly accessible by users, it was exploited with devices such as the blue box, which played the tones required for call control and routing. As a remedy, SS6 and SS7 implemented out-of-band signaling, carried in a separate signaling channel, thus keeping the speech path separate. SS6 and SS7 {{are referred to as}} common-channel signaling (CCS) protocols, or Common Channel Interoffice Signalling (CCIS) systems.|$|E
50|$|In Italy, {{leased lines}} are {{available}} at speeds of 64 kbit/s (terminated by DCE2 or DCE2plus modem) or multiple of 64 kbit/s from 128 kbit/s up to framed or unframed E1 (DCE3 modem) in digital form (PDH service, known as CDN, Circuito Diretto Numerico). Local Telephone companies also may provide CDA (Circuito Diretto Analogico), that are plain copper dry pair between two buildings, without any line termination: in the past (pre-2002) a full analog base band was provided, giving an option to customer to deploy xDSL technology between sites: nowadays everything is limited at 4 kHz of <b>bearer</b> <b>channel,</b> so the service is just a POTS connection without any setup channel.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, for voice T1s {{there are}} two main types: {{so-called}} [...] "plain" [...] or Inband T1s and PRI (Primary Rate Interface). While both carry voice telephone calls in similar fashion, PRIs are commonly used in call centers and provide not only the 23 actual usable telephone lines (Known as [...] "B" [...] channels for bearer) but also a 24th line (Known as the [...] "D" [...] channel for data) that carries line signaling information. This special [...] "D" [...] channel carries: Caller ID (CID) and automatic number identification (ANI) data, required channel type (usually a B, or <b>Bearer</b> <b>channel),</b> call handle, Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) info, requested channel number and a request for response.|$|E

5000|$|Using bipolar with eight-zero {{substitution}} encoding technique, call data {{is transmitted}} over the data (B) channels, with the signaling (D) channels used for call setup and management. Once a call is set up, {{there is a}} simple 64 kbit/s synchronous bidirectional data channel (actually implemented as two simplex channels, one in each direction) between the end parties, lasting until the call is terminated. There can be as many calls as there are <b>bearer</b> <b>channels,</b> to the same or different end-points. Bearer channels may also be multiplexed into what may be considered single, higher-bandwidth channels via a process called B channel BONDING, or via use of Multi-Link PPP [...] "bundling" [...] or by using an H0, H11, or H12 channel on a PRI.|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{operation}} of ATM Access Networks (ANs) {{calls for the}} incorporation of advanced signalling functionality also in the access part of the ATM core network. Instead of implementing the entire control plane in the AN we {{take advantage of the}} separation between call, bearer and channel control and we proceed with a simple, standard-compliant <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> control architecture for the ATM AN.

40|$|Today's {{solution}} to realize wide coverage with the Release 9 MBMS specification is to transmit an H. 264 /AVC video service with a robustness {{determined by the}} worst reception conditions of the target area. This sacrifices service data rate for robustness due to lower modulation and FEC code-rate. The combination of <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> multiplex and SVC promises significant gains in terms of channel capacity by establishing unequal error protection on the physical layer. In comparison with single layer transmission, SVC achieves equal performance in terms of continuous playout while allocating fewer resources for the expensive robust channel. This benefit is gained by providing temporary lower quality video to users within bad reception conditions. Simulation results within an MBSFN Release 9 network show significant capacity gains over a given bandwidth with only minor quality degradation for users located in bad reception areas while preserving playout robustness of H. 264 /AVC single layer services...|$|E
40|$|Future optical {{networks}} {{will consist}} of photonic switches, optical crossconnects, and routers that may be configured with links consisting {{of a number of}} user bearer channels and an associated control channel. This paper describes a new link management protocol, called LMP, which runs between neighboring nodes and will be used for both link provisioning and fault isolation. A unique feature of LMP is that it is able to isolate faults in both opaque and transparent networks, independent of the encoding scheme used for the bearer channels. LMP will be used to maintain control channel connectivity, verify <b>bearer</b> <b>channel</b> connectivity, exchange link property information (such as M:N or 1 + 1 local span protection), and isolate link, fiber, or channel failures within the optical network. 2 Introduction Future optical networks will be built using best-of-breed optical solutions that provide dynamic resource provisioning as well as network survivability. These heterogeneous networks will requi [...] ...|$|E

50|$|Layer 1(CCITT) ITU-G703 {{defines the}} {{physical}} and electrical interface. G704 defines the Frame structure of the 2,048 Mbs sent across the link. G732 defines the allocation of that frame structure into the 32 discrete 64Kbit 'channels', of which 0 is used for alignment of the frames and 16 is (by convention only) allocated to common channel signaling. Speech is carried as G711.Layer 2 Timeslot 16, 64Kbs operates as HDLC LAPB, to support up to 60 PVCs or DLCs (data link connections) (30 directly associated with the <b>bearer</b> <b>channels</b> and 30 for unrelated messages) as the specification describes them. Therefore, at maximum operation, each potential traffic channel can have two simultaneous data channels available for messages. Note that HDLC operates as a statistical multiplexing system. When traffic deltas are low, a single call establishment message {{will have access to}} the full 64Kbs (allowing for overheads).DPNSS is a layer 3 protocol functioning as common channel signaling. The functionality is divided into Levels (confusingly nothing to do with OSI layers.) Levels 1-6 deal with simple call establishment (make call/break call) and are the minimum requirements by which a PBX can be said to be DPNSS compatible. The remaining levels are allocated to telephony features, supplementary services or to administrative features. Note that support of 'levels' by a PBX is not necessarily incremental. Some levels are interdependent but a PBX may omit support of some levels (above 6) and support others.|$|R
