We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's {{something you have to}} live with– but to say people stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting.

This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
500|$|Watts {{then took}} a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being {{introduced}} to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts {{decided to move to}} America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. [...] "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole , who had <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on." ...|$|E

State Treasurer John Neely Kennedy, a 2004 Democratic opponent of Vitter, called upon Angelle {{to join him in}} endorsing Vitter. Remaining silent, said Kennedy, is the equivalent of an endorsement of Edwards. Angelle spokesman Ryan Cross responded to Kennedy's accusations saying “John Kennedy is confused. He is the eternal president of the RINO club. He endorsed John Kerry for President , who fought to kill the Keystone pipeline; he’s run statewide as a liberal Democrat twice; and he’s <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the map on issues like the minimum wage, abortion, and tax increases.” ...|$|E

But as important as my youth and upbringing was, there's something else that made me stick to Doo. He thought I was something special, more special {{than anyone else in the}} world, and never let me forget it. That belief would be hard to shove out the door. Doo was my security, my safety net. And just remember, I'm explainin', not excusin'. (Still Woman Enough xvii) ... Doo was a good man and a hard worker. But he was an alcoholic, and it affected our marriage all the way through. He was also a womanizer. Cheating husbands have <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the news talk shows for a few years now. Lots of women say they don't understand why women stay with them dogs. My story is about one who did—me.(Still Woman Enough, p. xiii).|$|E

2500|$|... "I'm a Rocker" [...] is a {{cover of}} the Chuck Berry track. To promote the album in Belgium, a Belgian film crew {{recorded}} the band performing the song at Portland Studios in London. The song was released as a single in Belgium in 1980, peaking at number one there. The song originally came to Holder's attention when it was played on Radio One by DJ Annie Nightingale. In a 1980 interview, Holder said: [...] "I really liked it [...] mentioned to {{the others in the}} band that I'd heard a really great Chuck Berry number". After spending time trying to get hold of a copy of the song, Holder obtained Berry's the album of the same name from an import shop. Holder revealed: [...] "After listening to it, we started to play it live on stage, first of all just as a jam {{at the end of the}} set. Then one night we went into the studio, we'd <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the pub, and we had half an hour left at the end of a session, and we decided to record it, and we got it down in one take. The feel is there in that song, it's us, Slade – it's what we are all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Gabe gets his picture taken in the photobooth, and when he's grabbing it, a picture of Sabi appears to be stuck in the slit. Both picture's feelings read [...] "Incomplete". Then Gabe makes his goal of the night to find the girl in the picture. While this is happening, Victoria Asher is seen dragging different people into the bathroom, these people including twins and a girl, hence her feeling being [...] "kinky". Gabe goes around the club (his [...] "world" [...] girl I've <b>been</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world looking for you) trying to find Sabi and stumbling upon different people who embrace him in hugs or handshakes. Sabi is seen dancing around the club when her part of the song comes on. Nate Novarro instead of dancing, orders a burger through Vicky-T's iPad; his feeling being [...] "munchy". During the first two thirds of the video, all drinks seem to be taken away from Ryland Blackinton, hence why on his picture he's feeling [...] "thirsty". When Gabe finally finds Sabi, they give each other a look of sheer happiness, before they both enter the photobooth. The lights go off, and at the moment they go back on, Gabe and Sabi seem to be kissing. They take a new picture together, and it reads [...] "Complete", thus ending the video.|$|E
