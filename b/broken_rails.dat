25|$|Infrastructure {{problems}} have affected performance. According to Network Rail, the main {{problems have}} been track-circuit failures, <b>broken</b> <b>rails,</b> track faults, points failures and overhead line equipment (OLE) failures. Network Rail, {{which is responsible for}} the infrastructure, intended to improve performance by work carried out during a planned closure of London Liverpool Street station over Christmas and New Year 2007/8. This allowed much of the outer London overhead line equipment to be replaced by modern, self-tensioning lines. The work was carried out, but overran at short notice by some 24 hours, causing ridicule in the national press.|$|E
25|$|The MRT-3 {{maintains}} an underground depot in Quezon City, near North Avenue station. On {{top of the}} depot is TriNoma, a shopping mall owned by the Ayala Corporation. The depot occupies 84,444 square meters (908,948sqft) of space and serves as the headquarters for light and heavy maintenance of the MRT-3, {{as well as the}} operations of the system in general. It is connected to the main MRT-3 network by a spur line. The depot is capable of storing 81 light rail vehicles, with the option to expand to include 40 more vehicles as demand arises. They are parked on nine sets of tracks, which converge onto the spur route and later on to the main network. However, a lot of rail tracks for storage inside the depot were taken by DOTC to repair <b>broken</b> <b>rails,</b> as DOTC's appointed maintenance provider did not purchase spare rails.|$|E
2500|$|CWR rail is laid (including fastening) at a {{temperature}} roughly midway between the extremes experienced at that location. (This {{is known as}} the [...] "rail neutral temperature"). This installation procedure is intended to prevent tracks from buckling in summer heat or pulling apart in winter cold. In North America, because <b>broken</b> <b>rails</b> (known as a pull-apart) are typically detected by interruption of the current in the signaling system, they are seen as less of a potential hazard than undetected heat kinks.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944 it was {{the site}} of a train {{derailment}} caused by a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> in which 47 people were killed.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> or wire {{will break}} the circuit between the power supply and the relay, de-energizing the relay. See {{exception}} below.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{a freight}} train was derailed inside the tunnel due to a <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b> Recovery of the wagons took about a week.|$|R
2500|$|The plan did {{not work}} because the four policemen did not come out of Sherritt's house until the morning. This meant that {{the news of the}} murder did not reach Melbourne as quickly as the Kelly Gang had hoped. The people held {{prisoner}} in the hotel became restless. Ned organised music and Dan joined in dancing to keep the people in the hotel entertained. Dan also organised some sporting games including long jump and hop, step and jump. Dan wanted to leave Glenrowan when they knew the plan was not going to work because the train was late. Ned Kelly let Thomas Curnow, the school master, go home to his wife. Dan told his brother not to [...] Curnow, and to keep him at the hotel. Curnow did go home, where he discussed with his wife about doing something, but after hearing the train approaching, he ran to the railway line with a lantern and his wife's red silk scarf and at about 3.00am he was able to stop the train before it reached the <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b> The police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside.|$|E
60|$|Thorn {{gave him}} a searching glance, and then, seeing he was resolute, shrugged contemptuously. The huntsman blew his horn, the dogs were drawn off, and Gerald {{followed}} the others across the field. Grace, however, {{sat down on a}} fallen tree to rest her foot and {{for a minute or two}} thought herself alone. Then she rose as Askew came through the gap in the hedge. He began to pull about the <b>broken</b> <b>rails</b> and thorns, but saw her when he looked up.|$|E
6000|$|At {{times we}} led the beasts out in {{detachments}} to water at wayside stations, {{and there was}} usually much profanity and destruction of property before we got them back again, and left the agent to assess the damage to his feelings, besides splintered gangways and <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b> It was at Portage or Brandon, I think, that one showed me a warning received by wire. [...] "Through freight full of wild beasts coming along. There'll be nothing left of your station if you let the lunatics in charge of them turn their menagerie out." ...|$|E

60|$|When Lister looked {{round the}} train was gone. He had done what he had undertaken, and after waiting {{for a few moments}} he started back. Now he could go cautiously, he stopped and tried to brace himself {{at the end of the}} bridge. Although he had run across not long since, he shrank from the dark, forbidding gaps. For all that, he must get back, and feeling {{carefully}} for the ties, he reached the other side and was for some time engaged at the muskeg where two cars had overrun the <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b> At length he went to the log shack he used for his office and sleeping-room, and soon after he lighted his pipe Kemp came in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's all {{send her}} a letter," [...] {{proposed}} Jack, and out came pens, ink, paper, and the lamp, {{and every one}} fell to scribbling. A droll collection was the result, for Frank drew {{a picture of the}} fatal fall with <b>broken</b> <b>rails</b> flying in every direction, Jack with his head swollen {{to the size of a}} balloon, and Jill in two pieces, while the various boys and girls were hit off with a sly skill that gave Gus legs like a stork, Molly Loo hair several yards long, and Boo a series of visible howls coming out of an immense mouth in the shape of o's. The oxen were particularly good, for their horns branched like those of the moose, and Mr. Grant had a patriarchal beard which waved in the breeze as he bore the wounded girl to a sled very like a funeral pyre, the stakes being crowned with big mittens like torches.|$|E

2500|$|... 31 October 2001: TGV 8515 from Paris to Irun derailed at [...] near Dax in {{southwest}} France. All ten carriages derailed and the rear power unit fell over. The cause was a <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} the {{location}} of a serious accident in 1965, when a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> led to the derailment at speed of a southbound sleeping car express. There were no fatalities, although eleven passengers were injured.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{reached a}} top speed of 12 mph (19 km/h). It proved too heavy for the relatively brittle cast-iron rails then in use, and Trevithick closed his exhibition after a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> caused a derailment.|$|R

50|$|On {{inspection}} {{the fracture}} {{faces of the}} <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> were clean and bright, so {{it was clear that}} no inspection could have previously found a fault. The railway company blamed faulty manufacture, suggesting the cast iron was too brittle.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 November 1967, the Hither Green rail crash occurred. An {{express train}} from [...] to [...] derailed between [...] and Hither Green station, {{close to where}} the railway crosses St. Mildred's Road, due to a <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b> Forty-nine {{passengers}} were killed.|$|R
40|$|Risk {{management}} {{represents an}} emerging approach to improving safety on railroads. One aspect of risk management {{is the development}} of a set of risk based tools to identify high risk locations in the track and provide guidance for improved inspection and/or preventive maintenance to reduce that level of risk. This is particularly the case for major derailment cause categories in the area of track or vehicle/track interaction failure, where failure or degradation can result in a derailment. This new generation of track safety management tools has been developed to quantify and analyze the “risk ” associated with key track failure modes. This paper will describe several such new generation risk management tools that deal directly with track safety in several key track failure (and derailment) areas. These models have been implemented on railways in the US and worldwide and {{have been shown to be}} effective tools in controlling and reducing the risk of derailments in their respective track risk areas. The specific models to be discussed in this article are: • <b>Broken</b> <b>rail</b> risk model which quantifies the risk of occurrence of a <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> (and associated <b>broken</b> <b>rail</b> derailment) and allows railways to adjust their UT test schedules t...|$|R

50|$|The {{load hauled}} by the {{locomotive}} {{was little more}} than that pulled by a good horse, although at about twice the velocity, advantages more than outweighed by the considerable costs involved, not least for the replacement of <b>broken</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|E
50|$|During emergencies, {{defined as}} {{unforeseen}} situations that may cause harm to employees, passengers, {{the public or}} the environment such as accidents, derailments, natural disasters and acts of God but not locomotive breakdowns or <b>broken</b> <b>rails,</b> employees may work until relieved subject to fatigue management policies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{was purchased}} by Pioneer Railcorp on December 28, 2012, which announced the intention to repair and extend it. Pioneer described the line as [...] "in dire need of rehabilitation", and it began extensive rehabilitation in January 2013, replacing decayed cross ties and <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|R
500|$|On 3 February 1954, {{locomotive}} No. 46250 City of Lichfield was hauling {{a passenger}} train that was derailed inside Watford Tunnel, Hertfordshire {{due to a}} <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b> The rear three carriages became divided from the train at [...] station, {{with one of them}} ending up on the platform. Fifteen people were injured.|$|R
50|$|On 10 November 1895, an {{overnight}} Scottish express hauled by locomotive No. 1006 derailed at St Neots when it encountered a <b>broken</b> <b>rail.</b> One person was killed. The accident report by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate {{commented on the}} abnormally heavy axle loading of the locomotive: nearly 20 tons on the driving axle.|$|R
