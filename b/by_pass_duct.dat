40|$|This work {{presents}} a flow identification methodology in multiphase system in stratified oil-water-gas regime. The principle {{is based on}} detecting the amount of X rays attenuated <b>by</b> <b>passing</b> through the <b>duct</b> containing the flow. The radiation interacts with the material and the composite duct fluid, causing the intensity of X ray declines. In this study, was used divergent bean into two and three dimensions. In this case {{we need to know}} the source position in order to back project the rays accordingly in a divergent way. In three dimensions, the projections discontinuity determination problem is substituted by the projections images contour determination. Each ray generates one algebraic equation. The system may be solved by the least square method or by some algebraic reconstruction technique such as the ART, MART or q-ART algorithms. The experiment shows that with a single view (a source-detector pair) it is possible to obtain information of a flow inside a duct (the attenuation of the radiation beam). However, {{it is not possible to}} make the reconstruction of the flow. Then, we use two views, so getting enough information to reconstruct the flow. The results presented show that the technique may be applied in the successfully flow regime identification...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to describe functional morphological features of venom apparatus in the tube web spider, Segestria florentina (Rossi, 1790) (Araneae: Segestriidae) by using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The venom apparatus is situated in the anterior part of the prosoma, and is composed of a pair of venom glands and chelicerae. The chelicera of S. florentina has two parts: basal segment and a movable articulated apical segment (fang). The cheliceral fang rests in a groove on the basal segment of chelicerae. A venom hole is located on the subterminal part of each fang. A pair of venom glands is completely separate but similar to each other within the prosoma. Each venom gland is surrounded by striated muscle bundles, such as with the capsules. The venom, produced in the venom glands, is carried <b>by</b> venom <b>ducts</b> <b>passing</b> throughout the chelicerae. Each venom gland has its own venom duct, chelicera and fang. The venom is excreted from the venom pore on the subterminal part of the fang by means of muscular contractions covering the venom gland...|$|R
