40|$|AbstractA matroid may be {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> its <b>bases</b> or by <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> its circuits. Along with any matroid is a uniquely determined dual matroid. Given <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> a matroid, {{it is possible to}} show that base complements are precisely <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual. So it is easy to construct <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual given <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original matroid. This paper provides two results. The first enables construction of all circuits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual matroid from circuits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original matroid. The second constructs all <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> a matroid from its circuits...|$|R

5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
