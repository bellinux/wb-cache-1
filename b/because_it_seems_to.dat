5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> attribute {{the action of}} a conscious mind when none {{is assumed to be}} present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, the {{delusion}} may {{be assumed}} to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing the belief, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely {{have the time or}} resources to check the validity of a person’s claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me the best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|Mitzeee begins being stalked. Her portrayer Shenton said Mitzeee {{was unaware}} of who the stalker was and that [...] "Mercedes hasn't even crossed her mind. She thinks it's a crazed fan". The viewers learn that it was Mercedes. The {{stalking}} stopped but later was resumed when Mitzeee and Riley begin a relationship. Shenton explained that the stalker had a key to Mitzeee's flat and had been watching her every move, and said that [...] "not only has the stalker come back, but they've come back {{on a whole new}} level". Shenton added that at this point [...] "Mitzeee definitely has no idea that it's Mercedes - in fact, Mercedes is probably the last person that she'd suspect. She actually thinks that it's Lynsey and accuses her, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> make sense".|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} between his return from Paris in 1908 and the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two {{of the largest and most}} prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian, were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, [...] "The work is wonderful <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is never sure whether one is listening to something very old or very new". Langford declared that the symphony [...] "definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers". Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams's largest-scale work was the first version of A London Symphony (1914). In the same year he wrote The Lark Ascending in its original form for violin and piano.|$|E

2500|$|The biggest cinema in the Faroe Islands, Havnar Bio, {{decided to}} boycott the film, {{effectively}} blocking it from the other smaller cinemas, who rely on second-hand films from this source, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be blasphemous in their point of view.

2500|$|The {{extent of}} Celtic {{influence}} is debatable. Tolkien {{wrote that he}} gave the Elvish language Sindarin [...] "a linguistic character very like (though not identical with) British-Welsh ... <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers". A number {{of the names of}} characters and places in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings have been found to have Welsh origin. In addition, the depiction of elves has been described as deriving from Celtic mythology.|$|E

2500|$|Like Einstein, Schrödinger was {{dissatisfied}} {{with the concept of}} entanglement, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> violate the speed limit on the transmission of information implicit in the theory of relativity.

2500|$|Stefan Collini regards this as [...] "an {{exceptionally}} frank, but not unjust, self-assessment. ... Arnold's poetry {{continues to}} have scholarly attention lavished upon it, in part <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> furnish such striking evidence for several central aspects of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century, especially the corrosion of 'Faith' by 'Doubt'. [...] No poet, presumably, would wish to be summoned by later ages merely as an historical witness, but the sheer intellectual grasp of Arnold's verse renders it peculiarly liable to this treatment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dialogue}} is much dismissed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> recommend clever evil over witless evil. This {{is not the}} real point, however. Socrates is the impresario who sings off key, the boxer who throws the match not for money, but because he can. The dialogue does not establish Socrates' absurd thesis, that the deliberate liar {{is better than the}} witless one, but it does prove that Plato is as clever as Homer. Socrates, who pretends to be a lover of good reasoning, is widely thought to be what he says he is, a rational man. [...] Socrates is the literary equivalent of Achilles, whose speech against dissembling seems to fool everyone. Socrates is no more [...] "rational" [...] than Achilles is [...] "honest and simple".|$|E

The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, Laarbi Maateis, is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism. He also said the prosecution were not understandable [...] "because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be the best for the city." ...|$|E

50|$|Augustine {{wrote of}} prevenient grace, and {{expanded}} {{to a discussion}} of pre-destination. A number of monastic communities took exception <b>to</b> the latter <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> nullify the value of asceticism practiced under their Rules. John Cassian felt that Augustine's stress on predestination ruled out any need for human cooperation or consent.|$|R
2500|$|Caster was optioned by the Athletics to the Portland Beavers for the 1936 season, {{which proved}} to be the best of Caster's career.

[...] He was the leader in the Pacific Coast League in 1936 in both wins and strikeouts (234). [...] In a front page profile, The Sporting News credited Caster's turnaround to overcoming his lack of control and adding a slow knuckleball to his blazing fastball and sharp-breaking curve. [...] Caster later wrote an article describing the role of his knuckler:"My knuckle ball is thrown with the fingertips of my index and second finger on my right hand in contact with the smooth surface of the ball – no seems touched... I have found when pitching against the wind the ball seems to be most effective <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> 'flutter'...
