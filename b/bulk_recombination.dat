40|$|In this Letter, we {{introduce}} {{a method of}} calculating the optimal wafer thickness for silicon solar cells with multicrystalline bulk material. The optimal thickness depends on the relation of <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> to surface recombination and the light trapping. For multicrystalline silicon <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> strongly varies laterally and with injection level, which complicates the calculations. A thickness optimization using the "Efficiency Limiting <b>Bulk</b> <b>Recombination</b> Analysis" (ELBA) takes all these effects correctly into account...|$|E
30|$|In this simulation, {{to ensure}} a fair comparison, we keep the rear surface {{recombination}} velocities at a constant value (i.e., 3 [*]×[*] 104  cm/s) when investigating the EQE response of HHSCs under different doping concentrations, so the <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> dominates the electrical losses in the transport process of the carriers. From the EQE spectra in Fig.  3 a, {{it is easy to}} see that with the doping concentrations’ increases, the EQEs show a declining trend at λ[*]>[*] 500  nm, while maintaining a steady state at λ[*]<[*] 500  nm. This is because when λ[*]<[*] 500  nm, the injection of the carriers that concentrate in the upper surface of the HHSCs can be separated effectively by the built-in potential, leading to negligible <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> as shown in Fig.  3 b. As λ[*]>[*] 500  nm, the continuing and vigorous <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> resulting from a longer diffusion length is the main reason for the atrophied EQE. With the increase of doping concentrations, the <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> increases sharply according to the following reasons: (1) the reduced bulk lifetime results in SRH recombination increasing synchronously and (2) the increased excess minority carrier concentration (i.e., δp) leads to the increase in <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination.</b>|$|E
30|$|The FCC {{life time}} is mainly {{determined}} by the slab thickness, FCC penetration depth and FCC diffusion length. These parameters determine whether the faster surface recombination process or the slower <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> process will be the dominating factor in the FCC life time. In our case, the 10  ns pulse pump permits a 10  μm FCC diffusion length into the bulk. Moreover, posterior to the pulse, the FCCs continue their diffusion into the bulk. Hence, after the pulse, the balance between the surface and <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination</b> processes is shifted {{in favor of the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>recombination.</b> Thus, for thinner samples the fast surface recombination process will shorten the FCCs life time and consequently will increase the modulation rates.|$|E
50|$|The {{gradient}} {{driving the}} diffusion is then {{the difference between}} the large excess minority carrier densities at the barrier and the low densities in the bulk, and that gradient drives diffusion of minority carriers from the interface into the bulk. The injected minority carriers are reduced in number as they travel into the <b>bulk</b> by <b>recombination</b> mechanisms that drive the excess concentrations toward the bulk values.|$|R
