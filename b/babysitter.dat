5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My <b>Babysitter</b> is {{the final}} id-developed game, {{released}} in December 1991 for MS-DOS. Originally planned to be the third episode of Goodbye, Galaxy and sixth episode overall, it was changed before development began to be a stand-alone game—stylized as Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter!—published as a retail title through FormGen. Due to differing timelines between FormGen and Apogee, despite being numbered as the sixth episode it was developed in between the fourth and fifth; it also features a modified engine from Goodbye, Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Goodbye, Galaxy and Aliens Ate My <b>Babysitter</b> in 1991, id Software planned to make a third set of episodes for the {{following}} December, titled Commander Keen in The Universe is Toast!. Beyond the proposed title and release date, shown in the epilogue of the two games, no design work was completed before the game was cancelled due {{to the success of}} id's Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as Doom (1993).

5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital <b>babysitter.</b> Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost touch {{with the realities of}} raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming is intended to be watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E

The movie also includes the band's manager, Nat's faux female interest, the siblings' real life cousin as the group's <b>babysitter,</b> and the siblings' genuine father playing their inept accordion-playing dad.|$|E

5|$|Id Software did {{not produce}} any more games in the Commander Keen series after Goodbye Galaxy besides the co-developed Aliens Ate My <b>Babysitter.</b> Another trilogy of episodes, titled The Universe Is Toast, was planned for December 1992, but was {{cancelled}} after the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. A final Keen game, Commander Keen, was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision. Goodbye Galaxy has been released as part of several collections since its first release: the id Anthology compilation in 1996, a compilation release by Apogee in 1998 of Invasion of the Vorticons and Goodbye, Galaxy, a similar compilation in 2001 by 3D Realms titled Commander Keen Combo CD, and the 3D Realms Anthology in 2014. They have also been released for modern computers through a DOS emulator, and sold through Steam since 2007 {{as a part of}} the Commander Keen Complete Pack. According to Steam Spy, as of June 2016 approximately 200,000 copies have been sold through Steam.|$|E
5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent <b>babysitter,</b> often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered some food. When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had gone out of business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My <b>Babysitter,</b> overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveAn {{increasing}} number of parents in China ask grandparents or <b>babysitters</b> {{to care for their}} children. Modern parents are often the only child in their family because of China’s One-Child Policy and thus may lack interaction with siblings. Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore whether different caregivers affect the physical and development of infants in China. MethodsIn total, 2, 514 infants were enrolled in our study. We assessed their weight-for-age, supine length-for-age, weight-for-length, occipital-frontal circumference, and Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) results and recorded their general parental information and their primary caregivers. ResultsThe weights and lengths of 12 -month-old infants under the care of <b>babysitters</b> were significantly lower than those of infants under the care of parents or grandparents (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Additionally, 12 -month-old infants under the care of <b>babysitters</b> had the lowest DDST pass rate (75 %) among the three groups (χ 2 [*]=[*] 11. 819, P[*]=[*] 0. 012), especially for the fine motor-adaptive and language domains. Compared to 12 -month-old infants under the care of parents and <b>babysitters,</b> infants under the care of grandparents {{were more likely to be}} overweight or obese (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). ConclusionThe study showed that caregivers had a dominant role in the physical and cognitive development of the infants. Specifically, compared with infants raised by grandparents and parents, 12 -month-old infants under the care of <b>babysitters</b> had partially suppressed lengths and weights and lagged cognitively. The 12 -month-old infants under the care of grandparents were more overweight than those cared for by parents and <b>babysitters...</b>|$|R
5|$|Makeba {{then moved}} to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on The Steve Allen Show in Los Angeles for a {{television}} audience of 60 million. Her New York debut at the Village Vanguard occurred soon after; she sang in Xhosa and Zulu, and performed a Yiddish folk song. Her audience at this concert included Miles Davis and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in Greenwich Village, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, {{and worked as a}} <b>babysitter</b> for a period.|$|E
5|$|The Commander Keen series {{began in}} 1990 when John Carmack, then a game {{programmer}} at Softdisk, {{came up with}} a method to produce scrolling graphics for a 2D platform video game on IBM-compatible general-purpose computers. After a demo port of Super Mario Bros. 3 failed to entice Nintendo, he and a group of his coworkers from Softdisk—including programmer John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack—used the technique to make an original trilogy of shareware episodes for publisher Apogee Software. The game, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, was a large success for the market, and led the group to quit their jobs and found id Software. The game was followed by four more episodes during 1991: Keen Dreams, a pair titled Goodbye, Galaxy, and Aliens Ate My <b>Babysitter.</b> Further plans were made for another trilogy to be produced in 1992 under the name The Universe is Toast, but before any work began it was cancelled due to the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the <b>babysitter</b> Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E
