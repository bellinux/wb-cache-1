Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify as one nor did he consider himself a novelist. ("I don't quite {{know the meaning of}} the word novel," [...] he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking <b>big</b> <b>questions</b> about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources.

500|$|Resistance to {{the growing}} {{influence}} of molecular biology was especially evident in evolutionary biology. Protein sequencing had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution (through the molecular clock hypothesis), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering the <b>big</b> <b>questions</b> of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: Theodosius Dobzhansky made the famous statement that [...] "nothing in biology makes sense except {{in the light of}} evolution" [...] {{as a response to the}} molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution suggested that natural selection was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from morphological evolution. (Resolving this [...] "molecular/morphological paradox" [...] has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.) ...|$|E
500|$|Ed {{had a large}} {{impact on}} a number of Brown's contemporaries, {{including}} fellow Canadians Dave Sim and Seth, the latter of whom was taken in by the ambitiousness of Brown's storytelling, saying [...] "Those brilliant sequences where he would show a situation and then return to it later from a different perspective, like the death of Josie, really blew me away"—and Dave Cooper, who called Ed [...] "the most perfect book ever". [...] Others who cite Ed as an influence on their work include Daniel Clowes, Chris Ware, Craig Thompson, Matt Madden, Eric Reynolds and the Canadian cartoonists Alex Fellows, whose Canvas shows the influence of Ed, and Bryan Lee O'Malley, who calls Brown [...] "a Golden God" [...] and whose Lost at Sea was heavily influenced by Ed. [...] Anders Nilsen calls Ed [...] "completely amazing {{and one of the best}} comics ever", placing it in his top five comic books, and citing it as a major influence on his spontaneous <b>Big</b> <b>Questions.</b>|$|E

500|$|The film {{garnered}} a 73% {{approval rating}} from 284 critics—an average rating of 7 out of 10—on the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which said, [...] "Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to Alien may not answer {{all of its}} <b>big</b> <b>questions,</b> but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances—particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android." [...] Metacritic provides a score of 65 out of 100 from 42 critics, which indicates [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a [...] "B" [...] {{on a scale of}} A+ to F, while audience members under 25 rated it the highest at A-. Reviews frequently praised both the film's visual aesthetic and design, and Fassbender's performance as the android David received almost universal acclaim. However the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable, tempered by appreciation for the action and horror set-pieces.|$|E
500|$|Many assertions {{about the}} year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified {{collection}} of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from [...] "Mayanist," [...] {{used to refer to}} an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of [...] "balancing the cosmos" [...] was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included [...] "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but [...] "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism." [...] Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a [...] "disconnected" [...] society: [...] "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's <b>big</b> <b>questions</b> within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge." ...|$|E

If so, reason can work on those problems over which it has authority while other sources of knowledge or opinion can have authority on the <b>big</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
