5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

500|$|Jackson owed his vocal {{technique}} {{in large part}} to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: [...] "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang – just the way she was." [...] He told her: [...] "I want to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> you, Diana." [...] She said: [...] "You just be yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|... 'Artpop' {{is really}} an inferno and it's the only song on the record that I didn't really wanna go {{anywhere}} or explode or orgasm. Because then {{it would just be}} like composing something that would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> every other sort of orgasm that I've ever had. And because its really the center of the record, I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone, to this concept of Art+Pop, that we can put art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore. How can we the artist back our ideas and for our visions {{to be the most important}} thing. The thing that's driving culture, driving these corporations. I didn't wanted [...] to grow too much, I wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra.|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Gavin Volure" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy, in a voice over, talks about the Edison Terrace—located in the rooftop gardens of the General Electric Building. [...] "It's a private rooftop garden reserved for the CEOs of this company. The inner temple of American business. The only outsider ever admitted is a mute cleaning lady who has never laid with a man." [...] The scene features six men, including fictional CEO of General Electric on the show, Don Geiss (Rip Torn). In the second scene, Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) intern (Liz Holtan) is excited to work with her and tells her that she wants to <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> her. Jenna believes the intern wants to become an actress, prompting her to pull the intern's earring off. The latter scene was included in the October 15, 2009, 30 Rock episode [...] "Season 4".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{increasing}} mainstream success, Sylvester {{continued to}} reaffirm his {{connection to the}} gay community of San Francisco, performing at the main stage at the 1979 Gay Freedom Day parade. Further, during his summer 1979 tour of the UK, he performed at the London Gay Pride Festival in Hyde Park. That same year, Sylvester met the singer Jeanie Tracy through Harvey Fuqua, and they immediately became friends. A large black woman, Sylvester felt that Tracy would work well with his Two Tons O' Fun, and invited her to join his backing singers, which she proceeded to do. Subsequently, befriending the Tons, she would work for Sylvester {{for the rest of}} his life. The Tons themselves were convinced by Fuqua to produce their own self-titled album, from which came two dance chart hits, [...] "Earth Can <b>Be</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> Heaven" [...] and [...] "Just Us"; as a result, they began to work less and less with Sylvester, only joining him on occasion for his live shows. In some interviews he would express bitterness at their departure, while in others he stressed that he had no bad feelings toward them.|$|E
500|$|Bond {{wrote of}} her next role, [...] "It {{was like a}} dream come true when I saw my own name in the title role" [...] of Iolanthe (1882–84). Bond's first {{entrance}} as Iolanthe was across a [...] "stream". [...] She wrote in her memoirs about a performance of Iolanthe: [...] "Realism can be carried too far, as it was when one night a zealous property man said to me: 'It'll <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the real thing to-night, Miss Bond. I've put some frogs into the water!' [...] 'Then you'll just have to fish them out again,' I retorted, 'and the curtain won't go up until you do.' [...] They had to catch those frogs in an inverted umbrella. [...] Everybody got splashed and agitated, and the performance was delayed for some time." [...] The critics praised Bond's portrayal of the title character: [...] "Miss Jessie Bond... may be credited with all the grace, delicacy, and fascination we should expect from a fairy mother, and her singing of the really exquisite melody in the last scene {{was one of the most}} successful items in the entire opera." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E

500|$|U2's initial time at Danesmoate {{was spent}} {{recording}} and refining [...] "extensive demos" [...] that the Edge anticipated {{could turn into}} final backing tracks. They began with their usual songwriting methods of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording jam sessions. The sessions saw the group's songwriting beginning to evolve; not all material was being worked out as a band, rather Bono and the Edge often brought basic song ideas to Mullen and Clayton. The group were first joined at Danesmoate by Eno, with Flood and fellow engineer Dave Meegan recording their jams. Meegan said of Eno's involvement: [...] "Usually he was in first every morning and he'd start some dodgy sequence on his DX-7 —it would <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a cello line with no intentions of ever staying forever, just something to inspire people when they walked into the room." [...] One of the first songs worked on was [...] "Heartland", which originated during The Unforgettable Fire sessions and was later released on the band's 1988 album, Rattle and Hum. The arrangements for [...] "With or Without You" [...] and [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] were completed early in the Danesmoate sessions, giving the band the confidence to experiment. Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times—one producer {{for a week or}} two, followed by the other. The producers encouraged an interest in older songs, especially American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of the Smiths and My Bloody Valentine. The band's musical vocabulary had improved after their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.|$|E
