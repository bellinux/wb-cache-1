5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey.|$|E

5|$|Alvarado's subjugation of Honduras proved superficial, {{and largely}} limited to Higueras. His {{conquest of the}} Naco valley and the lower Ulúa River firmly {{established}} a Spanish presence there, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> that Spanish control was fragile. Expeditions had penetrated deeply across Honduras, and distant native rulers had come to offer homage to the Spanish Crown. The settlement at Gracias a Dios was not as secure as it had appeared when Alvarado left, and no effective assistance {{had been sent to}} Trujillo. Many native rulers, who had been cowed by Alvarado's formidable reputation and military skill, rose in rebellion as soon as he left the province. Alvarado had also encouraged the enslavement of natives that fought against the Spanish, and their subsequent sale, as well as general harsh treatment of the indigenous population; this produced considerable resentment among the Indians, and left them susceptible to rebellion. Many natives resisted passively, by not providing supplies or labour to their encomenderos. Continued slave raids, and ferocious treatment {{at the hands of the}} Achi Maya auxiliaries increased their hatred and resistance, and many Indians abandoned their settlements and fled to the mountains and forests. The greater part of the districts of San Pedro and Gracias a Dios were at war, and the Spanish position was again precarious.|$|E

25|$|From an {{exploration}} point of view, Forrest's third expedition was of great importance. A large area of previously unknown land was explored, {{and the popular}} notion of an inland sea was shown to be unlikely. However, the practical results were not great. Plenty of good pastoral land was found up {{to the head of}} the Murchison, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> that, the land was useless for pastoral enterprise, and Forrest was convinced that it would never be settled. Forrest also made botanical collections during the expedition that were given to Ferdinand von Mueller, who, in turn, named Eremophila forrestii in his honour.|$|E
25|$|Jean Metzinger's 1905-1906 Fauvist-divisionist technique, too, had its {{parallel}} in literature. For him, {{there was an}} emblematic alliance between the Symbolist writers and Neo-Impressionism. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is {{an important aspect of}} Metzinger's early work, proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with Cézannian perspective, beyond not just the preoccupations of Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> too the preoccupations of his avant-garde entourage.|$|E

25|$|Consumed in bitter wars {{with the}} Persian Sasanian Empire in the east, the Byzantines had little {{resources}} {{to confront the}} Slavs. The Slavs came in large numbers {{and the lack of}} political organisation made it very difficult to stop them because there was no political leader to defeat in battle and thereby force their retreat. As the wars with Persia persisted, the 610s and 620s saw a new and even larger migration wave with the Slavs penetrating further south into the Balkans, reaching Thessaly, Thrace and Peloponnese and raiding some islands in the Aegean Sea. The Byzantines held out Salonica and a number of coastal towns <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> these areas the imperial authority in the Balkans disappeared.|$|E
25|$|To justify such {{a radical}} move towards the {{depiction}} {{of the world in}} unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with positivism, materialism and determinism. The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers Henri Bergson and Friedrich Nietzsche, William James and the mathematician Henri Poincaré. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on non-Euclidean geometry, Riemannian geometry and the relativity of knowledge, contradicting notions of absolute truth. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as Röntgen's X-rays, Hertzian electromagnetic radiation and radio waves propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> the sphere of sensory perception. Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by learning, memory and expectation.|$|E
25|$|By early 1931 {{unemployment}} {{stood at}} 19.2%. Governor Albert C. Ritchie was a stalwart opponent of federal intervention in local affairs, {{and continued to}} urge programs sponsored by the business community itself. Social welfare agencies based on state support expanded services as much as possible, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> pushing ahead with all feasible public works projects the state did little. Baltimore established a Commission on Employment Stabilization but found work for only one-fifth of the job-seekers. Baltimore relief agencies were soon overwhelmed and the election of Mayor Howard W. Jackson, although bringing about municipal loans to the Citizens' Emergency Relief Committee, showed that local aid was simply inadequate. Ritchie agreed to issue state bonds to aid Baltimore, but would not borrow from President Herbert Hoover's new Reconstruction Finance Corporation until mid-1933, and his luxury tax program met stiff opposition from county representatives opposed to new tobacco taxes. Originally planned for $8 million, the Baltimore bond issue had to be $12 million as the state economy floundered. Only reluctantly was federal assistance finally accepted.|$|E

25|$|<b>But</b> <b>beyond</b> {{the general}} {{fact that it}} enjoyed great wealth and prosperity, {{advantages}} which it doubtless owed to the noted fertility of its territory, we have scarcely any information concerning the history of Heraclea until we reach a period when it was already beginning to decline. We cannot doubt that it took part with the Tarentines in their wars against the Messapians and Lucanians, and {{it appears to have}} fallen gradually into a state of almost dependence upon that city, though without ever ceasing to be, in name at least, an independent state. Hence, when Alexander, king of Epirus, who had been invited to Italy by the Tarentines, subsequently became hostile to that people, he avenged himself by taking Heraclea, and, as already mentioned, transferred to the Thurians the general assemblies that had previously been held there. During the war of Pyrrhus with the Romans, Heraclea was the scene of the first conflict between the two powers, the consul Laevinus being totally defeated by the Epirot king in a battle (subsequently called the Battle of Heraclea) fought between the city of Heraclea and the river Siris, 280BCE.|$|E
25|$|At 7.30am the {{infantry}} battalions set {{off from the}} east of the town; first the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, then the 1st King's Royal Rifle Corps and lastly the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers (the 1st Leicestershire Regiment were left to guard the camp). The first part of the advance went well and they reached a small wood {{at the foot of the}} hill where they found some shelter <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> the wood there was a wall with a small gap and then open ground. Some of the Dublins were pinned down in a ditch ahead and the Fusiliers were lining the wall to the left. Shortly after 9am Symons rode up to the wood being followed by an aide-de-camp holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled. He ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by his pennant. After a few moments he returned and was helped to remount his horse. He then rode back from the front lines until he was out of sight from his troops before he asked for assistance from the Indian stretcher bearers as he had been shot in the stomach.|$|E

A little more remote is a third, {{separated}} by a narrow, horizontal, flat surface from the suture. All these three lirations are orname ted with little tubercles or blunt spines, which are strongest on the highest thread, and there number about twenty-five on the body whorl, on the second thread there are about twenty-eight. The base, which is rather flatly arched, has round the outside a flat surface hardly deep enough {{to be called a}} furrow, defined on the inner side by a clear narrow line, within which the curve of the base rises a little and has some faint spirals. The edge of the umbilicus is sharply defined by a fine line, outside of which is a broad shallow furrow bordered externally by a slight spiral. There is another narrower furrow, the outer side of which is the most projecting part of the base, <b>but</b> <b>beyond</b> this is rather flat and has some obsolete spirals. On the upper whorls the spirals are feeble and without tubercles, which only appear distinctly on the fourth whorl.|$|E
