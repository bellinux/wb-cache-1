5|$|Rico's {{choice is}} taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves {{with a sense}} of estrangement. He is {{assigned}} to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander. Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and Moral Philosophy in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated enough not to resign. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the <b>blast</b> <b>zone,</b> which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Eventually, after further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2009 who had begun training in that regiment.|$|E

25|$|The Irgun sent {{warnings}} by telephone, {{including one}} to the hotel's own switchboard, which, possibly because hoax bomb warnings were rife at the time, the staff decided to ignore, but none directly to the British authorities. From {{the fact that a}} bomb search had already been carried out, it appears that a hoax call or tip-off had been received at the hotel earlier that day. Subsequent telephone calls from a concerned Palestine Post staff member and the police caused increasing alarm, and the hotel manager was notified. In the closing minutes before the explosion, he called an unknown British officer, but no evacuation was ordered. Controversy has arisen over the timing and adequacy of the warnings and, based on the not necessarily true assumption that {{the number of people in}} the <b>blast</b> <b>zone</b> would have been reduced, the reasons why the hotel was not evacuated.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, mines are {{automatically}} activated upon {{contact with the}} water. In others, a safety lanyard is pulled (e.g. one end attached to the rail of a ship, aircraft or torpedo tube) which starts an automatic timer countdown before the arming process is complete. Typically, the automatic safety-arming process takes some minutes to complete. This is {{in order to give}} the people laying the mines sufficient time to move out of its activation and <b>blast</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
40|$|In the querry {{for white}} marble "Sivec", where the {{research}} was carried out during normal exploitation, in the zones where digging is done, marble masses appear, which are broken down, not quality, {{and they need to}} be quickly removed. Drilling and mining operations are applied using certain quantities of explosives. In this application there is a danger of damaging the quality marble masses that are located around the <b>blasting</b> <b>zone.</b> This paper is actually a continuation of the paper from the same authors regarding the seismic effects from blasting in surface mines...|$|R
500|$|Direct <b>blast</b> <b>zone,</b> the {{innermost}} zone, averaged about [...] in radius, {{an area in}} which virtually everything, natural or artificial, was obliterated or carried away. For this reason, this zone also has been called the [...] "tree-removal zone". The flow of the material carried by the blast was not deflected by topographic features in this zone. The blast released energy equal to 24 Megatons of TNT.|$|E
500|$|Channelized <b>blast</b> <b>zone,</b> an {{intermediate}} zone, extended out to distances {{as far as}} [...] from the volcano, {{an area in which}} the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography. In this zone, the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off {{at the base of the}} trunk as if they were blades of grass mown by a scythe. This zone was also known as the [...] "tree-down zone". Channeling and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades. Where the blast struck open land directly, it scoured it, breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil, thereby delaying revegetation for many years. Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres, it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained, permitting faster revegetation with scrub and herbaceous plants, and later with saplings. Trees in the path of such higher-level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights, whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long-term harm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the effect of blast shake on the {{stability}} of tunnel during mining process, finite element analysis software for rock and soil engineering is used to simulate the effect of blasting shake. In the simulation, a short-time dynamic load {{is applied to the}} rock in the <b>blasting</b> <b>zone.</b> Dynamic stress field in the rock mass and distortion in the surface of the tunnel are calculated with the finite-element method. Equivalent displacement method is utilized to determine the amount of sudden applied load, the actuation duration and the range of action. Consequently, the maximum critical explosive content at the critical shake speed of rock mass can be defined...|$|R
5000|$|Nuclear cores were {{deployed}} {{and thus the}} Air Force had several nuclear weapons at their disposal. Command of any nuclear strike was given to General Curtis LeMay. The plan was to destroy large military targets, power plants, and also create a ring of <b>blast</b> <b>zones</b> through Manchuria to dissuade any further intervention from the Communists. Although {{the use of nuclear}} weapons was approved, they were never needed because the Chinese and North Koreans eventually signed the Korean Armistice Agreement. In actuality, although the US almost lost the war and was prepared to follow through with the plan, by 1953 the US had pushed the communist forces back across the current armistice line before a ceasefire was called, and thus it was unneeded.|$|R
40|$|Artificial explosions are {{commonly}} used to prevent rockburst in deep roadways. However, the dissipation of the impact stress wave within the artificial <b>blasting</b> damage <b>zone</b> (ABDZ) of the rocks surrounding a deep roadway {{has not yet been}} clarified. The surrounding rocks were divided into the elastic <b>zone,</b> <b>blasting</b> damage <b>zone,</b> plastic zone, and anchorage zone in this research. Meanwhile, the ABDZ was divided into the pulverizing area, fractured area, and cracked area from the inside out. Besides, the model of the normal incidence of the impact stress waves in the ABDZ was established; the attenuation coefficient of the amplitude of the impact stress waves was obtained after it passed through the intact rock mass, and ABDZ, to the anchorage zone. In addition, a numerical simulation was used to study the dynamic response of the vertical stress and impact-induced vibration energy in the surrounding rocks. By doing so, the dissipation of the impact stress waves within the ABDZ of the surrounding rocks was revealed. As demonstrated in the field application, the establishment of the ABDZ in the surrounding rocks reduced the effect of the impact-induced vibration energy on the anchorage support system of the roadway...|$|R

The municipal water supply for Lac-Mégantic was shut down {{on the evening of}} the explosion because of a leak inside the <b>blast</b> <b>zone,</b> requiring trucks carrying drinking water, though the leak was repaired overnight and a precautionary boil-water advisory issued. The industrial park lost access to rail service in both directions as the line remained severed until December 2013.

40|$|Blasting with {{wedge cut}} {{is the key}} to the {{efficiency}} of roadway excavation in coal mines, particularly where the rock face is highly laminated. The quality of the wedge cuts can directly affect blasting results. A series of model experiments were carried out in the Blasting Laboratory of Henan Polytechnique University, China, in order to improve the quality of wedge cuts and increase roadway development rates in the South Wing rail of Tunliu mine. Three groups of twelve wedge cut model experiments were conducted, which showed that the wedge cutting boreholes angle can affect the depth and volume of <b>blasted</b> <b>zone.</b> It was found that; symmetrical cut pattern was beneficial, and effective stemming of the blasting holes can enhance explosive energy efficiency and ensure effective blasting.

5000|$|In 2004, it was {{estimated}} that there was a shortage of approximately 3,000 caravan sites for Romani communities in Netherlands. Instances of Romani communities being moved into socially and environmentally disadvantaged areas, for the purported intention of preventing conflicts between nomadic Romani and non-Romani, have been documented. Observers such as Rodrigues and Matelski have determined through interviews that it is extremely common, if not universally occurring, for nomadic Romani in Netherlands to experience vocal opposition when proposing new caravan sites to municipalities, whose residents frequently cite concerns over lowered property values. As a result, many nomadic Romani end up living at isolated, environmentally problematic, and sometimes dangerous sites. In one case, a Romani camp was identified as being located within the <b>blasting</b> <b>zone</b> of an explosives factory, a situation that Rodrigues and Matelski have explicitly identified as [...] "environmental racism." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} work is {{an investigation}} of high speed boundary layers in geological flows. In particular, it focuses on meteorite impact structures of the Martian double-layer ejecta (DLE) type and the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 which was hypothesized to be an underexpanded jet originally by Kieffer. Key questions include: What causes the transition {{that can be seen}} in the two <b>blast</b> <b>zones</b> of Mount St. Helens characterized by the blow down pattern of the trees? On the double-ejecta layer craters, what causes the transition from radial grooves to ridges that curve around preexisting obstacles? How does the presence of a boundary influence the overall structure of the external flow fields in the case of an underexpanded jet? What happens when roughness elements are introduced into the flow field? Do they play a role in the development in vortices or can the vortices inherent in the existence of a free underexpanded jet still exist even after the jet reflects off a boundary? Experiments were conducted impacting an underexpanded jet over a plate boundary with and without roughness elements. The plate mounted at various angles and distances. The flow field was investigated using pressure sensitive paint, shear stress sensitive film, and schlieren. Schlieren images show resulting shock interaction with the plate boundary and are compared to the separation of the two <b>blast</b> <b>zones</b> at Mount St. Helens. Pressure sensitive paint and shear stress sensitive films were used to monitor transition locations along the boundary and characterize pressure fluctuations due to roughness elements. Results indicate that the jet and plate boundary interaction produces a structure that is fairly insensitive to plate angle, for small angles. The jet also produced an oblique shock on the plate. This oblique shock was in a location that correlated well with the elevated Mach disk position for the range of pressure ratios investigated. Numerical calculations indicate curvature on Mount St. Helens and the DLE crater Bacolor could be sufficient for the formation of Taylor-Gortler vortices...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, activists like Bo Webb and Lorelei Scarbro, {{who live}} in the shadow of Coal River Mountain, have {{organized}} a group of citizens to propose that instead of destroying the mountain, a sustainable wind farm be built on the mountain’s ridges instead - an energy project that could power 70,000 homes with renewable energy virtually forever. But Massey Energy and now Alpha Natural Resources has a permit to destroy over 6,000 acre of the mountain instead. Over time, the wind farm would provide more jobs to the community, and on day-one it would pay more taxes to the county than the coal strip mine, Scarbro explains.

40|$|Field {{evidence}} suggests that the lateral blast in the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption behaved like an underexpanded jet flow. We conduct two experiments to investigate this hypothesis. In our first experiment, we use the compressible flow [...] shallow-water analogy to measure the geometry of the shock structure around the underexpanded jet, which is comparable with the position of the interface between the direct and channelized <b>blast</b> <b>zones</b> described by Kieffer (1981). Also, Kieffer and Sturtevant (1988) identified furrows created by the blast which were possibly formed by scouring due to Goertler vortices induced by curvature in the terrain. In our second experiment, carried out in a compressible flow laboratory, we investigate an additional Goertler vortex generation mechanism due to the curvature of the shear layer adjacent to the intercepting shocks in the underexpanded jet. These experiments allow for a more-detailed scrutiny of the underexpanded jet [...] lateral blast analogy proposed by Kieffer (1981) ...|$|R
