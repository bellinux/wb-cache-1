25|$|It {{was to be}} a full {{generation}} before British archaeology {{caught up}} with the Danish. When it did, the leading figure was another multi-talented man of independent means: John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury.

Thomsen had <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization.|$|E
25|$|Artists Naum Gabo, El Lissitzky, Kazimir Malevich, and Alexander Rodchenko, have {{influenced}} the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Coop Himmelb(l)au. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward purism, though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of socialist and collectivist causes.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{inception}} of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> describing and analysing previously undocumented languages. Starting with Franz Boas in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description {{played a role in the}} development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and linguistic anthropology, which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{referred}} to the conflict as a civil war, with other factors involved. The Korean War was the first armed confrontation of the Cold War and {{set the standard for}} many later conflicts. It is often viewed {{as an example of the}} proxy war, where the two superpowers would fight in another country, forcing the people in that country to suffer most of the destruction and death involved in a war between such large nations. The superpowers avoided descending into an all-out war against one another, as well as the mutual use of nuclear weapons. It expanded the Cold War, which to that point had mostly <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> Europe.|$|E

Once TVETs have labour market information, they should provide vocational guidance to match skills to job opportunities. Private TVETs, accounting for 51% of TVET provision in 2010/11, are concentrated in urban areas and have largely <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> making a profit rather than their graduates' employment opportunities. They do tend to have better resources and more practically skilled instructors than public TVETs {{but they have been}} reluctant to allow their workshops to be used for co-operative training and occupational assessment.|$|E

Nor is it clear if he ever fully appreciated Einstein's critical contribution to the understanding of the Lorentz transformations, thinking of Einstein's work as being an extension of Lorentz's work.|$|E
25|$|Research on the {{physiological}} roots of procrastination have <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> {{the role of}} the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is responsible for executive brain functions such as impulse control, attention and planning. Which is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to exactly these functions, or lack of them. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli, from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area of the brain can reduce an individual's ability to filter out distracting stimuli and result in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, where it is commonly underactivated.|$|E
25|$|The {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War in the early 1960s {{had a significant impact}} on Ohio Wesleyan students. A small minority had <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the war for several years, but the bombing of North Vietnam and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in August 1964 raised campus-wide awareness almost overnight. The Vietnam War, so distant, became a huge presence on campus, affected ideas of community, student power, and free speech, and influenced daily decisions like class choices and social interactions. The first stirrings of protest against the war occurred in late 1964. In December, the Wesleyan Council of Student Affairs voted to send a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson opposing the expansion of the war and advocating withdrawal. Opposing expansion was a fairly moderate position, but calling for withdrawal was much more radical.|$|E

25|$|Beuys's {{charisma}} and eclecticism have polarised his audience. Beuys {{has attracted a}} huge number of admirers and devotees, the tendency of whom has been to uncritically accept Beuys's own explanations as interpretive solutions to his work. In contrast, there are those who, following Buchloh, are relentlessly critical of Beuys's rhetoric and use weaknesses in his argumentation to dismiss his work as bogus. Relatively few accounts have <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> an encounter with the works themselves, with exceptions arriving in the scholarship of art historians such as Gene Ray, Claudia Mesch, Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes, Briony Fer, Alex Potts, and others. The drive here has been to wrest the potential of Beuys's work away from the artist's own rhetoric, and to further explore both the wider discursive formations within which Beuys operated (this time, productively), and the specific material properties of the works themselves.|$|E
25|$|Jones was {{rejected}} by all the Welsh universities, so he applied to the University of Edinburgh for an undergraduate degree, which had a closing date seven days later, and he was accepted onto a zoology undergraduate course. He stayed on in Edinburgh to do research for a Doctor of Philosophy degree on the ecological genetics of Cepaea, a snail whose shell is polymorphic in colour pattern, making it a model organism for evolutionary biologists. He developed an interest in snails from the late Bryan Clarke, one of his teachers at Edinburgh and subsequently professor of genetics at the University of Nottingham. After his PhD, Jones also completed post-doctoral research into the genetics of Drosophila at the University of Chicago to widen his experience. Much of Jones' research has <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> snails and the light their study can shed on biodiversity and genetics.|$|E
