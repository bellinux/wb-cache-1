60|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> old Mrs. Dempster {{sat down}} in her easy-chair without any painful, {{suppressed}} remembrance of the pre-ceding night.|$|E
60|$|MARLOW. I put the box {{out with}} the whisky last night, sir, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I can't find it anywhere.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I {{examined}} it without temper, {{and saw that}} if I abolished the advertisement it would be literature again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, good morning, Wadham," [...] he said, {{stepping}} into his taxicab. [...] "I {{have no doubt}} that you did your best, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> unfortunate happening will take me some time to get over. My compliments to your senior partner. You can say that I am disappointed--no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come thro', come thro', Lieutenant Gordon! [...] Come thro' {{and drink}} some wine wi' me! [...] Yestreen I was your prisoner, [...] <b>But</b> now <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> am I free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They's won't answer you," [...] {{said the}} {{apparition}} curtly. [...] "They are strangers ... only came last night, <b>but</b> all <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> when the landlord or his wife {{knocked at the}} door, they simply would not open it." ...|$|R
60|$|Gom. A {{little sleep}} will do her more good, I'm sure: You know, she disburthened her {{conscience}} <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to you.|$|E
6000|$|Again Miss Stackpole held him--with an {{intention}} of perfect kindness--in suspense. [...] "She came here yesterday, {{and spent the}} night. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> she started for Rome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Kurt, [...] "I'm {{going to}} be killed. I didn't know it before, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> at dawn, I knew it--as though I'd been told." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> no beggar {{would have}} more thankfully {{received}} a charitable coin, for the demon thirst had him by the throat--the drunkard's matutinal thirst that requires to be slaked at each morning station {{on the road to}} Tophet.|$|R
60|$|I {{attended}} the rehearsal last night, <b>but</b> am better <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{and the doctor}} thinks I will pull through with careful attention.|$|R
60|$|Gerard Godfrey {{was at his}} own door. He {{was not one of}} {{the regular}} attendants at the short service, being of that modern species that holds itself {{superior}} to 'Cranmer's prayers,' <b>but</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> he hastened up to her with outstretched hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father says}} I have seen you before, signora, but in sooth I know not where or how, {{since it was}} <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that I arrived in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} no {{opportunity}} of telling her," [...] he answered. [...] "I might not have thought so seriously of it, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I received a note from Heneage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Master de Luynes, that a St. Auban does not fight men of your stamp. You forced a {{rendezvous}} upon me; you shall reap the consequences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suit me all right," [...] Granet agreed. [...] "I'd {{meant to}} lay up because of my arm, <b>but</b> it's better <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> We'll start early and get back for the papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{appeared}} for {{a moment}} to reflect upon this: it was spoken in a tone that might have touched her. Yet {{at the end of the}} moment, lifting her eyes, she brought out: [...] "I hate art, as you call it. I thought I did, I knew I did; <b>but</b> till <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I didn't know how much." ...|$|R
60|$|On this occasion, {{when she}} gained her own room, she as usual placed Mimmy {{on the sofa}} with a needle. Her custom then was {{to take up a}} novel; <b>but</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> she sat herself down in her arm-chair, and resting her head upon her hand and elbow, began to turn over certain {{circumstances}} in her mind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He cannot tell you, sir,' {{the widow}} interposed. 'It's {{of no use}} to ask him. We are <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> come from a long {{distance}} in the country, and know nothing of these matters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{he could}} hardly wait till morning. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{when we came to}} call the teacher, he didn't answer, and father went in and found him unconscious. Then I went for the doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The deil ye didna!--See, man, I got {{the word}} <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> out of a {{memorial}} of Mr. Crossmyloof's--see, there it is, ictus clarissimus et perti--peritissimus--it's a' Latin, for it's printed in the Italian types." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You, then,' said Bertram to his sister, 'are {{all that}} remains to me! Last night, <b>but</b> more fully <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Colonel Mannering gave me an account of our family misfortunes, though without saying I should find my sister here.' ...|$|R
40|$|In Victoria {{the search}} has begun {{for a new}} chief police {{commissioner}} to replace Simon Overland who abruptly resigned yesterday. Installed by the former Brumby government {{more than two years}} ago Mr Overland had been accused of being Labor's stooge. <b>But</b> calls <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to de-politicise the way the chief commissioners are appointed have already been rejected by the current Coalition Government and Victoria's Police Association...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> Mr. McQuirk did not hasten {{immediately}} to his post of leisure and observation. Something unusual {{that he could}} not quite grasp was in the air. Something disturbed his thoughts, ruffled his senses, made him at once languid, irritable, elated, dissastisfied and sportive. He was no diagnostician, and he did not know that Lent was breaking up physiologically in his system.|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is Guy Aylmer, sir; I am {{the son of}} Sir James Aylmer, an English knight, and am here as the esquire of Dame Margaret de Villeroy, {{who arrived}} <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been through}} it, Liddy, {{and it is}} over. I shan't mind it again, for they will all have grown {{accustomed}} to seeing me there; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> it was as bad as being married--eyes everywhere!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know why}} well enough, girl? Because I have chosen another husband for you. The Lord Despard is taken with your baby face, and would marry you. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I had {{it under his}} own hand." ...|$|E
60|$|My cold {{has been}} oppressive, {{and is not}} yet gone. I have been very hard to sleep too, and last night I was all <b>but</b> sleepless. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> I was very dull and seedy; but I got a good walk, and picked up again. It has been blowing all day, and I fear we shall have a sick passage over to Dublin to-morrow night.|$|R
6000|$|He dress'd; {{and like}} young {{people he was}} wont [...] To take some trouble with his toilet, <b>but</b> [...] <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> rather spent less time upon 't; [...] Aside his very mirror soon was put; [...] His curls fell negligently o'er his front, [...] His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut, [...] His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied [...] Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> the Fairies {{who were}} searching in the {{mountains}} had a new thought. They joined hands and moved {{in a straight line}} through the rocks that formed the mountain, beginning at the topmost peak and working downward, so that no spot could be missed by their bright eyes. And at last they discovered the cave where the toys had been heaped up by the wicked Awgwas.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] said Tuppence, her {{flagging}} spirits reviving. [...] "And all expenses paid! But, oh, Tommy, I do {{like things}} to happen quickly. So far, adventure has succeeded adventure, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> has been dull as dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly we {{have heard}} so, and a {{messenger}} came to us <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> saying that {{they had come to}} deliver us from the Turks, and inviting us to go in thither and see them. Have you not received a message also?" ...|$|E
60|$|All the {{preceding}} afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed {{down upon the}} meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge, {{and the air was}} balmy and clear.|$|E
40|$|Remember Christmas morning? How shivvery you were, but how thrilled! How other mornings dad {{had to call}} {{at least}} three times before you dared venture into the cold room, <b>but</b> how <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> you were groping for robe and {{slippers}} before dad had scarcely called, 2 ̆ 2 Merry Christmas! 2 ̆ 2 up the dark stairway; and you were down like a flash to the rooms below, never noticing the cold...|$|R
60|$|I thought no {{one knew}} <b>but</b> me till <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{when you were talking}} to Arthur. Then I thought you must know too. My heart was in my mouth, I was afraid you were going to tell him. But you didn't, and I thought I'd been mistaken.|$|R
6000|$|... "A shaver, my dear Vigo! Only {{returned}} to town this afternoon, and found your invitation. How fortunate!" [...] And {{then he looked}} around, and recognising Mrs. Rodney, was immediately at her side. [...] "I must have the honour of taking you into dinner. I got your note, <b>but</b> only by <b>this</b> <b>morning's</b> post." ...|$|R
