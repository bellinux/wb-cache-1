40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to {{summarize}} the art of state {{in the area of}} the contact fatigue, lubricants and detection of the rolling contact fatigue exploiting the acoustic emission method. In the experimental part of this bachelor’s thesis are performed the rolling contact testing for the standard grease and the lubricant with EP additives by marginal exploiting the acoustic emission method.

40|$|Using the {{relationships}} of the ISO 281 standard, this paper optimizes the internal dimensions of tapered roller bearings for maximum rating life. The bearing system addressed contains two identical bearings subjected to an arbitrary combination of centred radial and axial forces. It is shown that the <b>basic</b> <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> increases more than quadratically with the roller infill and the aspect ratio of the rollers, increases with the sixth power of the pitch diameter of the roller set and decreases with the third power of the applied radial force. Further, for any given ratio of axial to radial force, an optimal contact angle exists which maximizes the rating life of the bearing pair, irrespective of the actual bearing size and ratio of roller diameter to pitch diameter. The optimization procedure can either be used to design custom-made bearings or to select from manufacturers’ catalogues the bearing with the best contact angle for any assigned loading condition...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{conceptual}} design of spindle speeder head for headstock of {{horizontal boring machine}} of FERMAT Company. The thesis includes research part, which is initially given to horizontal boring machines and their accessories and continues with an overview and comparison of spindle speeders that are currently on the market. The work includes technical report, which is aimed on design of the belt drive including the idler pulley. Design of belt drive {{is based on the}} output of the calculation program developed by manufacturer of synchronous belts. Calculation part, mainly focused on the spindle and its bearings, is preceded by a part in which are calculated cutting forces for two technological operations. Calculation of the spindle part contains strength calculation of the spindle and equivalent <b>basic</b> <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> of spindle bearings, including calculating of radial stiffness at the spindle nose and calculation of optimal distance between the spindle bearings. At the end of the technical report is a financial summary, description of used components and the chosen design solution. The drawings which are based on model assembly processed in 3 D CAD system, contains a drawing of the entire device and drawings of selected components...|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-section}} of roller profile controls the pressure {{distribution in the}} contact area and radically affects the roller bearings <b>basic</b> dynamic load <b>rating</b> and rating lives. Today the most used roller profiles are the logarithmic profile and cylindrical-crowned (ZB) profile. The logarithmic profile has a continuous evolution with no discontinuities till the intersection with the end fillet while ZB profile has two more discontinuities at the intersections points between the crowning circle and straight line generatrix. Using a semianalytical method, a numerical study {{has been carried out}} to find the optimum ZB profile for rollers incorporated in cylindrical rollers bearings.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} total {{deformation}} of {{thrust ball bearing}} & contact stress b/w ball & raceways & its effect on fatigue life of thrust ball bearing. The 3 -Dimensional Modeling has been done through modeling software Pro-e wildfire- 5. 0. The parts assembly is also done in Pro-e wildfire- 5. 0 & analysis has been done through ANSYS- 14. An analylitical method is good, less expensive and gives the best results. Analytical results give good agreement with the experimental data. The thrust ball bearings are subjected to various, thrust & dynamic loads, which simulated easily through Pro-E software & analysis because experimentally calculation is very complicated. The general theory used for calculating the Fatigue life of Bearing is <b>basic</b> <b>life</b> <b>rating</b> theory. The material taken for the Bearing is AISI 8720 H. In this study we have used various analysis codes and got a good result through these codes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{an electric}} transmission {{company in a}} pass-through area should settle {{the cost of a}} pass-through with the neighboring transmission companies under the point-of-connection tariff system. First, the paper shows that if the cost of the pass-through is settled based on the principle that determines the (metered) power transmission fares for ordinary customers (i. e. injectors and withdrawers) of the transmission companies, the fare receipts of the pass-through transmission company can be made to match its power transmission losses. The paper also demonstrates that this method minimizes power transmission losses from a nationwide perspective. In addition, the paper shows that incentives will be given to construction of the transmission line in the pass-through area if the transmission company in the pass-through area charges its neighboring transmission companies the same <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> (as opposed to the metered transmission fare) that ordinary injectors and withdrawers face. This structure of a <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> sets higher injection rates and lower withdrawal rates in upstream areas than in downstream areas. The revenue from this <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> structure can bear the burden of construction costs of transmission lines in the pass-through areas. Incidentally, this finding justifies the structure of <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> practiced in Nordic countries. ...|$|R
50|$|Margaret Thatcher, who favoured {{indirect}} taxation, reduced {{personal income}} tax rates during the 1980s. In the first budget after her election victory in 1979, the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60% and the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> from 33% to 30%. The <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> was also cut for three successive budgets - to 29% in the 1986 budget, 27% in 1987 and to 25% in 1988. The top rate of income tax was cut to 40% in the 1988 budget. The investment income surcharge was abolished in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Gift Aid allows {{individuals}} who are subject to UK income tax to complete a simple, short declaration {{that they are a}} UK taxpayer. Any cash donations that the taxpayer makes to the charity after making a declaration are treated as being made after deduction of income tax at the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> (20% in 2011), and the charity can reclaim the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> income tax paid on the gift from HMRC. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this adds approximately 25% to the value of any gift made under Gift Aid. Higher-rate taxpayers can claim income tax relief, above and beyond the amount claimed directly by the charities. The rate of the relief for higher-rate taxpayers in 2011 is usually 20%, the difference between the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> (20%) and the higher rate (40%) of income tax, although recipients of dividend income (taxed at 10% and 32.5%) can achieve a higher rate of tax relief (22.5%).|$|R
