5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or <b>burst</b> <b>disk</b> on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E

The engine has no valves on the main pipes. It uses instead <b>burst</b> <b>disks</b> on the main pipes, between the tanks and the engine.

50|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>Disk</b> Valve: Used {{in a few}} {{pneumatics}} but {{primarily in}} hybrid cannons, burst valves are considered the ideal pressure release mechanism as they allow an unobstructed flow of high pressure air. Burst disks have no moving parts, making them very reliable. They are very appealing for hybrid cannons because they can withstand the low pressure gas mix in the chamber before ignition, yet fail as planned upon successful ignition. The high pressure combustion gases are released into the barrel at a rate which generates greater velocities than a mechanical valve could allow. Pneumatic cannon burst discs work similarly. The disc and projectile are loaded, and the chamber is pressurised until the disc ruptures. Unfortunately, this usually does not give the operators {{much in the way}} of control over timing, although a puncturing mechanism can be used. Burst disks are of no specific material and may consist of plastic or thin sheet metal or foil.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{means of}} utilising dry ice in spud guns {{is to use}} the {{sublimation}} of dry ice to create substantial pressure behind a valve, and placing a barrel {{on the other side of}} that valve with a projectile loaded into it. Pressures behind the valve can reach upwards of , and by quickly releasing the valve, the projectile can be launched. Whilst this method is more controllable and in many means safer than utilising a soda bottle as a <b>burst</b> <b>disk</b> (provided pressure rated valves and piping are used), it is limited in that quick release valves, such as ball valves, are generally not bigger in diameter than 1 or 2 inches. Additionally, they cannot be opened as rapidly as a soda bottle will rupture, and consequently there is less immediate airflow. However, this is offset by the fact that such a design can operate at more than double the pressure of a typical dry ice bomb launcher, as soda bottles will rupture at only [...]|$|E
5000|$|Cryostats used in MRI {{machines}} {{are designed to}} hold a cryogen, typically helium, in a liquid state with minimal evaporation (boil-off). The liquid helium bath is designed to keep the superconducting magnet's bobbin of superconductive wire in its superconductive state. In this state the wire has no electrical resistance and very large currents are maintained with a low power input. To maintain superconductivity, the bobbin must be kept below its transition temperature by being immersed in the liquid helium. If, for any reason, the wire becomes resistive, i.e. loses superconductivity, a condition known as a [...] "quench", the liquid helium evaporates, instantly raising pressure within the vessel. A <b>burst</b> <b>disk,</b> usually made of carbon, is placed within the chimney or vent pipe so that during a pressure excursion, the gaseous helium can be safely vented out of the MRI suite. Modern MRI cryostats use a mechanical refrigerator (cryocooler) to re-condense the helium gas {{and return it to}} the bath, to maintain cryogenic conditions and to conserve helium.|$|E
50|$|The hybrid {{electrothermal}} light-gas gun {{works on}} similar {{principles of the}} standard light-gas gun, but adds an electric arc to heat the light gas to a higher temperature and pressure than the piston alone. The arc is applied in the chamber containing the light gas, raising the temperature and pressure {{to the point where}} the gas both breaks the <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> and ignites the propellant behind the piston, which is perforated to allow ignition. The resulting combination of electrical heating and piston compression provide higher pressures and temperatures, resulting in more power and a higher potential speed than a standard light-gas gun.|$|R

40|$|Laser etched 300 series Stainless Steel <b>Burst</b> <b>Disks</b> (SSBD) ranging between 0. 178 mm (0. 007 -in.) and 0. 508 mm (0. 020 -in.) thick were {{designed}} {{for use in a}} 17 -caliber two-stage light gas launcher. First, a disk manufacturing method was selected using a combination of wire electrical discharge machining (EDM) to form the blank disks and laser etching to define the pedaling fracture pattern. Second, a replaceable insert was designed to go between the SSDB and the barrel. This insert reduced the stress concentration between the SSBD and the barrel, providing a place for the petals of the SSDB to open, and protecting the rifling {{on the inside of the}} barrel. Thereafter, a design of experiments was implemented to test and characterize the burst characteristics of SSBDs. Extensive hydrostatic burst testing of the SSBDs was performed to complete the design of experiments study with one-hundred and seven burst tests. The experiment simultaneously tested the effects of the following: two SSBD material states (full hard, annealed); five SSBD thicknesses 0. 178, 0. 254, 0. 305, 0. 381 mm (0. 007, 0. 010, 0. 012, 0. 015, 0. 020 -in.); two grain directions relative); number of times the laser etch pattern was repeated (varies between 5 - 200 times); two heat sink configurations (with and without heat sink); and, two barrel configurations (with and without insert). These tests resulted in the quantification of the relationship between SSBD thickness, laser etch parameters, and desired burst pressure. Of the factors investigated only thickness and number of laser etches were needed to develop a mathematical relationship predicting hydrostatic <b>burst</b> pressure of <b>disks</b> using the same barrel configuration. The fracture surfaces of two representative SSBD bursts were then investigated with a scanning electron microscope, one burst hydrostatically in a fixture and another dynamically in the launcher.

The tests were designed to predict the ability of the self-rescuers to withstand those environmental stresses without causing a decrease in wearer protection. The apparatus were heated to 710 C for 48 h, cooled to - 450 C for 16 h, vibrated for 9 h, and dropped 1 m on each axis. A critical concern was internal damage to an apparatus, without any obvious external signs, that would cause it to malfunction or seriously degrade its performance. Carbon dioxide (C 02) levels in apparatus with combined treatments were higher than in apparatus with individual treatments and untreated apparatus. The higher levels remained within safe limits, however. None of the treatments caused venting of the small oxygen cylinder that provides starter oxygen. Some bottles were found to be empty because of manufacturing defects in the <b>burst</b> <b>disks.</b> This problem was corrected in later models. The heat treatments did make the case ends more difficult to remove and the breathing bag sticky and subsequently more difficult to unfold. An apparatus that was dropped and vibrated had a broken desiccant bag that released some of its contents which compromised the seal of the relief valve. The case was dented from the drops.
