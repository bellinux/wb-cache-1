40|$|The {{following}} document {{sets out}} to determine the key limitations to existing methods of acquiring <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> data and how could accurate live <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> provide better information about a vehicle’s current behavior to aid vehicle safety systems. Initially, <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> estimation techniques are evaluated as these methods are currently used in electronic stability control systems, as current vehicles do not have <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> sensors. It is clear to see that all the different estimations methods have clear limitations. With this in mind existing methods of measuring <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> were investigated, such as optical sensors, GPS and Doppler velocity sensors. It is clear that laser Doppler velocity sensors could be an accurate method of measuring <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> on consumer vehicles, therefore a <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> based electronic stability control system using laser doppler velocity sensors is proposed. In order to further validate <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> based electronic stability control systems, several multi body simulations are carried out. The multi body simulations show that an electronic stability control system based on <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> is feasible. The simulations also show that in low coefficient of friction conditions the <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> is a better indicator of vehicle behavior than yaw rate. In conclusion, {{it is clear to}} see {{that there is a need}} in the automotive industry for direct real time slip angle sensors, but further research is required to determine the robustness and viability of <b>body</b> slip <b>angle</b> targeted ESC systems...|$|R

5000|$|The ballbots (CMU Ballbot, BallIP, NXT Ballbot, Adelaide Ballbot, Rezero) use linear {{feedback}} control approaches to maintain balance and achieve motion. The CMU Ballbot uses an inner balancing control loop that maintains the body at desired <b>body</b> <b>angles</b> and an outer loop controller that achieves desired ball motions by commanding <b>body</b> <b>angles</b> to the balancing controller. The CMU Ballbot plans motions {{in the space}} of <b>body</b> lean <b>angles</b> in order to achieve fast, dynamic and graceful ball motions. With the introduction of arms, CMU Ballbot uses its planning procedure to plan {{in the space of}} both <b>body</b> lean <b>angles</b> and arm angles to achieve desired ball motions. [...] Moreover, it can also account for cases where the arms are constrained to certain specific motions and only <b>body</b> <b>angles</b> have to be used to achieve desired ball motions. The CMU Ballbot uses an integrated planning and control framework to autonomously navigate human environments. Its motion planner plans in the space of controllers to produce graceful navigation, and achieves point-point and surveillance tasks. It uses the laser range finder to actively detect and avoid both static and dynamic obstacles in its environment.|$|R

A misconception regarding kneeling chairs is that the body's weight bears on the knees, and thus users with poor knees cannot use the chair. In a proper kneeling chair, most of the weight remains on the buttocks, and some of the weight bears on the shins, not the knees. The primary function of the shin rests (knee rests) is to keep one from falling forward out of the chair.|$|E

40|$|A {{new system}} was {{developed}} to analyze work posture {{in order to measure}} the three-dimensional <b>body</b> <b>angles</b> required as inputs to a biomechanical strength prediction model. This system was non-invasive and required no interference with work activities. Videotape was used at the job site to establish a permanent record of postural activity and a computer-aided digitization system was used to measure <b>body</b> <b>angles</b> in the laboratory. An experiment using five subjects and ten work postures was performed to investigate the nature and significance of measurement errors when using the new system. The results of this experiment revealed that, in general, subjects were able to distinguish different work postures; and that inter-subject bias was not significant. Measurement error was small for most joint angles and could be reduced further by enhancements to the system hardware. The system was found to be a useful tool for determining three-dimensional <b>body</b> <b>angles</b> when direct measurements are infeasible...|$|R
