5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written {{to be in her}} late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, she did not think that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E
40|$|The underrepresentation of <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> {{engineering}} highlights {{a missing}} {{segment of the}} population who could contribute to the knowledge economy. 1 An increase <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> engineering could lead to an increase in Black faculty members - and in general, role models - who cold teach and inspire future generations of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To address this national concern, stakeholders must first identify prevailing issues such as racial microaggressions, which threaten the long-term participation of <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> science and engineering...|$|R
50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that overall, more black males are in prison than are enrolled in colleges and universities. In 2000 there were 791,600 <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> prison and 603,032 enrolled in college versus 1980, when there were 143,000 <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> prison and 463,700 enrolled in college. In 2003, according to Justice Department figures, 193,000 <b>black</b> college-age <b>men</b> were <b>in</b> prison, while 532,000 <b>black</b> college-age <b>men</b> were attending college. On an average day in 1996, more black male high school dropouts aged 20-35 were in custody than in paid employment; by 1999, over one-fifth of <b>black</b> non-college <b>men</b> <b>in</b> their early 30’s had prison records.|$|R

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson was unaware of which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E

He stayed at the The Hotel Times Square on W. 46th Street. On March 20, Jackson allegedly walked up to Caughman with an 18-inch sword and stabbed him to death in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. Jackson turned himself in to police on March 22. According to police, Jackson told them that he planned to attack more <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> Times Square.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} mentorship in Black Greek letter fraternities (BGLFs) in resisting cultural and institutional oppression. Based on twenty interviews with black male college students, we build upon the works of others that have sought to examine the functions BGLFs play among <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> college. Through a grounded analysis of interviews and participant observation, we find that peer mentorships produce positive academic and social outcomes for <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> BGLFs. We suggest that BGLF participation offers collegiate <b>black</b> <b>men</b> mentorships with older members who motivate them to succeed personally and academically, support in integrating them into the black student community, and helps develop their professionalism and leadership. This mentorship allows young <b>black</b> <b>men</b> to contest the negative controlling images of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> culturally, {{and the lack of}} institutional support at predominantly white colleges and universities...|$|R
25|$|Wright {{was criticized}} for his {{concentration}} on violence in his works. In the case of Native Son, people complained that he portrayed a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of Native Son was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by Edwin Rosskam. While in Chicago he visited the American Negro Exhibition with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps and Claude McKay.|$|E
25|$|In early 1971, Sun Ra was {{appointed}} as artist-in-residence at University of California, Berkeley, teaching a course called The <b>Black</b> <b>Man</b> <b>In</b> the Cosmos.

One half-hour of each class was devoted to a lecture (complete with handouts and homework assignments), the other half-hour to an Arkestra performance or Sun Ra keyboard solo. Reading lists included the works of Madame Blavatsky and Henry Dumas, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Alexander Hislop's The Two Babylons, The Book of Oahspe, and assorted volumes concerning Egyptian hieroglyphs, African American folklore, and other topics.|$|E
25|$|In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and {{extensive}} refurbishment was undertaken.

A production of Priestley's An Inspector Calls, starring Anne Kristen, Julian Curry, Daphne Heard and William Roderick was produced. In February 1966, a successful production of Shakespeare's Othello was produced at Malvern Theatre, causing initial controversy when Rudolph Walker, in his first professional role, portrayed Othello, being a <b>black</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> May of that year, fans of The Who, angered that the group's van had broke down before they were due to play a gig at the Winter Gardens in Malvern, smashed {{the windows of the}} theatre.|$|E

25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations {{of life as a}} <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} {{follows the}} lives of three main characters named Charles, Mary Anne and LeRoi. Charles is a 25-year-old white man {{from a family of}} bankers, just back from college and ready to start a family. LeRoi is a young <b>black</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> his early 20s from a well-to-do black family and son of a preacher, off for the summer and ready for college. Mary Anne is a young white woman courted by Charles, but who falls in love with LeRoi. When Charles discovers what has happened while he was away at college, he beats Mary Anne and reports to the sheriff that LeRoi beat and raped her. The town forms a lynch mob and the governor is set to attend. Feeling some remorse for what he had brought about, Charles confesses to the sheriff that he had beaten Mary Anne and that she never had been raped. The sheriff, unwilling to cancel due to the visit of the governor, allowed the lynching to proceed anyway.|$|E
25|$|Sparked by {{the alleged}} rape {{of a white}} woman by a black man and {{the murder of a}} white engineer, {{supposedly}} also by a <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> <b>in</b> Springfield, and reportedly angered by the high degree of corruption in the city, some white residents took their anxiety and frustration out on blacks. Rioting broke out on August 14, 1908 and continued for three days in a period of violence known as the Springfield Race Riot. Gangs of white youth and blue-collar workers attacked the predominantly black areas of the city known as the Levee district, where most black businesses were located, and the Badlands, where many black residences stood. Two blacks were lynched and four whites were killed by gunfire when black property-owners sought to defend their homes and businesses. The riot ended when the governor sent in more than 3,700 militiamen to patrol the city, but isolated incidents of white violence against blacks continued in Springfield into September.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the possible outcomes of U. S. Navy policies to achieve proportionru representation {{of blacks in}} enlisted occupations. This thesis employs two models to anruyze the distribution of <b>black</b> enlisted <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the Navy's occupational speciruties. The fIfst model uses FY 1979, FY 1982. FY 1985, and FY 1988 cohort data to examine black male occupational representation during the fifth year of service. This study introduces {{a new approach to}} control for the influence of aptitude test scores on the occupational placement process. Black male representation in 14 occupational categories comprising J 09 Navy ratings is graphically summarized using difference indicators. The study analyzes the trend in black ma 1 e representation by comparing difference indicators for four enlisted cohorts spanning a 14 -year period. The second model uses data on the 1991 Navy enlisted population and the 1992 census to compare the distribution of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> Navy ratings with the distribution of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> civilian occupations. The results of the study reveal that disproportionate representation persists in certain Navy ratings. However, when the influence of aptitude is controlled. results indicate that the Navy has made progress toward minority placement goals. The study suggests that U. S. Navy policies have been effective in achieving a more representative distribution of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> Navy occupations. Commander, United State Nav...|$|R

25|$|When Ward {{was twelve}} years old, his mother died {{unexpectedly}} during childbirth and, in the ensuing chaos, the young man left home to travel around the United States by freight train. He headed north, supporting himself with occasional work as a boot-black, hotel bellboy, and barber-shop porter, but eventually ended up in jail for bootlegging in Salt Lake City, Utah. Ward rediscovered his love for writing, and eventually amassed an impressive corpus of poetry, short stories, and essays that helped him to gain entry into an extension program at the University of Utah in 1930. While there, his professor, Louis Zucker, encouraged Ward {{to apply for the}} prestigious Zona Gale Fellowship in creative writing at the University of Wisconsin. Ward's essay won the prize, and he departed for the one-year program in Madison, where he studied literature and dramatic arts in addition to working as a script writer and voice actor for WIBA-Radio Madison.
