25|$|The {{origin of}} Assamese {{language}} is not clear. Some believe that it originated from Kamarupi Prakrit used in ancient Kamarupa Kingdom. However {{it is believed that}} along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Assamese evolved at least before 7th century CE from the middle Indo-Aryan Magadhi Prakrit, which developed from dialects similar to, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> more archaic than Vedic Sanskrit. Its sister languages include Maithili, Odia, Chittagonian, Sylheti and Angika. It is written in the Assamese script, an abugida system, from left to right, with a large number of typographic ligatures.|$|E
25|$|The Indo-Aryan {{languages}} are commonly assigned to three major groups – Old, Middle and New Indo-Aryan. The classification reflects consecutive stages {{in a common}} linguistic development, but {{is not merely a}} matter of chronology: Classical Sanskrit, as a codified derivate of Vedic Sanskrit, remains mostly representative of the Old Indo-Aryan stage, even though it continued to flourish {{at the same time as}} the Middle Indo-Aryan languages. Conversely, a number of the morphophonological and lexical features of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages show that they are not direct continuations of Ṛvedic Sanskrit, the main base of Classical Sanskrit. Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> more archaic than Rigvedic.|$|E

500|$|The Hidden Planet by Malcolm Hulke was {{commissioned}} in December 1963 {{and at one}} point was to be the seventh serial of Series 1. The story would have concerned a planet in an orbit opposite Earth's, with a parallel <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> opposite society to ours; for example, women were to be the dominant sex and all clovers would have four leaves. The original script was sent back for rewrites, and due to a pay dispute the rewrites were not made until after Susan had left the series; this necessitated further rewriting. A third submission was similarly rejected as Ian and Barbara were due to leave, and the script was dropped. [...] The story was the subject of an April Fool's Day prank in 1983, when Doctor Who Magazine issue 76 claimed that one episode had in fact been filmed and rediscovered, and would be integrated into a twentieth anniversary special co-starring the Fifth Doctor entitled The Phoenix Rises.|$|E
500|$|For a few years, Wessel lived {{a double}} life, as a middle-class {{university}} law student, {{and as a}} member of the primarily working-class SA, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> the two worlds were converging in ideology. At university, Wessel joined a dueling society dedicated to [...] "steeling and testing physical and moral fitness" [...] through personal combat, while with the brownshirted SA, which was always interested in a good street fight, he was immersed in the anti-Semitic attitudes typical of the extreme right-wing paramilitary culture of the time. His study of jurisprudence at school was seen through the filter of his belief that the application of the law was primarily an instrument of power, and his personal beliefs, already geared toward anti-Jewish attitudes, were heavily influenced by the novel From Double Eagle to Red Flag, by the Russian Cossack general Pyotr Nikolayevich Krasnov, which was published in Germany in 1922. The anti-Semitic Krasnov accepted as fact The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a hoax which purported to show the plans of [...] "International Jewry" [...] to control the world. According to Wessel's sister, Krasnov's book was tremendously influential with her brother.|$|E

2500|$|The closest {{comparison}} is probably to other ethnic-group based lobbies {{that attempt to}} influence American foreign policy decisions such as the Cuban-American lobby, the African-American lobby in foreign policy and the Armenian American lobby, although the lobby has also been compared to the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the lobby for the Pharmaceutical industry. In comparing the Israel Lobby to the NRA, Glenn Frankel concludes that [...] "Nevertheless, the Israel lobby, and AIPAC in particular, gained a reputation as the National Rifle Association of foreign policy: a hard-edged, pugnacious bunch that took names and kept score. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> it was even stronger.

2500|$|Although not required, Sacks {{chose to}} stay on for an {{additional}} year to undertake research, after {{he had taken a}} course by Hugh Macdonald Sinclair. Sacks recalls, [...] "I had been seduced by a series of vivid lectures on the history of medicine" [...] and nutrition, given by Sinclair. Sacks adds, [...] "And now, in Sinclair's lectures, it was the history of physiology, the ideas and personalities of physiologists, which came to life." [...] Sacks then became involved with the school's Laboratory of Human Nutrition under Sinclair. Sacks focused his research on Jamaica ginger, a toxic and commonly abused drug known to cause irreversible nerve damage. After devoting months to research, he was disappointed by the lack of help and guidance he received from Sinclair. Sacks wrote up an account of his research findings but stopped working on the subject. As a result he became depressed: [...] "I felt myself sinking into a state of quiet <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> agitated despair." [...] His tutor at Queen's and his parents, seeing his lowered emotional state, suggested he extricate himself from academic studies for a period. His parents then suggested he spend the summer of 1955 living on Israeli kibbutz Ein HaShofet, where the physical labour would help him.|$|E

60|$|With {{the next}} phase of Victorian fiction we enter a new world; the later, more revolutionary, more continental, freer <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> weaker {{world in which we live}} to-day. The subtle and sad change that was passing like {{twilight}} across the English brain at this time is very well expressed in the fact that men have come to mention the great name of Meredith in the same breath as Mr. Thomas Hardy. Both writers, doubtless, disagreed with the orthodox religion of the ordinary English village. Most of us have disagreed with that religion until we made the simple discovery that it does not exist. But in any age where ideas could be even feebly disentangled from each other, it would have been evident at once that Meredith and Hardy were, intellectually speaking, mortal enemies. They were much more opposed to each other than Newman was to Kingsley; or than Abelard was to St. Bernard. But then they collided in a sceptical age, which is like colliding in a London fog. There can never be any clear controversy in a sceptical age.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Blackburn's {{programme}} is fictionalist, which he himself disputes. However, {{there are certainly}} continuities between both approaches.
