40|$|Abstract—Recently, methodologies for {{developing}} brain-computer interface (BCI) games using the BCI have been actively researched. The existing general framework for processing <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> {{does not provide}} the functions required to develop BCI games. Thus, developing BCI games is difficult and requires {{a large amount of}} time. Effective BCI game development requires a BCI game framework. Therefore the BCI game framework should provide the functions to generate discrete values, events, and converted waves considering the difference between the <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> of users and the BCIs of those. In this paper, BCI game frameworks for processing <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> for BCI games are proposed. A variety of processes for converting <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> to apply the measured <b>brain</b> <b>waves</b> to the games are also proposed. In an experiment the frameworks proposed were applied to a BCI game for visual perception training.

25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked <b>brain</b> <b>wave</b> just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group, a USAF expert panel, {{recommended}} several {{changes to}} deal with the oxygen supply issues. In October 2011, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $24M contract to investigate the breathing difficulties. In July 2012, the Pentagon concluded that a pressure valve on flight vests worn during high-altitude flights and a carbon air filter were likely sources of at least some hypoxia-like symptoms. Long-distance flights were resumed, but were limited to lower altitudes until corrections had been made. The carbon filters were changed to a different model to reduce lung exposure to carbon particulates. The breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve, used to inflate the pilot's vest during high G maneuvers, was found to be defective, inflating the vest at unintended intervals and restricting the pilot's breathing. The on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS) also unexpectedly reduced oxygen levels during high-G maneuvers. [...] In late 2012, Lockheed Martin was awarded contracts to install a supplemental automatic oxygen backup system, in addition to the primary and manual backup. Changes recommended by the Raptor Aeromedical Working Group in 2005 received further consideration in 2012; the USAF reportedly considered installing EEG <b>brain</b> <b>wave</b> monitors on the pilot's helmets for inflight monitoring.|$|E
