5|$|In North America, California is {{the leading}} {{producer}} of Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon <b>Blanc</b> is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> grape {{is also known as}} Fumé <b>Blanc.</b> This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fumé <b>Blanc</b> as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fumé. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> wines have been marketed under the name Fumé <b>Blanc.</b> California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> have more tropical fruit undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fumé <b>Blanc</b> are more round with melon notes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, ampelographers began to {{distinguish}} Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non-blended Chilean Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and {{more similar to}} the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valparaíso is the most notable area for Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes {{to be picked up}} to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> planted in the region are really Seyval <b>blanc.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon <b>blanc</b> varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon <b>Blanc</b> vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon <b>blanc.</b>|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont <b>Blanc</b> massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont <b>Blanc</b> is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people with the reality and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont <b>Blanc,</b> the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont <b>Blanc</b> between 2007 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of Gomes, Bordeaux hired rookie manager Laurent <b>Blanc</b> ahead of the 2007–08 season. Chamakh has stated on several occasions that <b>Blanc</b> was an important figure in his development as a footballer. However, when <b>Blanc</b> first arrived to the club, Chamakh struggled to earn meaningful minutes because <b>Blanc</b> preferred David Bellion, a new recruit. His playing time up front was further hampered {{by the arrival of}} striker Fernando Cavenaghi, who had a prolific season scoring 15 goals in only 23 appearances. Due to Cavenaghi's emergence, Chamakh was used as a target man and scored four goals, his lowest output since becoming a professional. In the 2008–09 season, Chamakh was relegated to appearing as a substitute {{for the first half of}} the campaign. However, on 21 December 2008, Chamakh convinced <b>Blanc</b> to change his mind. With Bordeaux trailing 3–0 against Monaco, Chamakh appeared as a substitute and, within minutes on the field, scored a goal. Following a goal from Alou Diarra to make the match 3–2, Chamakh equalized three minutes from time and, two minutes later, Cavenaghi netted the game-winner to give Bordeaux a 4–3 victory. Following the winter break, <b>Blanc</b> decided to use both Chamakh and Cavenaghi in the attack with influential playmaker Yoann Gourcuff acting in support. It was the former who developed a consistent partnership with Gourcuff, and Chamakh responded by scoring eight league goals in the second half of the season. On 30 May 2009, Bordeaux sealed their first league title since the 1998–99 season after defeating Caen 1–0 at the Stade Chaban Delmas. Chamakh played the entire match. The club also won the Coupe de la Ligue, completing the league and league cup double.|$|E
5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, the Democrats nominated city councilman Victor H. <b>Blanc</b> against the Republicans' Wilhelm F.
