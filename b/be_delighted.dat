25|$|In March 1979 {{as part of}} the Muldergate Scandal, the British {{newspaper}} The Guardian {{wrote that}} Lange and ALP had received 180,000 NOK from a secret South African fund. In December 1981, Gordon Winther claimed that ALP and Lange had received about 400,000 NOK since 1972. People who had been close to Lange however rejected that he had received money from the South African government. In a letter from 1967, Lange however notes that he would <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> if he would get funds from South Africa (which he in any event had not received by that time), while another anonymous person who had been close to Lange claimed that he did indeed receive money, even {{to the point that it}} saved him from financial ruin.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

500|$|Those were renewed in March 1987 {{when the}} United States Customs Service sent similar {{exploratory}} material, supposedly from Canada, to Jacobson {{and others on}} the USPS's list, and he responded, placing an order that was never filled. A catalog from a [...] "Far Eastern Trading Company" [...] was sent instead, along with other written material bemoaning the infringement of sexual freedoms. This time Jacobson ordered a publication called Boys Who Love Boys, which the catalog said featured [...] "11 and 14 year old boys" [...] who [...] "get it on in every way imaginable. Oral, anal and heavy masturbation. If you love boys," [...] it further read, [...] "you will <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> with this".|$|E
500|$|Truman {{emulated}} this {{by flying}} to the Pacific to meet MacArthur. Initially, Truman was unenthusiastic about the idea, as he disliked publicity stunts, but in October 1950, {{in the wake}} of the victories at Pusan and Inchon, MacArthur's star was burning bright. By meeting with him, Truman could emphasize his own part in the victories, as Commander-in-Chief. A message was sent to MacArthur suggesting a meeting on Hawaii or Wake Island. MacArthur replied that he [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to meet the President on the morning of the 15th at Wake Island." [...] When MacArthur discovered that the President would be bringing the news media with him, MacArthur asked if he could bring correspondents from Tokyo. His request was denied.|$|E

To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|Cowell had preliminarily {{agreed to}} sign Talbot {{with his own}} record label, Sony BMG. After {{recording}} two songs in London with Talbot ("Over the Rainbow" [...] and [...] "Smile"), the label {{pulled out of the}} deal. Talbot's mother, Sharon, said she was told that her daughter [...] "...was too young to be their sort of artist", adding [...] "We have been told to look for a company which looks after children." [...] In a statement, the label said [...] "there was some deliberation over the possibility of recording with Connie... However, the decision not to proceed was made with the best intentions for Connie, taking into consideration her age and {{that it would not be}} right to do so at this time." [...] Cowell himself said that [...] "when the time is right, [...] <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to see if [...] make it work". The Talbot family decided to search for another label, saying [...] "while [...] loves what she's doing it would be cruel to stop her. Fame and money will never matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian Frank Bongiorno {{described}} Hirst as a [...] "creative historian {{capable of}} engaging a wide audience, {{as well as}} a public intellectual who delighted, infuriated and provoked". He contributed many influential opinion pieces and commentaries to leading Australian newspapers and journals. Jeremy Sammut has noted that Hirst was motivated by an independent mind and a distaste for unthinking conformity. He [...] "defied simplistic categorisation as a partisan because his politics were idiosyncratic". Hirst described himself as an old-fashioned social democrat. To read Hirst is not to encounter a reactionary but [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> as he marshals facts, logic and evidence with unarguable skill and precision to establish the heterodox case, while conveying powerful insights into whatever historical experience or process is discussed". A common theme in the obituaries cited is that Hirst was fearlessly honest, whatever the subject. As Sammut has noted, he was inspired by a commitment to [...] "the rigorous pursuit of historical truth that drove him to explore the deeper patterns and meanings of the past, and the contemporary implications, that others had missed or misled us about".|$|E

500|$|By Roosevelt's inauguration on March 4, 1905, Hay's {{health was}} so bad that both his wife and his friend Henry Adams insisted on his going to Europe, where he could rest and get medical treatment. Presidential doctor Presley Rixey issued a {{statement}} that Hay was suffering from overwork, but in letters the secretary hinted his conviction {{that he did not have}} long to live. An eminent physician in Italy prescribed medicinal baths for Hay's heart condition, and he duly journeyed to Bad Nauheim, near Frankfurt, Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm II was among the monarchs who wrote to Hay asking him to visit, though he declined; Belgian King Leopold II succeeded in seeing him by showing up at his hotel, unannounced. Adams suggested that Hay retire while there was still enough life left in him to do so, and that Roosevelt would <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to act as his own Secretary of State. Hay jokingly wrote to sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens that [...] "there is nothing the matter with me except old age, the Senate, and one or two other mortal maladies".|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Ra√∫l did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Ra√∫l would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Ra√∫l, even though we have hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Ra√∫l's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see my name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Ra√∫l as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
500|$|Although Sibelius {{informed}} {{his secretary}} in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret {{confined to the}} composer's private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius {{from time to time}} hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: [...] "I have finished my eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will <b>be</b> <b>delighted</b> to hand it over to you when the time comes." [...] In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony [...] "in his mind"; only in 1954 did he admit, {{in a letter to the}} widow of his friend Adolf Paul, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer's biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.|$|E

500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way....
