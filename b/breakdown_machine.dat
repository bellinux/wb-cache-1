30|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> {{restrain}} the <b>machine</b> availability when designing a DCMS (Esmailnezhad et al. 2015; Houshyar et al. 2014). Majority {{of the previous}} CMS design considered 100 % machine reliability, which is practically hard to achieve (Nouri et al. 2014; Saxena and Jain 2011; Chung et al. 2011). As stated by Kannan (2011), the severity of machine reliability issues is high in CMS. Reason for that is failure of any machine/tools assigned for a particular cell will halt entire production of the manufacturing cell (Kannan 2011). According to Houshyar et al. (2014), <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> have direct influence on due dates and optimal cost of the system. Seifoddini and Djassemi (2001) stated that <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> have greater effect on productivity of entire manufacturing operations. <b>Machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> are a crucial factor that must be incorporated in designing of CMS (Houshyar et al. 2014; Chung et al. 2011). One of the studies that incorporate variable failure rates of the machines is the model proposed by Yadollahi et al. (2014). The objective functions of their model are minimizing the purchase cost of machines, intra-cellular movements and the inter-cellular movement costs of materials while minimizing the total repair time for failed machines.|$|R

Under these circumstances, the shipyards have to meet customer demand. If this is not done, the shipyard may face customer loss, since they cannot meet the deadline. So, {{it is very important}} to understand the effects of <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> on system throughput. In this study, the hull production system of a shipyard situated in Turkey has been considered. In the first step of the study, the structure of the double bottom block, which is produced in the shipyard production system, and the workstations, which constitute {{the production}} system, were identified. Secondly, the simulation model of the production system was created using simulation software. By creating some <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> for various work stations in the production system, the effects of breakdown on system throughput have been investigated. As a result of the study, the critical rates of <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown,</b> which have affected system throughput, have been determined.

40|$|Research on {{neural network}} {{applications}} {{have been carried}} out very extensively in recent days. The current trends in manufacturing sectors for solving their business operational problems have been very difficult and subjective. Many organizations have used various methods to solve machine breakdown's repair time, either reducing the time taken to repair or eliminate the particular occurrence. The traditional way for solving these <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> issues was to predict the <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> occurrence through preventive maintenance. Hence, in the present study, a neural network method was proposed to optimize the mean repair time for <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> with regression models were evaluated from the trained neurons. The neurons were represented by the samples of repair time of previous years' record of a single machine. The results shows that the set of samples of repair time have critically influenced the optimized mean repair time for the machine.

The use of neural network, in the end of the study, gives significant changes in predicting <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> repair time for the future years...|$|R

The results of their study showed that although considering machine reliability can increase the movement costs, it significantly reduces the total costs and total time for CM system. Jabal Ameli and Arkat (2008) have conducted {{a study on the}} configuration of machine cells considering production volumes and process sequences of parts. Further, they studied on alternative process routings for part types and machine reliability considerations. They found out that the reliability consideration has significant impacts on the final block diagonal form of machine-part matrixes. Chung et al. (2011) found that machine reliability has meaningful effects on reducing the total system cost in the CF problem. Arkat et al. (2011) presented the CF problem in general state and considering the reliability. The generalized CF problem follows selecting the best process plan for each part and assigning machines to the cells. In this model, it has been assumed that the number of <b>breakdowns</b> for each <b>machine</b> follows a Poisson distribution with a known failure rate. Because of the probabilistic nature of the <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> a set of chance constraints have been introduced. These constraints guarantee that the number of <b>breakdowns</b> for each <b>machine</b> never exceeds a predefined percentile.

40|$|In various {{flow shop}} {{scheduling}} problems, {{it is very}} common that a <b>machine</b> suffers from <b>breakdowns.</b> Under these situations, a robust and stable sub-optimal scheduling solution is of much more practical interest than a global optimal solution that is sensitive to environmental changes. However, blocking lotstreaming flow shop scheduling problems with <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> {{have not yet been}} well studied up to date. This paper presents, for the first time, a multi-objective formulation of the above problem including robustness and stability criteria. Based on this formulation, an evolutionary multi-objective robust scheduling algorithm (REMO, for short) is suggested, in which solutions obtained by a variant of single-objective heuristic algorithm are incorporated in population initialization and two novel crossover operators are proposed to take advantage of nondominated solutions. In addition, a rescheduling strategy based on the local search is introduced to further reduce the influence resulting from <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> The proposed algorithm is applied to 22 test sets, and compared with the state-of-theart algorithms without <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively tackle blocking lot-streaming flow shop scheduling problems in the presence of <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> by obtaining scheduling strategies that are robust and stable...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare five rescheduling strategies according to their effectiveness in reducing entropic-related complexity arising from <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in manufacturing systems. Previous case studies carried out by the authors have guided computer simulation. Simulation performance is measured by: 1) Entropic-related complexity measures, which quantify: a) the complexity associated with the information content of schedules, and b) the complexity associated with the variations between schedules; and 2) Mean flow time. The results highlight two main points: a) the importance of reducing unbalanced machine workloads by using the least utilised machine to process the jobs affected by <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> and b) low disruption strategies are effective at reducing entropic-related complexity, this means that applying rescheduling strategies in order to manage complexity can be beneficial up to a poin. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it extends the application of entropic-related complexity to every schedule generated through rescheduling, whereas previous work only applied it to the original schedule. Second, recommendations are proposed to schedulers for improving their rescheduling practice in the face of <b>machine</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Those recommendations vary according to the manufacturing organisations' product type and scheduling objectives...|$|R

Scheduling problems with stochastic <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> are difficult to solve optimally by a single approach. This paper considers makespan optimization of a flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling problem with <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown.</b> It proposes a novel decomposition based approach (DBA) to decompose a problem into several sub-problems which can be solved more easily, while the neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is employed to group the machines of an FFS into a few clusters. A back propagation network (BPN) is then adopted to assign either the shortest processing time (SPT) or the genetic algorithm (GA) to each cluster to solve the sub-problems. If two neighbouring clusters are allocated with the same approach, they are subsequently merged.

One {{of the most popular}} models in scheduling theory is that of the job-shop scheduling, as it has earned a reputation for being notoriously difficult to solve.

A prior paper by Chiu has examined the lot-sizing problem on an imperfect quality EPQ model. Due to another reliability factor- random <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> seems to be inevitable in most real world manufacturing environments, {{and to deal with}} it the production planners must practically compute the mean time between failures (MTBF) and establish a robust production plan accordingly in terms of the optimal replenishment lot size that minimizes total production-inventory costs for such an unreliable system. This study extends Chiu’s work and incorporates a <b>machine</b> <b>breakdown</b> taking place in the stock piling stage into his model. The effects of random machine failure on optimal run time and on the long-run average costs are examined in this paper. Mathematical modeling and cost analysis are employed. The renewal reward theorem is utilized to cope with variable cycle length. Convexity of the long-run average cost function is proved and an optimal lot-size that minimizes the expected overall costs for such an imperfect system is derived. Numerical example is given to demonstrate its practical usage. Managers in the field can adopt this run time decision to establish their own robust production plan accordingly...|$|R
