5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute <b>bee</b> <b>paralysis</b> virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E

40|$|Definition of {{the disease}} Paralysis is a contagiously {{transmitted}} infection of adult bees caused by multiplication of chronic paralysis virus (CPV) primarily in the brain, nerve ganglia and in the hind-gut epithelium.

General epidemiology Although paralysis was first described {{more than a hundred}} years ago, the cause was not identified until 1963 when Bailey et a/. (1963) isolated and characterised the virus. Some twenty years earlier, before research on the small non-occluded viruses of insects had become established, Burnside (1945) showed that bacteria-free filtrates of <b>bees</b> with <b>paralysis</b> in the USA were infective.

40|$|Graduation date: 1939 This {{thesis is}} a {{discussion}} of the major bee diseases found in Oregon with notes on minor ailments of bees and on diseases not yet present followed by a history of the introduction and spread of the more important diseases, a history of bee legislation in Oregon and {{a discussion of}} the distribution and occurrence of American foulbrood and European foulbrood in Oregon as shown by inspection reports of the state apiary inspector for 1935, 1937 and 1938. A bibliography of 39 titles is included. Chapter I. American foulbrood is the most serious disease of bees. It is an infectious disease of the later larval stages and pupal stage caused by Bacillus larvae. The disease is practically always fatal to the colonies contracting it, no race of bees is resistant to it, it is spread largely by beekeepers in manipulating their bees, can be spread in package bees and in commercial honey although neither are important factors {{and it is difficult to}} control except by burning diseased colonies as soon as they are found. Some work is being done on breeding resistant stock and this work has some prospect of being successful since a method of controlling the mating of the queen has been discovered. Chapter II. European foulbrood is an infectious disease of bees attacking the brood of bees in the earlier larval stages while the sugar content of the digestive tract is still relatively high. It is caused by Bacillus alvei, a germ that assumes quite variable morphological forms during its development. Italian, Caucasian and Carniolan bees are usually resistant taken as colonies and not as individuals. The disease may be spread in honey and pollen and on equipment. It may be controlled by strengthening infected colonies and requeening with queens of resistant stock. Chapter III. Sac brood is an infectious disease caused by a filterable virus which does not live long in honey, pollen nor in dead larvae. Its principal damage is in weakening colonies and its seriousness is not usually realized because most of the dead larvae are removed by the <b>bees.</b> Nosema-disease and <b>paralysis</b> are diseases of adult bees, both of them are present in Oregon but are of little importance. Dissentery of bees in winter and early spring is due to stores with too high a water content. Parafoulbrood is not present in Oregon. Isle of Wight disease, caused by a mite in the trachea, is not present in North America. Septicemia and fungus diseases of bees are of little importance. Chapter IV. Instructions are given for methods of diagnosing the common bee diseases in the apiary with a chart listing symptoms of the common diseases. Chapter V. Bee diseases have been known since before the Christian era but it was not until 1903 that the different types of brood diseases were separated and their causative organisms isolated. It is not known just when or how American foulbrood was brought to Oregon but it was present in Malheur county in 1907 and was found in nearly all parts of the state by 1920. It is now present in every county in the state. There was a virulent type of European foulbrood in Clatsop county in 1908 and the disease was common in western Oregon by 1920. At present it is decreasing in importance and is seldom found in central and eastern Oregon. Sac brood is found all over the state but is generally confused with poisoning. Spray poisoning is serious only in Jackson, Hood River and Wasco counties. The first inspection law was passed in 1905, the next in 1917, another in 1920 and the present law in 1933. The first three were ineffective. Chapter VI. The present distribution of bee diseases is given by counties for 1935, 1937 and 1938 as shown by inspection records...|$|R

40|$|The Western honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an {{economically}} important insect, {{responsible for a}} large portion of global pollination services. They live in densely populated colonies, which give the optimum chance for opportunistic pathogens and parasites to spread. Honeybees, like all organisms, are subject {{to a wide range of}} threats, from viruses to parasites. The immune response of A. mellifera to these threats relies on a fast acting non-adaptive immunity, with effectors such as cellular defences and the release of antimicrobial peptides. The defence against invading pathogens and parasites is important not only for the individual bee, but for the colony as a whole. Many bee diseases have been shown as capable of causing collapse of honeybee colonies.
