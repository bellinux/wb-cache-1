500|$|Of {{the three}} top WSOP {{bracelet}} winners, only Johnny Chan still has them all. He keeps them {{locked in a}} vault because they are worth, according to him, [...] "millions." [...] Brunson did not pick up two of his. Fourteen-time bracelet winner Phil Hellmuth gave away ten of his. [...] "To me," [...] Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets {{have always been a}} really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they represented history." ...|$|E
500|$|They {{had four}} children—Linda's {{daughter}} Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella and James—and remained married until Linda's untimely death {{from breast cancer}} at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies." ...|$|E
500|$|From the outset, Euston {{intended}} to create {{two versions of}} the story; a four-part serial for broadcast on UK television and a 100-minute film, The Quatermass Conclusion, for distribution abroad. While writing the scripts, Kneale was [...] "careful not to pad, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> was the obvious thing, but to write in material which can be removed". There is one major deviation between the two versions; in the film version, the scene where Quatermass, separated from Annie Morgan while transporting Isabel to London, encounters a band of elderly people living in a scrapyard is completely absent; this meant that {{two versions of the}} hospital scene where Isabel dies were shot—one with Quatermass present (the film version) and one without (the television version). There was little interest among film distributors in The Quatermass Conclusion, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee was {{the only}} lawyer in a {{government}} composed primarily of farmers, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged. [...] The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings. [...] The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the John R. Boyle-led Liberals. [...] Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members, and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. [...] His maiden speech was typical of him: [...] "I came into this House with considerable trepidation, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill. Since coming in I've listened to all these men—giving their best—and now I blush at my own modesty." ...|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. [...] Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they represented history." ...|$|E
500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E

2500|$|She became {{disenchanted with}} Islam, and {{was shocked by}} the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, for which al-Qaeda {{eventually}} claimed responsibility. After listening to videotapes of Osama bin Laden citing [...] "words of justification" [...] in the Qur'an for the attacks, she wrote, [...] "I picked up the Qur'an and the hadith and started looking through them, to check. I hated to do it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I would find Bin Laden's quotations in there." [...] During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur'an as relative – it was a historical record and [...] "just another book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heidfeld {{picked up}} his first podium since the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix – another race won by Hamilton – and was {{relieved}} to have kept Rosberg behind him, believing that his fellow German was fuelled longer than he actually was. [...] "After the start I thought it {{was not going to}} be a very good race <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Nico was quite long. Actually he came in earlier than expected on the same lap as myself. What we lost at the start we regained on the pit-stop, so our pit-stop crew, just did a fantastic job to just get me out ahead of Nico. Then I was lucky on the pit-stops in terms of the safety car." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Michael said [...] "I used {{to sleep}} with women quite {{a lot in the}} Wham! days but never felt it could develop into a {{relationship}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> emotionally, I was a gay man. I didn't want to commit to them but I was attracted to them. Then I became ashamed that I might be using them. I decided I had to stop, which I did when I began to worry about AIDS, which was becoming prevalent in Britain. Although I had always had safe sex, I didn't want {{to sleep with}} a woman without telling her I was bisexual. I felt that would be irresponsible. Basically, I didn't want to have that uncomfortable conversation that might ruin the moment, so I stopped sleeping with them." [...] In the same interview, he added : [...] "If I wasn't with Kenny , I would have sex with women, no question". He said he believed that the formation of his sexuality was [...] "a nurture thing, via the absence of my father who was always busy working. It meant I was exceptionally close to my mother", though he stated that [...] "there are definitely those who have a predisposition to being gay in which the environment is irrelevant." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. I felt as if I had murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E
