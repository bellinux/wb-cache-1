5|$|Humans {{may have}} bred C.cartwrightianus {{specimens}} by screening for specimens with abnormally long stigmas. The resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal, {{and it has}} since been traded and used {{over the course of}} four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders. The C.sativus clone was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia, later reaching parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania. Global production on a by-mass <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> now dominated by Iran, which accounts for some 90% of the annual harvest.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors on a daily <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor's authority. Historically, the party {{in control of the}} General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based his party affiliation, and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.|$|E

5|$|In the infinite-dimensional case, an {{orthonormal}} basis {{will not}} be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> also called a Hamel basis. That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series, and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique.|$|E
5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds {{depends upon the}} needs of a specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting would be appropriate to show the fund's profitability. Accrual <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments would be important.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection. Indium tin oxide and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical <b>basis)</b> <b>is</b> used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E

5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global <b>basis,</b> <b>is</b> 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|The circle symbolizes {{unity and}} {{diversity}} in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn {{starting with a}} circle. For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in Yazd, Iran {{is based on a}} circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this <b>basis</b> <b>is</b> constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern. This forms the basic design which is outlined in white {{on the wall of the}} mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design. A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center.|$|E
