Prohibits total General Fund {{expenditures}} {{authorized by}} budget act and other statutes from exceeding estimated revenues {{and other financial}} resources for fiscal year. Authorizes adoption of budget bill by majority vote of Legislature. Requires Governor and Legislators to forfeit salaries and expense payments if budget bill is not enacted by June 30 of any year, until the date the budget bill is enacted. Requires budget act to provide two-percent emergency reserve and establishes State Emergency Reserve Fund. Applies to budget bills beginning with 1999 - 2000 fiscal year. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: This measure will result in unknown effects on aggregate state General Fund expenditures and revenues, depending on its effects on <b>budget-related</b> <b>decisions.</b> It would also result in unknown General Fund savings, depending {{on the extent to}} which annual budget bills are enacted following the start of the fiscal year and forfeitures of salaries and expenses occur...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{examines}} budgeting decision-making in Finnish municipalities; {{an issue}} that has not received a lot of attention in the academic literature. Furthermore, this thesis investigates whether the current budgeting decision-making practices could be improved by using a new kind of budget decision-making tool that is based on presenting multiple investment or divestment alternatives simultaneously to the decision makers as a frontier, rather than one by one. In the empirical part of the thesis, the results from three case interviews are introduced in order to answer the research questions of the study. The empirical evidence of this thesis suggests {{that there is a need}} for the presented budgeting decision-making tool in Finnish municipalities. The current routine is seen as good even though the interviewees would warmly welcome the alternative method that would function as a linkage be-tween strategy and the budget. The results also indicate that even though municipalities are left with a lot of room in their budgeting decision-making routine, the routine closely, though not always purposely, follows given guidelines and legislation. The major problem in the current practices seems to be the lack of understanding, as the decision-makers find it hard fully to understand the multiplicative effects of the <b>budget-related</b> <b>decisions...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aims: Due {{to limited}} resources, {{to provide a}} simple and {{transparent}} tool for physicians to facilitate <b>budget-related,</b> medical <b>decisions</b> in any patient. Study Design: Comparative study. Methodology: Several articles with topics referring to the 2008 ”Surviving Sepsis Campaign” guidelines in critically ill patients with varying effects on defined clinical endpoints were analyzed regarding the costs of additional treatment success (COATS). A simplified ICER = incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to assess COATS was expressed {{as the product of}} the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) and the difference in treatment costs per patient. Results: In publications with significant treatment effects enabling calculation of NNTs, calculating “COATS = NNT x delta costs per patient", mean costs to avoid one additional death or morbidity could be defined. Considering the 95 % confidence interval, estimated costs at minimum and maximum to reach distinct clinical endpoints could be expressed. In studies with no significant results, NNTs and COATS were tending to infinity. Conclusion: COATS based on NNT as a simplified ICER is an easy way for the physician at the bedside caring for individual patients to explicitly describe the amount of money which has to be spent to reach definable aims in the clinical setting in one additional patient, such as reduction of mortality or morbidity, or to reassess therapies without significant results. In contrast to COATS, ICER based on quality-adjusted life years may be necessary to perform calculation of the short-term and long-term costs for the community and the adequate allocation of health care resources...|$|R
