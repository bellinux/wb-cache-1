5|$|Gifford arrives, {{and most}} of the town attends the celebratory event, where Chef sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his {{position}} in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is hidden behind a bulletproof glass bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that they understand his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>television.</b> Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for costing the town a chance to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>television,</b> although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity. The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford while watching Geraldo.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

[...] Responding {{to a poll}} of probable Reform Party voters that showed him with only 14% support, fourth place behind Ventura (20%), Perot (25%), and Buchanan (30%), Trump pointed to the spike in ratings each television network received whenever he appeared on air. [...] He admitted, [...] "whether or not TV ratings can transfer into votes is an interesting question." [...] The Times characterized Trump's campaign as [...] "Political Science 101 on how far politics is devolving into pure entertainment." [...] Nevertheless, Trump contemporaneously delved into the politics of third party campaigns when {{he wrote a letter}} to Commission on Presidential Debates asking the body to review its standard for third party candidate inclusion in the general election debates. [...] His letter included a veiled threat of litigation if the body enacted a standard preventing his participation. [...] At this time, Trump announced that he would make his decision on whether to wage a full-scale campaign by early February. [...] In addition, he retained two signature collection agencies in order to secure ballot access.|$|E

After a brief run-in with Captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the show Deadliest Catch, Japanese pilots launch kamikaze attacks on the Sea Shepherd. The suicidal planes kill the Whale Wars crew except for Stan, Cartman and Kenny. The trio are {{captured}} and brought to Japan, where Emperor Akihito tells them retaliation for the bombing of Hiroshima is the primary motive for Japan's whaling efforts, with Cartman finding the whole nuclear drop and mass devastation hilarious. He shows them a doctored photograph—given to Japan by the United States after the bombing—of the Enola Gay piloted by a dolphin and a killer whale. According to him, Japan was so grateful the Americans gave the Japanese these photos they declared peace. Knowing the picture is a fake, Stan decides to reveal {{the truth about the}} bombing, but Cartman reminds him that the Japanese seek to drive the entire species of the perpetrators to extinction. Claiming the U.S. government has authorized him to show the [...] "original" [...] photo, Stan presents the Emperor, Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, and other Japanese officials with a new doctored photo showing a cow and chicken in the Enola Gay (created by Kyle, who Stan managed to phone beforehand). The Japanese become infuriated, now believing cows and chickens had modified the original photo to frame the innocent whales and dolphins. The Japanese agree to cease their whaling efforts and start slaughtering cows and chickens, storming farms full of the animals. The episode ends as Randy congratulates Stan for making the Japanese [...] "normal, like us".|$|E

It's a device that brings the audience into close identification with some person who is like them. It would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>television</b> a little extra programme tagged on before the programme proper begins.

Those costs include the services of 22 writers, whom Leno called the [...] "top 5% of the highest-paid [...] [...] [...] in the Guild." ...|$|E
