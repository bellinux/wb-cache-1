40|$|The {{first part}} of the present study focused on the {{development}} of an alternative automated sample preparation method for the measurement of selected polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in fish and shellfish. A previously developed automated method has been further optimized and simplified to decrease <b>blank</b> <b>levels</b> and cost. Sorbent and solvent quantities have been significantly reduced without altering extract quality. The second part of the study consisted of comparing tandem-in-time quadrupole ion storage mass spectrometry (QISTMS/MS) to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for the isotope dilution (ID) measurement step after gas chromatography (GC) separation. Both mass spectrometric methods performed similarly in terms of accuracy but better precision was observed for HRMS. Although better sensitivity can be attained with the high resolution sector instrument, method limits of quantification (mLOQs) were very similar for both approaches as they were dependent on the procedural <b>blanks</b> <b>levels.</b> The mLOQ values ranged between 0. 04 and 3. 56 ng/g fat, depending on the congener. They allowed the unambiguous identification and quantification of all target analytes, except for BDE- 183, in most considered fish extracts. An analytical procedure based on rapid automated sample preparation and QISTMS/MS appeared to be suitable for the measurement of PBDEs in fish and shellfish speciment under quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) criteria.

The presence of abundant biomarkers for cyanobacteria and eukaryotes derived from and trapped in rocks deposited before the Great Oxidation Event is consistent with an earlier evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis than previously thought and suggests that some aquatic settings had become sufficiently oxygenated for sterol biosynthesis by this time.

Much lower abundances (approx. 30 to 180 ppb) of glycine, beta-alanine, L-alanine and L-serine were detected in SM 2 above procedural <b>blank</b> <b>levels</b> indicating that this meteorite sample experienced only minimal terrestrial amino acid contamination after its fall to Earth.

30|$|Since {{amino acids}} can be {{produced}} both biologically and non-biologically, the most fundamental task that is common {{to the study of}} meteoritic amino acids is to identify the amino acids that are indigenous to the meteorite, which were produced or obtained through processes prior to atmospheric entry, and to distinguish them from terrestrial contaminants. The Itokawa particles returned by the first Hayabusa mission, for example, were shown to be composed of proteic amino acids at <b>blank</b> <b>levels</b> only (Naraoka et al. 2012).

Other than identifying amino acids that have rare biological occurrence and determining the relative amino acid abundances and enantiomeric ratio, stable isotope ratio is a reliable and convenient tool used to tell apart terrestrial and extraterrestrial amino acids, as biology preferentially uses lighter isotopes, while amino acids formed by abiotic processes in cold environments are more enriched in heavier isotopes.|$|R
