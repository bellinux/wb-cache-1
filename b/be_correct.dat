5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to <b>be</b> <b>correct.</b> Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that assumed a German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the two {{monitors}} entered service, {{the prospect of a}} French attack had decreased, prompting the Navy to question the usefulness of retaining the vessels. As a result, they were quickly removed from service. The ultimate fate of the two ships is unclear; according to naval historian Erich Gröner, both ships were sold for 3,500gold marks in December 1875. Robert Gardiner, however, states that the ships remained, out of service, until 1884, when they were sold for scrapping. The latter version would appear to <b>be</b> <b>correct,</b> as J.F. von Kronenfels published an elevation and deckplan of Rhein in 1881, with the inference that Rhein and Mosel were still extant at that time.|$|E

As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway.

5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to <b>be</b> <b>correct,</b> this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E

5|$|A {{preliminary}} enquiry into Magdalenas {{was held}} at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent {{a report to the}} Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of Formal Investigation be held. The enquiry {{was held at}} the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26–28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a Mr. Gray. Evidence was heard that the ship was seaworthy, and that the provision of rescue equipment on board either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to <b>be</b> <b>correct,</b> but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her captain had his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might <b>be</b> <b>correct.</b>|$|E
5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to <b>be</b> <b>correct.</b> Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{prediction}} of the comet's return proved to <b>be</b> <b>correct,</b> {{although it was}} not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days. This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It {{was also one of the}} earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power. The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.|$|E
5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to <b>be</b> <b>correct.</b>|$|E

Their results suggested that the current definitions of Eliurus and Voalavo may not <b>be</b> <b>correct,</b> because they found that northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the remaining species of Eliurus. However, the DNA of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a possible close relative of northern voalavo, could not be sampled, so Jansa and colleagues recommended further evaluation of the problem. According to a 2003 report, data from nuclear genes also support the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can transfer it into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to <b>be</b> <b>correct</b> in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the teleosts {{has been}} subject to long debate, without consensus on either their phylogeny or {{the timing of the}} emergence of the major groups before the application of modern DNA-based cladistic analysis.
