50|$|A {{thermophilic}} digester or thermophilic <b>biodigester</b> {{is a kind}} of <b>biodigester</b> {{that operates}} in temperatures above 50 °C producing biogas. It has some advantages: it does not need agitation and is faster in fermentation than a mesophilic digester. In fact, it can be as much as six to ten times faster than a normal <b>biodigester.</b> The problem is that for use in this <b>biodigester,</b> the source must enter at high temperature. Vinasse is produced at more than 70 °C and can be used in this kind of <b>biodigester.</b> For each unit of volume of ethanol, about eight units of vinasse are produced. In Brazil, this kind of <b>biodigester</b> is used to process vinasse as a cheap source of methane.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the persistence of}} virus, bacteria, mold, yeast and parasites in liquid pig manure, processed in <b>biodigesters</b> and manure tanks in the central-western part of Colombia. Materials and methods. A directed observational study analyzed descriptively {{was carried out in}} three pig farms located where the manure tanks were assembled and its <b>biodigesters</b> were used. A sampling of liquid pig manure was taken to assess the presence of 26 pathogens {{at the beginning of the}} study and another one at the end of the process in manure tanks and <b>biodigesters.</b> For the manure tank, a 250 liters tank was filled with fresh pig manure and was analyzed after three days of storage. The <b>biodigesters</b> were of continuous flow and its effluents were analyzed, according to the specific hydraulic retention times. The diagnostic techniques were those recommended specifically for each microorganism and were carried out in certified labs by the Colombian Animal Health authority. Results. Of the 26 pathogens that were investigated, 15 appeared in the fresh pig manure used in pig manure tanks and 12 in the one used in biodigestors. In manure tanks, Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV 2), mold, yeast, Salmonella spp., Balantidium coli and Strongylids did not persist. In <b>biodigesters,</b> PCV 2, yeast, Strongylids, B. coli and Strongyloides spp., did not persist. Conclusions.

The plan calls for a distributed biogas production system made up of strategically placed and variously scaled <b>biodigesters</b> (small for a cluster of dwellings, to larger community-scaled units). These <b>biodigesters</b> rely on slow anaerobic digestion that yields methane from organic human and animal waste mixed with agro-residuals.

Benefits include production of a new fuel source for cooking or for additional electricity generation; improved sanitation and public health; greenhouse gas reduction, and increased farm yields, along with job creation.|$|R

50|$|A <b>biodigester</b> is {{a simple}} {{technology}} that converts animal and organic wastes into biogas and nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer. Biodigesters are geared towards preventing deforestation while saving families time and money. The biogas can be piped to a simple gas cooking range and used as fuel, while the fertilizer can be put back on crops to increase yields. Biodigesters can yield up to five hours of gas per day, allowing families to stop cooking on wood-burning stoves. This change drastically improves their health by removing the toxic wood smoke {{from the kitchen and}} saves a significant amount of time and money spent to provide firewood.|$|E

50|$|Biodigesters convert organic wastes {{such as food}} waste, {{human waste}} and animal waste into {{nutrient}} rich liquid fertilizer and biogas (thus a renewable fuel made up primarily of methane).
