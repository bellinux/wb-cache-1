25|$|Automobile brakes {{inherently}} rely on friction, slowing {{a vehicle}} by converting its kinetic energy into heat. Incidentally, dispersing this {{large amount of}} heat safely is one technical challenge in designing brake systems. Disk brakes rely on friction between a disc and brake pads that are squeezed transversely against the rotating disc. In Drum brakes, brake shoes or pads are pressed outwards against a rotating cylinder (<b>brake</b> <b>drum)</b> to create friction. Since braking discs can be more efficiently cooled than drums, disc brakes have better stopping performance.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysler 4-wheel {{disc brake}} system was {{more complex and}} {{expensive}} than Crosley's, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>drum,</b> which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.|$|E

They were a single piece of steam bent wood and metal wire, fitted to the normal Model T transmission band. These bands give a very different feel to the pedals, with much more of a [...] "bite" [...] feel. The sensation is of a definite [...] "grip" [...] of the drum and seemed to noticeably increase the feel, in particular of the <b>brake</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{generally}} can {{be found}} on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc <b>brakes,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference of the <b>brake,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes on the <b>drum</b> allows <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and <b>braking</b> force. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear <b>brakes,</b> a <b>drum</b> <b>brake's</b> self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|R
2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner {{surface of a}} cast-iron <b>brake</b> <b>drum,</b> which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders. Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, {{at a time when}} an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Chrysler discs were [...] "self energizing," [...] in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.|$|E

50|$|It {{is quite}} simple to machine brake drums {{if one has}} a slow running lathe (one {{rule of thumb is}} that cast iron should not be {{machined}} faster than fifty feet per minute). Usually it is only necessary to machine away the ridge that forms that makes <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> removal difficult. If the ridge is left on big trouble can occur later especially if the brakes are self-adjusting. In bad cases this ridge can make the <b>brake</b> <b>drum</b> captive. Most drum brake designs provide a way to externally release the self-adjusting mechanism in order to ease drum removal and service.|$|E
