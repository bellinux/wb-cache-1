40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{establish}} factors affecting implementation of donor funded projects by public institutions in Malawi, with reference to the Rule of Law Project, a project funded by the European Union. Despite having a number of donor-funded projects in Malawi aimed at facilitating development and alleviation of poverty, there are many challenges that are faced by the public institutions in the course of implementing donor funded projects. The target population of the study was beneficiary institutions of the Rule of Law Project in Malawi. The sample was six respondents from purposively selected three beneficiary institutions of the Rule of Law Project. Data collection involved use of semi structured questionnaire and interviews of key staff involved in project implementation. The key findings of the study were as follows: factors that affected implementation of the Rule of Law Project in Malawi included levels of participation in the project by various actors, degree of support by the Project Implementation Unit, degree of support by institutional top management, changes of <b>beneficiary</b> <b>institution</b> staff responsible for the implementation of the project, bureaucratic procedures, delays in procurement of project items, delays in liquidating funds, rules and procedures governing the project, weak coordination among the beneficiary institutions, business as usual mentality, lack of incentives to motivate project implementers as well as lack of a harmonized monitoring and evaluation function. Almost all the respondents indicated that capacity building for the public institutions is important to ensure smooth implementation of projects. The following recommendations were drawn that could be used to enhance the effectiveness of donor funded projects in Malawi: Promoting professionalism and leadership autonomy of project management in public institutions; enhancing integrated planning in project management; capacity building for staff of the implementing agencies; ensuring coordination among projects beneficiaries, stakeholders and development partners; encourage donor harmonization and alignment of procedures and continuous provision of technical support by the Project Implementation Unit...|$|E

Se analizarán las relaciones con sus stakeholders y las acciones dirigidas a ellos como alternativa de financiación de la universidad. Se trata, pues, de una proposición enfocada a aspectos tales como la filantropía, la cultura corporativa o el sentimiento de pertenencia. A modo de conclusión puede afirmarse que la base de la captación de fondos reside - entre otros aspectos - en el nivel de cultura corporativa del mecenas o patrocinador - de sus stakeholders - con respecto a la institución beneficiada.

40|$|Even {{if all the}} {{technical}} security solutions appropriate for an organisation’s network are implemented, for example, firewalls, antivirus programs and encryption, if the human factor is neglected then these technical security solutions will serve no purpose. The greatest challenge to network security is probably not the technological solutions that organisations invest in, but the human factor (non-technical solutions), which most organisations neglect. The human factor is often ignored even though humans {{are the most important}} resources of organisations and perform all the physical tasks, configure and manage equipment, enter data, manage people and operate the systems and networks. The same people that manage and operate networks and systems have vulnerabilities. They are not perfect and there will always be an element of mistake-making or error. In other words, humans make mistakes that could result in security vulnerabilities, and the exploitation of these vulnerabilities could in turn result in network security breaches. Human vulnerabilities are driven by many factors including insufficient security education, training and awareness, a lack of security policies and procedures in the organisation, a limited attention span and negligence. Network security may thus be compromised by this human vulnerability. In the context of this dissertation, both physical and technological controls should be implemented to ensure the security of the SANReN network. However, if the human factors are not adequately addressed, the network would become vulnerable to risks posed by the human factor which could threaten the security of the network. Accordingly, the primary research objective {{of this study is to}} formulate guidelines that address the information security related human factors in the rolling out and continued management of the SANReN network. An analysis of existing policies and procedures governing the SANReN network was conducted and it was determined that there are currently no guidelines addressing the human factor in the SANReN <b>beneficiary</b> <b>institutions.</b> Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide the guidelines for addressing the human factor threats in the SANReN <b>beneficiary</b> <b>institutions...</b>|$|R

The research methodology was based on a standard of principles, criteria and indicators (PC&I) in order to characterize the socioeconomic impacts of the program. The standard was the key factor for developing a semi-structured interview, with which the field information was collected. This information was afterwards analyzed quantitatively and statistically to identify the socio-economical impacts on each one of the beneficiaries. The study demonstrated that the PES program did not contribute to increase the economic welfare of the direct beneficiaries, questioning therefore the sustainability of the mechanism over time. Nevertheless, the study showed that the PES program improved the economic welfare of the indirect <b>beneficiaries</b> and related <b>institutions,</b> strengthening the relationships of the direct <b>beneficiaries</b> with financial <b>institutions</b> and forestry sector. Also, the program improved the perception of beneficiaries regarding the sustainable use of natural resources.

40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{spending}} on psychiatric hospitalization {{has been reported}} to impose a tremendous socio-economic burden on many developed countries with public health insurance programmes. However, there has been no in-depth study of the factors affecting psychiatric inpatient medical expenditures and differentiated these factors across different types of public health insurance programmes. In view of this, this study attempted to explore factors affecting medical expenditures for psychiatric inpatients between two public health insurance programmes covering the entire South Korean population: National Health Insurance (NHI) and National Medical Care Aid (AID). Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study used a nationwide, population-based reimbursement claims dataset consisting of 1, 131, 346 claims of all 160, 465 citizens institutionalized due to psychiatric diagnosis between January 2005 and June 2006 in South Korea. To adjust for possible correlation of patients characteristics within the same medical institution and a non-linearity structure, a Box-Cox transformed, multilevel regression analysis was performed. Results Compared with inpatients 19 years old or younger, the medical expenditures of inpatients between 50 and 64 years old were 10 % higher among NHI beneficiaries but 40 % higher among AID beneficiaries. Males showed higher medical expenditures than did females. Expenditures on inpatients with schizophrenia as compared to expenditures on those with neurotic disorders were 120 % higher among NHI beneficiaries but 83 % higher among AID beneficiaries. Expenditures on inpatients of psychiatric hospitals were greater on average than expenditures on inpatients of general hospitals. Among AID <b>beneficiaries,</b> <b>institutions</b> owned by private groups treated inpatients with 32 % higher costs than did government <b>institutions.</b> Among NHI <b>beneficiaries,</b> inpatients medical expenditures were positively associated with the proportion of patients diagnosed into dementia or schizophrenia categories. However, for AID beneficiaries, inpatient medical expenditures were positively associated with the proportion of all patients with a psychiatric diagnosis that were AID beneficiaries in a medical institution. Conclusions This study provides evidence that patient and institutional factors are associated with psychiatric inpatient medical expenditures, and that they may have different effects for beneficiaries of different public health insurance programmes. Policy efforts to reduce psychiatric inpatient medical expenditures should be made differently across the different types of public health insurance programmes. </p...|$|R

The major challenges include the resolutions of deficient operational models such as: forgetting, chemical dependency of management, inability to make decisions, reluctance to start a dialogue, «cut-off» solutions and some others. Methodology. A desk and in-depth study is carried out of several national territorial stabilization programs dealing with the government that ensure infrastructural support to post-conflict regions and communities in the East of Ukraine. It is studied how the programs are managed by the controversy of the results-based and process-based approaches (2015 - 2016 data) via NGOs and subcontractors. Improving stabilization tools, it leverages transformation of its own systems into a firm yet flexible entity. Results of the research showed that stabilization project systems should seek {{a balance between the}} results-based and process-based ends of management, the first focusing on quicker and more flexible lower-level results, and the second building bureaucracy via continuous processes. Practical implementation. Regional subcontractors can improve satisfaction and widen participation by supporting informal initiative from the grassroots level. A good solution to resolve operational conflicts is hiring a helping hand to the administrator – a typical results-based manager who will help follow the harmony to achieve immediate results. Any improvement in the transparency of the system and the formalization of relations between the beneficiary and the subcontractor, shifted in addressing issues at the level below, does not require exclusive access to the principal decision-maker, and would simply and easily be implemented at the technical level of the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>institutions.</b> Value/originality.

40|$|Collaboration is {{identified}} within {{the supply chain}} management discipline as a strategy that helps to link inter-institutional business research operations {{in order to achieve}} a shared market opportunity. Through collaboration, institutions should aim at maintaining a competitive advantage in their core areas of operation. Researchers have begun to appreciate that through collaboration they are able to achieve combined synergies through effective use of available yet at times scarce resources particularly for research. In the Australian universities research sector collaboration has assumed importance in light of the changing public sector funding environment which is similar to the changes taking place {{in other parts of the}} world. The absence of a comprehensive operational policy on research collaboration at regional Universities in Australia would most likely hinder their capacity to attract funding from external sources for their business research function. Although the strategy of collaboration is widely advocated, no formal studies have been conducted and published in the context of the Australian regional university sector prior to this research. This thesis set out to fill this perceived gap in the literature by examining the policy issues likely to affect research collaboration at regional universities. For this purpose a research objective and five research questions were identified and defined. The research adopted a qualitative, inductive, theory-building exploratory approach with case study being the main research methodology. The researcher opted for a single case study of a regional university in Australia, where 30 in-depth interviews and an additional 12 interviews representing research partner and <b>beneficiary</b> <b>institutions</b> were conducted. Upon data collection and data analysis, the following findings emerged: • researchers were keen to be involved in the development of the policy to facilitate the process of collaboration • adequate funding is essential for collaboration to achieve the desired results • the regional university policy on collaboration is reflected in relations with external institutions, there is encouragement for the conduct of joint research with stakeholders • the policy on collaboration impacts on university’s research focus, and should be comprehensively addressed • for the policy on collaboration to become operationally feasible the guidelines should have specific objectives with measurable outcomes. Further to these findings, it has been concluded that: • a comprehensive policy addressing the concerns of all stakeholders should be employed to facilitate the process of collaboration • sharing of information within and among partners should lead to synergies and opportunities for additional funding • the university policy on collaboration reflection in external relations should help in recognising the institution as a regionally, nationally and internationally recognised research university • the regional university impact on research focus should be comprehensively addressed in the policy on research collaboration, and • for the policy to become operationally feasible the guidelines should have specific objectives with measurable outcomes. Based upon the surveyed literature (Chapter 2), the analysis of field data (Chapter 4), the researcher’s understanding of the capacity, importance and relevance of collaboration as a strategy to attract external funding for business research, a conceptual model has emerged. The model enables the researcher to shed light on the research issue, the policy issues likely to affect collaboration at a regional university. The empirical research findings derived from this research have further implications for theory, policy and practice. Finally, the conclusions and implications provide a valid foundation for further research. This will be imperative in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying issues...|$|R

METHODS: Participants were elderly beneficiaries in seven states receiving Medicaid paid long term care services. We created our chronic disease variables from the ICD 9 codes in the Medicare and Medicaid claims data using on algorithms similar to the CMS Chronic Condition Data Warehouse - Chronic Condition Categories. We classified beneficiaries into community or institution group using state provided enrollment data. We calculated per-person month health care expenditures based on actual Medicare and Medicaid claims for 2005. RESULTS: Medicaid medical care expenditures were low across all chronic illnesses in both community and institution groups and were higher for the community group. The Medicare medical care expenditures were also higher for community care recipients, but were substantial for both groups. Prescription drug expenditures were higher for <b>beneficiaries</b> in <b>institutions.</b> The Medicare medical care, Medicare LTC, and Medicaid medical care and prescription drug expenditures increased substantially as the number of chronic illnesses increased, while there was a very small increase in Medicaid LTC expenditures. CONCLUSION: Medicare expenditures for both medical care, LTC, and prescription drug were more sensitive to chronic disease than were Medicaid expenditures.

40|$|Dealing with {{microfinance}} presents {{two problems}} today: first, its operational limits are not clearly defined and, secondly, {{its very nature}} is unclear. Traditionally, microfinance is associated with programmes that benefit clients with serious subsistence problems in developing countries. Furthermore, for many years microfinance overlapped with microcredit. The continuous extension of financial services offered in microfinance programmes expands the boundaries of microfinance well beyond the classic role of financial assistance to the ‘poorest of the poor’, involving all victims of financial exclusion such as literature defines them. This work addresses these problems suggesting a new taxonomy for a modern microfinance. To achieve this, we analyzed the traditional features of microfinance and microcredit regarding to <b>beneficiaries,</b> services and <b>institution</b> to build a matrix of modern microfinance determined by the possible combinations of these three elements (beneficiaries–services–institutions).

A first analysis of the dataset reveals substantial heterogeneity of beneficiaries and projects across and within countries. While in the majority of lagging regions the largest project expenditure is dedicated to transportation and energy infrastructure, in most other regions the major part is assigned to innovation and technological development as well as business (including SME) support. In an econometric analysis we control for project and firm characteristics and find that the highest single project values are associated with older beneficiary firms that are larger in size. Furthermore, the projects with topmost expenditure are carried out in Dutch and British regions. : Department of Economics Working Paper Serie...|$|R
40|$|The {{parties of}} the {{fiduciary}} contract in general, and the fiduciary in particular represent the “engine” that moves the gear of this innovative institution. This study {{is dedicated to the}} analysis of the most important aspects regarding the parties of fiduciary contract as they are briefly regulated by civil Code, both by reference to current national regulation and practice and by reference to international law and practice. On one hand, it is relevant that there are some restrictions imposed by the legislator on the fiduciary capacity and, on the other hand, there is a partial lack of correlation between the current legislation regulating the activity of the qualified subjects of the potential fiduciaries with the provisions of civil Code. At the same time, very useful regulations have been issued for some of the fiduciary categories (investment companies and lawyers) that facilitate their access to this institution and the use of fiduciary agreements in practice. However, in general, the lack of clarity and insufficient legislation, as well as unawareness by some potential <b>beneficiaries</b> of this <b>institution,</b> keeps the utilization of fiduciary contracts at a low level in practice...|$|R
5000|$|Loyola Institute of Technology and Science, Thovalai (LITES) is an {{engineering}} college which {{is situated in}} Thovalai, Tamil Nadu, India {{in the foothills of}} the Western Ghats.The southern districts namely Thirunelveli, Tuticorin and Kanyakumari (where [...] "Loyola Institute of Technology and Science (LITES)" [...] is established) was once referred as the Oxford of the South, since large number of meritorious graduates came out of this place and served our motherland with grace and dedication.The Society of Jesus (SJ-Jesuits) have established many schools and colleges (like St. Xavier's College, Palayamkottai, St. Joseph's College, Trichy, Loyola College, Chennai and so on) and gave quality education in Tamil Nadu. They run these educational establishments strictly on professional and ethical basis. Their services are highly regarded and appreciated. They have produced many eminent leaders to serve our great nation including our beloved former President, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Now, they have promised to guide and counsel us. Hence a set of alumni and <b>beneficiaries</b> of Jesuit <b>institutions</b> have assembled together and registered the Loyola Educational Trust and establishing the Loyola Institute of Technology and Science with the AICTE approval in May 2008.|$|R
40|$|Architecture {{located in}} Quezon City, Metro Manila, priveleged {{to work with}} {{cooperative}} students and supported by a loving family, she has done several researches on relevant housing issues within the metropolis. She {{is also a member}} of the United Architects of the Philippines Elliptical Chapter which is largely composed of architects working with the National Housing Authority and the Quezon City local government. Measures have been adopted to address the enormous housing need in the Philippines for several decades including the creation of the National Shelter Program comprised of a lead agency and five government agencies under it. Aside from these agencies, several actors have been challenged and are involved in housing delivery. These are the local government, the private developers, NGOs, the project <b>beneficiaries</b> themselves, research <b>institutions,</b> and educational institutions. However, a lack of coordination and cooperation is observed among these actors, This is evident in the overlapping of functions, competition for beneficiaries, complexity of government procedures, misunderstanding of rules by beneficiaries, and the delivery of inadequate shelters. As an actor, the educational institution, in this case, the Central Colleges of the Philippines College of Architecture, can take an active part in the solution of the problem through a Center for Shelter Design and Development which aims to promote understanding among key actors and to cooperate with them in research, exchange, and dissemination of information. It is hoped that in the process, the college, especially its students, will be benefited...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the contribution of micro-finance institutions to poverty reduction in the Kasoa district of the Central Region of Ghana. In an attempt to achieve the objective of the study, data and hypotheses were drawn from First Capital Plus Microfinance Limited which has been operating in the Kasoa Municipality since 2009. The practical part contains primary statistical data through survey research, which consists of a combination of structured questionnaires, interviews, focus group, and participatory methods to collect qualitative data from program <b>beneficiaries</b> and MFI's <b>institutions.</b> Wellbeing variables such as women empowerment, household assets, savings mobilising, household income, start-up capital and business development were used as benchmark variables to investigate the contribution of microfinance institutions to poverty reduction in the Kasoa district area. The study also made use of secondary data to reinforce theoretical arguments on micro-finance and poverty reduction. The results emanated from the administered questionnaires, interviews and participatory approach reveals a favourable relationship between micro-finance and the benchmark variables as a sizeable number of the program beneficiaries attested to a certain level of improvement in their living conditions upon joining the micro-finance program. However, in as much as the positive effects the study also witnesses some challenges inhibiting the growth of micro-finance institutions in the area such as institutional challenges, dishonest staff and beneficiaries, interest rate, markets and infrastructure linkages which, if it is well addressed by policy makers, micro-finance will contribute meaningfully in the fight to reduce global poverty not only in Ghana but also many less developed countries (LDCs) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{percentage}} {{share of}} those under {{the poverty line}} in Kerala has declined due to faster economic growth. Does it mean that if the same policies are followed, eventually those considered desperately poor as a section will cease to exist in Kerala Society? It is difficult to happen. Three reasons are pointed out by this study in support of such a conclusion. 1) The social and cultural cleavage between the desperately poor and those above them, more than economic differences, are on the increase. Those immediately above the desperately poor can afford to purchase services from sources other than public institutions and services. To the poor, {{the only way out}} is to get such services from the public channels. Since they are turned to be the only <b>beneficiaries</b> of public <b>institutions</b> and services, they only will demand the upkeep and maintenance of efficiency of such institutions. Since {{they will not be able}} to exert as much pressure as other social groups in public decision making their interests will not get much attention. 2) In democratic decision making, the most important are the political parties. The poor whose interests get systematically neglected will not be able to make themselves heard in the forums of political parties. This possibility is higher in Kerala where the polity is trapped into a two party or two front system. To set a polarization started in favour of the desperately poor within such a closed polity is difficult. 3) Though there have been some organizations and organized moves from among the poor themselves...|$|R
