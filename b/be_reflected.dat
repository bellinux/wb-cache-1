5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|After Spare's death, Grant {{began to}} focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately {{published}} the Carfax Monographs, a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> in many of Grant's subsequent publications. The Carfax Monographs would eventually be assembled together and re-released as Hidden Lore in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, Black to Black and Other Poems. During the 1950s and 1960s Spare also authored a number of novels, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E

5|$|Newton {{argued that}} light is {{composed}} of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light {{to account for the}} interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
5|$|The marine hatchetfish is {{extremely}} flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, {{and the body}} is so silvery as to resemble aluminium foil. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures {{similar to those used}} to provide structural coloration: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of guanine spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to <b>be</b> <b>reflected,</b> so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to <b>be</b> <b>reflected,</b> and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

50|$|Understanding light's {{effect on}} makeup and various shades and {{pigments}} is important when designing a performer’s makeup.

5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to <b>be</b> <b>reflected</b> in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E
