5|$|Butthole Surfers is an American {{rock band}} formed by singer Gibby Haynes and guitarist Paul Leary in San Antonio, Texas in 1981. The band has had {{numerous}} personnel changes, but its core lineup of Haynes, Leary, and drummer King Coffey has <b>been</b> <b>consistent</b> since 1983. Teresa Nervosa served as second drummer from 1983 to 1985, 1986 to 1989, and 2009. The band has also employed {{a variety of}} bass players, most notably Jeff Pinkus.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a natural generalization of Borel 2 ̆ 7 s Conjecture. For each infinite cardinal number κ, let BCκ denote this generalization. Then BCℵ 0 {{is equivalent to}} the classical Borel conjecture. Assuming the classical Borel conjecture, ¬BCℵ 1 {{is equivalent to the}} existence of a Kurepa tree of height ℵ 1. Using the connection of BCκ with a generalization of Kurepa 2 ̆ 7 s Hypothesis, we obtain the following consistency results: 1. If it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that there <b>is</b> a 1 -inaccessible cardinal then it <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> that BCℵ 1. 2.

5|$|Because of its {{extensive}} ethnomedical tradition, the phytochemistry of P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the topic of several studies. Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not <b>been</b> <b>consistent.</b> Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, {{some of which were}} first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane.|$|E
5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would have had on a pagan site. This would have <b>been</b> <b>consistent</b> with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{consistency}} of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion [...] is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems). If T {{is a theory}} and A is an additional axiom, T + A is said to <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> relative to T (or simply that A <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with T) {{if it can be}} proved thatif T <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> then T + A <b>is</b> <b>consistent.</b> If both A and ¬A <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with T, then A is said to be independent of T.|$|R
50|$|Given this, {{instead of}} {{outright}} consistency, one usually considers relative consistency: Let S and T be formal theories. Assume that S <b>is</b> a <b>consistent</b> theory. Does it follow that T <b>is</b> <b>consistent?</b> If so, then T <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> relative to S. Two theories are equiconsistent if each one <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> {{relative to the}} other.|$|R

The Mali Empire, consisting predominantly of African and Berber tribes, stands as a strong example of the early Islamic conversion of the Sub-Saharan region. The gateways prominently expanded to include the aforementioned trade routes through the Eastern shores of the African continent. With the European colonization of Africa, missionaries were almost in competition with the European Christian missionaries operating in the colonies.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to prove the absolute consistency of a theory T. Instead we usually take a theory S, believed to <b>be</b> <b>consistent,</b> and try to prove the weaker statement that if S <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> then T must also be consistent—if we can do this we say that T <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> relative to S.

25|$|The {{notion of}} {{peacekeeping}} {{seems to be}} deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart {{from the likes of}} the United States. The Somalia commission wrote in 1997 that “Canada’s foreign policy with respect to peacekeeping has <b>been</b> <b>consistent</b> since Canadians embraced peacekeeping in the late 1950s”. Since the Suez Crisis, Canadian foreign policy has fit a peacekeeping rubric. Americans, however, were seen to fight wars, but Canadians pictured themselves as working for peace. Canada never had a reputation for starting wars but instead was seen to {{come to the aid of}} war-torn countries.|$|E
25|$|Low reward {{dependence}} is then {{hypothesized to}} fit the psychological profile of Type 2 Alcoholism (predominantly in males). Type 2 Alcoholism is clinically characterized by an early onset of alcohol-related problems {{before the age of}} 25 (independent of external circumstances), drinking often associated with antisocial behavior, spontaneous alcohol-seeking behavior (inability to abstain), low associated guilt and fear, and frequent fighting and arrests after drinking. This combination of traits also describes people with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and is consistent with findings that type 2 alcoholics frequently suffer from ASPD. Since the inception of these theories they have been tested in several investigations and the results have <b>been</b> <b>consistent</b> with the theories.|$|E
5000|$|The delta {{consistency}} model {{states that}} an update will propagate {{through the system}} and all replicas will <b>be</b> <b>consistent</b> after a fixed time period δ. In other words, the result of any read operation <b>is</b> <b>consistent</b> with a read on the original copy of anobject except for a (short) bounded interval after a modification. So basically, {{if you have an}} object which is modified, during the short period of time following its modification, the read will not <b>be</b> <b>consistent.</b> Then, after a fixed time period, the modification is propagated and the read will <b>be</b> <b>consistent.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{languages}} in the Athabaskan family have tone. However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; Proto-Athabaskan had no tones. In each case, tone evolved from glottalic consonants {{at the ends}} of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not <b>been</b> <b>consistent,</b> with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and Chipewyan, which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently. Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages circa 500 BC.|$|E
25|$|When {{surveyed}} in 1999 on his political positions by Project Vote Smart, Griffith {{indicated that he}} supports legalized abortion in the first trimester and {{to save the life}} of the mother, while favoring the restriction of abortion through parental notification laws and prohibition of partial-birth abortion. Griffith's voting record has generally <b>been</b> <b>consistent</b> with his 1999 survey, voting in favor of restrictions on late term abortions such as parental-notification and parental-consent, while voting against bills that would restrict first-term abortions. In 2010 Griffith voted to restrict state funding of abortions, and to require abortion clinics to meet the same licensing requirements as surgical centers. In 2006 Griffith voted to restrict state funding for fetal stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-risk}} pregnancies, {{the association}} between cigarette smoking and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has <b>been</b> <b>consistent</b> and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology {{increases the risk of}} preeclampsia {{to such a degree that}} any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked. However, the damaging effects of smoking on overall health and pregnancy outcomes outweighs the benefits in decreasing the incidence of preeclampsia. It is recommended that smoking be stopped prior to, during and after pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1999, the format of J2 has <b>been</b> <b>consistent.</b> Clubs played a quadruple round-robin (two home and away) format during the 1999 to 2007 seasons. To accommodate the ongoing expansion process, a triple round-robin format was implemented during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Until the 2001 season, the clubs played extra time if they were tied after regulation and the clubs received three points for a regulation win, two points for an extra time win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss (there were no penalties). However, starting in 2002, the league abolished extra time and set the points system to the standard three-one-nil system.|$|E

25|$|The {{spelling}} whiskey {{is common}} in Ireland and the United States, while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries.

Since the 1960s, American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US. However, some prominent American brands, such as George Dickel, Maker's Mark, and Old Forester (all made by different companies), use the whisky spelling on their labels, and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, the legal regulations for spirit in the US, also use the whisky spelling throughout.|$|E
