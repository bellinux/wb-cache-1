30|$|BET value reduces from 900 to 3 – 10 m 2 g − 1. The bromine {{accommodated}} {{into the}} micropores induces the dielectric and structural effects, including a polarizability of the interface layer modification [3]. In certain bromine substituents, p electrons are conjugated with π electrons in an aromatic ring [28, 29]. Moreover, a bromine substituent is a weak electron-withdrawing group so that π electrons would be delocalized [30]. The light absorption {{range of a}} compound containing a bromine substituent is broader than that for the initial one and should exhibit a redshift. Therefore, the ε value of the <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compound</b> is {{higher than that of}} the corresponding reference compound. These variations can be readout by the elastic optical scattering analysis [31]. The SEM and N 2 adsorption data testify that the bromination reaction takes place at the ACFs surface leading to sites formation enriched with grafted bromine—a kind of the nanoscale islands on the substrate interface. The sites are relatively hydrophobic due to the bromine terminal group. An interaction potential among the sites and its decay scale can be described in terms of the interaction of Br with the carbon interface states. This interaction is characterized by recording the Br 3 d core level with an assistance of XPS.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} one decade, SmC∗d 4, SmC∗d 3, andSmC∗ A were the only three {{confirmed}} commensurate SmC* variant phases with periodicities {{less than or equal}} four layers. In 2006, employing ellipsometry and resonant X-ray diffraction (RXRD), our research team first discovered a new liquid crystal mesophase having a six-layer periodicity in one ternary mixture which includes one sulfur-containing compound. From our ellipsometric results, this phase showed antiferroelectric-like optical response. This novel discovery inspired renewed interest to search for liquid crystal mesophases with commensurateperiodicities greater than four layers. Soon after, another mesophase having a six-layer structure and showing a ferrielectric-like dielectric response, instead, was uncovered by RXRD measurements on a different binary mixture which has one <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compound.</b> Meanwhile mesophases having a 5 -, 8 -, 12 - or 15 -layer periodicity were reported. However, numerous questions remain to be addressed associated with these unusual reported phases. Theoretical models giving rise to mesophases with periodicities greater than four layers have been developed; but, to date, none of them haveprovided satisfactory explanations of all the physical phenomena related to the mesophases exhibiting a six-layer structure. Moreover, the question “what is the source of long-range interactions between liquid-like smectic layers, which are responsible for establishing mesophases with long periodicities and mean-field behavior of the smectic-A–smectic-C transition?” remains unanswered for more than three decades...|$|E

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of the ozone layer}} is caused mainly by the increase in emissions of chlorine- and <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds</b> like CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide. Emissions of greenhouse gases can affect the {{depletion of}} the ozone layer through atmospheric interaction. We studied the interactions in the atmosphere between the greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion {{from the point of view}} of past and future emissions of the anthropogenic compounds: CFCs, halons, CH 4, N 2 O, NOx, CO and CO 2. In our investigation the increase in emissions of chlorine- and <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds,</b> largely responsible for the depletion of stratospheric ozone at mid-latitudes, was found to be - 5. 8 % per decade from 1980 to 1990. The increase in CH 4 emissions in the same period changes this ozone depletion by + 1. 4 % per decade to - 4. 4 % per decade, which is close to TOMS and Dobson measurements. The increase in N 2 O emissions hardly affects this depletion. The decrease in stratospheric temperatures due to increased CO 2 emissions also diminishes the ozone depletion; the same may also happen when NOx emissions are increased. The effect of these interactions in coming decades is to accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer. The trend in CH 4 emissions described in the business-as-usual scenario IS 92 a may yield 1980 ozone column levels in 2060 compared with 2080 with CH 4 emissions fixed at 1990 levels. The temperature decrease in the stratosphere may initially also accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer by several years, ignoring a possible large extra ozone depletion by the extra formation of polar stratospheric clouds over large areas of the world...|$|R
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds</b> can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|R

40|$|The ozone {{depletion}} events (ODEs) in the springtime Arctic {{have been investigated}} since the 1980 s. It is found that the depletion of ozone is highly associated with an auto-catalytic reaction cycle, which involves mostly the <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds.</b> Moreover, bromide stored in various substrates in the Arctic such as the underlying surface covered by ice and snow can be also activated by the absorbed HOBr.

40|$|Brominated {{disinfection}} byproducts (DBPs), {{formed from}} {{the reaction of}} disinfectant(s) with natural organic matter and bromide in raw water, are generally more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogues. Brominated DBPs have been intensively studied over the past 35 years, yet {{only a fraction of}} the total organic bromine formed during disinfection has been identified. A significant portion of the unaccounted total organic bromine may be attributed to polar/highly polar brominated HIPS. In this work, a method for fast selective detection of polar/highly polar brominated DBPs in drinking water was developed using negative ion electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-tqMS) by setting precursor ion scans of m/z 79 and 81. This method was conducted without liquid chromatography separation. The results demonstrate that the ESI-tqMS precursor ion scan is an effective tool for the selective detection of electrospray ionizable <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds</b> in a complex mixture. Many polar/highly polar bromine-containing HIPS were tentatively found in two drinking water samples, and some of them may be new brominated DBPs that have not been previously reported. This method was also extended for the selective detection of polar bromine-containing compounds/contaminants in groundwater, surface water and wastewater...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the present study has been to assess the {{atmospheric}} significance of methane (CH 4) in terms of its reactivity toward bromine-containing species. Methane is an important greenhouse gas that exists in abundance in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere. Its presence affects the temperature structure and climate system of the Earth. Methane 2 ̆ 7 s primary impact on the environment arises from its contribution to global warming of the Earth, and is a cause of concern. The chemical reactions of methane in the atmosphere not only affect its lifetime, but also the concentrations of other greenhouse gases such as ozone in the troposphere and water vapor in the stratosphere. ^ Methane reacts readily with hydroxyl (OH) radicals present in the atmosphere. The oxidation of methane is then catalyzed by bromine (Br) atoms and bromine monoxide (BrO) radicals. Br atoms are formed due to the photolysis of molecular bromine and <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds</b> released from the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface from natural and anthropogenic sources, and BrO radicals are formed due to ozone destruction by bromine atoms. The overall bromine-catalyzed oxidation cycle of methane proceeds through a series of steps involving the formation and absorption of various species. The oxidation of methane finally results in the formation of carbon monoxide (CO), together with water (H 2 O) and oxygen (O 2) molecules. For each molecule of methane, three molecules of ozone are destroyed, and, thus, the oxidation process is detrimental to the presence of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. From the results obtained in this study, it is proposed that the possible new inorganic bromine reservoirs could be HOOOBr, HOOBrO, CH 3 OOOBr, and CH 3 OOBrO. The proposition of such reservoirs forms a basis from which future sinks of bromine atoms in the stratosphere can be identified. ...|$|R

The linker {{is based on a}} tartaric acid unit, which, upon cleavage from resin, generates a C-terminal aldehyde. This aldehyde can then be derivatized with a <b>bromine-containing</b> amino-oxy <b>compound</b> that serves as an isotope tag for subsequent MS/MS analysis of y-ion fragments.

30|$|Water is {{the prime}} need for all living {{entities}} on Earth. Water resources have been obstinately affected by rapid development and increased anthropogenic activities. WHO (2003) estimates that, in India, about 38 million people are affected by waterborne diseases through various means each year, among which over 75 % are children. So, disinfection of drinking water is essential to reduce the incidence and spread of waterborne diseases (Gaffga et al. 2007). The disinfection of metropolitan drinking water is performed with chlorine {{in order to ensure}} the health of the public and to protect the people against various waterborne infirmities (Villanueva et al. 2015). Chlorination is the most universally accepted method for disinfection since the early twentieth century (Paull and Barron 2004) as it prevents the contamination of potable water against pathogens like bacteria and viruses (Zha et al. 2014). In (1974), Rook first discovered that hypochlorous and hypobromous acid react with naturally present organic matter to form water DBPs, few trihalomethanes (THM) substances such as chloroform (CHCl 3), bromo dichloromethane (CHCl 2 Br), dibromo chloromethane (CHClBr 2) and bromoform (CHBr 3). Richardson (2002) reported that during the addition of chlorine to water, toxic compounds are formed and more than 600 DBPs were identified like haloacetic acids. DBPs are formed through the reaction of organic precursor (natural organic matter, algal organic matter, wastewater effluent organic matter) and inorganic substance (bromate, iodate and nitrate) and also on reaction with chemical disinfectants (chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramines and ozone) (Krasner 2009). NOM includes humic substances, fulvic acid, hydrophilic amino acids (Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln, His, Tyr), carboxylic acids and carbohydrates too (Kitis et al. 2001). The USEPA issued the DBPs rule that specifies that the highest TOC levels for treated water is 2 and 4  mg/L in source water to ensure that DBPs such as THMs are present at acceptable levels (Pontius 1993). Zeng et al. (2015) highlighted that the common genotoxic compounds come from raw water and several mutagenic or carcinogenic DBPs are formed due to addition of disinfectants to drinking water. Chorine- and <b>bromine-containing</b> <b>compounds</b> also cause carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects on animal studies (Weisel et al. 1999). Zhai et al. (2014) reported that 2, 4, 6 -tribromoresorcinol, 2, 6 -dibromo- 4 -nitrophenol, 2, 2, 4 -tribromo- 5 -hydroxy- 4 -cyclopentene- 1, 3 -dione, 2, 2, 4 -dibro-mochloro- 5 -hydroxy- 4 -cyclopentene- 1, 3 -dione, and 2, 2, 4 -bromo-dichloro- 5 -hydroxy- 4 -cyclopentene- 1, 3 -dione are termed as polar brominated DBPs.|$|R

Furthermore, the most influential reactions in different time periods of ODEs are also revealed. By removing 11 reactions with the maximum absolute values of sensitivities lower than 10  %, a reduced reaction mechanism of ODEs is derived. The onsets of each time period of ODEs in simulations using the original reaction mechanism and the reduced reaction mechanism are identical while the maximum deviation of the mixing ratio of principal bromine species between different mechanisms {{is found to be}} less than 1  %. By performing the principal component analysis on an array of the sensitivity matrices, the dependence of a particular species concentration on a combination of the reaction rates in the mechanism is revealed. Redundant reactions are indicated by principal components corresponding to small eigenvalues and insignificant elements in principal components with large eigenvalues. Through this investigation, aside from the 11 reactions identified as unimportant in the concentration sensitivity analysis, additionally nine reactions were indicated to contribute only little to the total response of the system. Thus, they can be eliminated from the original reaction scheme. The results computed by applying the reduced reaction mechanism derived after the principal component analysis agree well with those by using the original reaction scheme. The maximum deviation of the mixing ratio of principal bromine species is found to be less than 10  %, which is guaranteed by the selection criterion adopted in the simplification process. Moreover, it is shown in the principal component analysis that O(1 D) in the mechanism of ODEs is in quasi-steady state, which enables a following simplification of the reduced reaction mechanism obtained in the present study...|$|R
