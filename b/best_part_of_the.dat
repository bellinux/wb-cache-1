5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E

25|$|Inaugurated as a {{state-of-the-art}} facility {{and as one}} of Italy's finest venues in 1963, the stadium appeared excessive for a team (Hellas) that had spent the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous 35 years in Serie B.

25|$|Following {{the merger}} of the SER and LCDR in 1899, Port Victoria found itself firmly in second place behind Queenborough for traffic to the continent.

25|$|The {{example of}} the {{relations}} with Portugal illustrated that De Witt's diplomatic gifts were necessary as much within the Republic, as without. He always had to make internal deals to accompany the external deals he made with foreign powers. In {{the case of the}} Hague treaty, Zeeland at first refused to ratify (and the requirement of unanimity in cases of peace and war in the Union of Utrecht made its position strong).

25|$|In {{order to}} combat the short-passing threat, the championship-winning Preston North End side of 1888 devised a more {{defensive}} 2–3–5 formation (two defenders, three mid-fielders and five attackers), which would become the standard formation for many teams for the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next 40 years. One of the half-backs was brought back into defence, which sat deeper than before, making the two defenders full-backs as opposed to three-quarter-backs. Their main job was to mark the opposition's inside forwards and cut out the short passes in mid-field. Furthermore, two forwards were brought back into midfield as half-backs to mark the opposition wingers and negate the pace threat. The remaining half-back became a centre-half, who would patrol the field, drifting from defence to attack as he saw fit. This left two wingers up front (outside-right and outside-left), along with two inside-forwards (inside-right and inside-left) and a centre-forward.|$|E

Against 406, Bombay lost their first six for 174, before Shastri and Sairaj Bahutule added 259 in six hours. Shastri's individual score was 151. Bombay survived the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last day to win on first innings lead. Shastri scored 612 runs in the season and took 17 wickets at 15.

The King decides that he will give the <b>best</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom to the daughter who loves him most, and asks his three daughters to state how much they love him. Goneril and Regan make hypocritical, flattering speeches, and are rewarded with a third each; Cordelia, however, cannot or will not stoop to false flattery for gain, and tells her father that she loves {{him as much as}} she should, and that she will love her husband as well if she marries. Enraged, the King disinherits and disowns his once-favourite child, and divides her portion between her two elder sisters. The loyal Earl of Kent speaks up boldly to defend Cordelia, and is banished by the furious King. The Duke of Burgundy withdraws his suit on finding Cordelia deprived of a dowry, but the King of France gladly accepts her as his bride.|$|E
