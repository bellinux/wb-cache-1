40|$|A variational {{method for}} calculating excited {{stretching}} states of symmetric tetrahedral pentaatomic molecules is presented {{based on the}} use of Radau coordinates and Morse oscillator-like basis functions. Symmetry is used both {{to reduce the size of}} the secular matrix to be diagonalized and to calculate the potential energy matrix elements over a reduced grid of quadrature points. Test results are presented for methane, silane and germane. For CH 4, stretch± <b>bend</b> <b>coupling</b> is found to be signi®cant, whereas it is less important for the more strongly local mode SiH 4 and GeH 4 molecules.

40|$|Using our {{recently}} developed technique of infrared laser assisted photofragment spectroscopy (IRLAPS), we have measured four vibrational overtone bands of jet-cooled CF 3 H in the N = 4 and N = 5 CH stretch-bend polyads. The cooling {{in the expansion}} eliminates much of the rotational congestion and reveals homogeneous structure which reflects the vibrational coupling of the stretch bend states with other modes of the molecule. This homogeneous structure indicates that the coupling of the stretch-bend slates {{to the rest of}} the molecule is 20 - 2000 times weaker than the stretch <b>bend</b> <b>coupling</b> itself and implies a hierarchy of time scales in the vibrational energy redistribution of the excited molecule. The overtone spectra of the jet-cooled molecules also reveal a wide variation in the coupling strengths of the stretch-bend states to the other modes, suggesting that the coupling depends upon the presence of specific low-order resonances rather than on the total density of states...|$|E
40|$|Polymer-based {{integrated}} optics is attractive for inter-chip optical interconnection applications, for instance, for coupling photonic devices to fibers in high density packaging. In such a hybrid integration scheme, a key {{challenge is to}} achieve efficient optical coupling between the photonic chips and waveguides. With the single-mode polymer waveguides, the alignment tolerances become especially critical {{as compared to the}} typical accuracies of the patterning processes. We study novel techniques for such coupling requirements. In this paper, we present a waveguide-embedded micro-mirror structure, which can be aligned with high precision, even active alignment method is possible. The structure enables 90 degree <b>bend</b> <b>coupling</b> between a single-mode waveguide and a vertical-emitting/detecting chip, such as, a VCSEL or photodiode, which is embedded under the waveguide layer. Both the mirror structure and low-loss polymer waveguides are fabricated in a process based mainly on the direct-pattern UV nanoimprinting technology and on the use of UVcurable polymeric materials. Fabrication results of the coupling structure with waveguides are presented, and the critical alignment tolerances and manufacturability issues are discussed. Cop. 2015 SPIE...|$|E
40|$|The {{elastic stress}} {{concentrations}} are addressed that are {{developed from the}} keyless frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into a hub with rounded bore edges. Derived from a formal modeling of the title problem {{in terms of an}} integral equation, a set of normalized parameters is proposed that accounts for the combined effects on the hub stress concentration of the fillet radius, the shaft radius, the hub outer radius, the hub axial length, the interference, the Young's modulus, and the <b>bending</b> <b>couple.</b> A numerical validation of the normalized parameters is presented. With the aid of Finite Elements, various design charts are compiled that (a) forecast the <b>bending</b> <b>couple</b> initiating the detachment between the shaft and the hub, and (b) report the elastic stress concentrations within the hub versus the proposed normalized parameters in the absence of shaft–hub detachment.

The relationship between the <b>bending</b> <b>couple</b> and the curvature of the bent sheet is presented in a graphical form that reveals the influence of anisotropy and strain-hardening on the bending characteristic of the sheet metal.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} modelling of a shaft-hub press-fit subjected to <b>bending</b> <b>couples</b> {{applied to the}} shaft extremities is developed, {{and the value of}} the <b>bending</b> <b>couple</b> inducing an un- desired shaft-hub incipient detachment is analytically determined. The shaft-hub contact is modelled in terms of two elastic Timoshenko beams connected by a distributed elastic spring, whose stiffness is analytically evaluated. Two models of the distributed spring are considered. The first model expresses the combined deformability of both the shaft and the hub cross sections. The second model accounts for the stiffening effect exerted by the shaft portion protruding from the hub on the adjacent shaft part that is in contact with the hub, and, consequently, it assumes only a rigid body motion of the shaft cross section, thus neglecting its deformability. Based upon this beam-like model, the <b>bending</b> <b>couple</b> producing the incipient detach- ment between the shaft and the hub is theoretically determined in term of the shaft-hub geometry, of the initial shaft-hub interference, and of the elastic constants. Comparisons with selected Finite Element (FE) forecasts indicate that the first modelling produces an incipient detachment couple that appreciably overrates the FE forecasts, whereas the sec- ond modelling lowers the error down to technically acceptable predictions...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a technique to}} optimally tune and calibrate bendable x-ray optics for sub-micron focusing. The focusing is divided between two elliptically cylindrical reflecting elements, a Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) pair. Each optic is shaped by applying unequal <b>bending</b> <b>couples</b> to each end of a flat mirror. The developed technique allows optimal tuning of these systems using surface slope data obtained with a slope measuring instrument, the long trace profiler (LTP). Due to the near linearity of the problem, the minimal set of data necessary for the tuning of each bender, consists of only three slope traces measured before and after a single adjustment of each <b>bending</b> <b>couple.</b> The data are analyzed with software realizing a method of regression analysis with experimentally found characteristic functions of the benders. The resulting approximation to the functional dependence of the desired shape provides nearly final settings. Moreover, the characteristic functions of the benders found {{in the course of}} tuning, can be used for retuning to a new desired shape without removal from the beamline and re-measuring. We perform a ray trace, using profiler data for the finally tuned optics, predicting the performance to be expected during use of the optics on the beamline...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} {{the resistance of}} a bilayer to changes in curvature two mechanisms are distinguished which are termed bilayer <b>couple</b> <b>bending</b> and single-layer <b>bending.</b> In bilayer <b>couple</b> <b>bending,</b> the resistance arises from the 2 -D isotropic elasticity of the two layers and their fixed distance. Single-layer bending covers the intrinsic bending stiffness of each monolayer. The two mechanisms are not independent. Even so, the distinction is useful since bilayer <b>couple</b> <b>bending</b> can relax by a slip between the layers from the local to the global fashion. Therefore, the bending stiffness of a bilayer depends on the time scale and {{on the extent of}} the deformation imposed on the membrane. Based on experimental data, it is shown by order of magnitude estimates that (a) the bending stiffness determined from thermally induced shape fluctuations of almost spherical vesicles is dominated by single-layer bending; (b) in the tether experiment on lipid vesicles and on red cells, a contribution of local bilayer <b>couple</b> <b>bending</b> can not be excluded; and (c) at the sharp corners at the leading and the trailing edge of tanktreading red cells, local bilayer <b>couple</b> <b>bending</b> appears to be important...|$|R
40|$|The peak contact {{stresses}} {{are addressed}} that are {{developed from the}} frictionless press fit of a shaft subjected to bending into an elastically similar hub with bore rounded edges. The non-linear behavior of this progressive contact is addressed by scaling a local solution available from the literature, {{with the aid of}} intermediate, auxiliary problems extracted from the fracture mechanics realm. The title problem being linear on the global domain with both the <b>bending</b> <b>couple</b> and the interference, this problem is solved by combining the FE forecasts obtained for two separate load cases, i. e. a) the interference alone and, b) the <b>bending</b> <b>couple</b> alone. Such results are expressed in terms of a) stress intensity factors for the auxiliary FM problems, and b) hoop strain component, as sampled in the proximity of the indenting edge for both the mating members. Design formulae for the contact stresses are proposed, that account for various normalized geometrical parameters, such as the outer to inner hub radii ratio, the radius of the hub bore fillet, and the contact length.

Two types of beams were considered: circumferentially asymmetric stiffness (i. e., CAS) and circumferentially uniform stiffness (i. e., CUS) beams.

40|$|Females of Mermis nigrescens, a {{nematode}} parasitic on grasshoppers, climb through terrestrial vegetation {{where they}} lay their eggs. The 100 -mm-long body of these nematodes bridges gaps in this three-dimensional substratum, and crawls efficiently over planar surfaces. The nematodes {{do not use}} the classical undulant pattern of nematode locomotion as one coordinated unit; instead they propel themselves in several independent, locally controlled zones that propagate posteriorly. A repeated motion of their anterior end laces the body around fixed objects at which force may be applied. Propulsive {{force is applied to}} objects as the body glides past the contact site. Intermediate loops are elevated above the surface where they cannot contribute to propulsion. These loops rise and fall with time due to varying differences in propulsive forces between the contact sites. Forces are applied to the objects by internally generated <b>bending</b> <b>couples</b> that are propagated along the trunk, propelling the body in a cam-follower mechanism. <b>Bending</b> <b>couples</b> are generated by the contraction of ventral or dorsal longitudinal muscle bands that apply compressive force to the cuticle. The muscle bands, consisting of a single layer of obliquely striated muscle cells, are closely applied to the cuticle and are separated from it only by a fibrous basal lamina and a thin extension of a hypodermal cell. The myofilaments of each sarcomere are parallel to the body axis and attached perpendicularly via dense bodies (z-line equivalents) to the basal lamina, which in turn is fixed to the cuticle via filaments passing through the hypodermal cytoplasm, Consequently, forces are transmitted laterally to the cuticle over {{the entire length of the}} muscle, compressing it parallel to the surface without need for attachment to the terminal ends of the muscle cells. Thus the muscles are engineered for local control of bending and avoidance of buckling. There is evidence that the motor nervous system of Mermis may not be as simple as in classical nematode examples, which may explain why Mermis is capable of a much more localized control of locomotory motion. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

If the Classical Laminated Plate Theory (CLPT) {{allows us to}} calculate the elastic behaviour of a laminate composed of traditional layers (mats, unidirectionals, taffetas, …), it is unable to do it when less common layers are used (satins for instance), because these layers are extension and <b>bending</b> <b>coupled.</b> The {{first part of this}} paper deals with this problem, and all the equations solving it are completely defined.

As a consequence, this effect is studied and a methodology is detailed to take it into account. Including the turn-over into the previous equations, a whole linear theory for laminates composed of coupled layers is obtained.

The LPGs were manufactured by UV-exposure of hydrogen-loaded Corning SMF 28 fibers and their annealing was followed by wet etching in hydrofluoric acid up to dispersion turning point (DTP) where the LPG shows the highest sensitivity.
