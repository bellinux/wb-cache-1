5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops to sack the town and destroy the church, acts that he had promised to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Boston,</b> carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E

5|$|The Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, {{and later}} the Little Belt Affair, contributed to the United States' {{decision}} to declare war on Britain on 18June 1812. Chesapeake, {{under the command of}} Captain Samuel Evans, was prepared for duty in the Atlantic. Beginning on 13December, she ranged from Madeira and traveled clockwise to the Cape Verde Islands and South America, and then <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Boston.</b> She captured six ships as prizes: the British ships Volunteer, LiverpoolHero, Earl Percy, and Ellen; the brig Julia, an American ship trading under a British license; and Valeria, an American ship recaptured from British privateers. During the cruise she was chased by an unknown British ship-of-the-line and frigate but, after a passing storm squall, the two pursuing ships were gone the next morning. The cargo of Volunteer, 40tons of pig iron and copper, were sold for $185,000. Earl Percy never made it back to port as she ran aground off the coast of Long Island, and LiverpoolHero was burned as she was considered leaky.

It is believed that his father was a mining engineer and that early in his life he traveled out west with his father, ending up in Butte, Montana. In his early teens, Eltinge dressed in women's clothing and performed in the rugged saloons patronized by ranchers and miners.
