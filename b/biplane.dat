5|$|At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris, Nungesser and Coli, {{working closely}} with Chief Engineer Émile Farret and {{production}} manager Albert Longelot, assisted {{in the design of}} the new Levasseur PL.8 <b>biplane.</b> Based on the Levasseur PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was a conventional, single-bay, wood and fabric-covered <b>biplane</b> that carried a crew of two in a side-by-side, open cockpit.|$|E

50|$|Large {{transport}} and bombing <b>biplanes</b> often needed still more bays to provide sufficient strength. These are {{sometimes referred to}} as multi-bay <b>biplanes.</b> A small number of <b>biplanes,</b> such as the Zeppelin-Lindau D.I have no interplane struts and are referred to as being strutless.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The four known <b>biplanes</b> {{of order}} 9 (k ii) are {{described}} in terms of their ovals, %-chain structures, and automorphism groups. An exhaustive computer search for all <b>biplanes</b> of order 9 with certain chain structures has produced but two, one of which is new. None of these four <b>biplanes</b> yield the putative plane of order i 0. Only finitely many <b>biplanes</b> (projective designs with % 2) are presently known and it is conjectured that for any fixed %> 2 but finitely many projective designs exist. The authors know of four <b>biplanes</b> of order 9. All are self-dual. The most symmetric of these has repeatedly been uncovered. A group-theoretica...|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s {{and very}} early 1930s, Travel Air <b>biplanes</b> {{were the most}} widely used {{civilian}} <b>biplanes</b> in America (not counting war-surplus military trainers re-purposed for civilian use) -- with the arguable exception of their chief competitors, WACO <b>biplanes.</b> (Travel Air production ended in the mid-1930s, under the Curtiss-Wright Corporation).|$|R

50|$|The <b>Biplanes</b> Of Yesteryear Mifyter (My Fighter) is an American amateur-built aircraft, {{designed}} by Rod Cowgill and produced by <b>Biplanes</b> Of Yesteryear, of Ontario, Oregon. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in December 1909 by the Alsatian Georges Chatel. It started with the license-production of French aircraft; Hanriot monoplanes and Farman <b>biplanes.</b> From 1912, the factory started {{building}} its own successful <b>biplanes,</b> designed by Robert Wild.|$|R
5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} {{landed on the}} summit plateau of Helvellyn and took off again. The plane was an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater <b>biplane</b> flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, the plane's manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In late September 1910 Bielovucic took Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, {{founder of}} the Futurist movement, over Milan as a {{passenger}} in a Voisin <b>biplane</b> during the International Air Week. Marinetti stated that the experience moved him to his new concept of art.|$|E

50|$|Very {{similar to}} the <b>Biplanes</b> level, was the Jets option. In this mode, only {{straight}} missile and guided missiles were used. It still had the same map options and squadron options as the <b>biplanes</b> mode, with Jets flying singly, two-on-two, or three-on-three.|$|R
5|$|Yamashiro {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it, the first Japanese ship to do so. During her modernization in the 1930s, a catapult and a collapsible crane were fitted on the stern, {{and the ship}} was equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 <b>biplanes</b> were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 <b>biplanes</b> in 1938 and then by Mitsubishi F1M <b>biplanes,</b> from 1942 on.|$|R

5|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{built an}} eight-foot foam {{model of the}} Zeppelin to {{complement}} shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the <b>biplane.</b> A <b>biplane</b> model with a two-foot wingspan {{was used for the}} shot of the <b>biplane</b> detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust and shadows were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences.|$|E

50|$|<b>Biplanes</b> offer several {{advantages}} over conventional cantilever monoplane designs: they permit lighter wing structures, low wing loading and smaller span {{for a given}} wing area. However, interference between the airflow over each wing increases drag substantially, and <b>biplanes</b> generally need extensive bracing, which causes additional drag.|$|R
50|$|On 31 March 1930, {{three of}} the <b>biplanes</b> from Ethiopia's air arm played a {{dramatic}} role in a battle between Haile Selassie (not yet crowned Emperor) and conservative forces seeking his ouster. During the Battle of Anchem, <b>biplanes</b> were effectively used to give Haile Selassie's forces the upper hand.|$|R
5|$|Once in the air, the <b>biplane</b> {{was escorted}} to the French coast by four {{military}} aircraft led by French Air Force Captain Venson, and sighted from the coastal town of Étretat. A sighting {{was made by}} the commanding officer of the British submarine , who recorded the note in his log, that he observed a <b>biplane</b> at 300 m altitude, 20 nautical miles southwest of the tip of Needles on the Isle of Wight. In Ireland, an aircraft overhead was reported by a resident of the town of Dungarvan and a Catholic priest reported a sighting over the village of Carrigaholt, then no further verified reports were made.|$|E
5|$|The <b>biplane</b> that chased Hannay was a 1916 Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, his {{apartment}} {{was in an}} Art Deco building and 1950s rail carriages were being pulled by a steam engine built in 1927.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic and Tails {{fly over}} the ocean in Tails' <b>biplane,</b> the Tornado, after {{defeating}} Doctor Eggman. Beginning from this point, After the Sequel depicts Sonic and Tails noticing a forested island and deciding to make a landing and explore. After completing the first zone, Sonic finds a robot resembling Tails—a trap sprung by Eggman. The robot ensnares Sonic in a forcefield while Eggman steals Sonic's Chaos Emeralds. Sonic escapes and sets out with Tails to recover the Emeralds.|$|E

5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 <b>biplane</b> reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the funnel.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the engine}} issues, the SO2U-1 was {{considered}} overall {{to be superior}} to the competing Curtiss XSO3C-1; however, Vought's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and F4U Corsair fighter. As a result, the XSO3C was declared {{the winner of the}} contract, and was ordered into production. Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC <b>biplane</b> which it was intended to replace.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Italy in September 1943, around 60 Regia Aeronautica aircraft {{were found}} at Mostar and Zadar airfields and 33 machines were incorporated into the ZNDH. This number included further Fiat G.50 fighters, as well as six Fiat CR.42 <b>biplane</b> fighters. Some CANT Z.1007 and Fiat BR.20 bombers were also added into the ZNDH. The Luftwaffe subsequently also supplied the HZL fighter squadron with about 20-25 Fiat G.50s captured by German troops on Regia Aeronautica airfields in the Balkans.|$|E
