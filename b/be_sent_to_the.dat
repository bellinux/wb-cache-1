5|$|The second {{agreement}} was again {{regarded as a}} provisional compromise by both parties. The charter prescribed that a joint delegation of the rebels and the noblemen should <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king, who was staying in Prague, to seek his arbitration. There {{is no evidence of}} the appointment of the delegates or their departure for Prague. Sigismund of Luxemburg died on 9 December 1437.|$|E
5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Council for scrutiny within 14 {{days of their}} publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within {{six months of the}} report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster {{for at least two years}} before he could <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minors. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1943 Petrov {{notified}} the People's Commissar of Armaments Dmitriy Ustinov {{about the new}} project. On 13 April Ustinov informed Petrov that the State Committee of Defence had requested for five of the new guns to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> testing grounds on 1 May. On 5 May, two pieces were received for trials; two days later, on 7 May the gun was recommended for adoption, and on 8 August 1943 it was officially adopted as the 152mm howitzer M1943. One {{and a half months}} later, the first series production D-1 howitzers were delivered to the Red Army representatives.|$|E
5|$|Europeans would sail to the West African {{coast and}} trade African kings {{manufactured}} goods (rifles and ammunition) for slave. From there slaves would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West Indies or {{the east coast}} of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, molasses, sugar, tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe. Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.|$|E

Joe Hamilton <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Utah Stars. George Carter also ended up with the Stars despite not being picked in the dispersal draft; Utah would become the ABA's third casualty of the season, suspending operations in early December. The Claws' best known player, Mel Daniels, was disappointed at the Claws' fate and retired rather than play for another team. In Terry Pluto's book on the ABA, [...] "Loose Balls", Daniels recalled that the Claws' players were allowed to take equipment and furniture from the team office in lieu of payment.|$|R
5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> driver's employer.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced a constitutional amendment in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco {{encountered}} {{bad weather}} {{on its way}} from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships {{would be allowed to}} visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Spanish court.|$|E

50|$|Jehovah’s Witnesses, homosexuals, and emigrants <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Dachau after <b>the</b> 1935 {{passage of}} the Nuremberg Laws which {{institutionalized}} racial discrimination. In early 1937, the SS, using prisoner labor, initiated construction of a large complex capable of holding 6,000 prisoners. The construction was officially completed in mid-August 1938. More political opponents, and over 11,000 German and Austrian Jews <b>were</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp after the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland in 1938.

5|$|Initially it {{had been}} planned that the Australians would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, where they would {{undertake}} further training prior to {{being sent to the}} Western Front in France and Belgium. However, the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital Suez Canal was threatened, {{and as a result of}} this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans for the use of the Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in Egypt instead.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E

The optimal power allocation {{can be achieved by}} a multilevel water-filling over the parallel channels, which is an extension of Gallager's 1968 water-filling strategy for single-user parallel Gaussian channels [11]. Some other studies have considered parallel broadcast channels in which simultaneous common and independent messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [5, 12, 13], or simultaneous common and confidential messages <b>are</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receivers [14].|$|R

5|$|Maximus {{may have}} {{remained}} in Rome, because he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may {{have been written by}} Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Capital.|$|E

However, Japan surrendered in August 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The division returned to the US two days after the surrender. All of its combat elements, as well as the Special Troops Battalion, were demobilized and deactivated on 30 November 1945, at Camp Carson, Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials for}} Petropavlovsk were {{scheduled}} to begin sometime in late 1941, {{and according to the}} training program, the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials. It was decided that Soviet officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941, and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials. German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine-room personnel. At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk, the relevant German training and technical manuals would <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Navy, albeit in German only.|$|E
