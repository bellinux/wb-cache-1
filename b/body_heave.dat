40|$|This paper {{presents}} the derivation {{of a full}} vehicle model which consists of ride, handling and tyre subsystems to study vehicle dynamics behaviour in the lateral direction. The full vehicle model is then validated experimentally using an instrumented experimental vehicle based on steering wheel input from the driver. Three types of vehicle dynamics test were performed for model validation, namely step steer, slalom and double lane change tests. The validation {{results show that the}} behaviours of the model are similar to the real vehicle with acceptable error. An Active Roll Control (ARC) suspension system was developed using the validated full vehicle model to reduce unwanted vehicle motions during steering input manoeuvres such as body roll angle, body roll rate, vertical acceleration of the body and <b>body</b> <b>heave.</b> The proposed controller for the ARC system is a combination of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control with roll moment rejection loop. The results of the study show that the proposed control structure signifi cantly improves the dynamics performance of the vehicle during step steer, slalom and double lane change manoeuvres compared with a passive vehicle system. The additional roll moment rejection loop is found to be able to further improve the performance of the PID ARC system. The effectiveness of the ARC system with the proposed control was also proven experimentally using the instrumented experimental vehicle...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} predict passing vessel interaction forces, different simulation tools {{have been developed}} over the years. Many of these {{are based on a}} double body flow approach. MARIN (a hydrodynamic research institute located in the Netherlands) developed a simulation tool called the FlowInteraction (FI) module, {{which is part of the}} modular hydrodynamic simulation tool aNySIM. This module is based on double body flow theory – new is that it takes bodymotions into account in the force interaction. This is done by solving the equations of motion at every time step. The FImodule has been verified and validated during this research. An assessment was made of whether the physics in the FI module has been implemented correctly. To do this, verification and validation case studies have been done. The verification case studies have been evaluated based on expectations from the implemented physics and mathematics. Unexplainable results suggesting an incorrect implementation have been analyzed and used to draw conclusions. As validation material, a set of results from model tests done during the ROPES joint industry project has been used. When the added mass force is neglected (as it is in the FI module) during a single <b>body</b> <b>heave</b> oscillation, cushion forces are dominant. This leads to a positive netmean force, which does not correspond with reality. Therefore, in order to simulate realistic behaviour, the added mass force should be included. Some numerical and discretization errors, due to the additional functionality of taking the body motions into account, are recognized. Based on these findings, recommendations on how to solve these problems are made. It has been concluded that a double body flow model, as implemented in the FI module, only provides good force estimations when the added mass force is implemented. The usability is currently restricted to the simulation of captive ships; radiation forces can then be neglected without consequence. The FI module enables a fast hydrodynamic time domain simulation taking the influence of body motions on the interaction forces into account.

This can be obtained by an oscillating body as explained above. Alternatively, wave generation by oscillatory displacement of water can be obtained, for instance, by an oscillating water column (OWC) in a fixed chamber having an opening into the sea. It is also possible to enclose the water by blocking the chamber opening with an elastic or flexible bag, which can oscillate under wave action. In such a case sea water in the chamber is not necessary; it can simply be replaced by air in which the pressure oscillates in step with the motion of the flexible bag.

40|$|Abstract: Two phase-control {{methods for}} maximizing {{converted}} energy, optimum reactive control and sub-optimum latching control, are compared, and also numerically discussed for a heaving semisubmerged sphere. For a sphere of 10 m diameter and an incident sinusoidal wave of 9 s period and 0. 5 m elevation amplitude, the maximum time-average absorbed power is 172 kW, 137 kW, and 24 kW for {{the cases of}} reactive control, latching control, and no phase control, respectively. With latching control, the need for reversing energy flow, during parts of each heave cycle, is avoided. For a more practically shaped axisymmetric body, a cylinder with a hemispherical bottom, numerical results for the radiation resistance are quantitatively com-pared with experimental results, by application of approximate semi-empirical elementary function formulae. Performed laboratory model experiments with such an axisymmetric <b>body,</b> which <b>heave</b> resonates {{with a wave of}} frequency 1. 1 Hz, demonstrate that, compared to no phase control, latching control results in an appreciable increase of energy capture from waves of frequency 0. 75 Hz and 0. 5 Hz.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{feasibility}} of wave electricity production in Italian seas is investigated through {{the implementation of a}} variant of the Seabased point absorber WEC. A numerical model of the coupled buoy-generator system is presented, which simulates the behavior of the WEC under different significant wave heights and periods. The WEC scheme is an improvement of the modeling of a three-body device, taking into account several aspects (independence among the <b>bodies,</b> <b>heave</b> and surge) ignored in previous studies for simplification of the scheme. One WEC composed by three bodies is simulated, with two different hydrodynamic numerical model schemes: a floating buoy and a submerged sphere placed at 25 meters below the water surface. The third body is the translator of the linear generator, which is located at the sea bottom and attached to the submerged sphere by a steel wire [...] For the hydrodynamic numerical model, the two bodies are allowed to move independently; heave and surge modes have been taken into account. The first scheme consists in the modeling with only three degrees of freedom, one per body only in the vertical direction (heave) and the other with five degrees of freedom, adding the horizontal component of movement for the buoy and the submerged body (surge). The results are compared with previous results of a WEC modeled as a single body system, with only one degree of freedom along the vertical axis. Preliminary results show that the produced energy in a simplified 1 DoF scheme is higher than results produced by the 3 DoF scheme, and is then approximately equal for the 5 DoF. The power matrixes present similar shapes.

It was three o'clock, and the old cook, as usual, asleep in an armchair, with her apron thrown up between her face and the fire. What would Cookie say if she knew? In that oven she had been allowed to bake in fancy perfect little doll loaves, while Cookie baked them in reality. Here she had watched the mysterious making of pink cream, had burned countless 'goes' of toffy, and cocoanut ice; and tasted all kinds of loveliness. Dear old Cookie! Stealing about on tiptoe, seeking what she might devour, she found four small jam tarts and ate them, while the cook snored softly. Then, by the table, that looked so like a great loaf-platter, she stood contemplating cook. Old darling, with her fat, pale, crumply face! Hung to the dresser, opposite, was a little mahogany looking-glass tilted forward. Nedda could see herself almost down to her toes. 'I mean to be prettier than I am!' she thought, putting her hands on her waist. 'I wonder if I can pull them in a bit!' Sliding her fingers under her blouse, she began to pull at certain strings. They would not budge. They were loose, yes, really too comfortable. She would have to get the next size smaller! And dropping her chin, she rubbed it on the lace edging of her chest, where it felt warm and smelled piny. Had Cookie ever been in love? Her gray hairs were coming, poor old duck!

Inertia dominated wave forces are typical of those encountered by a 21 inch diameter, torpedo shaped underwater vehicle operating in coastal waters and sea state 2. Strip theory is used to develop transfer function phase and magnitude between surface water waves and the slender <b>body</b> pitch, <b>heave,</b> and surge forces and moment for the vehicle in head seas, and for pitch, heave, yaw, and sway forces and moments in beam seas. Experiments are conducted which verify this method of transfer function calculation, and demonstrate the effects of vehicle forward motion in the head seas case. Using known sea spectra and linear time invariant systems theory allows for estimation of the water wave disturbance spectra for these forces and moments. Application of sliding control techniques are then developed for the underwater vehicle longitudinal plane equations of motion. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the dependence of underwater vehicle depth control upon the pitch control, and adaptive pitch control is shown to provide good performance in the presence of substantial parametric uncertainty. Pitch disturbance rejection properties of variations of the sliding controller are investigated. Both single frequency and stochastic disturbances are used, and the stochastic disturbance is developed using the results of the earlier investigation. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|A spar-type {{floating}} substructure that {{is being}} widely used for offshore wind power generation is vulnerable to resonance in the heave direction because of its small water plane area. For this reason, the stable dynamic response of this floating structure should be ensured by accurately identifying the resonance characteristics.

First, the nonlinear equations of motion with two degrees of freedom are derived by assuming that the floating substructure is a rigid <b>body,</b> where the <b>heaving</b> motion and pitching motions are coupled. Moreover, to identify the characteristics of the combination resonance, the nonlinear term in the nonlinear equations is approximated up to the second order using the Taylor series expansion. Furthermore, the validity of the approximate model is confirmed through a comparison with the results of a numerical analysis which is made by applying the commercial software ANSYS AQWA to the full model.

40|$|This thesis investigates wave loading on {{bodies in}} the free surface using {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics (SPH). This includes wave loading on fixed bodies, waves generated by <b>heaving</b> <b>bodies</b> in still water and the heave response of a body in waves, representing a wave energy device. SPH is a flexible Lagrangian technique for CFD simulations, which in principle applies to steep and breaking waves without special treatment allowing us to simulate highly nonlinear and potentially violent flows encountered in a real sea. However few detailed tests have been undertaken even with small amplitude waves. This research uses the open-source SPH code SPHysics. First two forms of SPH formulation, standard SPH with artificial viscosity and SPH-Arbitrary Lagrange Euler (ALE) with a Riemann solver, are used to simulate progressive waves in a 2 -D tank. The SPH-ALE formulation with a symplectic time integration scheme and cubic spline kernel is found to model progressive waves with negligible dissipation whereas with the standard SPH formulation waves decay markedly along the tank. We then consider two well-defined test cases in two dimensions: progressive waves interacting with a fixed cylinder and waves generated by a heaving semi-immersed cylinder. To reduce computer time in a simple manner a variable particle mass distribution is tested with fine resolution near the body and coarse resolution further away, while maintaining a uniform kernel size. A mass ratio of 1 : 4 proved effective but increasing to 1 : 16 caused particle clumping and instability. For wave loading on a half-submerged cylinder the agreement with the experimental data of Dixon et al. (1979) for the root mean square force is within 2 %. For more submerged cases, the results show some discrepancy, but this was also found with other modelling approaches. For the heaving cylinder, SPH results for the far field wave amplitude and vertical force on the cylinder show good agreement with the data of Yu and Ursell (1961). The variable mass distribution leads to a computer run time speedup of nearly 200 % in these cases on a single CPU. The results of the vertical force and wave amplitude are shown to be quite sensitive {{to the value of}} the slope limiter in the Riemann solver for the 2 -D heaving cylinder problem. A heaving 2 -D wedge or 3 -D cone whose oscillatory vertical motion is prescribed as the elevation of a focused wave group is a precise test case for numerical free-surface schemes. We consider two forms of repulsive boundary condition (Monaghan;Kos, 1999, and Rogers et al., 2008) and particle boundary force (Kajtar and Monaghan, 2009) for the 2 -D wedge case, comparing the result with the experimental data of Drake et al. (2009). The repulsive boundary condition was more effective than the particle boundary force method. Variable particle mass with different kernel sizes was then tested for 2 -D problems for mass ratios of 1 : 4, 1 : 16 and 1 : 4 : 16 with satisfactory results without particle clumping and instability. For the 3 -D cone case, SPH reproduces the experimental results very closely for the lower frequency tested where there is no separation from the bottom surface of the body but for the higher frequencies the magnitudes of force minima were underestimated. The mass ratios of 1 : 8 and 1 : 8 : 27 in two and three nested regions are tested for the 3 -D cone problem where a computer run time speedup of nearly 500 % is achieved on 16 processors for the mass ratio of 1 : 8. Finally, the floating <b>body</b> of a <b>heaving</b> wave energy device known as the Manchester Bobber is modelled in extreme waves without power take-off. The results for a single float are in approximate agreement with the experiment. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEPSRCGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
