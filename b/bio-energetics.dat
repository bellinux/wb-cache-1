He introduced the discipline of palynology to South Africa in a 1951 article in the [...] "South African Archaeological Bulletin". He stressed that global temperature variations were the primary cause of profound environmental changes, and that a study of fossil pollen would produce a wealth of information about palaeoenvironments.In this regard he worked at several sites in southern and eastern Africa with J. Desmond Clark, extending the scope of his research to include the Sahara and Namib deserts and the sub-Antarctic islands of Prince Edward and Marion. In 1965 he arranged the first major research expedition to these islands made up of an international team of 35 specialists who studied palynology, glacial geology, vulcanology, limnology, mineral cycling and <b>bio-energetics.</b> The results were published in a 1971 monograph.|$|E

The trait of utilizing CO is spread among a diverse group of microorganisms, including members of bacteria as well as archaea. Over the last decade this metabolism has gained interest due to the potential of converting CO rich gas, such as synthesis gas, into bio-based products. Three main types of fermentative CO metabolism can be distinguished: hydrogenogenesis, methanogenesis and acetogenesis, generating hydrogen, methane and acetate, respectively. Here, we review the current knowledge on these three variants of microbial CO metabolism with an emphasis on the potential enzymatic routes and <b>bio-energetics</b> involved...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how prey capture {{rates are}} {{influenced}} by feeding ecology and environmental conditions is fundamental to assessing anthropogenic impacts on marine higher predators. We compared how prey capture rates varied in relation to prey size, prey patch distribution and prey density for two species of alcid, common guillemot (Uria aalge) and razorbill (Alca torda) during the chick-rearing period. We developed a Monte Carlo approach parameterised with foraging behaviour from birdborne data loggers, observations of prey fed to chicks, and adult diet from wateroffloading, to construct a <b>bio-energetics</b> model. Our primary goal was to estimate prey capture rates, and a secondary aim was to test responses {{to a set of}} biologically plausible environmental scenarios. Estimated prey capture rates were 1. 5 ± 0. 8 items per dive (0. 8 ± 0. 4 and 1. 1 ± 0. 6 items per minute foraging and underwater, respectively) for guillemots and 3. 7 ± 2. 4 items per dive (4. 9 ± 3. 1 and 7. 3 ± 4. 0 items per minute foraging and underwater, respectively) for razorbills. Based on species' ecology, diet and flight costs, we predicted that razorbills would be more sensitive to decreases in 0 - group sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) length (prediction 1), but guillemots would be more sensitive to prey patches that were more widely spaced (prediction 2), and lower in prey density (prediction 3). Estimated prey capture rates increased non-linearly as 0 - group sandeel length declined, with the slope being steeper in razorbills, supporting prediction 1. When prey patches were more dispersed, estimated daily energy expenditure increased by a factor of 3. 0 for guillemots and 2. 3 for razorbills, suggesting guillemots were more sensitive to patchier prey, supporting prediction 2. However, both species responded similarly to reduced prey density (guillemot expenditure increased by 1. 7; razorbill by 1. 6), thus not supporting prediction 3. This <b>bio-energetics</b> approach complements other foraging models in predicting likely impacts of environmental change on marine higher predators dependent on species-specific foraging ecologies...|$|E
40|$|American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) are {{two species}} of migratory thrushes that breed in Northwest Indiana but {{historically}} are uncommonly present during the winter season (November 1 - March 1). These trends have changed recently, and both species are seen more abundantly during the winter. Recently invaded non-native fruiting plants continue to provide nutrients for the birds throughout the winter and {{may contribute to the}} increased avian populations during that time. To measure the effect these food sources contribute to thrush wintering habits, we created an agent-based computer model to simulate the birds 2 ̆ 7 movement in Northwest Indiana along with their food consumption {{over the course of the}} winter season.

Cyclic or pseudo-cyclic pathways include the PSI-driven cyclic electron transport, the cytochrome b 6 /f plastoquinone cycle and the oxygen-dependent water/water cycle. Side pathways altogether make up the chlororespiratory pathway, including the non-photochemical, NAD(P) H-dependent plastoquinone reduction by chloroplastic dehydrogenases and plastoquinol oxidation by a putative chloroplastic oxidase.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, Hawaiian spinner {{dolphins}} have become a species of interest for both scientists and tourists alike. Spinner dolphins can be found resting in the bays of coastal Hawaii almost daily, and their habits have been noted by the burgeoning ecotourism industry and increased human presence. While no in depth studies have been performed on the dolphin populations, these increased interactions have researchers concerned about {{the vulnerability of the}} dolphin population. Dukas & Clark (1995) hypothesize that a key unexplored factor in animal health is vigilance level, or the ability of the animal to process complex patterns such as foraging or detecting predators based on the amount of rest they are able to obtain. As the lifestyle of spinner dolphins puts them at extreme risk for lowered vigilance levels, the equations put forward in the article were used to create a <b>bio-energetics</b> model that would illustrate its potential effects on their ability to capture prey and evade predators. While short-term vigilance loss {{does not appear to be}} significantly damaging to the dolphin’s ability to feed and protect itself, a long-term loss may greatly affect a spinner dolphin’s overall health. These findings indicate that the current human presence in the bays during the spinner dolphins’ resting hours has the potential to detrimentally affect their health and consequently their population numbers and should serve as a starting point for further vigilance based research...|$|E
40|$|Temperature affects most {{physiological}} processes {{which in}} turn impact animal behaviour and ecology. In ectotherms, both short- and long-term variations in temperature impact physiological (i. e. locomotor and metabolic capacity) and ecological (i. e. body condition and growth) performance and thus affect survival. It is therefore critical to understand the mechanisms driving these relationships. Here, we investigated the impact of seasonally changing temperature on the ecological and physiological performance of juvenile free-ranging largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis) in its riverine nursery in North Western Australia. Animal-attached accelerometers, revealed that despite a 10 °C increase in temperature, sawfish were active and displayed substantial burst-swimming capacity. Physiological performance, as ascertained by locomotory capacity, increased in the warmer late dry season conditions, whereas timing and duration of activity did not. Contrary to the physiological performance, late season sawfish were poorer condition that those in the early season. Activity was primarily crepuscular, irrespective of the season. This suggests that even though locomotory performance of juvenile sawfish increased at greater temperature, foraging activity and thus energy intake was not sufficient to maintain body condition, resulting in declining growth. Contrary to popular belief, seeking warmer temperatures can represent a disadvantage for juveniles under certain scenarios. Especially for individuals that are intake limited, greater temperatures and associated metabolic rates are disadvantageous and can result in lower growth rates and potentially starvation. Physiological and ecological performances may thus respond differently to warming temperatures, emphasizing that ‘optimal’ temperatures may be highly context dependent. Ecological scenarios responsible for mediating growth performance are discussed and integrated into a classic <b>bio-energetics</b> framework...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cancer is an {{intricate}} disorder/dysfunction of cells {{that can be}} defined as a genetic heterogeneity in human disease. Therefore, it is characterized by several adaptive complex hallmarks. Among them, the pH dysregulation appears as a symbol of aberrant functions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). In comparison with normal tissues, in the solid tumors, we face with an irregular acidification and alkalinization of the extracellular and intracellular fluids. Methods: In this study, we comprehensively discussed the most recent reports on the hallmarks of solid tumors to provide deep insights upon the molecular machineries involved in the pH dysregulation of solid tumors and their impacts on the initiation and progression of cancer. Results: The dysregulation of pH in solid tumors is fundamentally related to the Warburg effect and hypoxia, leading to expression of a number of molecular machineries, including: NHE 1, H+ pump V-ATPase, CA- 9, CA- 12, MCT- 1, GLUT- 1. Activation of proton exchangers and transporters (PETs) gives rise to formation of TME. This condition favors the cancer cells to evade from the anoikis and apoptosis, granting them aggressive and metastasis phenotype, as well as resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This review aimed to discuss the key molecular changes of tumor cells in terms of <b>bio-energetics</b> and cancer metabolism in relation with pH dysregulation. During this phenomenon, the intra- and extracellular metabolites are altered and/or disrupted. Such molecular alterations provide molecular hallmarks for direct targeting of the PETs by potent relevant inhibitors in combination with conventional cancer therapies as ultimate therapy against solid tumors. Conclusion: Taken all, along with other treatment strategies, targeting the key molecular machineries related to intra- and extracellular metabolisms within the TME is proposed as a novel strategy to inhibit or block PETs that are involved in the pH dysregulation of solid tumors...|$|E
40|$|France {{being the}} largest {{consumer}} of oysters in Europe, oyster farming is {{deeply rooted in}} French heritage. The Japanese oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is the oyster species the most exploited in France, and in the world. Due to filter-feeding, these bivalves are sensitive to toxic algal blooms. Although not always lethal, toxic algae can affect oyster physiology and make it unfit for human consumption. Phytoplankton toxins can be classified in several groups: amnesic, neurotoxic, diarrhetic and paralytic. For the latter group, saxitoxins are synthesized by the microalgae of genus Alexandrium that can accumulate bivalve tissues. In recent years, {{number of studies have}} been performed on the interactions between C. gigas and saxitoxins. In order to better understand these interactions, mathematical models have been developed but they did not allowed to describe accurately the kinetics of accumulation and detoxification of paralyzing toxins (PSTs). Models on DEB theory (Dynamic Energy Budget) (Kooijman, 2000) have been widely applied to the study of bivalve <b>bio-energetics.</b> This type of model already allowed to quantify growth and reproduction of C. gigas under different environmental forcing. These models have also been applied to study host-pathogen interactions (Flye-Sainte-Marie et al., 2009) and kinetics of accumulation and detoxification of contaminants (Bodiguel et al., 2009; Echinger et al., 2010). The aim of this PhD work is to develop a model based on DEB theory, that describes the interactions between PSTs and oysters. Indeed, different effects of PSTs contamination on oyster physiology have been shown. For example, paralytic toxins alter the immune response (overproduction and phagocytosis of hemocytes), behavior (modification of valve rhythms, production of pseudo-faeces) or organ integrity (myoatrophy, inflamed gills). In this PhD project, we will focus first on describing the accumulation and detoxification kinetics of PSTs in C. gigas and second on quantifying the effects of PSTs on the physiology of C. gigas...|$|E

40|$|Macroautophagy (hereafter called ‘autophagy’) is a {{cellular}} process for degrading and recycling cellular constituents, and for maintenance of cell function. Autophagy initiates via vesicular engulfment of cellular materials and culminates in their degradation via lysosomal hydrolases, {{with the whole}} process often being termed ‘autophagic flux’. Autophagy is a multi-step pathway requiring the interplay of numerous scaffolding and signalling molecules. In particular, orthologs {{of the family of}} ∼ 30 autophagy-regulating (Atg) proteins that were first characterised in yeast play essential roles in the initiation and processing of autophagic vesicles in mammalian cells. The serine/threonine kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a master regulator of the canonical autophagic response of cells to nutrient starvation. In addition, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key sensor of cellular energy status, can trigger autophagy by inhibiting mTOR, or by phosphorylating other downstream targets. Calcium (Ca 2 +) has been implicated in autophagic signalling pathways encompassing both mTOR and AMPK, as well as in autophagy seemingly not involving these kinases. Numerous studies have shown that cytosolic Ca 2 + signals can trigger autophagy. Moreover, introduction of an exogenous chelator to prevent cytosolic Ca 2 + signals inhibits autophagy in response to many different stimuli, with suggestions that buffering Ca 2 + affects not only the triggering of autophagy, but also proximal and distal steps during autophagic flux. Observations such as these indicate that Ca 2 + plays an essential role as a pro-autophagic signal. However, cellular Ca 2 + signals can exert anti-autophagic actions too. For example, Ca 2 + channel blockers induce autophagy due to the loss of autophagy-suppressing Ca 2 + signals. In addition, the sequestration of Ca 2 + by mitochondria during physiological signalling appears necessary to maintain cellular <b>bio-energetics,</b> thereby suppressing AMPK-dependent autophagy. This article attempts to provide an integrated overview of the evidence for the proposed roles of various Ca 2 + signals, Ca 2 + channels and Ca 2 + sources in controlling autophagic flux...|$|E
40|$|B-cell {{lymphoma}} 2 (Bcl- 2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-Xl) {{are major}} anti-apoptotic proteins, {{members of the}} Bcl- 2 family, which have {{a key role in}} the regulation of cell-fate decisions. Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl share all four B-cell homology (BH 1 - 4) domains, with an N-terminal BH 4 domain and a hydrophobic cleft formed by the BH 3 -BH 2 -BH 1 domains. Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl also possess a C-terminal trans-membrane domain (TMD), which is responsible for their targeting at different intracellular membranes like mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or even nuclear membrane. In addition to opposing the pro-apoptotic members, thereby preventing their activation and subsequent cell death, Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl execute their anti-apoptotic functions by regulating Ca 2 + signals. Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl emerged as direct functional regulators of the IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R), the main intracellular Ca 2 +-release channel. Bcl- 2 appears to function as an inhibitor of IP 3 R channel, suppressing pro-apoptotic Ca 2 +-release events mediated by IP 3 R. Depending on its concentration, Bcl-Xl can function as a sensitizer or inhibitor of IP 3 R channel. At low concentrations, Bcl-Xl sensitizes IP 3 R activity, which results in boosted mitochondrial metabolism and <b>bio-energetics,</b> while when present at high concentrations, Bcl-Xl inhibits IP 3 R activity, suppressing Ca 2 +-mediated apoptosis. An increasing body of data suggests that the complex modulation of IP 3 Rs by Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl proteins relies on multi-domain interactions. To date, 2 different IP 3 R regions have been identified as target sites for Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl. Via its BH 4 domain, Bcl- 2 binds to the Domain 3 of IP 3 R, which is located in the central, modulatory domain. This interaction is considered as the driving force for the inhibition of IP 3 R activity by Bcl- 2. Bcl- 2 was also proposed to target the C-terminus of IP 3 R, but this remained poorly understood. Bcl-Xl was shown to interact with the same domains like Bcl- 2, Domain 3 and C-terminus. Recently, it was reported that Bcl-Xl engages its hydrophobic cleft and to target the C-terminus of IP 3 R, but the binding determinants in Bcl-Xl/Domain 3 complex are still under investigation. Previously, we showed that while Bcl- 2 targets with similar efficiency the Domain 3 and the C-terminus of IP 3 R, Bcl-Xl shows preferences for the C-terminus. Here, we demonstrated that in contrast to Bcl-Xl, the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl- 2 does not contribute to the binding to and regulation of IP 3 R. We revealed an interaction between the Bcl- 2 ’s TMD and the C-terminus of IP 3 R, which was critical for an efficient IP 3 R inhibition and protection against Ca 2 +-mediated apoptosis by Bcl- 2. Furthermore, we identified the ligand-binding domain of IP 3 R as a novel interaction partner of Bcl- 2 and in particular, of its BH 4 domain. We observed a mutual antagonism between Bcl- 2 /BH 4 domain and the ligand, IP 3 which were able to disrupt each other’s interaction with the ligand-binding domain. We anticipate that such an interaction might serve as a parallel or additional mechanism of IP 3 R inhibition by Bcl- 2, thereby revealing an additional layer of regulation where the level of agonist stimulation modulates the inhibitory function of Bcl- 2. Finally, we confirmed the important role of the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-Xl for IP 3 R regulation and identified another candidate for molecular determinant, involved in this complex. We showed that the Lys 87, located in the BH 3 domain, but outside of the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-Xl, contributes to Bcl-Xl binding to IP 3 R and to the regulation of the channel. In conclusion, we present a model where the 2 very similar anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl- 2 and Bcl-Xl, target the same domains in IP 3 R, but with different efficiencies and engaging distinct binding determinants, thereby resulting in a differential regulation of the IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2 + signals. status: publishe...|$|E
