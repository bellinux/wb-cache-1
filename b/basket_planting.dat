50|$|Aeschynanthus speciosus, {{also known}} as the <b>Basket</b> <b>plant,</b> is a species of {{flowering}} plant in the family Gesneriaceae. There are many species of Aeschynanthus, all of which have long, trailing stems and bright flowers. The large, fleshy, dark green leaves are up to 4 in long and 1+1/2 in wide and are arranged in groups along the stems. The flowers can be as long as 4 in and grow in clusters that usually consist of 6-20 flowers. Most of the time they are shaded in different colors, from orange-yellow in the lower area to orange-red at the tip with a blotched red inside and a yellow streaked throat.|$|R

50|$|The {{red color}} of the crown is {{symbolic}} of the “red land”, arid desert land that surrounded the fertile “black land” of Kemet. The curlicue of the crown is symbolic of the proboscis, or stinger, of the honey bee. The crown was woven, like a <b>basket,</b> of <b>plant</b> fiber, perhaps grass, straw, palm leaf, or reed. It is theorized that it was passed down from king to king instead of being buried with each king, which might explain why no actual deshret has been found.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} deshret (red crown), no {{example of the}} white crown has been found. It is unknown how it was {{constructed}} and what materials were used. Felt or leather have been suggested, but this is purely speculative. Like the deshret, the hedjet may have been woven like a <b>basket</b> from <b>plant</b> fiber such as grass, straw, palm leaf, or reed. The fact that no crown has ever been found, even in relatively intact royal tombs {{such as that of}} Tutankhamun, suggests the crowns may have been passed from one regent to the next, much as in present-day monarchies.|$|R
40|$|Copper hydroxide-treated {{surfaces}} {{are commonly used}} to control roots in horticultural production systems, although the particulars of Cu movement from the treated surface are largely unknown. The rate and temporal pattern of Cu mobility from in-ground Cu-treated growing baskets, {{and the fate of}} this Cu, was studied. In a field experiment involving Acer platanoides, an alternative Cu formulation consisting of Cu metal powder was determined to move slightly more slowly from the basket fabric than Cu(OH) 2 over the first season while providing adequate root control. Addition of Glomus intraradices inoculum to the basket system increased the mobility of Cu metal and had no effect on Cu(OH) 2. This suggests that VAM fungi can actively solubilize Cu metal. These results also confirm that the chemistry of the Cu, possibly in addition to the chemistry of the resin, determines Cu movement from the treated surface. The fate of Cu from in-ground <b>baskets</b> <b>planted</b> with Acer jinnala was elucidated in a second field experiment. After one field season, the majority of Cu initially on the basket fabric had been deposited in the soil both in- and outside the basket. While Cu recovered in leachate represented {{only a tiny fraction of}} basket Cu, the concentration of Cu in leachate exceeded acceptable limits in the majority of samples. This indicates that the use of Cu(OH) 2 -treated baskets in the field may have a negative impact on groundwater quality...|$|R

Modern and presumably ancient hunter-gatherer populations, despite a high-fat, high-protein diet, were free of the signs and symptoms of noncommunicable diseases — a paradox. Perhaps energy needs were not always met, thus keeping body sizes in check; also, the relative lack of salt and simple carbohydrates, a mix of saturated and good fats, plenty of fiber, abundant micronutrients, a vigorous and active life, and less stress than we now endure may explain this finding...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{mechanical}} {{cotton picker}} is a machine that automates cotton harvesting {{in a way that}} reduces harvest time and maximizes efficiency. To develop a {{mechanical cotton picker}} with the intent on replacing manual labor. The first pickers were only capable of harvesting one row of cotton at a time, but were still able to replace up to forty hand laborers The current cotton picker is a self-propelled machine that removes cotton lint and seed (seed-cotton) users rows of barbed spindles that rotate at high speed and remove the seed-cotton from the plant. The seed-cotton is then removed from the spindles by a counter-rotating doffer and is then blown up into the <b>basket</b> the <b>plant</b> at up to six rows at a time. The picker or spindle type machine was designed to pick the open cotton from the bolls using spindles, fingers, or prongs, without injuring the plant's foliage and unopened bolls.

40|$|The artwork on {{the arched}} windows of Hull Paragon station’s {{entrance}} {{is inspired by}} the "Transmigration" phenomenon in Hull. Between 1848 and 1914, more than 2 million people arrived into the city by ship from mainland Europe, and left by train for the ports of Liverpool and Southampton. They {{were on their way}} to take ships to a new life, particularly in the United States of America. This mass movement of people through and across Hull, many staying in the city only for a few hours, ended abruptly with the outbreak of WW 1. The designs on the windows explore the notion that skills migrate along the transport routes, as well as people, their hopes and expectations. Many of the migrants used traditional baskets to take their belongings on their journey, and there are a number of basket weaving patterns and skills now present in North America that can be traced back to northern Europe. The images also make reference to other elements that interweave with this history – the materials that make the <b>baskets,</b> the <b>plants</b> and seeds that also migrate along the train tracks, and the final destination of the people who passed through the station during that time. The site of the artwork is a place where the constant moving of people today mirrors the weaving process which creates textiles and baskets – the action of layers crossing over layers, creating new patterns every time people enter and exit the building...|$|R

While yam production issues have been stressed on agronomical practices, a research study carried out on the economic efficiency of this crop grown in this region with small farm holdings, which is labour-intensive, reveals that land, labour and material (fertilizers and chemicals), credit and extension services inputs have a significant bearing on the yield of yam in the region.|$|R
40|$|Willow {{is often}} used in {{bio-energy}} plantations for its potential {{to function as a}} renewable energy source, but knowledge about its effect on soil carbon dynamics is limited. Therefore, we investigated the temporal variation in carbon dynamics in willow, focusing on below-ground allocation and sequestration to soil carbon pools. <b>Basket</b> willow <b>plants</b> (Salix viminalis L.) in their second year of growth were grown in pots in a greenhouse. At five times during the plants growth, namely 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 months after breaking winter dormancy, a subset of the plants were continuously labelled with 14 CO 2 in an ESPAS growth chamber for 28 days. After the labelling, the plants were harvested and separated into leaves, first and second year stems and roots. The soil was analysed for total C and 14 C content as well as soil microbial biomass. Immediately after breaking dormancy, carbon stored in the first year stems was relocated to developing roots and leaves. Almost half the newly assimilated C was used for leaf development the first month of growth, dropping to below 15 n the older plants. Within the second month of growth, secondary growth of the stem became the largest carbon sink in the system, and remained so for the older age classes. Between 31 and 41 f the recovered 14 C was allocated to below-ground pools. While the fraction of assimilated 14 C in roots and root soil respiration did not vary with plant age, the amount allocated to soil and soil microbial biomass increased in the older plants, indicating an increasing rhizodeposition. The total amount of soil microbial biomass was 30 arger in the oldest age class than in an unplanted control soil. The results demonstrate a close linkage between photosynthesis and below-ground carbon dynamics. Up to 13 f the microbial biomass consisted of carbon assimilated by the willows within the past 4 weeks, up to 11 f the recovered 14 C was found as soil organic matte...|$|R
