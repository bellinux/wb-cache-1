6000|$|... "Who'll {{have some}} coffee?" [...] cried Phil, {{coming up with}} a pot of the {{steaming}} beverage. [...] "I've got to strain it through the corner of a napkin, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> won't hurt it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Gregson," [...] {{said the}} American, looking across at the official, [...] "I don't {{know what your}} British point of view may be, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> in New York this lady's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A few dents, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is all," [...] {{answered}} Dick, after {{a look at}} {{both the}} car he was driving and the one run by his brother. [...] "We'll let those go, for {{we are on a}} tour and have no time to waste here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can swap a good yarn; kind of handy man and {{sometimes}} helps {{me with the}} hammer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> {{all there is to}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{took you}} {{a long time}} to get here, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> just as well," [...] spoke up a smooth, suave voice with a ring in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've got him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> not {{all they}} mean," [...] said Devine. [...] "Whatever {{was wrong with}} it, he has fixed the thing. They've beaten the cañon. The sling's working." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blue grouse!" [...] said Harry disgustedly {{aside to}} Frank. [...] "It's the nesting season, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> wouldn't count for much with them." [...] He {{turned to his}} host. [...] "I'm not a heathen. Savvy cook American? Got any flour you can make {{biscuits}} or flapjacks of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a {{scrap of}} paper, not a dollar; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> wasn't always the case with him--you can see it by his face," [...] he said. Then he laughed. [...] "He's {{probably}} like a good many more of us--not very anxious to let folks know where he came from." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know {{ever and}} ever {{so much more}} than I did when I first came to you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> after all I know very little of all there is to know," [...] said he shyly, which shows that Peter really had learned a great deal. Then he started for the dear Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip.|$|E
6000|$|The skipper laughed grimly. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that's quite simple. Get out of this, {{and head}} her south {{just as soon}} as we can, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> not quite what you mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I forgot," [...] {{said the}} chief clerk. [...] "I {{thought it was}} the Indian Massacre, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> for to-morrow. Go {{straight}} {{to the end of the}} street and turn left about half a mile and you'll find the boys down there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! Not {{sure about}} the rest of it <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> what you and all the other discontented young women really want: some {{stranger}} kissing your hand!" [...] At Carol's gasp, the old squirrel-like Vida darted out and cried, [...] "Oh, my dear, don't take that too seriously. I just meant----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said March, [...] "I've {{often been}} glad that I {{was not a}} girl, on that account. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> on general {{principles}} Beaton is not more in love than she is. I couldn't imagine that young man being more in love with anybody, unless it was himself. He might be more in love with himself than any one else was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No use {{in all of}} us getting wet," [...] he said. [...] "I don't {{think the}} damage amounts to much. A mud-guard is bent and the hood is {{scratched}} and the glass broken, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is all. But we'll have to get the limb from under the car before we can go ahead again," [...] he added, after an inspection.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, it isn't {{as bad as}} that. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, that's all. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> {{will wear}} away, sooner or later. You see, I've been {{studying}} hard the last three days, {{trying to make up}} for lost time, and that is what's done it. I think I'll take it a bit easier after this, until I feel more like myself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on {{the record}} to Tom Roland in The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits, Harlan Howard said, [...] "Ive never written a song that moves people so much. Ive had guys tell me they almost wrecked their truck when they heard it cause it made them cry. I {{had a lot of}} {{delightful}} records in many different languages on <b>that</b> song, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>thats</b> probably my favorite song as far as impact is concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} double people, Cavaliere," [...] Rowland said, [...] "and I don't {{pretend to}} understand you. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> have <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> {{you are going}} to play some secret card." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the photography for which Cohen is known is shot in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area (also known as the Wyoming Valley), a historic industrialized region of northeastern Pennsylvania. Characteristically Cohen photographs people close-up, using a wide-angle lens and a flashgun, mostly in black and white, frequently cropping their heads from the frame, concentrating on small details. He has used 21 mm, 28 mm and 35 mm focal length, wide-angle, lenses and later on 50 mm. Cohen has described his method as 'intrusive'; [...] "They're not easy pictures. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> why they're mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] nodded Paul. [...] "That's {{the beauty}} of dream-people [...] . they stay any age you want them. You and my {{beautiful}} teacher and me myself are the only folks {{in the world that}} I know of that have dream-people. Isn't it funny and nice we should all know each other? <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> kind of people always find each other out. Grandma never has dream-people and Mary Joe thinks I'm wrong in the upper story because I have them. But I think it's splendid to have them. YOU know, Miss Lavendar. Tell me all about your little dream-boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall also trail a maid, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> {{young woman}} will learn {{what it is}} to be left behind in half the cities of Europe before I have done with her. I always lose my maids. They are so much more passive and forgettable than luggage--abroad that is. And Justin usually in the old days used to {{remember}} about them. And his valet used to see after them,--a most attentive man. Justin cannot, he says, have his wife abroad with merely a companion; people would talk; maid it must be as well. And so in a week or less I shall start, unusually tailor-made, for South Germany and all that jolly country, companioned and maided. I shall tramp--on the feet God has given me--in stout boots. Miss Summersley Satchel marches, I understand, like the British infantry but on a vegetarian 'basis,'--fancy calling your nourishment a 'basis'!--the maid and so forth by Èilgut...." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the novel}} was published, {{the strangeness of}} the title {{attracted}} attention. Brodsky was quoted in a brief note in the New York Times: Ideally, you shouldn't say anything, but just visualize the asterisks. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> saying 'Three Asterisks' is O.K. quoted in Sarah Lyall ...|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not give}} her a chance to say, and she was willing to let him talk on, and tell her what he thought of Hatboro' himself. [...] "Well, it's like every other place in the world, at every moment of history--it's in a {{transition}} state. The theory is, you know, that most places are at a standstill the greatest part of the time; they haven't begun to move, or they've stopped moving; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> a mistake; they're moving all the while. I suppose Rome itself was in a transition state when you left?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> now {{and then}} [...] With Betty all was not so well, [...] And to the road she turns her ears, [...] And thence full many a sound she hears, [...] Which she to Susan will not tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "'There to the north. It follows on thy spoor. I saw it pass yesterday, <b>but</b> myself <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>that</b> thou wouldst be nigher to the mountain, {{and came}} this way, and found thee. To-morrow at the daybreak the slayers will be here.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Zappa {{expressed}} concern that despite his rich body of music, he {{was seen as a}} [...] "novelty" [...] artist through songs like [...] "Valley Girl" [...] and [...] "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow". At the time of the single's release, Moon said [...] "I am not a valley girl, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is my claim to fame".|$|E
5000|$|Irones was {{appointed}} mayor of San Diego on August 2, 1934 to finish out {{the term of}} John Forward, who resigned.The council wanted to appoint Vice Mayor Al Bennett, but he said [...] "I'm thoroughly disgusted with city politics. I don't want the mayor's appointment."Councilman Charles E. Anderson commented [...] "I was in hope some outstanding citizen...could be persuaded to accept the office, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is impossible."He said the council settled on Irones as a [...] "harmony" [...] move.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sometimes I take a pill to sleep, {{or two or}} six. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> {{is the way it}} goes - {{when you}} put three years into making an album, you also become a bit of an insomniac. I have always been more of a night person. I never lay vocals onto any song before eight or nine at night. I always work at night. I go to the studio at six or seven in the evening and leave again at six in the morning. So in a way the album was done by night." [...] —Enrique Iglesias told to The Insider about {{recording}} the album.|$|E
2500|$|JoJo {{describes}} Agápē as a [...] "labor of {{love from}} the heart without limits or boundaries." [...] In an interview with VibeVixen when describing the tape JoJo said [...] "I would say this is definitely the most cohesive body of work. It's more of an experience, there's more interludes," [...] she says. [...] "It'll kind of let you in on what's been happening in my personal life, my family. It really plays on me being from Massachusetts, me living in L.A. and finding myself in between those two worlds, not feeling like I necessarily belong anywhere, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> how most people feel in their 20s anyway." ...|$|R
5000|$|Admiral Ackbar ranked number 16 in 1998 {{list of the}} [...] "Top 20 Star Wars Characters" [...] {{featured}} in the magazine Star Wars Insider. Scott Chernoff, a writer for that magazine, called the character [...] "one of the most visually striking and memorable characters introduced in the final installment of the saga". Scott Chitwood of TheForce.net criticized the fact that Ackbar's death in The Unifying Force was so abrupt and only mentioned in passing by the characters: [...] "He deserved a little more attention. I {{would have liked to}} see him killed in action in the final battle, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> asking a lot of a sickly old Admiral." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cliff Ramshaw {{reviewed}} Sword and Crown for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Ramshaw {{comments that}} [...] "with a party this size things can become unwieldy, {{and the author}} suggests you use Birthright skirmish rules to resolve large-scale combats". [...] He notes that the adventure is [...] "all fairly straightforward to referee until the closing scene" [...] as it is [...] "suggested that a trial takes place, but no mechanism is provided", {{and the fact that}} [...] "the players will earn the enmity of {{one or the other of}} the noble houses ... seems a trifle unfair, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> just the risks of power politics".|$|R
5000|$|Some players {{support the}} new age limit. Gerald Green called it [...] "a smart move", saying that [...] "everybody is LeBron James ... He came in ready and he {{dominated}} the league. There's {{a lot of players}} that have to get developed. Me, I've got to get developed. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> age limit, that one year of college experience, can get you more developed and I think that's pretty good." [...] Others, however, strongly criticize the rule. Andrew Bynum said [...] "That's something I'll never understand. Because in no other business can the owner, or a stock trader or a C.E.O. of a company try to protect themselves by putting rules like that." [...] Former Florida Gators and current Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Billy Donovan believed that the rule made high schoolers feel like they were being punished.|$|E
5000|$|... "Still Alone" [...] was {{released}} to radio on October 16. From late October to mid-November, the group supported The Bravery on their US tour. This {{was followed by}} a headlining US tour, from mid-November to mid-December, with support from the Color Fred, Dear and the Headlights and Cassino. On December 9, it was announced that the band were dropped from Universal. Cooper explained that they [...] "did everything in our power to avoid the horrible situation we were put into, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> wasn't enough." [...] From late January to early March 2008, the band supported Bayside on their tour of the US. In April and May, the band went on the Get a Life Tour alongside the Used, Army of Me and the Street Drum Corps. In January 2009, the band's cover of the Nirvana track [...] "Drain You" [...] was made available for download.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the critics}} of Ashton's {{appointment}} came to concede her effectiveness in office. In September 2013, Peter Oborne, the chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph, wrote:Well, let’s admit we were all completely wrong. It is now obvious that Catherine Ashton has been a success. In her unobtrusive but determined way, she can boast real achievement. Last year a peace deal was struck between Serbia and Kosovo. Nobody had thought it possible. It was a massive step towards healing ancient hatreds and building economic prosperity. It was brokered by Baroness Ashton.... I have never met Baroness Ashton <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> one of her secrets is that she keeps her head down, does not flaunt her ego, and allows others to take the credit. It takes little imagination to envisage how a male politician {{from any of the}} main parties would have exploited the Kosovo peace-deal, or the Morsi visit. She just kept her head down and quietly got on with her job.|$|E

5000|$|On August 15 a video {{entitled}} [...] "Fuck the Police" [...] {{was posted}} online accompanying a song by Ceebo the Rapper. The song's lyrics state [...] "When they killed Ez' Ford, {{they should have}} killed me," [...] and described police as [...] "the enemy" [...] and [...] "KKK in the flesh." [...] On August 21 the Los Angeles Police Protective League (LAPPL) called for officers to be on heightened alert {{in response to the}} video. Ceebo the Rapper, a cousin of Ford, said [...] "There was never any intent the song to threaten any police or nothing. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that's</b> how they want to take it".|$|R
