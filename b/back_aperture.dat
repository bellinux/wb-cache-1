40|$|We {{present an}} optical system capable of {{generating}} stereoscopic images to track trapped particles in three dimensions. Two-dimensional particle tracking on each image yields three dimensional position information. Our approach allows {{the use of}} a high numerical aperture (NA= 1. 3) objective and large separation angle, such that particles can be tracked axially with resolution of 3 nm at 340 Hz. Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs), the diffractive elements used to steer and split laser beams in Holographic Optical Tweezers, are also capable of more general operations.

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for generating a multifocal spot array (MSA) {{with a high}} numerical aperture (NA) objective. The MSA is generated by using a special designed phase-only modulation at the <b>back</b> <b>aperture</b> of an objective. Without using any iteration algorithm, the modulated phase pattern is directly obtained by the simple analytical expressions based on the fractional Talbot effect. It is shown {{that the number of}} the spots in the focal region depends solely on the fractional Talbot parameter. By engineering the phase pattern with a large fractional Talbot parameter, a large number of focal spots can be created. Furthermore, the intensity distribution of each focal spot can be manipulated by introducing a composite spatially shifted vortex beam (CSSVB) as the incident field, leading to creation of various kinds of specific shaped spots. Consequently, the MSA composed of multiple individual spots with specific shape is created by focusing the CSSVB combined with the multifocal phase-only modulation. These kinds of MSAs may be found applications in parallel optical micromanipulation, multifocal multiphoton microscopic imaging, and parallel laser printing nanofabrication.

Temperature was maintained by heating the imaging objective lens and glass prism using objective heaters (MTC-HLS- 025 /TC-HLS- 025, Bioscience Tools, San Diego, CA). The imaging duration {{was less than}} 30 min. Transgenic Hues 6 cells expressing mEos 3 -HP 1 α were seeded on glass bottom dishes with phenol-red free TeSR 30 min prior to imaging. For 250 ml of colorless TeSR, 500 μl of FGF- 2, and 30 μl of TGFb 1 were added to prevent cell differentiation. To minimize adverse phototoxicity, 1 mW 405 nm laser was used to activate mEos 3 for 5 s, followed by bleach-and-blink acquisition using the 561 -nm laser at 40 mW for ~ 23 s with 4000 frames.

40|$|As a {{powerful}} and noninvasive tool, laser trapping has been widely applied for the confinement and physiological study of biological cells and organelles. Researchers have used the single spot laser trap to hold individual sperm and quantitatively evaluated the motile force generated by a sperm. Early studies revealed the relationship between sperm motility and swimming behavior and helped the investigations in medical aspects of sperm activity. As sperm chemotaxis draws more and more interest in fertilization research, the studies on sperm-egg communication may help to explain male or female infertility and provide exciting new approaches to contraception. However, single spot laser trapping can only be used to investigate an individual target, which has limits in efficiency and throughput. To study the chemotactic response of sperm to eggs and to characterize sperm motility, an annular laser trap with a diameter of several hundred microns is designed, simulated with ray tracing tool, and implemented. An axicon transforms the wavefront such that the laser beam is incident on the microscope objective from all directions while filling the <b>back</b> <b>aperture</b> completely for high efficiency trapping. A trapping experiment with microspheres is carried out to evaluate the system performance.

40|$|Laser axotomy {{followed}} by time-lapse microscopy is a sensitive assay for axon regeneration phenotypes in C. elegans 1. The main difficulty of this assay is the perceived cost ($ 25 - 100 K) and technical expertise required for implementing a laser ablation system 2, 3. However, solid-state pulse lasers of modest costs (<$ 10 K) can provide robust performance for laser ablation in transparent preparations where target axons are "close " to the tissue surface. Construction and alignment {{of a system}} can be accomplished in a day. The optical path provided by light from the focused condenser to the ablation laser provides a convenient alignment guide. An intermediate module with all optics removed can be dedicated to the ablation laser and assures that no optical elements need be moved during a laser ablation session.

These satellite systems require low-profile, high gain, light weight and low cost antennas for communications to and from Earth {{as well as for}} inter-satellite links (ISL). At higher mm-wave frequencies, the conductor loss of conventional microstrip line is high and consequently the feed network loss of patch antenna arrays is also high.

40|$|A laser {{tweezers}} {{system for}} transporting dissociated neurons into small “cages” on a culture dish was constructed, {{and it was}} studied extensively. The system consists of an inverted microscope, a 1064 nm or 980 nm laser module, a beam expander, a motorized mechanical stage, a CCD camera, and steering mirrors. A laser beam is generated by the IR laser module, and the beam is expanded by the beam expander to match {{the size of the}} <b>back</b> <b>aperture</b> of the objective. The beam is then steered into the objective where it is focused to a point. The system uses this single, tightly focused laser beam to trap a neuron. Once a neuron is trapped and lifted, the mechanical stage is moved to locate the neuron above its destination. The system will know the location of the neurocages and will automatically move neurons to their destination. Newly dissociated neurons will attach to most substrate surfaces eagerly, and the lifting of a neuron is impossible when it is attached to the surface. Many possible surfaces were investigated, and it was discovered that the surface can best be made “non-sticky” for more than an hour, by coating the surface with Poly- 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PolyHEMA). The neural survival at different laser intensities, exposure times, and wavelengths were studied. The results show that neural survival depends strongly on laser wavelengths, and a 980 nm laser is less damaging than a 1064 nm laser. For 980 nm, perfect survival after irradiation is independent of laser power up to our maximum of 130 mW for exposure time up to 4 minutes. At 17 mW, almost all neurons can be lifted off a PolyHEMA substrate. The maximum speed for moving a neuron through the medium at different laser intensities was studied, and was 250 um/s at 100 mW for 980 nm. The studies have shown that a laser tweezers system is suitable for transporting live dissociated neurons over millimeter distance in less than a minute. The neural survival in neurocages on glass substrate was then studied. The survival and growth over time for neurons loaded into cages was found to be no different than for that of a control culture...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, optical {{near-field}} {{has received}} an ever-increasing attention owing to {{its ability to}} localise optical signals beyond the diffraction limit. Optical near-field is a non-propagating field existing in the close vicinity of a matter within a range less than the wavelength of the illumination light and it carries the high spatial frequency information showing the fine details of the matter. An optical near-field can be generated by a near-field optical microscope with a nano-aperture or a metal-coated fibre tip. However, common difficulties associated with this approach, such as a fragile probe, a low throughput and signal-to-noise ratio, and a slow response of gap controlling between the probe and the sample, make it less applicable. Alternatively, optical near-field can be produced by total internal reflection (TIR) occurring at the interface of a prism, which is capable of localising the electromagnetic (EM) field in the close vicinity of the interface. However, in this geometry, no confinement of the field can be achieved in the transverse direction, whereas, in most applications such as optical trapping, micro-fabrication and optical data storage, a transverse confinement of the light field is essential. In order to achieve a transverse confinement of the light field, maintaining the high spatial resolution of the optical near-field, {{and at the same}} time eliminating the drawbacks associated with the conventional near-field optical microscope, a novel near-field probe based on a high numerical aperture (NA) TIR objective combined with annular illumination has been developed recently. In this arrangement, an obstruction disk is inserted at the <b>back</b> <b>aperture</b> of the objective to block the light with a convergence angle lower than the critical angle determined by the refractive indices of the two media, resulting in a pure focused evanescent field in the second medium. The evanescent field produced by this method provides a useful tool for studying light-matter interaction at the single molecule level not only because of its high resolution but also due to its inherent merits such as no distance regulation, no heating effect and simple experimental setup. But, the most significant advantage that makes this method unique and superior to the other approaches in terms of producing the optical near-field is that it allows the dynamic control of the focal field by simply modulating the phase or amplitude or even the polarisation state of the incident beam before it enters the objective so that complex illumination beams can be generated, whereas in other fibre probe based approaches this goal is extremely difficult to achieve. To make use of such a novel near-field probe, a thorough theoretical and experimental investigation is required. A complete knowledge of the focused evanescent field is a prerequisite for a wide range of applications including single molecule detection, Raman spectroscopy, near-field non-linear imaging and near-field trapping. Therefore, it is not only necessary but also urgent to exploit the focusing properties of a focused evanescent field under complex field illumination both experimentally and theoretically and this is the major aim of this thesis. The complex fields, which are of particular interest in this thesis, are the radially polarised beam and the Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam, because the former owns a more compact circularly symmetric field distribution in the focal region when focused by a high NA objective, while the latter is capable of rotating a trapped particle by transferring the orbital angular momentum. Combining them with the focused evanescent field is potentially able to induce novel functions in the near-field region, which cannot be fulfilled by other near-field approaches. In this thesis, in order to generate these two types of beams, a single liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LCSLM) is employed to produce useful phase modulation to the incident beam. Experimental characterisation of an evanescent focal spot is performed with scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM), which is capable of providing the direct mapping of the focused evanescent field not only because of its high spatial resolution and its ability to detect the near-field and far-field signals simultaneously, but also due to the motion of the piezzo-stage enables a three-dimensional characterisation of the evanescent focal spot. In this thesis, a SNOM system with an aluminum coated aperture probe is implemented. The field distributions at both the interface and parallel planes with a small distance away from the interface are obtained. To verify the applicability of SNOM as a characterisation methodology, the field distribution in the focal region of a high NA objective illuminated by a linearly polarised plane wave is measured first. A focus splitting along the direction of incident polarisation is observed threedimensionally near the interface under such a circumstance. It has been demonstrated that the depolarisation effect plays an important role in determining the coupling behaviour of the light into the fibre probe of SNOM. The good match between the experimental results and theoretical predications confirms the validity of SNOM. Theoretical investigation of a tightly focused radially polarised beam is undertaken based on the vectorial-Debye diffraction theory because under the tight focusing of a high NA objective, the vectorial nature of the highly localised field has to be carefully considered in order to represent the field distribution accurately. The calculations on the focusing properties of a radially polarised beam suggest that the longitudinal field component in the focal region plays a dominant role in determining the overall field distribution. Direct measurement of the focused evanescent radially polarised beam in a three-dimensional manner near the interface is performed with SNOM. A highly localised focal spot is achieved in the close vicinity of the coverglass. The measured intensity distributions from SNOM show that correction of the focal spot deformation associated with a linearly polarised beam is achieved by taking advantage of the radially symmetric focal spot of a radially polarised beam. A smaller focal spot is acquired due to the dominant longitudinal polarisation component in the focal region, which possesses a more compact focal intensity distribution than that of the overall field. The experimental results demonstrate a good agreement with the theoretical expectations. The fact that a radially polarised beam is capable of eliminating the focus deformation often presented in the focal region of a high NA objective when a linearly polarised beam is employed can be very useful in many applications, including microfabrication using two-photon photopolymerisation technique. The theoretical study on the two-photon point spread function (PSF) of a radially polarised beam indicates that the focus elongation and splitting associated with a linearly polarised beam are eliminated and the achievable lateral size of the focal spot is approximately a quarter of the illumination wavelength, which is less than half of that under the illumination of a linearly polarised beam. A further reductiont of the lateral size can be expected by using annular radial beam illumination. The investigation on the focusing properties of LG beams has also been one of the major tasks of this thesis. Theoretical investigations of a focused evanescent LG beam suggest that the phase shift induced by the boundary effect when a light beam passes the interface satisfying TIR condition plays a vital role in determining the overall shape of the total field distribution. A severe focal intensity deformation is predicted theoretically in the case of focused evanescent LG beam illumination, which might involve new physical phenomena when applied in the near-field trapping. Such a focal intensity deformation is evidenced experimentally by the direct mapping result obtained from the SNOM probe. A quantitative cross-section comparison with the theoretical predication is conducted, which demonstrates a good agreement. To achieve a controllable optical trap and rotation in the near-field region, complex optical fields such as LG beams carrying orbital angular momentum, have been induced for the manipulation of a polystyrene particle. The influence of the focal intensity deformation on a near-field trapping has been thoroughly investigated. Rotation motion of the particle is examined by mapping the two-dimensional (2 D) transverse trapping efficiency of the particle. Theoretical investigation reveals that a significant tangential force component is generated on the particle when it is illuminated by a focused evanescent LG beam. Such findings may prove useful in introducing a rotation mechanism in near-field trapping. The research investigations and methodologies described in this thesis provide a new approach to characterise the near-field focal spot under complex field illumination. It enhances the understanding of the novel near-field probe, thus opening the pathway for numerous near-field applications including optical trapping, two-photon excitation (photopolymerisation) and spectroscopy. The focal field rotation phenomena demonstrated in this thesis may prove particularly beneficial in introducing a rotation mechanism in near-field trapping using a focused evanescent field...|$|E

40|$|Predicting the {{insertion}} loss of an opening backed with an enclosed space {{is important for}} building noise control. Recent research in sound transmission through apertures of finite depth in infinite rigid baffles has included the effects of propagating and evanescent modes within the aperture in order to extend models to higher frequencies. The present study extends the model {{to the case of}} the <b>aperture</b> <b>backed</b> by a cavity as opposed to sound radiating into half-space. The role of coupling between the aperture modes, radiation modes, and cavity modes in the transmission was investigated. The results were compared to those of previous models which neglected the depth of the aperture and finite element modeling using COMSOL Multiphysics. Comparisons show that the current model is effective at predicting the sound transmission loss through the aperture and the acoustic field within the cavity for an obliquely incident plane wave. By changing impedance conditions on the half-space side of the aperture and within the aperture, the model has been used to evaluate passive noise control techniques...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{electromagnetic}} (EM) scattering from an <b>aperture</b> <b>backed</b> by a rectangular cavity recessed in a three-dimensional conducting body is analyzed using the coupled field integral equation approach. Using the free-space Green's function, EM fields scattered outside the cavity are determined {{in terms of}} (1) an equivalent electric surface current density flowing on the three-dimensional conducting surface of the object including the cavity aperture and (2) an equivalent magnetic surface current density flowing over the aperture only. The EM fields inside the cavity are determined using the waveguide modal expansion functions. Making the total tangential electric and magnetic fields across the aperture continuous and subjecting the total tangential electric field on the outer conducting three-dimensional surface of the object to zero, a set of coupled integral equations is obtained. The equivalent electric and magnetic surface currents are then obtained by solving the coupled integral equation using the Method of Moments. The numerical results on scattering from rectangular cavities embedded in various three-dimensional objects are compared with the results obtained by other numerical techniques...|$|R

40|$|Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is {{a common}} {{treatment}} option for breast cancer patients. The goal of BCS is to remove the entire tumor from the breast while preserving as much normal tissue as possible for a better cosmetic outcome after surgery. Specifically, the excised specimen must have at least 2 mm of normal tissue surrounding the diseased mass. Unfortunately, a staggering 20 - 70 % of patients undergoing BCS require repeated surgeries due to the incomplete removal of the tumor diagnosed post-operatively. Due to these high re-excision rates as well as limited post-operative histopathological sampling of the tumor specimen, there is an unmet clinical need for margin assessment. Quantitative diffuse reflectance spectral imaging has previously been explored as a promising, method for providing real-time visual maps of tissue composition to help surgeons determine breast tumor margins to ensure the complete removal of the disease during breast conserving surgery. We have leveraged the underlying sources of contrast in breast tissue, specifically total hemoglobin content, beta-carotene content, and tissue scattering, and developed various fiber optics based spectral imaging systems for this clinical application. Combined with a fast inverse Monte Carlo model of reflectance, previous {{studies have shown that}} this technology may be able to decrease re-excision rates for BCS. However, these systems, which all consist of a broadband source, fiber optics probes, an imaging spectrograph and a CCD, have severe limitations in system footprint, tumor area coverage, and speed for acquisition and analysis. The fiber based spectral imaging systems are not scalable to smaller designs that cover a large surveillance area at a very fast speed, which ultimately makes them impractical for use in the clinical environment. The objective of this dissertation was to design, develop, test, and show clinical feasibility of a novel wide field spectral imaging system that utilizes the same scientific principles of previously developed fiber optics based imaging systems, but improves upon the technical issues, such as size, complexity, and speed,to meet the demands of the intra-operative setting. First, our simple re-design of the system completely eliminated the need for an imaging spectrograph and CCD by replacing them with an array of custom annular photodiodes. The geometry of the photodiodes were designed with the goal of minimizing optical crosstalk, maximizing SNR, and achieving the appropriate tissue sensing depth of up to 2 mm for tumor margin assessment. Without the imaging spectrograph and CCD, the system requires discrete wavelengths of light to launch into the tissue sample. A wavelength selection method that combines an inverse Monte Carlo model and a genetic algorithm was developed in order to optimize the wavelength choices specifically for the underlying breast tissue optical contrast. The final system design consisted of a broadband source with an 8 -slot filter wheel containing the optimized set of wavelength choices, an optical light guide and quartz light delivery tube to send the 8 wavelengths of light in free space through the <b>back</b> <b>apertures</b> of each annular photodiode in the imaging array, an 8 -channel integrating transimpedance amplifier circuit with a switch box and data acquisition card to collect the reflectance signal, and a laptop computer that controls all the components and analyzes the data. This newly designed wide field spectral imaging system was tested in tissue-mimicking liquid phantoms and achieved comparable performance to previous clinically-validated fiber optics based systems in its ability to extract optical properties with high accuracy. The system was also tested in various biological samples, including a murine tumor model, porcine tissue, and human breast tissue, for the direct comparison with its fiber optics based counterparts. The photodiode based imaging system achieved comparable or better SNR, comparable extractions of optical properties extractions for all tissue types, and feasible improvements in speed and coverage for future iterations. We show proof of concept in performing fast, wide field spectral imaging with a simple, inexpensive design. With a reduction in size, cost, number of wavelengths used, and overall complexity, the system described by this dissertation allows for a more seamless scaling to higher pixel number and density in future iterations of the technology, which will help make this a clinically translatable tool for breast tumor margin assessment.

40|$|For those {{steeped in}} the Western legal tradition, the Chinese {{political}} and legal system is, in the famous words of Winston Churchill, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. 1 Of course, Churchill was describing the potential actions of Russia, not China. 2 But, to continue borrowing from Churchill, perhaps there is a key – Chinese national interest and {{the interest of the}} Chinese Communist Party. 3 This research explores the interaction between political, economic, and legal reform, and posits that the Chongqing incident 4 was ultimately a positive turning point in the country’s institutional development. The theory presented herein is that although some argue {{the manner in which the}} Bo Xilai trial 5 was conducted, and its aftermath, represents a step <b>back</b> in political <b>aperture,</b> it is actually an example of the “two steps forward, one step back” 6 so closely associated with Communist political regimes in transition, and holds promise for consolidation of institutional reform in China. In exploring the riddle, this article attempts to place the Chinese legal system in its historic context before moving to the inextricable relationship between law and politics in China. Finally, it is argued that the Bo Xilai prosecution, while undeniably politically motivated and rife with retrograde elements, was also a cautious but definitive move towards the triumph of a new model of consolidated institutionalization...|$|R
40|$|A planar {{discrete}} {{lens antenna}} {{is a low}} profile, light weight and cost effective solution to conventional and curved dielectric lenses. The basic theory of operation of flat lens antenna unit cell is to collimate the feed spherical electromagnetic incident wave into planar wavefront at the <b>back</b> of the <b>aperture.</b> Therefore, the array unit cell must be designed to establish the required phase adjustment. Flat lens antenna elements {{which are based on}} aperture-coupled microstrip patches are presented. The lens contains 7 × 7 elements with a diameter of 71 mm and operates in the X-band frequency range. The lens was experimentally validated and good agreement between simulation and measurement results were obtained. The achieved measured peak gain is 15. 85 dB. This gives 6 dB gain enhancement for the system. The antenna 1 -dB gain bandwidth and power efficiency are 7. 8 % and 58 % respectively. A very good transmission phase shift of 340 ° is achieved with transmission coefficient of better than 2. 25 dB. In addition, the measured radiation pattern results show that the antenna system has good symmetry between E and H plane with a half-power beamwidth of 16. 2 ° and 16. 6 ° in E-plane and H-plane respectively. Moreover, the proposed lens element employs a simple and less fabrication complexity mechanism for phase shift correction. Finally, the obtained results show that the proposed flat lens antenna is an attractive choice for the applications of wireless airborne systems such as VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) ...|$|R
5000|$|... (Description by Joseph Verco) The solid, elongate-fusiform shell {{consists}} of 6½ whorls, including the blunt protoconch, which merges into the spire insensibly. The first whorl {{and a half}} are smooth and rather flat; the next is scarcely convex, and has at first distant invalid axial angulations, which gradually become more numerous and costulate. In the next whorl they become more distant again, and remain throughout the shell as feeble axial angulations which are just visible {{when looking at the}} shell from the apex. The spire-whorls are subconvex, subangulate just below the middle, and have the upper fourth somewhat adpressed just below the simple impressed suture. The aperture is oblique oblong-ovate. The siphonal canal is short, wide, scarcely notched. The outer lip is solid but sharp, with a deep round sinus separated from the ascending suture by a callus from the posterior part of the inner lip, then straightly convexly antecurrent to two shallower sinuses {{at the base of the}} siphonal canal. The inner lip shows a complete smooth thin applied glaze, thickened behind. The spiral incisions, which begin in the second half of the first sculptured protoconchal whorl, cut the surface up into flat slightly rounded ribs, increasing to eleven in the penultimate and twenty-four in the body whorl, the second below the suture and that at the angulation being the widest. Microscopic accremental striae scratch the whole surface and have the sinuosities of the outer lip. A narrow white spiral, articulated with brown, ornaments the angulation, with a fainter narrower one above, and a rather wider brown spiral articulated with white runs from the <b>back</b> of the <b>aperture</b> over the dorsum nearly to the lip margin. The general colour is brown, with darker irregular spots and clouds.|$|R
