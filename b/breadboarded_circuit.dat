40|$|Abstract. Design, {{fabrication}} and {{preliminary testing}} {{of a flat}} pump with millimetre thickness are described in this paper. The pump is entirely made of polymer materials barring the magnet and copper coils used for electromagnetic actuation. The fabrication is carried out using widely available microelectronic packaging machinery and techniques. Therefore, the fabrication of the pump is straightforward and inexpensive. Two types of prototypes are designed and built. One consists of copper coils that are etched on an epoxy plate and the other has wound insulated wire of 90 µm diameter {{to serve as a}} coil. The overall size of the first pump is 25 mm × 25 mm × 3. 6 mm including the 3. 1 mm-thick NdFeB magnet of diameter 12 mm. It consists of a pump chamber of 20 mm × 20 mm × 0. 8 mm with copper coils etched from a copper-clad epoxy plate using dry-film lithography and milled using a CNC milling machine, two passive valves and the pump-diaphragm made of Kapton film of 0. 089 mm thickness.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{increase in}} the range and types of portable electronic devices in the past decades has resulted in higher requirements for energy storage and conversion modules. Most of these devices use rechargeable batteries as energy storage elements. No matter what type of batteries are used (Ni-Cd, Ni-MH, Li-Ion, etc.) they all have one serious drawback in common, in terms of charging time. Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) also known as ultracapacitors or supercapacitors seem to have overcome this disadvantage, {{at the cost of}} lower energy storage capacity. This work aims to explore the design of fast and compact integrated charging techniques for ultracapacitors using the AC mains network as the source. The main constraints that arise are the power dissipation on-chip and in the magnetic components due to the large amount of energy that has to be transferred {{in a very short time}} interval. Two other limitations come from the EDLC side due to the device parasitics and the widely varying voltages over the operational envelope. This will impose the need for a flexible control system providing high efficiency over the whole output voltage range. The structure of this thesis comprises five main parts: literature review, behavioural modelling of the control system (including matlab simulations); implementation of the device with discrete components; design of an analogue circuit implementation and design of a mixed signal circuit implementation. As ultracapacitors represent one of the newest solutions in the field of electrical energy storage there are very few designs for chargers from the mains network. Therefore the literature review will also examine the properties and the modelling of EDLCs, as well as the choice of converter topologies available and the characteristics of the magnetic devices required for the system. The behavioural model of the control module gives a preview of the system parameters, while the design chapter introduces a series of new control techniques. The simulations and measurements of the <b>breadboard</b> <b>circuit</b> come as a first confirmation of the design approach and make it a viable starting point for an IC implementation. The analogue IC design presents the integration of the algorithms in a medium-voltage process using the current mode approach, as a demonstrator for a fully monolithic high-voltage IC. Once the functionality of the system is demonstrated at IC level, the mixed-signal system aims to optimize the device and provide a broader flexibility for the system parameters and control algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design and {{implementation}} of an analog actuation circuit for a novel frequency-modulated MEMS gyroscope. The gyroscope detects angular rotations as {{the difference between the}} natural frequencies of two closely spaced drive and sense modes rather than the magnitude of displacement in the sense direction. Furthermore, the actuation system features a resonant drive (RLC) circuit that amplifies the gyroscope actuation signal. The input to the circuit is an amplitude-modulated (AM) signal composed of a carrier signal modulated with a base signal that excites the gyroscope drive mode. The carrier frequency corresponds to the electrical resonance frequency of the drive circuit. This research develops techniques for the stabilization of the circuit output through close loop feedback. First, we attempt to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the modulating signal by implementing feedback and feedforward control loops (AGC). The feedback controller closes the loop on the entire conditioning circuit for the modulating signal while the feedforward controller acts on the input signal to the conditioning circuit. The feedforward and the feedback controllers derive an error signal representing the signal noise by comparing the input and output signal, respectively, with a reference signal. However, we find that the <b>breadboard</b> <b>circuit</b> implementations of our control strategies performed similar to a baseline uncontrolled function generator due to the additional noise input from the breadboard and the additional components used to implement the controller, such as the amplifiers. Next, we develop a single-harmonic amplitude-stabilized actuation scheme for the gyroscope to minimize multi-frequency excitations and reduce amplitude fluctuations to improve the gyroscope precision. A low pass filter is applied to the AM signal to obtain a single sideband full carrier (SSB-FC) signal. Since the capacitance of RLC circuit changes due to the vibration of the gyroscope, this variation in capacitance causes a shift in the frequency response of the RLC circuit, resulting in variation in the circuit gain. Three feedback control topologies are implemented to stabilize the signal by first detecting the change in signal level, and then amplifying or attenuating the signal level in order to maintain a constant gyroscope actuation level. The control strategy with the best performance involves feeding back the RMS of the output signal to control the amplitude of the carrier signal and feeding back the average of the output signal’s envelope to control the bias level of the modulating signal. Using control this strategy, the peak magnitude at the carrier frequency dropped approximately 2 % as the capacitance is varied from 15 pF to 16 pF, awhile the other two control strategies changed 9 % and 6 %...|$|R

40|$|At {{the time}} of its {{invention}} in the seventeenth century, the logarithmic slide rule literally revolutionized the way calculation was done. From then until the advent of the pocket calculator, this analog computational device was widely used to perform multiplications and divisions, to raise numbers to fixed powers and extract fixed roots of numbers. Today, the slide rule may be gone, but it is not forgotten. In this thesis, I present a class of simple translinear network circuits which essentially function as electronic slide rules, accurately computing products, quotients, powers, and roots. I describe two different analysis procedures that allow us to determine the steady-state relationship between input and output currents. I also describe systematic techniques for synthesizing such circuits whereby we can produce a circuit whose steady-state transfer characteristics embody some desired product-of-power-law relationship between input and output currents. These circuits are made from multiple-input translinear elements; such elements produce output currents that are proportional to the exponential of a weighted sum of their input voltages. We can implement the weighted voltage summations with either resistive or capacitive voltage dividers. We can obtain the required exponential voltage-to-current transformations from either bipolar transistors or subthreshold MOS transistors. The subthreshold floating-gate MOS transistor naturally implements the exponential-of-a-weighted-sum operation in a single device.
