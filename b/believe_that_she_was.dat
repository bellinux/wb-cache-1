5|$|Princess Ida (1884) spoofed women's {{education}} and male chauvinism and continued {{the theme from}} Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce {{based on the same}} material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused {{a good deal of the}} dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.|$|E
5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she was a little girl but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E

Soon other people also come to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an {{incarnation}} of the goddess. After hearing the news, Umaprasad returns home but is unable to remedy the situation as Dayamoyee herself begins to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an avatar, a belief which soon turns to tragedy.|$|R
25|$|A bust and {{historical}} plaque marks her birthplace in Toronto, now {{the site of}} the Hospital for Sick Children. The plaque was unveiled by her husband Buddy Rogers in 1973. The bust by artist Eino Gira was added ten years later. Her date of birth on the plaque is April 8, 1893. This can only be assumed to be because her date of birth was never registered – and throughout her life, beginning as a child, she led many people to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a year younger so she would appear to be more of an acting prodigy and continue to be cast in younger roles, which were more plentiful in the theatre.|$|E
25|$|Sephy, {{living with}} Callum's mother, Meggie, becomes {{increasingly}} fond of her daughter, Callie Rose. Callum's guard, Jack, delivers a letter, written by Callum before he died, {{saying that he}} never loved her and could not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stupid enough to fall for him. Meggie tries to make Sephy believe that Callum was forced to write the letter {{by the rest of}} the gang, but the letter is so hurtful that Sephy believes it and becomes full of postnatal depression. She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|Neighbours {{had assumed}} the flat was unoccupied, and the odour of decomposing body tissue was {{attributed}} to nearby waste bins. The flat's windows did not allow direct sight into the accommodation. Drug addicts frequented the area, {{which may explain why}} no one questioned the constant noise from the television. Half of her rent was being automatically paid to Metropolitan Housing Trust by benefits agencies, leading officials to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> still alive. However, over two years, £2,400 in unpaid rent accrued, and housing officials decided to repossess the property. Her corpse was discovered on 25 January 2006 when the bailiffs broke in. The television and heating were still running due to her bills being continually paid for by automatic debit payments and debt forgiveness.|$|E

25|$|In {{political}} affairs, Shajar al-Durr {{played a}} crucial role after the death of her first husband during the Seventh Crusade against Egypt (1249–1250). She became the Sultana of Egypt on May 2, 1250, marking the end of the Ayyubid reign and the start of the Mamluk era. There are several theories about the ethnic roots of Shajar al-Durr. Many Muslim historians <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> of Turkic origin and some <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> of Armenian origin.|$|R

25|$|During {{his first}} police interview, Hodgson denied {{having an affair}} with Nicholl and also denied {{anything}} to do with her disappearance. The next day, Nicholl's mobile phone was switched on and messages were sent which led her family and the police to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alive and well. The text messages were later revealed to have been sent from locations as far afield as Carlisle in Cumbria and Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. Later, the authenticity of these messages were put into doubt by the police when they stated in November 2005 that the inquiry had turned from a disappearance into a murder investigation. At the end of July 2005, police found David Hodgson in a hut near to Hudswell. He had taken an overdose of pills and wine. In later police interviews, Hodgson admitted that he and Nicholl were lovers, but that their affair had ended 12 months earlier.|$|E
25|$|Princess Ida is {{the only}} Gilbert and Sullivan work with {{dialogue}} entirely in blank verse {{and the only one}} of their works in three acts (and the longest opera to that date). The piece calls for a larger cast, and the soprano title role requires a more dramatic voice than the earlier works. The American star Lillian Russell was engaged to create the title role of Princess Ida, but Gilbert did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, she was dismissed. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's usual female lead, Leonora Braham, a light lyric soprano, nevertheless moved up from the part of Lady Psyche to assume the title role. Rosina Brandram got her big break when Alice Barnett became ill and left the company for a time, taking the role of Lady Blanche and becoming the company's principal contralto.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} date of the {{shooting}} match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate is currently on file with the Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reporting Butler and Oakley being wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. Many sources say that the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, {{yet there is no}} recorded certificate to validate that date. A possible reason for the contradicting dates may be that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. Federal Census record shows Saunders as married. Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was actually his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler. Throughout Oakley's show-business career, the public was often led to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> five to six years younger than her actual age. Claiming the later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age.|$|E

25|$|Thackston {{lost control}} of his vehicle while exiting at the Opryland exit on Briley Parkway at a speed of 55 miles per hour; the exit ramp was posted for 25 miles per hour. The car left the ramp, went {{airborne}} and struck the central division. West did not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> as badly injured as her neighbor had been and insisted he be treated first. Officers {{who responded to the}} scene incorrectly reported that she did not seem harmed at the time. West herself was under the same impression, however she suffered severe internal injuries and proved to have suffered both a ruptured spleen and a lacerated liver. Her spleen was removed that Friday and, the following Monday, she underwent two more surgeries to stop her liver from bleeding; these ultimately failed in that effort. Doctors said that West knew the extent of her injuries and even visited with Kenny Rogers shortly before her last operation. On September 4, 1991, during her third operation, West died on the operating table at 9:43a.m., at the age of 58.|$|E
25|$|From 1951 to 1953, most of {{her works}} are made from ripped {{drawings}} completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, {{the edges of the}} figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works. From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works. Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used Pollock's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage format. Others <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> creating a sense of intimacy between the two artists, which was lacking in their relationship by this time period, by combining their works together. By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either masonite, wood, or canvas. These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the Stable Gallery in 1955, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from Greenberg.|$|E

As Esther gains popularity and submits to numerous acts of peer pressure [...] including attacking a girl from her old school [...] her friendship with Sunni starts to deteriorate.

500|$|Aoba, {{continuing}} to receive damaging hits, turned to starboard to head away from Scott's formation and began making a smoke screen which led {{most of the}} Americans to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sinking. Scott's ships shifted their fire to Furutaka, which was following behind Aoba. At 23:49, Furutaka was hit in her torpedo tubes, igniting a large fire that attracted even more shellfire from the US ships. At 23:58, a torpedo from Buchanan hit Furutaka in her forward engine room, causing severe damage. During this time, San Francisco and Boise sighted Fubuki about [...] away and raked her with shellfire, joined soon {{by most of the}} rest of Scott's formation. Heavily damaged, Fubuki began to sink. Kinugasa and Hatsuyuki chose turning to port rather than starboard and escaped the Americans' immediate attention.|$|E
500|$|She came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being {{contacted}} by the Ascended Masters, including [...] "the Master Jesus", and underwent trance mediumship to channel the Masters' messages. In 1922 Fortune and Charles Loveday claimed that during one of these ceremonies they were {{contacted by}} Masters who provided them with a text, The Cosmic Doctrine. Although she became {{the president of the}} Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, she believed the society to be uninterested in Christianity, and split from it to form the Community of the Inner Light, a group later renamed the Fraternity of the Inner Light. With Loveday she established bases in both Glastonbury and Bayswater, London, began issuing a magazine, gave public lectures, and promoted the growth of their society. During the Second World War she organised a project of meditations and visualisations designed to protect Britain. She began planning for what she believed was a coming post-war Age of Aquarius, although she died of leukemia shortly after the war's end.|$|E
500|$|When Sinatra's {{mother was}} a child, her pretty face earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dolly." [...] Energetic and driven, biographers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the dominant factor {{in the development of}} her son's personality traits and extraordinary self-confidence. Barbara Sinatra claims that Dolly was abusive to him as a child, and [...] "knocked him around a lot". Dolly became influential in Hoboken and in local Democratic Party circles. She worked as a midwife, earning $50 for each delivery, and according to Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelley, also ran an illegal abortion service that catered to Italian Catholic girls for which she was nicknamed [...] "Hatpin Dolly". She also had a gift for languages and served as a local interpreter. [...] Sinatra's illiterate father was a bantamweight boxer who fought under the name Marty O'Brien. He later worked for 24 years at the Hoboken Fire Department, working his way up to captain. Sinatra spent much time at his parents' tavern in Hoboken, [...] working on his homework and occasionally singing a song on top of the player piano for spare change. During the Great Depression, Dolly provided money to her son for outings with friends and to buy expensive clothes, resulting in neighbors describing him as the [...] "best-dressed kid in the neighborhood". Excessively thin and small as a child and young man, Sinatra's skinny frame later became a staple of jokes during stage shows.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} speculated Thutmose's father was Amenhotep I. His mother, Senseneb, was of non-royal {{parentage}} {{and may have been}} a lesser wife or concubine. Queen Ahmose, who held the title of Great Royal Wife of Thutmose, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I; however, she was never called [...] "king's daughter," [...] so there is some doubt about this, and some historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Thutmose's own sister. Assuming she was related to Amenhotep, it could be thought that she was married to Thutmose in order to guarantee succession. [...] However, this is known not to be the case for two reasons. Firstly, Amenhotep's alabaster bark built at Karnak associates Amenhotep's name with Thutmose's name well before Amenhotep's death. Secondly, Thutmose's first-born son with Ahmose, Amenmose, was apparently born long before Thutmose's coronation. He can be seen on a stela from Thutmose's fourth regnal year hunting near Memphis, and he became the [...] "great army-commander of his father" [...] sometime before his death, which was no later than Thutmose's own death in his 12th regnal year. Thutmose had another son, Wadjmose, and two daughters, Hatshepsut and Nefrubity, by Ahmose. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant. Thutmose had one son by another wife, Mutnofret. This son succeeded him as Thutmose II, whom Thutmose I married to his daughter, Hatshepsut. It was later recorded by Hatshepsut that Thutmose willed the kingship to both Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. However, this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut's supporters to legitimise her claim to the throne when she later assumed power.|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} feature live action footage {{in the game}} after {{becoming}} frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on [...] for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is [...] "very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling {{a lot of the}} subtext into her performance", which led him to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "perfect" [...] for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering font size, as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role. Seifert began to feel pressure midway through filming, when she realised that [...] "the whole game is hinging" [...] on her performance. She described the shoot as [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "rather exhausting", and felt as if she was [...] "subtly being scrutinised" [...] by Barlow, which helped her performance. Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert's performance, taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock, who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance. Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have [...] "added some twists and turns" [...] for players that Barlow had not anticipated. The game's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days, in a process that Barlow called [...] "natural". Barlow travelled to Seifert's home county of Cornwall to film. He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production, because [...] "everywhere has crappy looking rooms", with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro. When filming was complete, Barlow wanted {{to give the impression that}} the videos had been recorded in 1994, but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately. Instead, he recorded the footage through two VHS players to create imperfections in the video before digitising the video into the game.|$|E
