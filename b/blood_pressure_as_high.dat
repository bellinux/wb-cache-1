Examination showed visual acuity of 20 / 50 and 20 / 60, no afferent pupillary defect, cecocentral scotomas, and bilateral optic disc edema with extensive peripapillary and macular exudates. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple cortical and subcortical white matter lesions. Both the laboratory workup and the systemic examination were unrevealing. However, on follow-up, the patient showed episodic elevations of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as 240 / 160. Further workup revealed elevated urine catecholamines and a right supra-adrenal mass {{proven to be}} a pheochromocytoma by histopathologic analysis. The paroxysmal hypertension resolved, and the visual acuity, visual fields, fundus exam, and neuroimaging improved. The patient was lost to follow-up until age 18 when she developed shortness of breath and was found to have multiple pulmonary metastases identified as pheochromocytoma by biopsy. Genetic testing identified a 3 p 25 - 26 (c. 482 G>A) VHL gene chromosomal mutation consistent with von Hippel–Lindau disease genotype. Multiple peripheral retinal vascular dilations and small retinal capillary hemangioblastomas were also found. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the lability of blood pressure often seen with pheochromocytomas, which may mask the underlying cause of hypertensive papillopathy and retinopathy, a diagnosis of low clinical suspicion in the pediatric population. The case also underscores the importance of thorough systemic workup, including genotyping to detect conditions where pheochromocytoma may be the presenting sign of the disease, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 A and 2 B, von Hippel–Lindau disease, von Recklinghausen disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Sturge–Weber syndrome.

40|$|Purpose. Case report {{describing}} an eight-month-old infant presenting with intermittent esotropia and irritability who {{was found}} to have malignant (grade 4) hypertensive retinopathy and mid-aortic syndrome. Methods. Visual acuity was 6 / 140 in the right eye and not recordable in the left eye. <b>Blood</b> <b>pressure</b> was <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 230 / 120 [*]mmHg. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral optic disc swelling, macular stars, and serous retinal detachment in the left eye, findings that are consistent with malignant (grade 4) hypertensive retinopathy. CT abdominal angiogram revealed a severe mid-aortic syndrome with occlusion of the abdominal aorta at T 12. Results. The patient was treated with medical management of his hypertension, improving the subretinal exudate. Binocular visual acuity improved to 6 / 9. 5 over 9 months. There was a persistent left relative afferent pupillary defect and moderate left esotropia. Conclusion. This is the first reported case of malignant hypertensive retinopathy in an infant with concomitant mid-aortic occlusion. The authors emphasize the need for an ophthalmological and pediatric examination in a child presenting with intermittent squint and irritability.

40|$|Background: Telmisartan {{has been}} shown to exert an {{equivalent}} action as ramipril on the prevention of cardiovascular events, but the dose-dependent actions of telmisartan on the prevention of events remain unknown. Objective: We investigated the dose-dependent effects of telmisartan on the prevention of AF in patients associated with risk factors. Methods: One hundred hypertensive patients were randomized to take 40 mg (low-dose group: n= 57) or 80 mg (high-dose group: n= 43) of telmisartan for 24 months. The primary endpoints were defined as a new development and/or recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Results: The mean values of the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in both groups decreased significantly and to similar degrees after 24 months, in the low-dose (p < 0. 01) and high-dose (p < 0. 01) groups. At the end of the follow-up, the incidence of AF was lower in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (p < 0. 05). Moreover, the proportion of AF recurrences in the patients with a past history of paroxysmal AF was lower in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (p < 0. 05). Further, using a logistic regression model, there were no risk factors associated with the incidence of AF. Conclusion: The results indicated that telmisartan in low doses was as effective in controlling the <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> in <b>high</b> doses, but high doses of telmisartan had beneficial effects on preventing the recurrence of AF in hypertensive patients...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Hypertensive {{crisis is}} a {{life-threatening}} condition, defined as severe hypertension complicated with acute target-organ dysfunction (mainly neurological, renal or cardiac). It rarely occurs in childhood and most {{children and adolescents}} who presents with hypertensive crisis symptoms have secondary hypertension, mainly of renal etiology. Case reports:We present the cases of three children with severe hypertension of different renal etiology who presented with the characteristic features of hypertensive emergency. Case 1 is a 11 -year-old girl with reflux nephropathy who at admission had <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (BP) <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 250 / 200 mmHg. She was lethargic, with headache, vomiting and a 3 -month history of weight loss. Case 2 is a 13 -year-old boy with renal artery stenosis who had clinical presentation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and BP 220 / 150 mmHg. Case 3 is a 9 -year-old boy with chronic renal insufficiency of unexplained etiology and BP <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> 220 / 135 mmHg. This patient, like two others, presented dominantly with symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy, aswell as signs of renal damage. All three patients have documented hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the patient who had renal artery stenosis, the removal of his dysplastic atrophic right kidney failed to normalize his <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> Conclusion: We discuss the cases of unrecognized long-standing hypertension, with progression to malignant hypertension, as the first manifestation of renal disease – two with renal parenchymal disorders and one with renovascular disease. Hypertension is underdiagnosed in children {{and the purpose of}} these case reports is to raise awareness about it and point to the importance of routine careful measurement of <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in pediatric patients...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with acute heart failure (AHF), early worsening heart failure (WHF) predicts {{a significant proportion}} of post-discharge readmissions and mortality. We aimed to identify the predictors of 7 -day heart failure events or death in patients hospitalized with AHF. A predictive model and risk score for the short-term primary composite endpoint of 7 -day death, HF rehospitalization, or WHF was created using variables collected within 24 h of admission from {{patients with}} complete data (n 2015) enrolled in the PROTECT trial of AHF patients. The 7 -day composite was experienced by 294 patients (14. 6), with a mortality rate of 1. 8 (n 37), HF rehospitalization rate of 0. 5 (n 9), and WHF rate of 13. 1 (n 264). In multivariable analyses, the strongest predictor of short-term morbidity and mortality was higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration. Additional independent predictors of a worse outcome were lower serum albumin, cholesterol, and systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>higher</b> heart rate and respiratory rate. Model coefficients were converted to an additive risk score for predicting the 7 -day composite endpoint with a total point range of 0100. The risk score allowed discrimination of a wide spectrum of risk (4. 8 risk with score 35, to 28. 7 risk with score 55). Using the PROTECT 7 -day risk model and score, the main determinants of an adverse outcome for AHF patients included impaired metabolic status, neurohormonal activation, and reduced cardiac performance, gauged by BUN, serum albumin and cholesterol levels, systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> heart rate, and respiratory rate...|$|R
40|$|Aims: 1) To {{identify}} a dietary pattern associated with plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) in Latinos diagnosed with T 2 D. 2) To examine whether the “pro-inflammation” dietary pattern obtained {{is associated with}} additional cardiovascular disease risk in this Latino population. Methodology: Reduced rank regression {{was used to determine}} the cross-sectional relationship between food patterns and plasma inflammatory biomarkers in Latinos (26 men/ 77 women, 32 - 76 y) diagnosed with type- 2 diabetes (T 2 D). Reduced rank regression was used to create 3 dietary patterns from 33 food groups. We included IL- 6, TNFα, and MCP- 1 as response variables to derive 3 dietary patterns. Study Design: Cross-sectional. Place and Duration of Study: University of Connecticut, Hartford Hospital, and the Hispanic Health Council, between January 2010 and May 2011. Results: The first dietary pattern characterized by low intake of fruits and yellow vegetables and high intake of refined grains and sugar-free beverages explained the largest proportion of variance in inflammation markers. After adjusting for confounding factors including energy intake, statin treatment, waist circumference, glycosylated hemoglobin and <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> IL- 6 (P< 0. 0001) and TNFα (P = 0. 0004) were positively associated with the first dietary pattern. Food groups that were negatively associated with inflammation markers were fruits and dark yellow vegetables, explaining 10. 2 % and 4. 6 % of the variance, respectively. This dietary pattern was also significantly associated with higher number of large VLDL particles (P < 0. 05) after adjusting for WC, statins use and systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>higher</b> concentrations of apolipoprotein A- 2 after adjusting for WC and energy (P< 0. 05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four hour ABPM was performed sequentially in-hospital and again 9 +/- 3 days later on an out-patient basis, in 30 consecutive heart transplant recipients (27 men, median age 56 years, median time post-transplant 3 years). The same equipment was used on both occasions, without any interim change in medical treatment. RESULTS: Both systolic and diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> were <b>higher</b> in-hospital than <b>as</b> an out-patient: + 7 +/- 7 and + 6 +/- 5 mm Hg respectively for the 24 -h average (P< 0. 001).
