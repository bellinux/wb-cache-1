40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are severely-energy constrained devices. Energy-related issues {{are one of}} the common failure modes in sensor deployments. One challenge in systemwide energy management is that individual nodes in a sensor network often have widely varying energy profiles due to the amount of data transmitted, hardware construction, and other environmental effects. These differences result in unpredictable node and system lifetimes. As a result, sensor network bit-rate and reliability may degrade prematurely. Our research explores and evaluates an easily implemented dynamic scheduling policy supported by a <b>battery</b> <b>gauge</b> aimed to solve this problem. The dynamic scheduling policy presented here operates in a slotted manner. The decision for each node to communicate is based on the available energy of that node. Our policy guarantees a minimum communication bandwidth, while allowing nodes with more energy to increase their available bandwidth by a factor related to the amount of “extra ” energy they have. We present real-system results measured on test nodes in several different network scenarios. The results show our scheduling, when compared to a fixed schedule, guarantees a longer usable system lifetime by preventing premature degradation of connections. In addition to improving connectivity, it reduces data delay by as much as 50 % for intermittently connected nodes, with no added communication overhead...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a micro power {{battery state of charge}} monitor. The novelty of this design lies in the extreme low power consumption and accurate prediction of the battery reserve time. The average current drawn is successfully limited to 60 µA, which is significantly smaller than those in currently available devices. The proposed design predicts the reserved battery charge with an accuracy of 5 % under different discharge conditions. The automated learning scheme using software is utilized. Protection of the battery against excessive current drain and usage outside the specified temperature range is incorporated. This paper details the proposed technique adopted for power reduction. The battery temperature and current sensing circuits are normally in power down mode, they go into active mode for the microcontroller to take measurements. An ON/OFF ratio of 1 : 153 is achieved which results in power reduction by a factor of 59. 30. The average current requirement of the proposed design is reduced from 3302. 79 µA to 55. 69 µA with the adoption of power reduction approach. The proposed design has been tested on a NiMH, NiCd and Li-Ion battery packs and the experimental results confirm the utility of the proposed design 1.

Additional options, such as fifteen-inch alloy wheels, a spare tire, a cassette and/or CD player, two additional speakers behind the front seats, and power windows and door locks, and keyless entry were also available for all Ranger EV's.

Motivation—The Need to Know The reliability of portable equipment depends on the status of the energy source. The best equipment cannot function properly with a low battery. For rechargeable batteries as in cell phones, sophisticated battery monitors are now the norm. Is there a way to determine the remaining charge of a conventional battery? In the case of a temperature logger, how can one know whether there is enough power for the next mission? Precondition Batteries lose energy over time through self-discharge (aging) and through normal use when the equipment is switched on. Both the rate of battery self-discharge and the energy consumption of a silicon chip strongly depend on the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy consumption. If one knows the charge of a fresh battery, the temperature history, and the discharge rate during normal use, one has all the data needed to estimate the battery's remaining charge. The initial battery charge, measured in mAh, is found in battery data sheets. The challengin...|$|R

The island's central location and size made it the most heavily armed coastal fort and {{it was part of the}} plans for expanding Krepost Sveaborg already in 1909.

In January 1916 work began to modify the 11-inch battery (battery number 2) for 10-inch guns, with the modifications complete in 1916. The first 10-inch battery is located on the south-western tip of the island, while the other two batteries are on the south-eastern shore.

Findings: Batteries faces many problems like charge imbalance, thermal runaway, over voltage and under voltage due to high charge/discharge profile.

5000|$|Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan {{is a new}} {{single drive}} Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan {{represents}} Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek [...] "deep V" [...] style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also {{a departure from the}} steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current <b>battery</b> connectors, 12 <b>gauge</b> power wire, and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed top speed is 30 mi/h kn with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to 50 mi/h kn with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.|$|R
