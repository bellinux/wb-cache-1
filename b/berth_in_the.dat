5|$|ACC teams viewed a <b>berth</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} {{due to its}} location. Aside {{from being}} one of the lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint.

In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E
