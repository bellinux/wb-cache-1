2500|$|Water {{that is not}} fit for {{drinking}} but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called safe water, or [...] "safe for bathing". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant {{that is used to}} make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) {{for drinking}} water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for <b>bathing</b> <b>water).</b> Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as chlorine or ozone or by the use of ultraviolet light.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1996, another female {{patient of}} his claimed that Zeng had outraged her modesty at a {{treatment}} session at his acupuncture centre. During the trial, Zeng refused {{to settle in}} court, repeatedly stating {{that he was a}} [...] "knight of Saint John"; the claim was found to be untrue. His antics were likened by a police officer at scene to that of a [...] "Shakespearean" [...] actor. Maintaining his innocence to the end, Zeng was nonetheless found guilty and sentenced to four strokes of the cane and some eighteen months of jail time. During that period in jail, Zeng alleged that he was stripped of some of his basic rights; he claimed {{that as a result of}} being denied access to clean <b>bathing</b> <b>water,</b> he had developed painful rashes near his rectum. He added that the police in charge of him called him crazy and wanted to [...] "put him in a psychiatric cell", and also accused them of forcing him to confess through physical means.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{traditional}} low temperature and higher temperature firing techniques {{are used in the}} Guadalajara area, to produce ware from cheap objects to artistic productions. The two main pottery producing municipalities are Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. These two municipalities produce several different types of pottery and ceramics, principally [...] "bruñido", [...] "bandera", [...] "canelo", [...] "petate", [...] "betus" [...] and high-fire/stoneware. The best known of these styles is bruñido, which translates to burnished. It probably descends from polychrome produced in this area en the 19th century. The name {{comes from the fact that}} these pieces are not glazed, but rather they are given a slip and then polished with a stone or pyrite. Many of these pieces are slender necked jugs or lamp bases, often decorated with animals, such as rabbits, with distorted characteristics, giving them a surreal look. The pieces are usually painted with delicate tones of rose, gray-blue and white on a background of a light coffee color, light gray and sometimes green or blue. Each piece is individually created. The attraction of this pottery is its appearance, as it is too porous to hold any liquid or food. One exception to this are thick large tubs mainly to store water or for <b>bathing.</b> <b>Water</b> stored in this kind of vessel takes on a flavor from the pottery, which is desired by some people. Another exception is a water container with a fat body and long neck, with a ceramic cup placed upside down over the neck. These are called botellones, and are similar to carafes. One town that specializes in these is El Rosario, near Tonalá.|$|E

40|$|In Europe, {{and in many}} {{countries}} around the world, there is an increasing focus on the bacterial quality of recreational <b>bathing</b> <b>waters.</b> <b>Bathing</b> <b>waters</b> are impacted by both continuous and intermittent discharges from urban and rural sources {{which can be a}} significant distance away. In order {{to improve the quality of}} <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> there is a need to be able to target the key sources for improvement measures. The Cloud to Coast project has collected a significant amount of data and developed models, based on the River Ribble basin in the UK, to predict time series FIO concentrations.

5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust <b>bathing</b> and <b>water</b> <b>bathing.</b> Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust <b>bathing</b> (or <b>water</b> <b>bathing</b> where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. <b>Bathing</b> with <b>water</b> involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|R

40|$|A new {{procedure}} for detecting and counting enteroviruses {{based on the}} VIRADEN method applied to 10 liters of seawater was examined. It improved the efficiency of detection by taking into account both the number of positive isolations and numbers found with traditional methods. It was then used to quantify viruses in <b>bathing</b> <b>waters.</b> A number of bacterial indicators and bacteriophages were also tested. Cultivable enteroviruses were detected in 55 % of the samples, most of which complied with bacteriological criteria. In contrast, viral genomes were only detected in 20 % of the samples by reverse transcription-PCR. Somatic coliphages outnumbered all other indicators. F-specific RNA phages were detected in only 15 % of the samples, whereas phages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were detected in 70 % of samples. A numerical relationship between the numbers of enteroviruses and the numbers of enterococci and somatic coliphages was observed. In situ inactivation experiments showed that viruses persisted significantly longer than the bacterial indicators. Only somatic coliphages and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides persisted longer than the viruses. These results explain the numbers of enteroviruses and indicators in <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> attending the numbers usually found in sewage in the area. Somatic coliphages show a very good potential to predict the risk of viruses being present in <b>bathing</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Portuguese {{freshwater}} reservoirs {{are important}} socio-economic resources, namely for recreational use. National legislation concerning <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> {{does not include}} mandatory levels or guidelines for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. This {{is an issue of}} concern since cyanotoxin-based evidence is insufficient to change the law, and the collection of scientific evidence has been hampered by the lack of regulatory levels for cyanotoxins in <b>bathing</b> <b>waters.</b> In this work, we evaluate the profile of cyanobacteria and microcystins (MC) in eight freshwater reservoirs from the center of Portugal, used for bathing/recreation, {{in order to determine the}} risk levels concerning toxic cyanobacteria occurrence. Three of the reservoirs did not pose a risk of MC contamination. However, two reservoirs presented a high risk in 7 % of the samples according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for MC in <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> (above 20 µg/L). In the remaining three reservoirs, the risk concerning microcystins occurrence was low. However, they exhibited recurrent blooms and persistent contamination with MC up to 4 µg/L. Thus, the risk of exposure to MC and potential acute and/or chronic health outcomes should not be disregarded in these reservoirs. These results contribute to characterize the cyanobacterial blooms profile and to map the risk of toxic cyanobacteria and microcystins occurrence in Portuguese inland waters...|$|R
