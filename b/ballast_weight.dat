25|$|Another form of ascent {{which may}} be {{considered}} an emergency ascent is a tethered-ascent – where the diver has unintentionally lost full control of buoyancy due {{to a loss of}} <b>ballast</b> <b>weight,</b> and controls ascent rate by use of a ratchet dive reel {{with the end of the}} reel line secured to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Weighing on {{the morning}} of the launch day, January 30, {{demonstrated}} that the aircraft still possessed a reserve in buoyancy, and the crew decided to increase <b>ballast</b> <b>weight</b> by 180 kilograms, which would enable them to reach 20,500 metres altitude, higher than initial estimates. Prior to the launch of Osoaviakhim-1 meteorologists released radiosondes that reported satisfactory weather on the ascent path.|$|E
25|$|Buoyancy {{changes with}} depth {{variation}} are {{proportional to the}} compressible part {{of the volume of}} the diver and equipment, and to the proportional change in pressure, which is greater per unit of depth near the surface. Minimising the volume of gas required in the buoyancy compensator will minimise the buoyancy fluctuations with changes in depth. This can be achieved by accurate selection of <b>ballast</b> <b>weight,</b> which should be the minimum to allow neutral buoyancy with depleted gas supplies {{at the end of the}} dive unless there is an operational requirement for greater negative buoyancy during the dive.|$|E

50|$|A spin kit is a kit for a {{sailplane}} {{to make it}} spin. The kit {{consists of}} <b>ballast</b> <b>weights</b> (usually discs) applied to the tail to move {{the center of gravity}} rearward. This increases the instability of the glider, enabling it to spin.|$|R
50|$|Some submersibles, such as bathyscaphes, dive and re-surface {{solely by}} {{controlling}} their buoyancy. They flood ballast tanks to submerge, then to re-surface either drop discardable <b>ballast</b> <b>weights,</b> or use stored compressed air to blow their ballast tanks clear of water, becoming buoyant again.|$|R
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{issue in}} open circuit scuba diver weighting {{is that the}} breathing gas is used up during a dive, and this gas has weight, so the total weight of the cylinder decreases, while its volume remains almost unchanged. As the diver needs to be neutral {{at the end of}} the dive, particularly at shallow depths for obligatory or safety decompression stops, sufficient <b>ballast</b> <b>weight</b> must be carried to allow for this reduction in weight of gas supply. (the density of air at normal atmospheric pressure is approximately 1.2kg/m3, or approximately 0.075lb/ft3) The amount of weight needed to compensate for gas use is easily calculable once the free gas volume and density are known.|$|E
25|$|The bell is {{deployed}} {{over the}} side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame or through a moon pool. Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large <b>ballast</b> <b>weight</b> suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. The bell hangs from a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads guide it down the clump weight cables to the workplace.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to public}} {{investigation}} reports, the crash was ultimately {{caused by a}} prolonged stay at record altitudes exceeding maximum design limits. The balloon, overheated by sunlight, lost too much lifting gas in the upper atmosphere. As it descended past the [...] mark, cooling down to ambient air temperature, quick loss of buoyancy caused downward acceleration that triggered structural failure of the suspension cables. The aircraft design was marked by numerous engineering flaws, notably insufficient <b>ballast</b> <b>weight</b> and faulty gondola suspension design, which all contributed {{to the loss of}} life.|$|E

Johann Tomforde was replaced as chief engineer by Gerhard Fritz.

25|$|The {{position}} of the centre of buoyancy is largely {{beyond the control of}} the diver, though the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of <b>ballast</b> <b>weights.</b> The main <b>ballast</b> <b>weights</b> therefore should be placed as far as possible to provide an approximately neutral trim, which is usually possible by wearing the weights around the waist or just above the hips on a weight belt, or in weight pockets provided in the buoyancy compensator jacket or harness for this purpose. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position. There are several ways this can be done.|$|R
40|$|Page(s) : 12 (2), 155 - 172, 21 Ref. A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of tractor <b>ballasting</b> <b>weights</b> on compaction of a sandy loam soil. Three levels of tractor <b>ballast</b> <b>weights</b> were used with a 4 -wheel drive tractor. The soil compaction variables measured in the rear tyre track were soil bulk density, cone penetration resistance, infiltration rate and tyre sinkage. The results indicated that increasing tractor tyre <b>weight</b> by using <b>ballasting</b> <b>weights</b> caused a significant increase in both soil bulk density and cone index through the soil layer. Among the different compaction treatments, the highest compaction treatment (full ballast) resulted in 22 % increase in soil bulk density at depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. The cone index was increased up to 102 % over the depth of 0 - 25 cm compared to untrafficked (control) treatment. All compaction treatments significantly reduced the initial infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of the soil. However, the reduction in cumulative infiltration of soil under high compaction treatment reached up to 80 % compared to the control. Measurement of tyre sinkage differentiated between treatments. The greatest sinkage was observed under high compaction treatment providing 73 mm, whereas this value is equal to 1. 7 times sinkage of zero ballast treatment. The regression analysis done between the measured compaction variables showed high correlation between soil bulk density and each of cone index, initial infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration giving coefficients of determination (R 2) of 0. 98, 0. 91 and 0. 92, respectively. Tyre sinkage and cumulative infiltration were highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 94). Khartoum University Pres...|$|R
