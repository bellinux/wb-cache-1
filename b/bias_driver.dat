Drivers in the original study navigated a pre-set route at night while their eye movements were recorded using a head-mounted eye-tracking system.

Researchers evaluated the probabilities of drivers looking at specific areas of the road scene using binary logistic regression modeling.

40|$|Car crashes {{are still}} {{a leading cause of}} death in the United States, with {{vulnerable}} road users like bicyclists and pedestrians being injured or killed at rates that outpace their mode share. Planners, engineers, and advocates are increasingly adopting Vision Zero and Tactical Urbanism approaches and trying to better understand the underlying causes of dangerous roadway interactions. However, existing research into crash causation has focused on instrumental factors (e. g. intersection type, vehicle speed) while little research has probed the role of attitudes or socio-cognitive mechanisms in interactions between roadway users. Social psychology suggests that attitudes and social cognitions can play a role in conflict. Drivers’ attitudes toward bicyclists, and how those attitudes may affect drivers’ behavior, are a largely unexplored area of research, particularly in the United States. This study is the first use of an implicit method to examine transportation <b>biases</b> between <b>drivers</b> and bicyclists. The research used an Implicit Association Test as well as an attitudinal survey to measure drivers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward their own driving behavior, other drivers, and bicyclists. The results yielded information about the dimensions of drivers’ attitudes toward bicyclists, including lack of legitimacy as a fellow roadway user, stereotypes about different sub-types of bicyclists, normative beliefs about roadway behavior, and sub-conscious preferences for drivers versus bicyclists. Results demonstrated that the implicit method captured bias that was overlapping with, but distinct from, the explicit measures. This research demonstrates the potential value of measuring implicit attitudes to complement traditional transportation survey self-report measures. Understanding these subconsciously-held attitudes and their relationship with self-reported safety-related behaviors can improve potential educational, legal, programmatic, and infrastructural interventions to improve road safety.

Both data sets {{are found to be}} in good agreement in terms of correlation and <b>bias.</b> The <b>drivers</b> of albedo variability are identified by means of in situ measurements of biological and physical properties of the land surface collected over a network of 29 long-term survey sites. Short-term variability is dominated by changes in the spectral composition of incident radiation, which reflects aerosol optical depth and integrated water content, and changes in soil moisture, which have a short-lived effect (1 d). Bush fires cause a marked decrease of albedo of the order of 10 d, whereas a dry season storm event is suspected to have increased albedo through litter and soil surface abrasion. Seasonal plant growth causes the largest changes in rainy season albedo, and displays a large interannual variability: Because of the 2004 drought, albedo increases steadily from late 2003 to early 2005 at latitude 15 degrees N. Grazing pressure is found to impact albedo mostly in the dry season. Dry season albedo is controlled by the amount of litter and standing dead phytomass hiding the bright soils. Thus rainfall anomalies have a direct effect on albedo through plant growth but also a lagged effect caused by above normal amounts of dry phytomass that can persist until the arrival of the next monsoon.

Many of the factors that influence fuel consumption, such as the road type, vehicle configuration or external environment, are difficult to influence. One of the most under-explored ways to lower the costs is training and incentivizing drivers. However, today it is difficult to measure driver performance in a comprehensive way outside of controlled, experimental setting. This paper proposes a machine learning methodology for quantifying and qualifying driver performance, with respect to fuel consumption, that is suitable for naturalistic driving situations. The approach is a knowledge-based feature extraction technique, constructing a normalizing fuel consumption value denoted Fuel under Predefined Conditions (FPC), which captures the effect of factors that are relevant but are not measured directly. The FPC, together with information available from truck sensors, is then compared against the actual fuel used on a given road segment, quantifying the effects associated with driver behavior or other variables of interest. We show that raw fuel consumption is a <b>biased</b> measure of <b>driver</b> performance, being heavily influenced by other factors such as high load or adversary weather conditions, and that using FPC leads to more accurate results.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an innovative}} process-based analysis of contemporary model performance of precipitation over southern Africa. This region is typically understudied and not fully understood {{due to the}} complexity of various influences and drivers of precipitation. Historical simulations of precipitation are assessed including principal <b>drivers,</b> sources of <b>biases</b> and dominant modes of interannual variability. The South Indian Ocean Convergence Zone (SIOCZ), a large-scale, austral summer rainfall feature extending across southern Africa into the south-west Indian Ocean, is evaluated as the feature of interest in historical simulations. Most CMIP 5 models simulate an SIOCZ feature, but are typically too zonally oriented and discontinued between land and the adjacent Indian Ocean. Excessive precipitation over the continent is likely associated with excessively high low-level moisture flux around the Angola Low, which is almost entirely due to model circulation <b>biases.</b> <b>Drivers</b> of precipitation over southern Africa include three dominant moisture flux transport pathways which originate from flow around the SIOHP and SAOHP and monsoon winds. Interannual variability in the SIOCZ is shown by a clear dipole pattern, indicative of a northeast-southwest movement of the SIOCZ. Drivers of this shift are significantly related to the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the subtropical Indian Ocean dipole in observations. However models do not capture these teleconnections well, limiting confidence in model representation of variability. A large majority of the population rely heavily on precipitation over southern Africa for agricultural purposes. Therefore spatial and temporal changes in precipitation are crucial to identify and understand with intentions to ultimately provide useful climate information regarding water security over the region. Key climate change signals over southern Africa are established in this thesis (OND and DJF), in which the dominant regional mechanisms of precipitation change over southern Africa are quantified. Robustness and credibility of these changes are additionally quantified. The most notable projected change in precipitation over southern Africa is the distinct drying signal evident in the pre-summer season (OND). This has the implication of delaying the onset of the rainy season affecting planting and harvesting times. Future projections of the SIOCZ are determined, which indicate a northward shift of approximately 200 km. A dipole pattern of precipitation wetting/drying is evident, where wetting occurs {{to the north of the}} climatological axis of maximum rainfall, hence implying a northward shift of the ITCZ, consistent with the SIOCZ shift. Using a decomposition method it is established that ΔP’s dipole pattern emerges largely from the dynamic component, which holds most uncertainty, particularly over the south-west Indian Ocean. Changes in precipitation over land are not solely driven by dynamical changes but additionally driven by thermodynamic contributions, implying projected changes over land and ocean regions require different approaches. SST patterns of warming over the Indian Ocean corroborate the warmest-get-wetter mechanism driving wetting over the south-west Indian Ocean, which is robust in both key seasons. Coherent model behaviour is understood via across model correlation plots of principal components, whereby patterns of coherent warming patterns are identified. Composite analyses of diagnostic variables across models illustrate patterns driving projected precipitation changes. Drying is more robust over land than over the south-west Indian Ocean. Clear robust drying signal in OND, however magnitude is uncertain. Drivers of uncertainty include SST pattern changes, which modulate atmospheric circulation patterns. Therefore reductions in uncertainty rely on the accurate representation of these processes within climate models to become more robust. There is a desire from both climate scientists and policy-makers to reduce uncertainty in future projections. No one particular methodology is unanimously agreed upon, however one approach is analysed in this thesis. Uncertainties of future precipitation projections are addressed using a process-based model ranking framework. Several metrics most applicable to southern African climate are selected and ranked, which include aspects of both mean state and variability. A sensitivity test via a Monte Carlo approach is performed for various sub-samples of “top” performing models within the CMIP 5 model dataset. Uncertainty is significantly reduced when particular sub-sets of “top” performing models are selected, however only for austral summer over the continent. The result has the implication that potential value is established in performing a process-based model ranking over southern Africa. However additional investigation is required before such an approach may become viable and sufficiently credible and robust. Reductions in model spread are additionally established in SIOCZ projections, whereby model processes of change exhibit agreement, despite differing initial SIOCZ conditions. Therefore model process convergence and coherence is established with respect to projected changes in the SIOCZ, irrespective of initial climatology biases...|$|R

However, placing empirical results into an ecological context is difficult, owing to large variations that reflect both natural heterogeneity and scientific bias. The goal {{of this study is to}} address the observed heterogeneity in three physiological responses (larval survival, settlement, and calcification) of reef building corals to elevated temperature and reduced aragonite saturation. To discern scientific <b>bias</b> and identify <b>drivers</b> of the remaining heterogeneity, 100 publications were analyzed using a combination of weighted mixed effects meta-regression and categorical effect size meta‑analysis. A linear regression model was applied {{to quantify}} the variation caused by differing stress levels across studies. The least squares predictions were then used to standardize individual study outcomes and weighted effect size meta-analysis was performed on original and standardized outcomes separately. On average, increased temperature significantly reduces larval survival, while ocean acidification impedes settlement and calcification. Significant differences were based on biological traits (genera and life cycle stage), environmental factors (climate and various characteristics of the collection site) and additional differences in experimental design (presence of particulate food, filter size and experimental duration). Standardizing outcomes to linear model predictions proved useful in discerning strong sources of scientific bias.

40|$|Geometrical {{indicators}} neglect both {{normal human}} behavior and driver’s behavior under specific conditions of stress, risk and fatigue. These conditions are frequently {{induced by the}} road environment and the way of driving. Repeated dynamic stresses (such as transversal accelerations) during driving can cause abnormal behaviors. This {{is the reason why}} a new, advanced and effective indicator is proposed and validated to assess the safety of road infrastructures considering the investigation of the variability of transversal accelerations as an unbiased indicator of discomfort. The main theoretical assumption is: a subject driving on a self-explaining road assumes a correct and safe trajectory and the local transversal accelerations depend only on the curvature of road geometry. If the driver corrects the vehicle’s trajectory more than what road curvature imposes, the road is not self-explaining and, consequently, it can be unsafe. If the local transversal accelerations do not depend only on the actual road curvature, they are <b>biased</b> by the <b>driver’s</b> corrections of trajectory. The proposed indicator takes into account the frequency and the amplitude of anomalous corrections of trajectory. The theoretical hypothesis of high correlation between the proposed indicator and the observed accident rate has been verified using an advanced driving simulator. Moreover an analysis of the correlation between such an indicator and a geometrical parameter has been examined. Two Italian case studies are presented. The numerical results confirmed such a theoretical hypothesis. The values of correlation parameters are much higher than any expectation. These outcomes are extremely promising but validations to other case studies are suggested before model generalization...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} {{understand the relationship between}} licensing policy and the opportunity {{for the development of a}} scientifically-based approach to identifying high risk older drivers based on prior driving history. This research focused on five tasks: (1) review of the literature, (2) compilation of information on licensing policy for use by decision-makers, (3) assessment of charges and payer source for older driver crashes using linked crash and hospital data, and (4) the development, and (5) validation of an older driver crash prediction model. There is relatively little available in the way of information for policymakers regarding licensing, and there is even less information available on evaluation of licensing practice effectiveness. Emergency department charges for older males were lower than females even though males accounted for a larger percentage of the injured population. Older drivers were no more likely to be covered by public insurance than the comparison group. Crash and citation data used to develop a driver history showed no differences between drivers in injury causing crashes and drivers in non-injury crashes. Logistic regression, Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression models were unable to effectively predict crash involvement based on driver history. This is likely due to self-selection <b>bias</b> for older <b>drivers</b> and truncated distribution of count variable (injury causing crashes). Recommendations resulting from this research include Massachusetts and national policy recommendations and additional research. Massachusetts should expand beyond its referral-based system for reviewing older drivers, consider restriction rather than only revocation, review medical advisory board practices, conduct evaluation of any policies it does implement, and conduct a thorough review of alternative transportation options. Nationally, efforts should focus on developing effective cognitive/functional testing by licensing agents, identification of effective second phase of testing, determination of a mechanism for determining when to retest, and assessment of the differences between older males and females for potential use in training, education, and testing. Research recommendations include continued exploration of the potential for systematic identification of high risk drivers using administrative data and in-depth analyses of the differences between males and females in terms of aging and driver safety. ...|$|R

Førere som er under innflytelse av sentralnervøst aktive stoffer, vil derfor være en potensiell fare i trafikken. I perioden 1. 8 – 31. 12. 1993 identifiserte Statens rettstoksikologiske institutt (SRI) 394 ulykkesførere som politiet hadde rekvirert {{analyser}} av med hensyn på narkotiske stoff/sentralnervøst aktive medikamenter (andre rusmidler) og/eller alkohol. Blodprøver fra disse førerne ble analysert med hensyn på alkohol og et utvidet repertoar av andre rusmidler ved SRI. Da polititjenestemenn og medtrafikanter ofte ikke vil oppdage påvirkning av andre rusmidler enn alkohol, dels pga. manglende alkohollukt, vil andre rusmidler som ulykkesårsak være noe underrepresentert i dette materialet sammenliknet med alkohol. Hos 299 av ulykkesførerne ble det påvist alkohol og/eller andre rusmidler. 44 førere hadde tatt inn både alkohol og andre rusmidler, mens alkohol og andre rusmidler ble påvist alene i henholdsvis 204 og 51 saker. Totalt ble benzodiazepiner, cannabis, opiater og amfetamin påvist i henholdsvis 54, 30, 17 og 16 saker. Av de 95 som hadde tatt inn andre rusmidler, hadde 34 tatt inn mer enn ett rusmiddel (alkohol ikke medregnet) og i 72 av tilfellene ble analysefunnene vurdert (AB og JM) til sannsynligvis å ha gitt sentralnervøs påvirkning. Risikoøkningen for trafikkulykke ved nylig bruk av cannabisstoffer og diazepam i høydose ble estimert til å kunne tilsvare en blodalkoholkonsentrasjon på 1 - 1, 5 promille. Alkohol er det rusmiddel som oftest påvises hos ulykkesførere, men forekomsten av benzodiazepiner, cannabis og amfetamin er såvidt høy blant ulykkesførere at disse stoffene må anses å være et alvorlig trafikksikkerhetsproblem. Bjørneboe A, Beylich K-M, Christophersen AS, Fosser S, Glad A, Mørland J. Prevalence {{of alcohol}} and other intoxicants in blood samples from drivers involved in road traffic accidents.       ENGLISH SUMMARY Illegal and some legal drugs affect {{the central nervous system}} and drivers who use such drugs may represent a hazard in the road traffic. The prevalence of such drugs among drivers involved in accidents depends on the increase of the accident risk due to the drug and on the prevalence of the drugs among drivers on the road. In this study we have examined blood samples from 394 drivers involved in road traffic accidents during the period August–December 1993, to determine the prevalence {{of alcohol and}} drugs among drivers involved in accidents. Most of the drivers enrolled in the study were suspected by the police of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} or drugs. The data are, however, probably somewhat <b>biased,</b> because <b>drivers</b> influenced by alcohol or drugs will, if possible, avoid contact with the police. Furthermore, the police's ability to detect drivers influenced by drugs is limited. Accordingly, the proportion of influenced drivers and especially drivers influenced by drugs could be too low compared with the proportion among all drivers involved in traffic accidents. In about 2 / 3 of the blood samples examined, alcohol was found either alone or together with other drugs, and in 1 / 4 of the cases drugs were found either alone or together with alcohol. The most prevalent drugs were benzodiazepines (13. 7 %), cannabis (7. 5 %), opiates (4. 3 %) and amphetamine (4. 1 %). In about 3 / 4 of the drug positive cases the drug concentration was so high that it was considered likely or very likely that the driver was influenced by the drug(s). The bias due to the police's inability to detect all drivers influenced by drugs 50 A. B JØRNEBOE OG MEDARBEIDERE was estimated. After correction for this bias it was estimated that at least 2. 7 % of drivers involved in injury accidents will have significant concentrations of drugs in the blood and at least 4. 4 % will have significant blood alcohol concentrations. Based on various sources of drug use in Norway we arrived at rough estimates of increase in risk of being involved in road traffic accidents after different drug intakes. Driving a car the first few hours after cannabis intake may increase the risk for an accident comparable to the risk involved when driving with a blood alcohol concentration in the range 1. 0 - 1. 5 per mill. High doses of diazepam intake will most likely increase the risk of an accident in the same order of magnitude. We conclude that drunken drivers still constitute the main problem with regard to influenced driving on Norwegian roads. Nevertheless, the relatively high frequency of drivers influenced by drugs among those involved in accidents, demonstrates that these drivers are a serious safety problem.
