Many thanks to my {{supervisor}} Annemette Palmqvist for her help during the experiment and her comments on the report. 2 This project investigated the settling, survival and growth of Capitella sp. I in sediments contaminated with fluoranthene and acetyl cedrene. Different organic contents of the sediment and contaminant concentration levels were tested. Not much research has been done on this area, but Capitella sp. I is regarded as important pollutant indicator and <b>bioremediation</b> <b>organism,</b> which gives initiative to investigate their behaviour. In the experiment three organic content levels (100 %, 75 % and 50 %) and three different contaminant levels for fluoranthene (0, 45, and 90 µg Flu g- 1 DW sediment) and for acetyl cedrene (0, 1, and 50 µg AC g- 1 DW sediment) were used. The larval settlement was observed for ten days and the survival and body volume of the worms was measured on days 12 and 25 of the experiment. The contaminant levels of the sediment...|$|E

40|$|By {{reason of}} human {{activities}} are more greater content than natural process, many organic chemical substances such as pesticides, halogenated and nitroaromatic compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, phthalate esters, solvents pollute the aquatic and soil environments. Bioremediation {{is known as}} one of the cleaner, safer, environmental friendly technology and cost effective for cleaning up sites that are contaminated by various pollutants. The bioremediation process uses different agents such as bacteria, fungi, yeast, algae and plants for treating environment included heavy metal, organic and inorganic compound. The objective of this paper is to enlarge a better understanding of the strategies and techniques for the bioremediation. Besides the paper addresses the main features of the following issue and techniques: comparing with conventional remediation techniques, advantageous, disadvantageous and limitations of bioremediations, principles of bioremediation, bioremediation system and process (In situ and Ex situ remediation techqniques), phytoremediation, electrobioremediation, <b>bioremediation</b> <b>organisms,</b> using biomolecular engineering techniques for bioremediation...|$|R

40|$|A 1992 {{survey of}} DOE waste sites {{indicates}} that about 32 % of soils and 45 % of groundwaters at these sites contain radionuclides and metals plus an organic toxin class. The most commonly reported combinations of these hazardous compounds being radionuclides and metals (e. g., U, Pu, Cs, Pb, Cr, As) plus chlorinated hydrocarbons (e. g., trichloroethylene), fuel hydrocarbons (e. g., toluene), or polychlorinated biphenyls (e. g., Arochlor 1248). These wastes {{are some of}} the most hazardous pollutants and pose an increasing risk to human health as they leach into the environment. The objective of this research is to develop novel organisms, that are highly resistant to radiation and the toxic effects of metals and radionuclides, for in-situ bioremediation of organic toxins. Few organisms exist that are able to remediate such environmental organic pollutants, and among those that can, the bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas are the most characterized. Unfortunately, these bacteria are very radiation sensitive. For example, Pseudomonas spp. is even more sensitive than Escherichia coli and, thus, is not suitable as a bioremediation host in environments subjected to radiation. By contrast, D. radiodurans, a natural soil bacterium, is the most radiation resistant organism yet discovered; it is several thousand times more resistant to ionizing radiation than Pseudomonas. The sophisticated gene transfer and expression systems the authors have developed for D. radiodurans over the last eight years make this organism an ideal candidate for high-level expression of genes that degrade organic toxins, in radioactive environments. The authors ultimate aim is to develop organisms and approaches that will be useful for remediating the large variety of toxic organic compounds found in DOE waste sites that are too radioactive to support other <b>bioremediation</b> <b>organisms.</b> This report summarizes work after the first 6 months of a 3 -year project. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to provide {{fundamental}} knowledge on environment stress response of subsurface bacteria and a radiation-resistant bacterium (Deinococcus radiodurans). This information will be particularly useful {{in the development of}} successful <b>bioremediation</b> strategies. These <b>organisms</b> represent two phylogenetically distinct groups of soil bacteria, each of which has specific features of interest for bioremediation. The subsurface bacteria, Sphingomonas spp (Savannah River Site), have unique degradative capabilities of organic waste. The study of subsurface bacteria will {{serve as a model for}} bioremediation using indigenous bacteria. D. radiodurans exhibits high resistance to external stress such as ionizing radiation and organic solvent. The study of D. radiodurans will serve as a model for the use of genetically engineered bacteria for bioremediation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} the ecotoxicity of contaminated soil and water during <b>bioremediation.</b> Different test <b>organisms</b> were selected for the battery of ecotoxicity tests such as the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the terrestrial plants Sinapis alba, Lactuca sativa, and Hordeum vulgare, the water plant Lemna minor, the earthworm Eisenia fetida, and the crustaceans Daphnia magna and Heterocypris incongruens. A comparison of individual biotests with various organisms and endpoints should demonstrate their suitability and sensitivity for the ecotoxicity evaluation of contaminated soil and water. The bioassays {{were used for the}} evaluation of the bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, composting of PAH-contaminated soil and remediation of contaminated groundwater. The ecotoxicity of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil originating from a brownfield was evaluated during a 17 -month biodegradation pilot test (experiment I). The initial concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the soil was 6380 µg. g- 1 dry weight; the concentration of TPH in the soil decreased by 65. 5 % after bioremediation. The highest toxicity was detected in the first period of bioremediation; however, certain toxic effects were detectable during the whole bioremediation process. The contact tests were the most [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDNA, as the {{signature}} of life, has been extensively studied {{in a wide range}} of environments. While DNA analysis has become central to work on natural gene exchange, forensic analyses, soil <b>bioremediation,</b> genetically modified <b>organisms,</b> exobiology, and palaeontology, fundamental questions about DNA resistance to degradation remain. This paper investigated on the presence of plant DNA in groundwater and artesian fountain (groundwater-fed) samples, which relates to the movement and persistence of DNA in the environment. The study was performed in the groundwater and in the fountains, which are considered as a traditional artesian drinking water in Geneva Champagne Basin. DNA from water samples was extracted, analysed and quantified. Plant gene sequences were detected using PCR amplification based on 18 S rRNA gene primers specific for eukaryotes. Physicochemical parameters of water samples including temperature, pH, conductivity, organic matter, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC) were measured throughout the study. The results revealed that important quantities of plant DNA can be found in the groundwater. PCR amplification based on 18 S rDNA, cloning, RFLP analysis and sequencing demonstrated the presence of plant DNA including Vitis rupestris, Vitis berlandieri, Polygonum sp. Soltis, Boopis graminea, and Sinapis alba in the water samples. Our observations support the notion of plant DNA release, long-term persistence and movement in the unsaturated medium as well as in groundwater aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{xenobiotics}} {{are used}} worldwide as pesticides and petroleum additives. OP compounds share the {{major portion of}} the pesticide market globally. Owing to large-scale use of OP compounds, contaminations of soil and water systems have been reported {{from all parts of}} the world. OP compounds possess very high mammalian toxicity and therefore early detection and subsequent decontamination and detoxification of the polluted environment is essential. Additionally, about 200, 000 tons of extremely toxic OP chemical warfare agents are required to be destroyed by 2007 under Chemical Warfare Convention (1993). Chemical and physical methods of decontamination are not only expensive and time-consuming, but also in most cases they do not provide a complete solution. These approaches convert compounds from toxic into less toxic states, which in some cases can accumulate in the environment and still be toxic to a range of <b>organisms.</b> <b>Bioremediation</b> provides a suitable way to remove contaminants from the environment as, in most of the cases, OP compounds are totally mineralized by the microorganisms. Most OP compounds are degraded by microorganisms in the environment as a source of phosphorus or carbon or both. Several soil bacteria have been isolated and characterized, which can degrade OP compounds in laboratory cultures and in the field. The biochemical and genetic basis of microbial degradation has received considerable attention. Several genes/enzymes, which provide microorganisms with the ability to degrade OP compounds, have been identified and characterized. Some of these genes and enzymes have been engineered for better efficacy. Bacteria capable of complete mineralization are constructed by transferring the complete degradation pathway for specific compounds to one bacterium. In the present article, we review microbial degradation and metabolic pathways for some OP compounds. The biochemical and molecular basis of OP degradation by microbes and the evolution and distribution of genes/enzymes are also reviewed. This article also examines applications and future use of OP-degrading microbes and enzymes for bioremediation, treatment of OP poisoning, and as biosensors. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
