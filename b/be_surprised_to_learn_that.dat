He sent a brief reply: [...] "Thank you for your open letter dated 6March. You will not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto 'Remodernism'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{extensive}} modifications {{were made}} for the second voyage of HMS Beagle. Darwin noted in his journal in April 1833 that [...] "It blew half a gale of wind; but it was fair & we scudded before it. — Our decks fully deserved their nickname of a [...] "half tide rock"; so constantly did the water flow over them", but John Lort Stokes who was on all three survey expeditions praised the Beagle: [...] "The reader will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> she belongs to that much-abused class, the '10-gun brigs'—coffins, as they are not infrequently designated in the service; notwithstanding which, she has proved herself, under every possible variety of trial, {{in all kinds of}} weather, an excellent sea boat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly {{noticed a}} {{connection}} between Daniel and Imogen in their first scenes together and Phillipps told him that something could happen between them in the future. He continued, [...] "Imogen gets into twists and gets very worked up about things and Daniel just doesn't get it. He finds it really funny and thinks that Imogen is super sweet. He doesn't get why she finds stuff so frustrating, but he really loves that about her as well." [...] Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her a new dress, {{but it was too}} big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress. Imogen developed feelings for Daniel after they teamed up for a community project. Phillipps commented that Daniel and Imogen had developed [...] "a great chummy friendship", so he thought Daniel would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Imogen has feelings for him.|$|E

60|$|You {{will not}} <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> in the {{peculiar}} exigencies {{of the times}} our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{very rare}} bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all things are {{possible}} upon the moor. Yes, I should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> what we have heard is the cry {{of the last of}} the bitterns." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick {{gave him}} a dry smile. [...] "I suspect that Don Sebastian didn't trust you altogether. He left me, and I shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> {{he had found a}} place where he could watch the gangway without being seen." ...|$|E

Indeed, from their freshness, I should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> he had them at first hand from living men, or even from his own observation of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{take a trip}} to Switzerland," [...] said Lady Vandrift. And any one {{who knows}} Amelia will not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> we did take a trip to Switzerland accordingly. Nobody can drive Sir Charles, except his wife. And nobody at all can drive Amelia.|$|E
6000|$|M. de Bellegarde meditated a moment, {{as if he}} had {{not heard}} Newman's refusal. [...] "My mother and I, last evening," [...] he said, [...] "talked over your story.

60|$|My {{readers will}} now pretty well {{understand}} what last step that excellent sister, Mrs. Harold Smith, {{had taken on}} her brother's behalf, nor will they <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> {{in the course of}} the day Mr. Sowerby hurried back to town and put himself into communication with Miss Dunstable's lawyer.|$|E
60|$|As this monumental {{treatise}} {{began in}} the times of the Early Fathers and was planned to fill ten volumes {{of at least a}} hundred thousand words apiece, no one will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> it never reached the stage of publication, or indeed, to be accurate, that it came to final stop somewhere about the time of Athanasius.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a great}} {{good fortune}} {{for a man to}} have written a thing so {{beautiful}} as this, and not a singular fortune that he should have written nothing else comparable to it. The like happens in all literatures; and no one need <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> I found the other poems of Grossi often difficult, and sometimes almost impossible to read.|$|E

60|$|My {{readers will}} have observed, probably, by this time, that I am much given to meditation: they will not, therefore, <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> I {{fell into a}} deep reverie on the subject of sleep, which was {{continued}} without intermission into the night, and prolonged without interruption into the following morning. But I cannot feel assured that I actually slept during that time, although I am tolerably certain that I was not awake.|$|E
6000|$|... “Since I’ve got my notice with {{no reason}} given,” he drawled, “I don’t see why I should exhaust myself by {{carrying}} heavy planks about. Of course you noticed his statement that Mr. Aynsley was not responsible—though the fellow was afterward sorry {{he had made}} it. I’m {{of the opinion that}} there’s something to be inferred from his use of our employer’s Christian name, particularly as a big automobile stood at the gate for two hours yesterday. I shouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> Clay, senior, had examined the pay-roll.” ...|$|E
60|$|I have narrated {{all this}} as best I could, because I like the {{contrast}} of these episodes with the life that I had seen Strickland live in Ashley Gardens when he was occupied with stocks and shares; but I am aware that Captain Nichols was an outrageous liar, and I dare say {{there is not a}} word of truth in anything he told me. I should not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> he had never seen Strickland in his life, and owed his knowledge of Marseilles to the pages of a magazine.|$|E
60|$|Buzzy {{heard the}} words and leaped forward in a fresh effort. As he did this Henry looked behind him, and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> that both Dave and Barringford were nowhere in sight.|$|R

6000|$|The shallow honesty, {{as well as}} the besetting {{infirmity}} of Weucha, {{have already}} been exhibited. The reader, therefore, will not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the first to}} forget the regulations he had himself imposed. It was at the precise moment when we left Mahtoree yielding to his nearly ungovernable delight, as he surveyed the number and quality of Ishmael's beasts of burden, that the man he had selected to watch his captives chose to indulge in the malignant pleasure of tormenting those it was his duty to protect. Bending his head nigh the ear of the trapper, the savage rather muttered than whispered-- ...|$|E
6000|$|To be a saloon-keeper {{and kill}} a man was to be illustrious. Hence the reader will not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> more than one man was killed in Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation, so {{impatient}} was the slayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being held in indifferent repute by his associates. I knew two youths who tried to [...] "kill their men" [...] for no other reason--and got killed themselves for their pains. [...] "There goes the man that killed Bill Adams" [...] was higher praise and a sweeter sound in the ears {{of this sort of}} people than any other speech that admiring lips could utter.|$|E
60|$|The {{sun shone}} brightly; {{the tide was}} making--four jolly miles an hour; the wind blew steadily, with {{occasional}} squalls. For my part, I {{had never been in}} a canoe under sail in my life; and my first experiment {{out in the middle of}} this big river was not made without some trepidation. What would happen when the wind first caught my little canvas? I suppose it was almost as trying a venture into the regions of the unknown as to publish a first book, or to marry. But my doubts were not of long duration; and in five minutes you will not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>that</b> I had tied my sheet.|$|E
