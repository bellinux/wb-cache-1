The 819 eventually returned to the rails {{for a second time}} in April 1986 and operated annually to various points on the railroad (trips to Fordyce, Little Rock, St. Louis, Tyler and Athens) until making its final run between Tyler, Texas and Pine Bluff on October 17, 1993.

40|$|Coal is a {{strategic}} commodity in South Africa {{as it is}} the Primary source of energy in form of electricity and synthetic liquid-fuels. It is also a feedstock in the heavy industries that include steel, cement, aluminium smelters and paper. Its role in socio-economic development spans over 100 years. Therefore, the importance of coal supply chain cannot be overemphasised. The mining industry and the role players comprises the South African government, public and private enterprises. Hence, there is need for collaboration of the three parties in a public-private partnership (PPP) model to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency. The government role in the legislative environment, issuing of exploration, mining and water licenses among others is crucial for the industry. The state-owned corporations such as Transnet, the only national rail transport logistics company and electricity supply company (Eskom), the main electricity generating company and the leading customer/consumer of the South African coal underpins the extent of the state involvement in the industry. The private sector role of ownership of the coal-mines is dominated by the big five international organisations namely BHP Billiton, Anglo Coal, Xstrata/Glencore, Sasol and Exxaro and the black economic empowerment (BEE) companies or junior miners. The electricity and the liquid-fuels types of energy impact on all sectors of the economy. It is this complex relationship by all the role players in the coal-mining industry supply chain that requires enhanced collaboration in a PPP model to harmonise the entire operations in the value-chain. The relationship of the industry players was observed through the mining process, coal transportation to the domestic customers/consumers and export markets. The coal transport logistics infrastructures comprising conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>rail,</b> road and water were explored and constraints requiring PPP solutions identified...|$|R

40|$|As {{the near}} surface {{deposits}} are being mined out, underground mines will increasingly operate at greater depths. This {{will increase the}} challenges related to transporting materials from deeper levels to the surface. For many years, the ore and waste transportation from most deep underground mines has depended on {{some or all of}} the following: truck haulage, conveyor <b>belts,</b> shafts, <b>rails,</b> and ore pass systems. In sub-level caving, and where ore passes are used, trains operating on the main lower level transport the ore from ore passes to a crusher, for subsequent hoisting to the surface through the shaft system. In many mines, the use of the ore pass system has led to several problems related to the ore pass availability, causing production disturbances and incurred cost and time for ore pass rehabilitation. These production disturbances have an impact on the mining activities since they increase the operational costs, and lower the mine throughput. A continued dependency on rock mass transportation using ore passes will generate high capital costs for various supporting structures such as rail tracks, shaft extensions, and crushers for every new main level. This study was conducted at an existing underground mine and analyzed the transport of ore from loading areas at the lower levels up to the existing shaft points using trucks without employing ore passes. The results show that, when the costs of extending ore passes to lower levels become too great or ore passes cannot be used for production, haul trucks can be a feasible alternative method for transport of ore and waste up the ramp to the existing crusher located at the previous main level. The use of trucks will avoid installing infrastructure at the next main level and extending the ore passes to lower levels, hence reducing costs...|$|R
