5|$|The Manhattan Project {{became public}} {{knowledge}} after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer {{became a national}} spokesman for science who was emblematic of {{a new type of}} technocratic power. He became a household name and his face appeared on the covers of Life and Time. Nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons. Like many scientists of his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed United Nations, which could institute a program to stifle a nuclear arms race.|$|E
5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{that there was little}} hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority of}} the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|Although {{randomness}} {{had often}} {{been viewed as}} an obstacle and a nuisance for many centuries, in the 20th century computer scientists <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the deliberate introduction of randomness into computations {{can be an effective}} tool for designing better algorithms.

25|$|During WWII, it {{was found}} that 1 out of 8 men {{considered}} for military service was rejected based on a neurological or psychiatric problem. This increased awareness of the prevalence of mental illnesses, and people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the costs associated with admission to mental institutions (i.e. cost of lost productivity and of mental health services).|$|E

25|$|The near-Earth {{asteroid}} 433 Eros {{had been}} discovered {{as long ago as}} 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: 1221 Amor, 1862 Apollo, 2101 Adonis, and finally 69230 Hermes, which approached within 0.005 AU of Earth in 1937. Astronomers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the possibilities of Earth impact.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vehicles}} {{require only}} generalist maintenance, where any competent mechanic can properly maintain the vehicle. Certain vehicles — like Citroëns and Ferraris — require specialist care {{due to their}} unique design. While a sturdy car if maintained rigorously, the SM did require two sets of specialist care — Citroën specialists, which are widespread in Europe, and a rarer Maserati specialist, to keep the engine in tune. Once potential buyers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> this, sales dropped precipitously.|$|E

25|$|The Assemblies of God has {{its roots}} in the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves forced outside existing religious bodies. These people sought out their own places of worship and founded hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations. By 1914, many ministers and laymen alike <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> just how far-reaching the spread of the revival and of Pentecostalism had become. Concerned leaders felt the desire to protect and preserve the results of the revival by uniting through cooperative fellowship.|$|E
25|$|In 1854 the British Admiralty ordered 4,000 Navy Model Colt revolvers. In 1855 the British Army {{placed an}} order for 5,000 of these revolvers for army issue. Despite a {{following}} order {{later in the year}} for an additional 9,000 revolvers, Colt failed to convince the British to adopt his revolver as the issue sidearm for the army. Colt <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that British sales were failing to meet his expectations. Unable to justify the London factory’s expenses, Colt closed the London factory in 1856. Over the next few months his workmen crated and shipped the machinery and disassembled firearms back to America.|$|E

Mononutu initially did not have nationalistic ideals. However, after attending the association for Indonesian students in the Netherlands or Indische Vereeniging or Perhimpunan Indonesia, Mononutu <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the nationalism of Indonesia. He became more involved in the organization and was elected as vice president, the same period in which Mohammad Hatta was elected as treasurer.|$|E

25|$|As Santee's {{dramatic}} drawing {{became more}} widely published, and Lambrecht and Pogin ramped up their lobbying efforts, others <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{the advantages of}} the site. This included Mark Oyaas, founder of New Ballpark, Inc., a separate group of downtown Minneapolis business leaders, who sought to create a private financing plan for a stadium. They quickly settled on Rapid Park as their preferred ballpark site, which enhanced its visibility significantly. The Twins, however, completely ignored Rapid Park, and kept their distance from all of the ad hoc working groups. They would eventually go on record as believing that the Rapid Park site was too small and constrained to house the type of facility they sought to build.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decades of the 19th century further changes in {{northern}} Westchester negatively affected the West Somers church. The railroads began to spur suburbanization, as city residents who originally spent their summers and weekends in the area <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that they could live there full-time and commute to their jobs in the city via train. The growing city, in need of water, began acquiring large tracts of land, sometimes including whole communities, in the area through eminent domain, reducing {{the total amount of}} land available for development and thus driving up the value of what remained. This induced many of the area's farmers, the population from which West Somers had grown, to sell their farms for subdivision and development.|$|E
25|$|Prefontaine was a rambunctious person, {{even during}} his {{formative}} years. He was always moving around, partaking in different activities. In junior high, Prefontaine {{was on his}} school’s football and basketball teams, but was rarely allowed to play because of his short stature. In the eighth grade, he noticed several high school cross country team members jog to practice past the football field, an activity he then viewed as mundane. Later that year, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> {{he was able to}} compete well in longer distance races in his physical education class during a three-week conditioning period. By the second week of the daily mile runs, Prefontaine was able to finish second in the group. With this new-found success, {{he fell in love with}} cross country.|$|E
