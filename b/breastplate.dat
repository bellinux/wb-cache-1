Caligula {{was said to}} have taken Alexander's <b>breastplate</b> from the tomb for his own use. Around AD200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.|$|E
5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying {{one night in}} 1823. Smith said that this angel {{revealed}} {{the location of a}} buried book made of golden plates, as well as other artifacts, including a <b>breastplate</b> and a set of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had been hidden in a hill near his home. Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E
5|$|In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense created Programa Coraza 2000 (Program <b>Breastplate</b> 2000), {{which focused}} on the {{procurement}} and integration of new armament for the Spanish army's modernization. The program included the Leopard2E and the Pizarro infantry combat vehicle, {{as well as the}} Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter. The program's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard2A4s, which were leased to Spain in late 1995. Apart from procurement, Programa Coraza was meant to prepare the Spanish army logistically for the introduction of new matériel.|$|E

Later she usually wore a chain mail shirt along with the <b>breastplates.</b> Though generally depicted as a strong warrior woman, Bêlit was often shown in peril or in bondage on the covers, as was typical of pulp comic covers of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R

5|$|The Leopard 2E or Leopard 2A6E (E {{stands for}} España, Spanish for Spain) is {{a variant of}} the German Leopard 2 main battle tank, {{tailored}} to the requirements of the Spanish army, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named Programa Coraza, or Program <b>Breastplate.</b> The acquisition program for the Leopard2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a <b>breastplate,</b> sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E
5|$|Yet arguably his {{greatest}} diplomatic achievement was negotiating with Phraates IV of Parthia (37–2BC) in 20BC {{for the return}} of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus' defeat by military means. However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the <b>breastplate</b> design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor ('Mars the Avenger') built to house the standards.|$|E

5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, <b>breastplate</b> with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his political power and in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as {{a small price to pay}} to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the <b>breastplate</b> scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E
5|$|The equestrians, {{the highest}} social class of all, served in mounted units known as equites. The first {{class of the}} richest {{citizens}} served as heavy infantry with swords and long spears (resembling hoplites), and provided {{the first line of}} the battle formation. The second class were armed similarly to the first class, but without a <b>breastplate</b> for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind the first class when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E

5|$|The {{style of}} warfare between the Greek city-states, which dates back {{until at least}} 650 BC (as dated by the 'Chigi vase'), was based around the hoplite phalanx {{supported}} by missile troops. The 'hoplites' were foot soldiers usually drawn from {{the members of the}} middle-classes (in Athens called the zeugites), who could afford the equipment necessary to fight in this manner. The heavy armour usually included a <b>breastplate</b> or a linothorax, greaves, a helmet, and a large round, concave shield (the aspis or hoplon). Hoplites were armed with long spears (the dory), which were significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos). The heavy armour and longer spears made them superior in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks. Lightly armed skirmishers, the psiloi also comprised a part of Greek armies growing in importance during the conflict; at the Battle of Plataea, for instance, they may have formed over half the Greek army. Use of cavalry in Greek armies is not reported in the battles of the Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{style of}} warfare had been honed over the {{preceding}} centuries. It {{revolved around the}} hoplite, members of the middle-classes (the zeugites) who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner. The hoplite was, {{by the standards of}} the time, heavily armoured, with a <b>breastplate</b> (originally bronze, but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version), greaves, a full helmet, and a large round shield (the aspis). Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the doru), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos). Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields, and spears, to the enemy. Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon; on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx. The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however. The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there was a reasonable chance the armour would.|$|E
5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and begs the father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining <b>breastplate.</b> The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of Pluto Press AustraliaAt first glance, <b>breastplates</b> {{might seem to}} be just another device in the technology of colonial capture in Australia. Take the photograph of Bilin Bilin wearing a plate inscribed 'Jackey Jackey - King of the Logan and Pimpama'. The plate, the chain and the conventions of photography produce a Yugambeh elder as a shackled criminal on display - he is both a primitive in tableau and one of 'the usual suspects'. The image seems to both document captivity and evoke those 'frontier photographs' of Aboriginal prisoners in the desert bound together with heavy chains attached to manacles around their necks.
