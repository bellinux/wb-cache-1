25|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2005, Karam {{released}} a new single and video clip called Shu Jani. Shu Jani was a contemporary pop song, with the use of traditional Lebanese instruments. The video was filmed in the Faraya ski resort in Lebanon by director Sa'aed el-Marouk. It was to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> upcoming 2005 album. The timing of the new clip was criticised in some tabloids, because it was released during the tense electoral season in Lebanon, and the so-called Cedar Revolution (Independence Intifada). It was argued by these tabloids that it was disrespectful for Karam to release new material at such a time. Karam defended herself by putting the claim on her Saudi production company, Rotana, who she says fast tracked the release against her wishes. Even though there was some controversy surrounding Shu Jani, it fared well with the public.|$|E

500|$|Varahi {{is usually}} {{depicted}} with her characteristic sow {{face on a}} human body with a black complexion comparable to a storm cloud. The scholar Donaldson informs us that the association of a sow and a woman is seen derogatory for the latter, but the association is also used in curses to protect [...] "land from invaders, new rulers and trespassers". Rarely, she is described as holding the Earth on her tusks, similar to Varaha. She wears the , a conical basket-shaped crown. Varahi can be depicted as standing, seated, or dancing. [...] Varahi is often depicted pot-bellied and with full breasts, while most all other Matrikas – except Chamunda – are depicted as slender and beautiful. One belief suggests that since Varahi is identified with the Yoganidra of Vishnu, who holds the universe in her womb (Bhugarbha Paranmesvari Jagaddhatri), {{that she should be}} shown as pot-bellied. Another theory suggests that the pot-belly reflects a [...] "maternal aspect", which Donaldson describes as [...] "curious" [...] because Varahi and Chamunda [...] "best exemplify" [...] the terrible aspect of the Divine Mother. A notable exception is the depiction of Varahi as human-faced and slender at the sixth-century Rameshvara cave (Cave 21), the Ellora Caves. She is depicted here as part of the group of seven Matrikas. A third eye and/or a crescent moon is described to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> forehead.|$|E
