2500|$|The {{location}} {{shooting was}} mostly completed at Zaccariello's Sabaudia beach {{house and its}} outlying property. Bava {{had to resort to}} various camera tricks to convince the audience that an entire forest existed when in fact, only a few scattered trees were at the location. Betti recalled, [...] "All of this had to occur in a forest. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> it? Bava said, 'Don't worry. I will do the forest.' And he found a florist who was selling these little stupid branches with little bits of foliage on them, and he began to make them dance in front of the camera! We had to act the scenes strictly in front of those branchesâ€”if we moved even an inch either way, the 'woods' would disappear!" ...|$|E
60|$|Father Gibault came back. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> Hamilton? This was the disquieting thing.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> Guy Waring? Dead? Dead? Or run away? Had his half-brother, in this utmost need, then, so basely deserted him? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>were</b> Fred Ellice and Tom Singleton {{all this}} time? {{the reader will}} {{probably}} ask.|$|R

60|$|Richard <b>was</b> the victor, <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>were</b> the gratulations? Young John's hearty but slender hurrah {{was lost}} in the general silence.|$|R

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> {{the tyrant}} Queen while this scene of {{butchery}} was being enacted? In her chamber in the palace--comparatively, yet not altogether, {{regardless of the}} matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "it is you, <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> it taken? How does {{it happen}} that The Sheik's {{daughter}} is clothed in the garments of the unbeliever?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] he said gratefully, [...] "where I <b>am.</b> <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>am</b> I at--I mean, <b>where</b> <b>am</b> I? Oh, yes, in the chart-room. Well, some people--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A {{most notable}} comrade, good Okematan; <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> we to find him, for I know nobody who comes near to that description." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{could hardly}} have {{supplied}} the gentlemen with a leg, or an arm, each. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> the boat all this time--you had the light-house boat in tow, I suppose?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> Massissauga? Several {{settlements}} {{had been}} passed, the houses looking clean and white in forest openings, with fields where the lovely spring green of young maize charmed the eye.|$|E
6000|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, {{a large crowd}} assembled at the fairy's palace, which was decorated with the sweetest flowers, known only to fairyland. Toupette had taken her place, <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> the bridegroom? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, but,' Merton broke in, 'this want is {{so widely}} felt, acutely felt too: hair {{is not in}} it. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> the accomplices?' ...|$|R
60|$|Leonore. Where {{art thou}} leading me, dear Louis? Thy hiding-place is a {{pleasant}} one, <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> Norna? I thought {{she waited for}} us.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{wonder how}} this will end?" [...] said he of the {{beautiful}} voice, which had even fascinated the steady Freya herself. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> its charming timbre now? These words had sounded like a raven's croak.|$|E
6000|$|I might {{appeal to}} the Egyptian. I might tell her even what I shuddered to tell him. She cared for him, I was sure, well enough {{to have the courage}} to give him up. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> I to find her? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> he {{to go by}} himself? He {{could not}} go abroad alone; the sea upset his liver; he hated hotels. Roger went to a hydropathic--he {{was not going to}} begin that at his time of life, those new-fangled places we're all humbug! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I see. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>are</b> the others, {{and what}} is this dreadful place? Are we buried alive, Leonard? It looks like a tomb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it would}} seem, {{if your father}} is telling you secrets {{all the time you}} <b>are</b> smoking together. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> this land, Dirck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--to be sure--the image o' me! <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>is</b> the other? Why {{that one}} only?... That {{performance}} of theirs killed her, but kept me alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned and}} sped {{like a deer}} back to where I had seen the lace. All the way the {{footprints}} went before me. Now I was there. Yes, the wrapping was hers, {{and it had been}} rent as though by a rude hand; <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> she? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> {{the heavenly}} Father? Far {{away in the}} clear sky, in the highest heaven beyond all suns and stars? Silent and idle, caring for no one on earth, content in himself, and leaving sinful man to himself to go to ruin as he chose? ...|$|E
60|$|What {{was to be}} done? Their arquebuses were {{of little}} use; for the Spaniards were behind a strong bulkhead. There were cannon: <b>but</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> powder or shot?

6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> Merry? Mr Pecksniff didn't ask the {{question}} in reproach, but in a vein of mildness touched with a gentle sorrow. She was upstairs, reading on the parlour couch. Ah! Domestic details had no charms for HER. 'But call her down,' said Mr Pecksniff, with a placid resignation. 'Call her down, my love.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{lay still}} against him, taking his {{physical}} warmth without heed. It was great confirmation {{for him to}} feel her there, absorbing the warmth from him, giving him back her weight and her strange confidence. <b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> she, that she seemed so absent? His mind was open with wonder. He did not know her.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>where</b> <b>was</b> David Boone {{all this}} time? Rather say, {{where was he}} not? Everywhere by turns, and nowhere long, was David to be seen, in the frenzy of his excitement. Conscience-smitten, {{for what he had}} done, or rather {{intended}} to do, he ran wildly about, making the most desperate efforts to extinguish the fire.|$|E
