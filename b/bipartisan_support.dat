5|$|In December 2014, {{authorization}} for {{a national}} historical park designation was incorporated in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Despite opposition from some legislators, the bill passed with <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support,</b> and {{was signed into law}} by the President on December 19, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support,</b> and was popular with the public.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions. However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, has received <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support.</b> Some Congressional Republicans argued against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.|$|E
50|$|Mirroring the <b>bipartisan</b> congressional <b>support</b> for the interventions, polls, {{notwithstanding}} varying qualifications, show {{majorities of}} Americans supporting air strike in Iraq.|$|R
50|$|Human Rights First {{launched}} its End Torture Now campaign in 2004. Posner and Human Rights First led the advocacy efforts {{in support of}} the McCain Amendment which bans U.S. soldiers and officials from engaging in cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The amendment won broad <b>bipartisan</b> congressional <b>support</b> and was signed into law in December 2005.|$|R

5|$|The {{bill was}} seen as entirely {{innocuous}} when it was introduced on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support,</b> and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20.|$|E
5|$|To face an {{opposition}} that was becoming uncooperative {{was not what}} Playford has expected, or could satisfactorily handle. Before the effect Dunstan had on Parliament, Playford would meet with Labor leaders to discuss bills, and ensure <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support</b> in the House of Assembly for them; there was little discordance on matters. The belligerents were previously only rural independent members.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2013, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Burwell {{to be the}} Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. A {{confirmation hearing}} was held on April10. Burwell's nomination received <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support,</b> culminating in the U.S. Senate confirming Burwell as Director by a 96–0 vote. With her confirmation, Burwell became only the second woman to serve as OMB Director, the first being Alice Rivlin, who held the position from 1994 to 1996.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{previous}} Labour government, its Prime Minister Helen Clark maintained New Zealand's nuclear-free zone status, a <b>bipartisan</b> position <b>supported</b> {{by the opposition}} New Zealand National Party. In a 2008 survey, 19% of New Zealanders favouring nuclear as a power source, more than both gas and coal power, but well behind wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectricity.|$|R
50|$|The Institute {{has been}} part of a <b>bipartisan</b> {{coalition}} <b>supporting</b> criminal-justice reform in Illinois. In 2015, the Institute supported Illinois House Bill 218, which would decriminalize marijuana in the state. The Institute has also supported police reforms such as body cameras. In 2015, the Illinois General Assembly passed a law approving the use of police body cameras statewide.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many trade agreements, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement enjoyed widespread, <b>bipartisan,</b> and multisectoral <b>support.</b> Proponents {{pointed to}} the {{reduction}} of customs duties and other trade barriers as a boon for exports.|$|R
5|$|Obama {{was elected}} to the Illinois Senate in 1996, {{succeeding}} Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn. Once elected, Obama gained <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support</b> for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support</b> of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton assumed {{control in}} the War department, and the rift between Adams' and Hamilton's {{supporters}} widened. Many sought to vest Hamilton with command authority over the army, and they also resisted giving prominent Democratic-Republicans positions in the army, which Adams wanted {{to do in order}} to gain <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support.</b> By building a large standing army, Hamilton's supporters raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Overall, however, patriotic sentiments and a series of naval victories, popularized the war as well as the president.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} [...] "a fair go" [...] {{has been found}} to be the most highly rated value on a recent {{published}} survey of the opinion of Australian citizens. This belief sustains <b>bipartisan</b> political <b>support</b> for strong public health and education systems in Australia, as well as equal opportunity legislation to ensure people are not excluded from jobs or positions by their race, gender or sexual orientation.|$|R
5000|$|Rahall, {{along with}} other Lebanese-American lawmakers, {{expressed}} concern with a <b>bipartisan</b> resolution <b>supporting</b> Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict without adding language urging restraint against civilian targets. He helped draft a resolution that urged [...] "all parties to protect innocent life and civilian infrastructure." [...] Rahall {{was one of only}} 8 House members to vote against a resolution supporting Israel's right to defend itself, which was supported by 410 House members.|$|R
5000|$|The US Senate {{was also}} {{involved}} in the issue. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced the Internet Nondiscrimination Act of 2006, and Sens. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) were expected to introduce a <b>bipartisan</b> amendment <b>supporting</b> Net Neutrality when the Senate took up its own rewrite (the [...] "Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006", aka S. 2686 http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN02686:@@@X) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 later that year.|$|R
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support</b> would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{personal}} expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. He won <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support</b> for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the Marshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the CIA and the National Security Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the National Security Agency (NSA).|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} malapportionment {{had grown to}} a level in excess of 3:1 in favour of rural areas, and Hall, having won the 1968 state {{election}} on 46 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote, committed himself to a fairer electoral system. Previously 39 members were elected: 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country. Hall's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors, and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter. A second proposal, for 47 seats with 19 in the country, was adopted with <b>bipartisan</b> <b>support</b> in the House of Assembly, but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council. The new system would make an LCL win near-impossible at the coming 1970 state election, and Hall and the LCL were aware of it. For his weakening of rural constituencies, Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system. Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform {{to cope with the}} removal of an artificial situation.|$|E
40|$|Since 1997, {{proposals}} {{for a federal}} patients 2 ̆ 7 bill of rights have enjoyed strong, <b>bipartisan</b> political <b>support,</b> from Congress, presidential candidates, and the two major political parties in their party platforms. Despite widespread approval, nothing has been adopted, and, furthermore, nothing has even come close. This Article examines developments in markets, state law, and federal court decisions that attest to the continued need for a federal patients 2 ̆ 7 bill of rights...|$|R
50|$|He <b>supported</b> <b>bipartisan</b> issues, such {{as federal}} {{campaign}} finance reform (Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold). He voted against NAFTA, but voted for CAFTA {{as a means to}} help reverse abject poverty and hunger, and ease potential political unrest in impoverished Latin America.|$|R
50|$|In the 112th Congress and the 113th Congress, Petri {{introduced}} the ExCEL Act, {{which would have}} created a universal income-contingent student loan repayment process, where students repaid loans based on their after college earnings.

50|$|The {{package was}} the Federal government's {{response}} to the Territory government's publication of Little Children are Sacred, but implemented only two out of ninety-seven of the report's recommendations. The response has been criticised, but also received <b>bipartisan</b> parliamentary <b>support.</b> The then Prime Minister Julia Gillard has supported the response, though her predecessor (and successor) Kevin Rudd did make some adjustments to its implementation. The Emergency Response has since {{been replaced by the}} very similar Stronger Futures Policy.|$|R

25|$|At {{least one}} {{component}} of the Reagan Doctrine technically pre-dated the Reagan Presidency. In Afghanistan, the Carter administration began providing limited covert military assistance to Afghanistan's mujahideen {{in an effort to}} drive the Soviets out of the nation, or at least raise the military and political cost of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The policy of aiding the mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation was originally proposed by Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and was implemented by U.S. intelligence services. It enjoyed broad <b>bipartisan</b> political <b>support.</b>|$|R

40|$|We are {{fortunate}} to have <b>bipartisan</b> political <b>support</b> for enhancing trade and cultural links with our region in the so-called Asian Century. But do we have similar consensus when dealing with those from Asia who have found a temporary or permanent home in Australia? According to the latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia is now home to nearly 2 million people of Asian origin. Moreover, {{they are on the}} brink of overtaking European-born migrants {{for the first time in}} the nation’s history. Also of significance is that this crop has been recruited largely from students and skilled migrants, thereby distinguishing them from previous “waves”...|$|R
