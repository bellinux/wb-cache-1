5|$|For {{that entire}} day the Comanches plundered and burned buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds and <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded {{large numbers of}} cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback in his {{official}} career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125–144) ascended to the throne. His intensive astronomical work was rewarded {{only with the}} rank and salary of 600bushels, or shi, of grain (mostly commuted to coin cash or <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> silk). To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000bushels during the Han. The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.|$|E
30|$|In actual timber structures, {{members are}} often {{connected}} with multiple bolts, {{and the lead}} holes of the members are usually not smaller than the bolt diameter to facilitate assembly. The shear strength <b>of</b> multiple <b>bolted</b> joints has been investigated by numerous researchers [37]. In {{the case of a}} wood member subjected to a lateral force parallel to the grain with a single row <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> in the loading direction, the maximum loads per <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>bolted</b> joints with steel side plates and an l/d ratio of 2.5 were almost the same when the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> ranged from one to three [38]. When the l/d ratio was four, the ultimate load per bolt decreased when four or more bolts were used, whereas with an l/d ratio of 6 – 8, it decreased as the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> increased from one to six [33]. With an l/d ratio of four, the load-carrying capacity per <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>bolted</b> joints with wood side members decreased when the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> was three or more, and that with an l/d ratio of six decreased when the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> was five or more [39]. The yield and ultimate loads per <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>bolted</b> joints with steel slotted-in plates and an l/d ratio of 6.3 decreased as the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> increased from one to six, and the decreasing rate of the yield load per bolt with {{the increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> was almost equal to that of the ultimate load [40]. In the case <b>of</b> <b>bolted</b> joints subjected to a lateral force perpendicular to the grain with a single row <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> perpendicular to the loading direction, the ultimate load per <b>bolt</b> <b>of</b> <b>bolted</b> joints with steel slotted-in plates and an l/d ratio of 6.9 decreased when the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> was two or more [40]. On the whole, the shear strengths <b>of</b> multiple <b>bolted</b> joints were smaller than that <b>of</b> a single <b>bolted</b> joint multiplied by the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts.</b> However, the relations between the shear strengths <b>of</b> <b>bolted</b> joints and the number <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> differed between reports. The different results might have been caused by the relations between the joint configurations, joint geometry, and characteristics of the wood species.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} two decades, the {{relationship}} between the Liao and Song continued to deteriorate. The Liao were continuously informed of Song attempts to create military alliances with other groups sharing a border with the Liao, and minor border skirmishes were common. Beginning in 999 Emperor Shengzong of Liao led a series of campaigns against the Song that, while generally successful on the battlefield, failed to secure anything of value from the Song. This changed in 1004 when Emperor Shengzong led a campaign that rapidly worked its way to right outside of the Song capital of Kaifeng by only conquering cities that quickly folded to the Liao army, while avoiding protracted sieges of the cities that resisted heavily. Emperor Zhenzong of Song marched out and met the Liao at Chanyuan, a small city on the Yellow River. In January 1005 the two dynasties signed the Chanyuan Treaty, which stipulated that the Song would give the Liao 200,000 <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> silk and 100,000 ounces of silver each year, that the two emperors would address each other as equals, that they would finalize the location of their disputed border, and that the two dynasties would resume cordial relations. While the sums (referred to as gifts by the Song and as tributes by the Liao) were later increased to 300,000 <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> silk and 200,000 ounces of silver per year out of Song fears that the Liao might form a military alliance with the Western Xia, no major wars were fought between the Liao and Song for over a century following the signing of the treaty. By signing the treaty the Song dynasty functionally ceded its claim over the sixteen prefectures.|$|E
5|$|Raziel retains most of {{the powers}} he possessed in the {{previous}} game, such as the abilities to glide, climb walls, fire <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> telekinetic energy, and swim. To sustain his strength and travel between the planes, he must devour souls; this is typically accomplished by defeating enemies. The game's combat consists of a hack and slash system, entailing the use of combinations of attacks before executing a finishing move. Human enemies exist only in the material world, and include mercenaries, demon hunters, and the Sarafan, a monastic order of vampire hunters; other material creatures include dogs, thralls, and mutants. Sluagh are enemies who exclusively inhabit the spirit world, whereas cross-planar beings such as demons and shades can pursue the player between both realms. Enemies leave behind souls when killed, which replenish Raziel's health once consumed.|$|E
5|$|The Jurchens were a Tungusic-speaking {{group of}} semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of {{northeast}} Asia {{that are now}} part of Northeast China. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the Liao dynasty (907–1125), an empire ruled by the nomadic Khitans that included most of modern Mongolia, a portion of North China, Northeast China, northern Korea, and parts of the Russian Far East. To the south of the Liao lay the Han Chinese Song Empire (960–1276). The Song and Liao were at peace, but since a military defeat to the Liao in 1005, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> silk and 100,000 ounces of silver.|$|E

The line {{bisecting}} the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford {{from east to west}} and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|While The Loves of the Plants {{celebrates the}} natural world and {{advances}} several scientific hypotheses regarding {{the formation of the}} cosmos, the moon and the earth, The Economy of Vegetation celebrates scientific progress and technological innovation, such as the forging of steel, the invention of the steam engine and the improvements to gunpowder. It depicts scientists and inventors, such as Benjamin Franklin, responsible for this progress as the heroes of a new age; he “mythologizes” them. The poem at some points goes further, into what would now be called science fiction, forecasting that the British Empire will have giant steam-powered airships ("The flying-chariot through the fields of air. Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above") and far-ranging submarines ("Britain's sons shall guide | Huge sea-balloons beneath the tossing tide; The diving castles, roof'd with spheric glass, Ribb'd with strong oak, and barr'd with <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> brass, Buoy'd with pure air shall endless tracks pursue").|$|E

5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be learned, and solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Vesperia is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in a}} fantasy world featuring three-dimensional environments and characters. The game's environments are split into two types. On the field map, the main characters navigate reduced-scale environments. A compass and mini-map are displayed, along with towns, other named locations, and enemy icons. Striking an enemy icon triggers a battle, while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it. In battle and towns or similar locations, characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters. In these areas, the party may interact with non-player characters (NPCs). Within these environments, items such as crates came be moved by the currently-assigned character. After {{a certain point in}} the game, an item called the Sorcerer's Ring is given to the party, enabling them to shoot <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> energy. These bolts can be used to activate switches, move objects, and attack enemies from a distance. Save points can be found in dungeons and towns. Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald, the in-game currency. While in environments, players can trigger optional character conversations called Skits. In Skits, characters are represented by head-and-shoulder portraits, and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots <b>bolts</b> <b>of</b> fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E
