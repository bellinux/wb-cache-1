60|$|In {{the midst}} of all this pageantry, the beautiful, but afflicted Duchess of Lorraine made her {{approach}} to the throne. She was dressed in black, and closely veiled; for duennas of the most staid and severe aspect, and six <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselles,</b> formed her female attendants. She was guarded by several very ancient, withered, and grayheaded cavaliers; and her train was borne by one of the most deformed and diminutive dwarfs in existence.|$|R
6000|$|After {{visiting the}} Luxembourg, I resorted to {{the gardens of}} the Tuileries. The {{thermometer}} was at about eighty degrees in the shade. From {{the number of people}} assembled one would have thought, if {{it had been in the}} United States, that some great mass convention was coming off. Under the impenetrable screen of the trees, in the dark, cool, refreshing shade, are thousands of chairs, for which one pays two cents apiece. Whole families come, locking up their door, bringing the baby, work, dinner, or lunch, take a certain number of chairs, and spend the day. As far as eye can reach you see a multitude seated, as if in church, with other multitudes moving to and fro, while boys and girls without number are frolicking, racing, playing ball, driving hoop, &c., but contriving to do it without making a hideous racket. How French children are taught to play and enjoy themselves without disturbing every body else, is a mystery. [...] "C'est gentil" [...] seems to be a talismanic spell; and [...] "Ce n'est pas gentil ça" [...] is sufficient to check every rising irregularity. O that some savant would write a book and tell us how it is done! I gazed for half an hour on the spectacle. A more charming sight my eyes never beheld. There were grayheaded old men, and women, and invalids; and there were <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselles</b> working worsted, embroidery, sewing; men reading papers; and, in fact, people doing every thing they would do in their own parlors. And all were graceful, kind, and obliging; not a word nor an act of impoliteness or indecency. No wonder the French adore Paris, thought I; in no other city in the world is a scene like this possible! No wonder that their hearts die within them at thoughts of exile in the fens of Cayenne! ...|$|R
60|$|Men passing {{down the}} room tried {{to attract the}} {{attention}} of the <b>beautiful</b> young English <b>demoiselle</b> who looked out upon the little scene so indifferently as regarded individuals, and yet with such eager interest as a whole. No one was bold enough, however, to make a second effort. Necessity at times gives birth to a swift capacity. Fresh from her simple country life, Phyllis found herself still able with effortless serenity to confound the most hardened boulevarders who paused to ogle her. Her eyes and lips expressed with ease the most convincing and absolute indifference to their approaches. A man may sometimes brave anger; he rarely has courage to combat indifference. So Phyllis held her own and waited.|$|R
50|$|The <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx virgo) is a European damselfly. It {{is often}} found along fast-flowing waters {{where it is}} most at home.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally the golden-ringed {{dragonfly}} (Cordulegaster boltoni) and <b>Beautiful</b> <b>Demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx virgo), {{a type of}} damselfly, {{can be seen by}} streams in the Harz.|$|E
50|$|The dark wing {{patch of}} the male starts at the nodus (the slight dip midway down the upper edge of the wing) but can reach up to the wing-tip in {{southern}} races. In the very similar <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx virgo), the dark patch starts before the nodus.|$|E
5000|$|The habitat {{that the}} adults occupy, {{corresponds}} to the nearby larval habitat. Unlike the adults of the banded demoiselle you meet those of the <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> but also in forest clearings, but very rarely {{on the banks of}} larger ponds. As resting places, the animals need trees and shrubs, often resting on high herbaceous plants such as the large nettle ( [...] Urtica Dioica [...] ).The breeding habitats are similar to the Larval habitat, these are cool, shady water-courses largely with a more or less strong current and near-natural vegetation and bank structure. This is mostly meadow and pasture streams in the area, they rarely pass through the forest. A distinct riparian vegetation also plays a role as a windbreak. Due to their broad wings the <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> can be blown away by the wind more easily than other species of dragonflies.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> covers all of Europe {{with the exception of}} the southwestern Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands and Iceland. In the north it extends to the Arctic polar sea, and thus much further north than that of the banded demoiselle. On the North African Mediterranean coast, its southern populations in Morocco and Algeria can be found.The northern boundary in Asia following the 13-°C July isotherm, it is therefore not in the areas where the average temperature in summer below 13 °C falls, otherwise they are met with in temperate and cool regions in the entire continent with the exception of deserts and the mountains of. The eastern subspecies of C. v. japonica found on the Japanese islands is under debate as to whether it is a separate species.The <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> is mostly found in lowland locations. Regular findings come from areas up to a maximum height of 980 m above sea level. Occasionally they may be found up to 1,200 meters in altitude, such as in the Alps.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of the <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> develop over 10 to 12 stages, each {{of which}} takes place between a molt. The body length is {{variable}} and highly dependent on environmental conditions. The final stage (F-0-stage) larvae are 3.5 to 4.6 millimeters and weigh about 4 milligrams, slightly below the banded demoiselle. Apart from the larvae of the demoiselles are difficult to distinguish from each other, the apparent differences lie mainly in the bristles and {{the severity of the}} tracheal gills on their abdomen. Compared to other damselflies demoiselles larvae fall immediately on the other hand, due to their much shorter mean gill lamella.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E
5000|$|The {{geographical}} distribution of {{many species of}} invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area. Viviparid snails and water scorpions (of the genus Nepidae) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay. Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around Brockham and the tributaries which run over the Wealden Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies, caddisflies, fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles.The <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (Calopteryx virgo) disappeared from the River Mole during the 1960s owing to deteriorating water quality, but has since recolonised. The white-legged damselfly (Platycnemis pennipes) is also found along {{the river and the}} downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) is found between Box Hill and Leatherhead. [...] The Mole is one of only three locations in England where the river shingle beetle (Meotica anglica) is found.|$|E
40|$|Co-occurrence of {{closely related}} species can cause {{behavioral}} interference in mating and increase hybridization risk. Theoretically, this {{could lead to the}} evolution of more species-specific mate preferences and sexual signaling traits. Alternatively, females can learn to reject heterospecific males, to avoid male sexual interference from {{closely related species}}. Such learned mate discrimination could also affect conspecific mate preferences if females generalize from between species differences to prefer more species-specific mating signals. Female damselflies of the banded demoiselle (Calopteryx splendens) learn to reject heterospecific males of the <b>beautiful</b> <b>demoiselle</b> (C. virgo) through direct premating interactions. These two species co-occur in a geographic mosaic of sympatric and microallopatric populations. Whereas C. virgo males have fully melanized wings, male C. splendens wings are partly melanized. We show that C. splendens females in sympatry with C. virgo prefer smaller male wing patches in conspecific males after learning to reject heterospecific males. In contrast, allopatric C. splendens females with experimentally induced experience with C. virgo males did not discriminate against larger male wing patches. Wing patch size might indicate conspecific male quality in allopatry. Co-occurrence with C. virgo therefore causes females to prefer conspecific male traits that are more species specific, contributing to population divergence and geographic variation in female mate preferences...|$|E
