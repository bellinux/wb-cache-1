40|$|The grass-dwelling beetle fauna of five Pennsylvania and Maryland {{serpentine}} <b>barrens</b> {{of varying}} sizes was sampled in effort {{to assess whether}} these areas serve as refugia for rare beetle species. A number of serpentine <b>barrens</b> species show an unusual disjunct distribution, with populations in Eastern serpentine <b>barrens</b> and Midwestern prairies, and {{it was hypothesized that}} serpentine beetle species would possess a similar distribution. The number of beetle species found in each <b>barrens</b> was compared with the number of serpentine-restricted plant species in the <b>barrens</b> and the <b>barrens</b> size. The distribution of the beetles captured was analyzed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to search for patterns in the distribution. A total of 13 families and 44 species were collected, of which 27 were fully identified to species. Three rare beetle species new to Pennsylvania, Longitarsus arenaceus, Graphops varians, and Cephaloscymnus z. zimmermani were found in serpentine <b>barrens.</b> Of the 27 identified species, three possessed a disjunct distribution between Eastern serpentine <b>barrens</b> and the Midwest. The number of serpentine-restricted plant in each <b>barrens</b> did not exhibit a significant relationship with the number of beetle species in each <b>barrens</b> when examined using correlation analysis. A linear regression comparing <b>barrens</b> size and the number of beetle species captured, however, was positive and marginally significant, suggesting that the size of a <b>barrens</b> is the most important predictor of the number of beetle species present. DCA showed a close relationship between the three rare species new to Pennsylvania and two of the five serpentine <b>barrens</b> sampled, New Texas and Pilot <b>barrens,</b> suggesting that these <b>barrens</b> should receive priority for conservation purposes. Potential future research on serpentine beetle diversity is discussed...|$|R
40|$|To compare {{adjacent}} post oak flatwoods and <b>barrens</b> {{communities in}} south-western Indiana, we used vegetational, environmental and fire history data in multivariate analyses. <b>Barrens</b> had greater dominance by post oak and lower tree species richness, but variation in tree species composition was not {{strongly related to}} soil moisture, litter depth or other environmental gradients measured. Tree growth has been slow and variable, with little difference between the <b>barrens</b> and flatwoods. <b>Barrens</b> and flatwoods differ in herb species composition, but with considerable overlap. In the <b>barrens,</b> herbaceous vegetation composition was correlated with tree basal area, litter depth and soil moisture; in the flatwoods, it was correlated with soil moisture and microelevation. The <b>barrens</b> and flatwoods differed only slightly but significantly in environment: <b>barrens</b> soils were drier in June 1986 than flatwoods soils. Data from fire-scarred trees show no clear evidence of differences in frequency or extent of fire between the flatwoods and <b>barrens.</b> Multistemmed post oaks in the <b>barrens</b> indicate that past cutting {{may have contributed to}} these openings within the closed canopy flatwoods matrix...|$|R

40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{was used}} during summer 1997 {{to determine whether}} vegetation patterns follow predicted soil moisture gradients in the Pocono till <b>barrens,</b> a rare species-rich assemblage of pine <b>barrens</b> in northeastern Pennsylvania that occurs disproportionately on deposits of Illinoisan glacial till. The results provide insights into {{the relative importance of}} disturbance and abiotic factors in determining vegetation patterns and dynamics and have implications for <b>barrens</b> protection and management. Soils of <b>barrens</b> and adjacent forests did not differ in water content over all depths and drought conditions, and in the upper 15 cm of soil <b>barrens</b> on bedrock had slightly higher water contents than <b>barrens</b> on Illinoisan till. It can be inferred from these results, contrary to prevailing views, that xeric soil conditions do not maintain the barrens/forest distinction on the southern Pocono Plateau. Vegetation-driven processes that encourage wildfire and restrict nitrogen availability may instead be responsible for <b>barrens</b> maintenance. Relatively mesic conditions could explain the rapid succession of Pocono <b>barrens</b> into woodlands that has occurred since fire suppression [...] particularly in areas over bedrock. Furthermore, soils of distinct <b>barrens</b> types that were thought previously to follow moisture gradients did not differ in water content, although the abundance and diversity of wetland indicator plant species does vary between <b>barrens</b> types. Frost pockets may favor the persistence of heathlands in topographic depressions, with rhodora <b>barrens,</b> which support a greater abundance and diversity of wetland indicator species, occurring in areas subject to periodic flooding not apparent during summer 1997. Mesic soils and the historical importance of wildfire in the Pocono till <b>barrens</b> make prescribed burning a particularly appropriate management strategy for biodiversity conservation...|$|R

40|$|Distinct <b>barrens</b> {{and forest}} {{vegetation}} types grow {{in close proximity}} on the Pocono Plateau of northeastern Pennsylvania. This study investigated whether organic chemicals produced by ericaceous shrubs in the <b>barrens</b> inhibit the growth of forest tree species. Germination of Betula populifolia (Gray birch, Marshall, Betulaceae) and Tsuga canadensis, (Eastern hemlock, L., Pinaceae) were not inhibited by aqueous extracts of <b>barrens</b> leaf litter or organic soil. Activated carbon applied to tree seedlings planted in the <b>barrens</b> and forest reduced mortality of Acer rubrum (Red maple, L., Aceraceae), Prunus serotina (Black cherry, Ehrh., Rosaceae), and Betula lenta (Sweet birch, L., Betulaceae) in the <b>barrens</b> {{but not in the}} forest. It increased the growth of Acer and Prunus seedlings in the <b>barrens,</b> but did not increase their growth in the forest. Organic chemicals that were absorbed by activated carbon in this experiment may contribute to the persistence of distinct forest and <b>barrens</b> vegetation types.

5|$|The {{northern}} part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for the lack timber there. For the first decades of settlement, settlers refused to purchase the land in the barrens because it was considered too far from the timber needed to build homes, fires, fences, and other necessities. The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest <b>barren</b> ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The Central <b>Barren</b> covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19thcentury, settlers began to discover that the barrens were among the most fertile farmlands in the state, and they quickly filled up with landholders. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20thcentury the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.|$|E
40|$|The species-rich Pocono heath <b>barrens</b> {{unexpectedly}} persist on {{a similar}} soil type and moisture regime as adjacent forests. Field and greenhouse experiments evaluated the hypothesis that <b>barrens</b> fragments have persisted despite forty years of fire suppression because the <b>barrens</b> plants alter nitrogen cycling, lowering mineral nitrogen levels and inhibiting invasion by most forest species. A greenhouse test using Carex pensylvanica suggests {{that there may be}} less available nitrogen in <b>barrens</b> soil than in forest soil. The difference in available nitrogen seems to be large enough to cause a physiological response in Carex pensylvanica growth, indicating that the difference is biologically significant. However, a bioassay of nitrogen uptake by fine roots of Acer rubrum and Amelanchier spp. suggests that i the few trees growing in the <b>barrens</b> are no more nitrogen stressed than those in the forest. It seems likely that these trees are able to invade the <b>barrens</b> because they are able to tolerate low nitrogen conditions. Because of this trait, Acer rubrum may be a key species in transitions from <b>barrens</b> to forest...|$|R
