In the absence of historical facts, mediaeval chroniclers provided their own details for Æthelberht's ancestry, life as king and death {{at the hands of}} Offa. His feast day is 20 May. Several Norfolk, Suffolk and West Country parish churches are dedicated to the saint.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the committee.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1995, {{the monsoon}} trough was active across the Bay of Bengal, with several {{associated}} circulations. A disturbance near the Andaman Islands <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> {{of the overall}} system on November6. Located south of the subtropical ridge, the system moved to the west-northwest. Based on the improved organization, the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on November6, and at 00:00UTC the next day initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03B {{just west of the}} Andaman Islands. Six hours later, the IMD likewise classified the system as a depression.|$|E

5|$|Leo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American factory {{superintendent}} who {{was convicted}} in 1913 {{of the murder of}} a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in Atlanta, Georgia. His trial, and lynching two years later, attracted national attention and <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers on the subject holds that Frank was wrongly convicted.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{taxonomy}} and classification <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> {{of natural}} historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy {{for the natural}} world in 1735 (variations {{of which have been}} in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. They managed {{to break out}} of the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et Tire and facing Signal Hill, which <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the detachment from Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry to fall back to its original line.|$|E

5|$|The {{execution}} of Gardner at Utah State Prison <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> {{of media attention}} in June 2010, {{because it was the}} first to be carried out by firing squad in the United States in 14years. Gardner stated that he sought this method of execution because of his Mormon background. On the day before his execution, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement clarifying its position on the issue of blood atonement of individuals. The case also attracted debate over capital punishment and whether Gardner had been destined for a life of violence since his difficult childhood.|$|E
5|$|Although Morgan {{was briefly}} {{seen as a}} hero, {{widespread}} fears concerning plutocracy and concentrated wealth soon eroded this view. Morgan's bank had survived, but the trust companies that were a growing rival to traditional banks were badly damaged. Some analysts believed that the panic had been engineered to damage confidence in trust companies so that banks would benefit. Others believed Morgan {{took advantage of the}} panic to allow his U.S. Steel company to acquire TC Although Morgan lost $21 million in the panic, and the significance of the role he played in staving off worse disaster is undisputed, he also <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of intense scrutiny and criticism.|$|E
5|$|Chris was a {{high school}} student who befriended the soap's other teens. He became the captain of the school's {{basketball}} team and he began dating Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas). However, Chris developed a crush on Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and subsequently revealed that he was gay. Chris initially struggled with his sexuality and the reactions of his friends, family and team mates. Upon finding employment at the local garage, Chris was faced with Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a homophobic customer. In August 2011, a love interest for Chris was introduced in the form of Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) and they formed Neighbours first gay couple. After a break-up and reunion, Chris and Aidan split for good in January 2013. Chris <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of a coward punch storyline in 2014 and agreed to have a baby with his friend Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell).|$|E

5|$|Flint {{and bronze}} weapons have been {{discovered}} in the neighbourhood showing evidence of habitation during the Palaeolithic and Bronze Ages. Roman discoveries were made in 1607 and 1823. Middleton was mentioned as Mildentone and Mildetone in the Domesday Book as having three carucates of land much of which was woodland. The land was given to Ilbert de Lacy who had a castle at Pontefract. Middleton Park is a remnant of the manorial estate which existed after the Norman Conquest. In the 13th century the boundary between Middleton and Beeston <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of a protracted dispute over where it lay in the dense woodland which covered the area. The dispute between William Grammary and Adam de Beeston was settled in 1209 by single combat and resulted {{in the construction of}} a boundary bank and ditch, a stretch of which can still be seen in Middleton Woods.|$|E
5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address the economic problems or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{challenged}} {{herself in}} the latter half of her life, as she regularly appeared in Shakespearean stage productions and tackled a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in The African Queen (1951), a persona the public embraced. Three more Oscars came for her work in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), The Lion in Winter (1968), and On Golden Pond (1981). In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of her career in later life. She remained active into old age, making her final screen appearance in 1994 at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.|$|E

5|$|In Belgium, {{political}} {{debate about the}} Royal Question continued and grew after the war, and remained a polemical topic in the popular press, notably in the Francophone newspaper Le Soir. In the general election of 1949, the PSC–CVP campaigned on a pro-Leopold royalist platform. The results reshaped the political landscape; the Communists were routed and the PSB–BSP lost seats to both the Liberals and Catholics. The Catholics gained a new majority in the Senate and a plurality in the Chamber of Representatives, their best results since the war. Gaston Eyskens took over as Prime Minister {{at the head of}} a Liberal-Catholic coalition. Both parties in the government (and Leopold himself) supported a referendum on the King's return, which <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of political attention.|$|E
5|$|Living River Siam was {{launched}} on March 14, 1999, the International Rivers Day of Action, {{by a group}} of NGO workers and Thai academics. Its first action, on March 23, was to support an occupation of the Pak Mun Dam site by 5,000 villagers. The Pak Mun Dam, funded partially by the World Bank, was built in 1994 and slowly <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of national controversy. It received widespread complaints from Thai villagers and was the focus of the Assembly of the Poor's 99-day, 20,000-person protest in Bangkok in 1997. The dam generates 0.5 percent of Thailand's electric capacity; 40 percent of Thailand's total electric capacity goes unused on an everyday basis.|$|E
5|$|Macedonia's {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, {{but it did not}} take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and bring them home. Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in {{the first phase of the}} battle, Gen. Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian. His ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with Života Panić, a Serb. In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Miroslav Stojanovski, <b>became</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.|$|E
