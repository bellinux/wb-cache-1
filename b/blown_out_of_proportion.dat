To this, he attributes the Palestinians' taking advantage of UNRWA's largesse, which gives out free food and aid without asking questions and deliberate gross inflation in the number of refugees by Palestinians themselves.|$|R

50|$|Butler later {{commented that}} the matter had been <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proportion,</b> {{claiming}} that he remained friends with Savin. He preferred to attribute the sacking to a general falling-out with BRMB management.|$|R

500|$|Eleven tracks {{had been}} {{completed}} by early 2014, and Yankovic set the release date {{in the middle of}} the year as to keep the material [...] "as timely as possible". However, he wished to find [...] "the big hit of the summer" [...] to add to the set. Yankovic recalled that he determined the saturation point of Iggy Azalea's [...] "Fancy" [...] by asking his daughter: [...] "I said, 'Are they talking about Iggy Azalea at school?' And she says, 'Well, not so much.' I asked the same thing two weeks later and she said, 'Oh yeah, that's all they're talking about now!'" [...] Yankovic then traveled from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado in early June 2014 to ask Azalea permission to parody her song. He noted that meeting a spoof target in person is not his usual method for obtaining permission, but was necessary in this instance to meet the album deadline. The encounter was described by TMZ as an [...] "ambush" [...] as Yankovic presented the potential parody lyrics to Azalea backstage at one of her concerts. He later clarified that the meeting was much more polite and <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> by TMZ. Yankovic recorded the Azalea parody [...] "Handy" [...] that same month, and announced that the album mastering process was complete on June 12.|$|E
500|$|Millwall have {{averaged}} a gate close to 12,000 per home game over their 86 {{seasons in the}} Football League, while the club have spent the majority of that time yo-yoing {{back and forth between}} the second and third tiers of English football. Originally based in the East End of London, the club moved across the River Thames in 1910 to south east London and support is drawn from the surrounding areas. The club and fans have a historic association with football hooliganism, which came to prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s with a firm known originally as F-Troop, eventually becoming more widely known as the Millwall Bushwackers, who were one of the most notorious hooligan gangs in England. On five occasions The Den was closed by The FA and the club has received numerous fines for crowd disorder. The BBC documentary Panorama was invited into the club by Millwall in 1977 to show the hooligan reputation was a myth and being <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> by reporting. Instead the BBC portrayed hooliganism as being deeply rooted in Millwall, and attempted to link them to the far-right political party National Front. The show was extremely damaging for the club. Former club chairman Reg Burr once commented: [...] "Millwall are a convenient coat peg for football to hang its social ills on", an example being the reporting of convicted murderer Gavin Grant. Although he had played for eight different clubs, playing his fewest number of games (four) for Millwall, and was signed to Bradford City at the time, the BBC used the headline, [...] "Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant guilty of murder".|$|E

2500|$|Counter-accusations were made, {{including}} {{claims that}} the actual incident was relatively minor but had been <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> by individuals and groups with political motives.

2500|$|Jay Kanter, Brando's agent, producer, and friend, defended him in Daily Variety: [...] "Marlon {{has spoken}} to me for hours about his fondness for the Jewish people, {{and he is a}} {{well-known}} supporter of Israel." [...] Similarly, Louie Kemp, in his article for Jewish Journal, wrote: [...] "You might remember him as Don Vito Corleone, Stanley Kowalski or the eerie Col. Walter E. Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', but I remember Marlon Brando as a mensch and a personal friend of the Jewish people when they needed it most." [...] In an interview with NBC Today one day after Brando's death, King also defended Brando's comments, saying that they had been <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> and taken out of context.|$|E
2500|$|Young {{was awarded}} the NFL Rookie of the Year honors for 2006. In spite of this, Young {{considered}} ending his career.

There was so much going on with my family. It was crazy being an NFL quarterback. It wasn't fun anymore. All of the fun was out of it. All of the excitement was gone.

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, Morris provokes {{a war between}} Hong Kong and Australia, {{and much of the}} episode {{revolves}} around bombastically over-the-top reports on the resulting conflict, a parody of the extensive and overdramatic media coverage of the Gulf War. Subsequent reports of the war, delivered from [...] "Eastmanstown in the Upper Cataracts on the Australio-Hong-Kong border", are humorously <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion.</b> At the end of the episode, a false advertisement features a three-tape VHS set of the war produced by The Day Today, featuring footage of the war and its origins, set against a backdrop of inappropriate pop music, a parody of tabloid television's tendency to [...] "dumb down" [...] stories and present serious events in a lighthearted manner.|$|E

5000|$|However, Laws' conduct {{during the}} matter {{attracted}} strong criticism, with Laws misleading {{the public on}} a number of issues, and he eventually resigned from parliament. Differing opinions exist over the whole controversy. Laws acknowledges that he did things which he should not have done, but described the scandal as a relatively minor matter which his numerous political enemies <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion.</b> His opponents paint Laws as corrupt. Official investigations by the New Zealand Police, by the Serious Fraud Office and by the Auditor-General found he had no case to answer. The latter declared that he made [...] "an honest mistake" [...] in not declaring his wife Karen's shareholding in the company that contracted to the Napier City Council to conduct the poll.

2500|$|Following the SPL Old Firm game of 24 October, Celtic twice {{wrote to}} the SFA to {{question}} the decisions made by referee William Collum, who also received death threats.

On 3 November Celtic striker Gary Hooper claimed referees wanted to give decisions against his team. Lennon then received a two match touchline ban after heavily criticising decisions by referee Craig Thomson and his team during a 2–0 away defeat to Hearts on 10 November. Lennon stated after the game [...] "I'll seek clarification, but they'll probably have their story ready" [...] and [...] "Craig Thomson's supposed {{to be one of the}} best in the country.

50|$|In {{a report}} later {{issued by the}} Stichting Nederlandse Nieuwsmonitor (Dutch News Monitor Foundation), it was alleged that the Dutch media had contributed to <b>blowing</b> things <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> after the prime {{minister}} made 'unnuanced' comments during two news conferences. In this period Wisse Smit also received negative publicity by revelations about her affair, which started circa 1993, with married Bosnian UN Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey.|$|R
25|$|Melton {{challenges}} {{the validity of}} many anti-NRM sources and testimonies of former members (which {{he refers to as}} apostates) critical of their previous groups. While testifying as an expert witness in a lawsuit, Melton asserted that when investigating groups, one should not rely solely upon the unverified testimony of ex-members, and that hostile ex-members would invariably shade the truth and <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> minor incidents turning them into major incidents. Melton also follows the argumentation of Lewis Carter and David Bromley and claims {{that as a result of}} their study, the treatment (coerced or voluntary) of former members as people in need of psychological assistance largely ceased and that an (alleged) lack of widespread need for psychological help by former members of new religions would in itself be the strongest evidence refuting early sweeping condemnations of new religions as causes of psychological trauma. This view is shared by several religious scholars, and contested by others (see also “Criticism”).|$|R
