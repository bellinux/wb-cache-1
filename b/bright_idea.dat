500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Bioscope from November 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Will and John are prosperous young businessmen and close friends. Will has {{an apartment in the}} city, while John lives in the suburbs. When Will goes to the country on his vacation he leaves the latchkey of his apartment with his chum, telling him to make himself at home. The landlady in the house in which Will lives is seized with a <b>bright</b> <b>idea</b> that she can sublet his apartment during his absence. May and Belle, two pretty girls who are in business, decide to try their hand at housekeeping. They rent Will's apartment and settle down in their new quarters. John decides to take advantage of his friend's invitation and make use of his rooms. He lets himself in with the latchkey, and is amazed to find the two girls sound asleep. Believing him to be a burglar the girls threaten him with annihilation. John thinks the joke too good to spoil, so does not try to square himself, but pleads for mercy. May secures his promise that he will never 'burgle' again, and allows him to escape. Unknown to John, May has been engaged by his partner as a typist, and when she enters the office the following morning and finds John opening the safe, she decides that once again her burglar has been caught red-handed. She calls for help, and is greatly chagrined when her supposed burglar is introduced as her employer. Amid explanations, the 'burglar' and the lady shake hands and become good friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the <b>bright</b> <b>idea</b> of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out on a little vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a change of clothes, his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks to do when he comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky enough to hear the woman's cry for help. When she gets out of the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E

A decade down the road, the Maxim {{may well be a}} genuine classic of the 1980s — a <b>bright</b> <b>idea</b> that stood the test of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{visual effects}} and {{backgrounds}} {{for the film}} were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays. Marlon West, one of Disney's veteran animation visual effects supervisors, says about the production; [...] "Those guys had this <b>bright</b> <b>idea</b> to bring back hand-drawn animation, but everything had to be started again from the ground up. One {{of the first things}} we did was focus on producing shorts, to help us re-introduce the 2D pipeline. I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short, How to Hook Up Your Home Theater. It was a real plus for the effects department, so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog." [...] The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop, and many of the architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Autodesk Maya. Much of the clean-up animation, digital ink-and-paint, and compositing were outsourced to third-party companies in Orlando, Florida (Premise Entertainment), Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Yowza Digital Animation), and Brooklin, São Paulo, Brazil (HGN Produções) ...|$|E
2500|$|WWE's storylines for Bryan {{since his}} return were widely criticized. Dave Scherer of Pro Wrestling Insider {{questioned}} [...] "bringing Bryan {{back for the}} Rumble in the first place" [...] {{if there was no}} intention of letting Bryan win. Benjamin Tucker of Pro Wrestling Torch criticized WWE for having [...] "watered down" [...] Bryan's babyface character to a [...] "sneaky, backstabbing, cheap, aggravating jerk" [...] for the feud against Roman Reigns. Mike Tedesco of WrestleView wrote in March that WWE [...] "killed Daniel Bryan and Randy Orton dead in the last two months. It takes a special bunch of nincompoops to pull that off". Jake Barnett of Pro Wrestling Dot Net said that Bryan being labelled a 'turd' was [...] "asking fans to disbelieve what they see with their own eyes" [...] and [...] "will do nothing to calm down the conspiracy theorists who insist WWE is intentionally cooling off Bryan to make Reigns look better in comparison". In a piece for the Wrestling Observer, Zach Dominello was [...] "dumbfounded and disheartened" [...] that [...] "after returning from a very serious injury, WWE’s <b>bright</b> <b>idea</b> is to put Bryan {{in one of the most}} dangerous matches possible at WrestleMania", while having [...] "dragged Bryan down to the levels of R-Truth and Stardust".|$|E

In September 2007 UKTV announced that UKTV <b>Bright</b> <b>Ideas</b> would be replaced on Freeview by UKTV G2, renamed Dave, as of 15 October 2007 due to low viewing figures of around 0.1% of the audience share.
