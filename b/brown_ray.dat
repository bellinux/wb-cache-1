500|$|In 1965, Phil Spector caught an Ike & Tina {{performance}} in Los Angeles {{and sought to}} work with Tina. Working out a deal, Spector gave Ike a $20,000 advance {{to keep out of}} the studio to which Ike agreed. With Spector, Tina produced the song [...] "River Deep - Mountain High", which was released in 1966 on Spector's Philles label. Spector considered that record, with Tina's maximum energy over a symphonic sound, to be his best work. It was successful overseas, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it eventually reached number 3 on the singles chart, but it failed to go any higher than #88 in the United States. Crushed, Spector never signed another act to Philles. [...] But the impact of the record gave Ike and Tina an opening spot for The Rolling Stones' UK tour later that fall, which the Revue later extended by performing all over Europe and Australia. Signing with Blue Thumb Records in 1968, the Revue issued the blues-heavy albums, Outta Season and The Hunter. Outta Season produced the Revue's charted cover of Otis Redding's [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long" [...] while the latter earned Tina a Grammy nomination for Best Female R Vocal Performance for her rendition of the title track, originally recorded by Albert King. The success of the albums led to the Revue headlining at Las Vegas where their shows were attended by a variety of celebrities including David Bowie, Sly Stone, Janis Joplin, Cher, James <b>Brown,</b> <b>Ray</b> Charles, Elton John, and Elvis Presley.|$|E
2500|$|Philadelphia's African American {{population}} grew greatly {{as a result}} of immigration from the south during World War 2, when future luminaries like the Heath Brothers, Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane moved to Philadelphia from the Carolinas. [...] Philadelphia's mid-20th century jazz heritage includes {{an important role in the}} development of bebop, a style most closely associated with New York. [...] In the 1940s, Philadelphia jazz was based out of clubs along Columbia Avenue in North Philadelphia and clubs like the Clef Club, the Showboat, and Pep's in South Philadelphia. The city produced a number of bop-era saxophonists, the most famous of whom was John Coltrane, one of the most renowned jazz musicians of the 20th century, known for an [...] "active, vigorous, emotionally charged style". [...] The city also produced Charlie Biddle, Clifford <b>Brown,</b> <b>Ray</b> Bryant, Tommy Bryant, Jimmy Oliver, Catalyst, Philly Joe Jones, Reggie Workman, Red Rodney, Jimmy Smith, Hank Mobley, Billy Root, Specs Wright, Jerry Thomas, Wilbur Ware, Hasaan Ibn Ali, Clarence Sharpe, John Dennis, Walt Dickerson, Johnny Coles, Lee Morgan, Cal Massey, Benny Golson, Odean Pope, Bill Barron, Kenny Barron, Arthur Harper, Jymie Merritt, Henry Grimes, Leon Grimes, Jimmy Garrison, Colmar Duncan, Sherman Ferguson, McCoy Tyner, Kenny Rodgers, D.B.
