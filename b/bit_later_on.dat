2500|$|On 18 April 1963, the 17-year-old Jane Asher {{interviewed the}} Beatles at Royal Albert Hall in London, England {{and began a}} five-year {{relationship}} with Paul McCartney. In December 1963, McCartney took up residence at Asher's family Wimpole Street town house and stayed there until the couple moved into McCartney's own home located in St John's Wood in 1966. McCartney wrote several Beatles songs inspired by her, including [...] "And I Love Her", [...] "You Won't See Me", [...] "I'm Looking Through You", and [...] "Here, There and Everywhere". McCartney and Asher announced on Christmas Day 1967 that they were engaged to marry, and in February and March 1968, Asher accompanied the Beatles and their respective partners to Rishikesh to attend an advanced Transcendental Meditation training session with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In mid-1968, Asher returned to London from an acting assignment in Bristol earlier than expected and caught McCartney in bed with Francie Schwartz. A fan who frequently hung around Paul's Cavendish Avenue home claims to have witnessed the incident, saying, [...] "...Paul brought this American girl home......another car turned into Cavendish Avenue — it was Jane. She'd come back...earlier than she was supposed to. Jane went into the house. A <b>bit</b> <b>later</b> <b>on,</b> she came storming out again and drove away." [...] Shortly after, Margaret Asher drove to Cavendish Avenue to collect her daughter's things.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Let M be a {{logarithmic}} space Turing machine (or a polynomial width branching program) {{that uses}} up to k ss 2 plog n(read once) random bits. For a fixed input, let Pi(S) bethe probability (over the random string) that at time i themachine M is in state S, {{and assume that}} some weak es-timation of the probabilities Pi(S) is known or given orcan be easily computed. We construct a logarithmic space pseudo-random generator that uses only logarithmic num-ber of truly random bits and outputs a sequence of k bits thatlooks random to M. This means that a very weak estimation of the state probabilities of M is sufficient for a full derandomization of M andfor constructing pseudo-random sequences for M. We haveseveral applications of the main theorem, as stated within. To prove our theorem, we introduce the idea of recyclingthe state S of the machine M at time i {{as part of the}} randomstring for the same machine at later time. That is, we use the entropy of the random variable S in order to save trulyrandom <b>bits</b> <b>later</b> <b>on.</b> Our techniques and results can both be generalized tolarger size of space...|$|R

40|$|This {{means that}} a very weak {{estimation}} of the state probabilities of M is sufficient for a full derandomization of M and for constructing pseudo-random sequences for M. We have several applications of the main theorem. For example: 1. We show how to derandomize up to ss 2 plog n random bits for Symmetric-Logspace on any regular graph, and more generally on any graph such that the ratio between the degrees of the two special vertices s and t is between ss 2 plog n and ss 2 Γ plog n. 2. Let G be a graph with n vertices. We give a Logspace Turing machine that uses only O(log n) random bits and (on input G) outputs a length k ss 2 plog n &quot;pseudo-random walk &quot; (on G), that looks random to any machine M with space O(log k) (and to any branching program of size poly(k)). 3. Say that we need random variables x 1;:::; xk 2 f 1;:::; ng with some specific individual distributions xi and some (consistent) conditional distributions xi+ 1 jxi. We show that for k ss 2 plog n, such x 1;:::; xk can be constructed (up to error ss 2 Γ plog n) by a Logspace Turing machine that uses only O(log n) random bits. To prove our theorem, we introduce the idea of recycling the state S of the machine M at time i {{as part of the}} random string for the same machine at later time. That is, we use the entropy of the random variable S in order to save truly random <b>bits</b> <b>later</b> <b>on...</b>|$|R
