Mary was welcomed back shortly before she gave birth to her first son by being given a <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private ward. Jim was not present at the birth as he was fighting a warehouse fire, but arrived at the hospital two hours later.|$|E
5|$|On Day 12—October 3, 2004—Sayid finds a {{peculiar}} cable {{running out of}} the ocean and into the jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from {{what appears to be the}} headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E

Tommy Barban, another guest, comes loyally to the defense of the Divers. The action involves various other friends, including the Norths, where a frequent occurrence is the drunken behavior of Abe North. The story becomes complicated when Jules Peterson, a black man, is murdered and ends up in Rosemary's <b>bed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> situation which could destroy Rosemary's career.

25|$|Returning to {{his home}} town of Caerleon (now a village in south Wales just outside Newport, where {{the ruins of the}} Roman {{fortress}} of Isca can still be seen, whose walls surrounding its Roman baths and elsewhere were still standing high during the medieval period). Sir Launfal takes humble lodgings, spends all the money that King Arthur gave him before setting out, and soon descends into poverty and debt. One Trinity Sunday, the king holds a banquet in Caerleon to which Sir Launfal, because of his poverty, is not invited. The mayor's daughter offers to let him spend the day with her, but he declines her offer since he has nothing to wear. Instead, he borrows a horse from her and goes for a ride, stopping to rest under a tree in a nearby forest. Two maidens appear and bring him to a lady they call Tryamour, daughter of the King of Olyroun and of Fayrye, whom Sir Launfal finds lying on a <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> glorious pavilion.|$|E
25|$|Several known {{deaths have}} been {{associated}} with Project MKUltra, most notably that of Frank Olson. Olson, a United States Army biochemist and biological weapons researcher, was given LSD without his knowledge or consent in November, 1953, as part of a CIA experiment and committed suicide by jumping out of a window a week later. A CIA doctor assigned to monitor Olson claimed to have been asleep in another <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> New York City hotel room when Olson exited the window and fell thirteen stories to his death. In 1953, Olson's death was described as a suicide that had occurred during a severe psychotic episode. The CIA's own internal investigation concluded that the head of MKUltra, CIA chemist Sidney Gottlieb, had conducted the LSD experiment with Olson's prior knowledge, although neither Olson nor the other men taking part in the experiment were informed as to the exact nature of the drug until some 20 minutes after its ingestion. The report further suggested that Gottlieb was nonetheless due a reprimand, as he had failed to take into account Olson's already-diagnosed suicidal tendencies, which might have been exacerbated by the LSD.|$|E

After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room– pausing to play the opening bars of the song [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" [...] by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system– and runs a bath.|$|E
500|$|Merrick {{arrived at}} Liverpool Street Station on 24 June 1886, safely {{back in his}} own country, but with nowhere to go. He was not {{eligible}} to enter a workhouse in London {{for more than one}} night and would be accepted only by Leicester Union, where he was a permanent resident. Leicester was [...] away. He approached strangers for help, but his speech was unintelligible and his appearance repugnant. He drew a crowd of curious onlookers until a policeman helped him into an empty waiting room, where he huddled in a corner, exhausted. Unable to make himself understood, his only identifying possession was Frederick Treves's card. The police contacted Treves, who went to the station. Recognising Merrick, Treves took him in a hansom cab to the London Hospital. Merrick was admitted for bronchitis, washed, fed and put to <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small isolation room in the hospital's attic.|$|E
500|$|Don awakens to a {{knock on}} the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his <b>bed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E

40|$|Gas-solid heat {{transfer}} <b>in</b> rotating fluidized <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> static geometry is theoretically and numerically investigated. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the particle bed temperature response to <b>a</b> step change <b>in</b> the fluidization gas temperature are presented {{to illustrate the}} gas-solid {{heat transfer}} characteristics. A comparison with conventional fluidized beds is made. Rotating fluidized <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> static geometry can operate at centrifugal forces multiple times gravity, allowing increased gas-solid slip velocities and resulting gas-solid heat transfer coefficients. The high ratio of the cylindrically shaped particle bed "width" to "height" allows a further increase of the specific fluidization gas flow rates. The higher specific fluidization gas flow rates and increased gas-solid slip velocities drastically increase the rate of gas-solid heat transfer <b>in</b> rotating fluidized <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> static geometry. Furthermore, both the centrifugal force and the counteracting radial gas-solid drag force being influenced by the fluidization gas flow rate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar way. rotating fluidized <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> static geometry offer extreme flexibility {{with respect to the}} fluidization gas flow rate and the related cooling or heating. Finally, the uniformity of the particle bed temperature is improved by the tangential fluidization and resulting rotational motion of the particle bed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Don tries to assuage a slightly perturbed Megan, who is upset over how many of Don's old flames they run into in Manhattan. Don works with new hire Michael Ginsberg and Ken Cosgrove on the pitch to Butler Footwear. Ginsberg goes rogue during the presentation and ends up pitching a commercial based on Cinderella, which the group had earlier rejected as being too cliche - although {{that was what the}} executives were expecting, and they reject the pitch they had earlier approved in favor of a Cinderella campaign. Don is enraged and admonishes Ginsberg for the act; Ginsberg doesn't seem to realize the seriousness of his transgression until Ken points out he {{was on the verge of}} being fired. Afterwards, Don returns home early to an empty house and collapses on his <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> weakened state.|$|E
500|$|Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized {{again in}} 2013. The act led to further related {{developments}} {{in the creation of}} the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, [...] "you did it... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking." [...] He has also taken legality into the situation. Biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that, [...] "No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're in <b>bed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dorm or on the street. No means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind. No means no." ...|$|E
500|$|A second {{expedition}} {{to map the}} wreck of Scorpion was mounted in 1985. Only twelve days of search time would be left {{at the end of}} the {{expedition to}} look for Titanic. As Harris/Grimm's unsuccessful efforts had taken more than forty days, Ballard decided that extra help would be needed. He approached the French national oceanographic agency, IFREMER, with which Woods Hole had previously collaborated. The agency had recently developed a high-resolution side-scan sonar called SAR and agreed to send a research vessel, Le Suroît, to survey the sea bed in the area where Titanic was believed to lie. The idea was for the French to use the sonar to find likely targets, and then for the Americans to use Argo to check out the targets and hopefully confirm whether they were in fact the wreck. The French team spent five weeks, from 5 July to 12 August 1985, [...] "mowing the lawn"– sailing back and forth across the [...] target area to scan the sea <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of stripes. However, they found nothing, though it turned out that they had passed within a few hundred yards of Titanic in their first run.|$|E
