40|$|AbstractFossil lignophyte stems show {{remarkable}} diversity including non-sympodial and sympodial {{forms and}} a variety of pith and tracheid structures. Most lack scalariform <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> on radial walls of secondary xylem tracheids, while these occur in the putative progymnosperm Protopitys and some (but not all) cycads, bennettitaleans, and angiosperms. We describe a new genus of Permian gymnosperms that comprises decorticated stems and branches with a parenchymatous pith that is septate in stems but entire in branches and has scleroid cells that are organised singly or in bands. Vasculature is non-sympodial, comprising endarch primary xylem strands that become mesarch leaf traces that are occluded through ontogeny. Secondary xylem is pycnoxylic with scalariform <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> on radial tracheid walls. The eustelic and non-sympodial organisation, the septate pith and the presence of scalariform <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> on secondary tracheids represent a unique combination of features not previously seen in lignophyte genera, justifying the erection of Xuanweioxylon scalariforme gen. et sp. nov. X. scalariforme shows similarities to several extinct and extant lignophytes but is placed within the coniferophytes — an informal grouping of conifer-like plants of uncertain affinity that includes probable sister groups to cordaitaleans and conifers. Scalariform <b>bordered</b> <b>pitting</b> in secondary tracheids is unique to Xuanweioxylon within coniferophytes, demonstrating previously unrecognised diversity within the group.

Fran-co var. menziesii and var. glauca) wood on larger scale proper-ties like hydraulic conductivity. The model showed that tra-cheid length, the ease of flow through a <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> and effective tracheid diameter can all limit maximum hydraulic conductivity. Among the model parameters tested, increasing <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> conductivity and tracheid length resulted in the greatest increase in maximum conductivity in both the inland and coastal ecotypes. A sensitivity analysis of the uncertainty between parameters governing flow through the <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> and air-seeding potential showed that, although decreased pit flow resistance increased maximum hydraulic conductivity, in-creased cavitation led to lower conductivity over time. The benefits of {{increasing the number of}} bordered pits depended on the intensity of the meteorological driving function: in drier en-vironmental conditions, wood with fewer pits was more con-ductive over time than wood with more pits. Switching the bor-dered pit characteristics between coastal and interior wood indicated that the conductivity time course of coastal and inte-rior wood was primarily governed by differences in the number of bordered pits and not differences in tracheid dimensions. The rate at which tracheids refilled had little effect on the con-ductivity time course of either coastal or interior wood during the first two summers when the wood was highly saturated, but had a marked influence in subsequent years once the cavitation profile stabilized. Our work highlights the need for more em-pirical work on bordered pits to determine whether variation in their number and properties is related to changing environmen-tal conditions.

30|$|The {{penetration}} {{behavior of}} P. vitreus into Norway spruce heartwood {{is supposed to}} be characterized by a stepwise capture of wood tissue (Fuhr et al. 2011 a), because the aspirated and lignified <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> hinder the expansion of the mycelium (Figure  2). Only the degrading of either the <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> or the cell wall enables the fungus to grow from one tracheid to another. Thereby the ratio between the velocity of the hypha within the tracheids (i.e. hyphal growth rate) and the pit degradation rate is of interest, because this ratio influences the density of the mycelium, the number of tips in the system and the penetration velocity of the growth front as shown by our simulations (Figures  3 and 4).|$|R

The size, structure and distribution of bordered pits is a significant factor for the accessibility of wood tissue both for fluids and fungal hyphae (Rayner & Boddy 1988). The time required by a hypha to penetrate through a <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> either by the support of pressure or enzymes (i.e. pit penetration time) obviously influences the ability of the mycelium to colonize a refractory wood such as Norway spruce heartwood.|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between xylem vessel age and vulnerability to cavitation of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) was quantified {{by measuring the}} pressure required to force air across <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> membranes separating individual xylem vessels. We found that the <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> membranes of vessels located in current year xylem could withstand greater applied gas pressures (3. 8 MPa) compared with <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> membranes in vessels located in older annular rings (2. 0 MPa). A longitudinal transect along 6 -year-old branches indicated that the pressure required to push gas across <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> membranes of current year xylem did not vary with distance from the growing tip. To understand the contribution of age-related changes in vulnerability to the overall resistance to cavitation, we combined data on the pressure thresholds of individual xylem vessels with measurements of the relative flow rate through each annual ring. The annual ring of the current year contributed only 16 % of the total flow measured on 10 -cm-long segments cut from 6 -year-old branches, but it contributed more than 70 % of the total flow when measured through 6 -year-old branches {{to the point of}} leaf attachment. The vulnerability curve calculated using relative flow rates measured on branch segments were similar to vulnerability curves measured on 6 -year-old branches (pressure that reduces hydraulic conductance by 50 % = 1. 6 – 2. 4 MPa), whereas the vulnerability curve calculated using relative flow rates measured on 6 -year-old branches were similar to ones measured on the extension growth of the current year (pressure that reduces hydraulic conductance by 50 % = 3. 8 MPa). These data suggest that, in sugar maple, the xylem of the current year can withstand larger xylem tensions than older wood and dominates water delivery to leaves...|$|E

30|$|The {{positive}} {{regression coefficients}} in the BD and ARO are in {{consistent with the}} findings that MCf increases with increasing BD [2 – 6] and ARO [3, 6 – 8]. In general, wood with lower BD dries faster than that with higher BD, because the structure of wood with lower BD contains thinner cell walls and more openings per unit volume, which contributes to an increase in the diffusion of bound water and free water, respectively. Radial diffusion, perpendicular to the growth rings, is somewhat faster than tangential diffusion, parallel to the rings [18]. This explains why the samples with lower ARO resulted in the higher drying rate and consequently the lower MCf. Pang [19] gave a reasonable explanation why the radial diffusion of free water is faster than the tangential diffusion in Pinus radiata. During drying, the moisture within the wood material can either flow along the radial ray cells or through <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> which are on the radial-longitudinal face [20]. However with drying, the <b>bordered</b> <b>pits</b> aspirate but the ray cells are cleared. This increases the gas permeability and the moisture flow in radial direction [21, 22].|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} version {{is available at}} [URL] air-seeding hypothesis predicts that xylem embolism resistance is linked directly to <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> functioning. We tested this prediction in trunks, roots, and branches at different vertical and radial locations in young and old trees of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Dimensions of bordered pits were measured from light and scanning electron micrographs, and physiological data were from published values. Consistent with observations, calculations showed that earlywood tracheids were more resistant to embolism than latewood tracheids, mainly from earlywood having stretchier pit membranes that can distend and cover the pit aperture. Air seeding that occurs in earlywood appears to happen through gaps between the torus edge and pit border, {{as shown by the}} similar calculated pressures required to stretch the membrane over the pit aperture and to cause embolism. Although <b>bordered</b> <b>pit</b> functioning was correlated with tracheid hydraulic diameter, pit pore size and above all pit aperture constrained conductivity the most. From roots to branches and from the trunk base to higher on the trunk, hydraulic resistance of the earlywood pit membrane increased significantly because of a decrease {{in the size of the}} pit aperture and size and number of margo pores. Moreover, overall wood conductivity decreased, in part due to lower pit conductivity and a decrease in size and frequency of pits. Structural and functional constraints leading to the trade-off of efficiency against safety of water transport were also demonstrated at the individual pit level, with a positive correlation between pit membrane resistance on an area basis and the pressure differential required to cause membrane stretching, a characteristic that is essential for pit aspiration...|$|E

Specific permeability of intermediate wood and sapwood were significantly related to the number of effective open pits in earlywood, Nef, which was determined by anatomical properties such as aspirated and incompletely aspirated pits, the number of pits and tracheids, and proportion of latewood, suggesting that specific permeability of sugi sapwood and intermediate wood is a physical value determined by the intrinsic properties of earlywood in addition to the condition of <b>bordered</b> <b>pits.</b> スギ辺材と移行材の比透過率を決定する木材組織構造因子を明らかにする目的で，地上高別に移行材，辺材内側と外側の比透過率を算出した。そのあと，その試験片の組織構造を計測し，比透過率との関係を見た．比透過率は樹幹上部に向かって減少，髄からの距離が大きくなるに伴って上昇する候向を示した。このことは比透過率への形成層齢の関与を示唆した．晩材割合と比透過率との問に有意な相関関係が認められなかったことから，比透過率には早材が大きな役割を担うことが明らかになった．比透過率を決定する組織構造因子として，軍材の有縁壁孔閉塞率，不完全閉塞率，仮道管当たりの有縁壁孔数，単位面積当たりの仮道管数および晩材割合を考慮して算出した有効開放壁孔数Nefが提案された．すなわち，有効開放壁孔数と比透過率との間に直線関係が認められ，スギ辺材と移行材の比透過率が，有縁壁孔の状態に加えて他の早材組織構造によって決定されることを明らかにした...|$|R
