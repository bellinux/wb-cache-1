5|$|Six {{sets were}} {{constructed}} on which 60 pounds of baking soda {{were used as}} snow (the crew tried to use real snow but it melted), 42 pounds of glitter were used to cover the background, and 20 boxes of breakfast cereal were used to cover the coral rocks. Over 38 different types of foam were {{used to make the}} set pieces and the characters' bodies and heads. To render SpongeBob's pineapple house, palm fronds from a tree in a school yard were used. Other props and materials used were an actual starfish, three Christmas trees (for the Patchy the Pirate's Winter Wonderland scenes), six boxes of puff cereal (to create the fruitcake inside SpongeBob's mouth), 21 pounds of googly eyes (for rivets, texture pieces, knobs, etc.), 22 pounds of woodchips (to create Sandy's treedome floor), and 24 <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> craft flowers (to create the parade float).|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{to cut down}} the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include carriages and horsemen. After the tree {{to be used as}} the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, apples, and sometimes with the Serbian flag. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> leaved oak twigs are prepared to be distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may be followed by a procession, {{as is the case in}} parts of Republika Srpska and the Bay of Kotor.|$|E

25|$|In Protestant and Catholic countries, {{attempts}} were made to simplify and reform the extravagances of dress. Louis XIII of France issued sumptuary laws in 1629 and 1633 that prohibited lace, gold trim and lavish embroidery for all but the highest nobility and restricting puffs, slashes and <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> ribbon. The effects of this reform effort are depicted in a series of popular engravings by Abraham Bosse.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} opossums have prehensile tails, {{although}} dangling {{by the tail}} is more common among juveniles. An opossum may also use its tail as a brace and a fifth limb when climbing. The tail is occasionally used as a grip to carry <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> leaves or bedding materials to the nest. A mother will sometimes carry her young upon her back, where they will cling tightly even when she is climbing or running.|$|E
25|$|Like her ever-present <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> gladioli, one of {{the most}} popular and {{distinctive}} features of Edna's stage and TV appearances has been her extravagant wardrobe, with gaudy, custom-made gowns that satirically outdo the most outrageous creations of Hollywood showbiz designers such as Bob Mackie. Her costumes, most of which were created for her by Australian designer Bill Goodwin, routinely incorporate Aussie kitsch icons such as the flag, Australian native animals and flowers, the Sydney Opera House and the boxing kangaroo.|$|E
25|$|On Labour Day (May, 1st) a {{colourful}} pageant is held {{throughout the}} village's high streets to celebrate lu Maje (The May), a circle-shaped wooden cane decked with small <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> wild pink underbrush violets and other spring flowers and carried {{at the forefront}} of the pageant, which kicks off at the main church soon after the late morning mass.

25|$|On May 1, 1561, King Charles IX of France {{received}} a lily {{of the valley}} as a lucky charm. He decided to offer a {{lily of the valley}} each year to the ladies of the court. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on May 1. The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> lily of the valley or dog rose flowers.|$|E
25|$|Earlier on, in {{the third}} segment, Mrs. Potts' Party, the Beast makes several cameos {{sleeping}} in his bed in the West Wing. Dialogue between Lumiere and Cogsworth shows that {{he had spent the}} entire previous night mending leaks in the castle roof, and is still resting. An argument between Lumiere and Cogsworth about Mrs. Potts' favourite flowers lead to them having to hide several <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> flowers around the Beast's bed. At one point, the Beast begins to smell one of the flowers and almost wakes up, but it is removed just in time, and he falls asleep again.|$|E
25|$|Merlot grapes are {{identified}} by their loose <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> large berries. The color has {{less of a}} blue/black hue than Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and with a thinner skin and fewer tannins per unit volume. It normally ripens up to two weeks earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon. Also compared to Cabernet, Merlot grapes {{tend to have a}} higher sugar content and lower malic acid. Ampelographer J.M. Boursiquot has noted that Merlot has seemed to inherit some of the best characteristics from its parent varieties—its fertility and easy ripening ability from Magdeleine Noire des Charentes and its color, tannin and flavor phenolic potential from Cabernet Franc.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs were}} often not painted but consisted, for example, of paraphernalia {{connected with the}} brewing process such as <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> hops or brewing implements, which were suspended above {{the door of the}} pub. In some cases local nicknames, farming terms and puns were used. Local events were often commemorated in pub signs. Simple natural or religious symbols such as 'The Sun', 'The Star' and 'The Cross' were incorporated into pub signs, sometimes being adapted to incorporate elements of the heraldry (e.g. the coat of arms) of the local lords who owned the lands upon which the pub stood. Some pubs have Latin inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|Teosintes {{strongly}} resemble maize in many ways, notably their tassel (male inflorescence) morphology. Teosintes are {{distinguished from}} maize most obviously by their numerous branches each bearing <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> distinctive, small female inflorescences. These spikes mature {{to form a}} two-ranked 'ear' of five to 10 triangular or trapezoidal, black or brown disarticulating segments, each with one seed. Each seed is enclosed by a very hard fruitcase, consisting of a cupule or depression in the rachis and a tough lower glume. This protects them from the digestive processes of ruminants that forage on teosinte and aid in seed distribution through their droppings. Teosinte seed exhibits some resistance to germination, but will quickly germinate if treated with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional gobelet style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of vine training and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the guyot method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters. This is because the Beaujolais wine-making style of carbonic maceration utilizes whole <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> grape clusters that normally get broken and separated by a mechanical harvester.|$|E
