Creator MacFarlane, the {{recipient}} of the award, noted that Povenmire deserved to have received the award for the contribution the visuals made to the episode's win. Povenmire jokingly responded [...] "That's a nice sentiment and all, <b>but</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> offer to give me his? No! And it's not like he doesn't already have two of his own just sitting in his house!"

2500|$|Rahane {{made his}} first Test ton at Basin Reserve, Wellington, New Zealand on 15 February 2014 against New Zealand. India was in a {{difficult}} position when Rahane came to the crease at 156 for five {{and by the time he}} departed with 118 India were in a match-winning position ruined by Brendon McCullum's famous triple-century. [...] "He had a mountain of first-class runs backing him, of course, <b>but</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> have what goes around by the queer name of X-factor? Did he have that extra edge in his game and personality that separates top-class international players from the rest? Was he merely humble, or was he unable to assert himself, unable to absorb real pressure? After his first two Test tours to South Africa and New Zealand, we can safely conclude it must be the former. Underneath that seemingly soft exterior lurks a solid Test batsman, and he was on display at the Basin Reserve", ESPN Cricinfo wrote in their analysis.|$|E
