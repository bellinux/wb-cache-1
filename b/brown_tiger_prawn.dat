40|$|It {{is common}} to model the {{dynamics}} of fisheries using natural and fishing mortality rates estimated independently using two separate analyses. Fishing mortality is routinely estimated from widely available logbook data, whereas natural mortality estimations have often required more specific, less frequently available, data. However, {{in the case of}} the fishery for <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus esculentus) in Moreton Bay, both fishing and natural mortality rates have been estimated from logbook data. The present work extended the fishing mortality model to incorporate an eco-physiological response of tiger prawn to temperature, and allowed recruitment timing to vary from year to year. These ecological characteristics of the dynamics of this fishery were ignored in the separate model that estimated natural mortality. Therefore, we propose to estimate both natural and fishing mortality rates within a single model using a consistent set of hypotheses. This approach was applied to Moreton Bay <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> data collected between 1990 and 2010.

40|$|AbstractThe {{cover of}} {{seagrasses}} and macroalgae, landings and fishery-independent measures of spawning stock and recruitment for <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> were monitored immediately following a major cyclone in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia in March 1999. Anecdotal {{evidence on the}} extent of seagrass from 1990 to 1998 suggests that the cyclone caused a major, immediate disruption and loss of the seagrass/macroalgal beds (to ≤ 2 % cover), the critical prawn nursery habitat, and mangroves in the shallow inshore waters of the system. Prawn landings and recruitment to the fishery were not affected in the year of the cyclone, but were markedly lower in the two years immediately afterwards and then increased as the cover of macrophytes increased to over 40 % in 2003. <b>Tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> landings and catch rates were not affected in Shark Bay, a system 500  km south of Exmouth Gulf that did not experience cyclonic disturbance. Seagrasses in Exmouth Gulf showed a succession of species from small colonising species (Halophila ovalis and Halodule uninervis) to larger, broad-leaved species (Cymodocea serrulata, Syringodium isoetifolium) only two years after the cyclone. The recruitment and landings of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> were correlated significantly with the total cover of macroalgae and seagrass. The large loss of seagrass and macroalgae reduced the settling habitat for postlarvae and the nursery habitat for juvenile <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns,</b> probably leading to the lower recruitment to the fishery. These findings suggest that the extent of seagrass and macroalgae are some of the factors defining the productivity of the <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> fishery in Exmouth Gulf...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{submersible}} chronographic tethering {{device to}} compare the survival time of tethered juvenile <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (Penaeus esculentus [Haswell, 1897]) in seagrass and bare plots at two different sites. At one site, more prawns survived and those that were eaten survived for longer among the seagrass than on the bare habitat. However, at the other site there was little difference between numbers of survivors and survival time in the seagrass compared to the bare substrate. Laboratory observations suggest that the difference in survival was due to an effect of the tethers on the prawn's ability to escape from blue-swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus [Linnaeus 1758]), and differences in the abundance of P. pelagicus at the two field sites. P. pelagicus rely on olfaction, rather than sight to locate their prey, and so the crabs' efficiency at locating tethered prawns is not affected by the structure that seagrass provides. Our results clearly demonstrate {{an example of an}} artifact caused by experimental intervention, and highlight the need to investigate the possible effects of these types of artifacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{western king prawn}} (Penueus Zarisulcutus) is one of {{the most}} {{economically}} valuable species of crustacean in Australia. The experiment was carried out for 60 days to determine the growth, survival, haemolymph osmolality and organosomatic indices of the western lung prawn (2. 95 f 0. 26 g mean initial weight) reared at 10, 22, 34 and 46 g L of salinities. In addition, haemolymph osmolality and osmoregulatory capacity (OC) of the western king prawn (5. 37 f 0. 1 g mean initial weight) reared at salinities (10, 22, 34 and 46 g/L) were determined following 7, 14 and 21 minutes of air exposure and compared with the <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> (P, esculentus). Mean final weight, total length, carapace length and specific growth rate (SGR) of the western king prawn were highest at a salinity of 34 g/L. Moult increments (in weight and total length) of the western king prawn were not significantly different (P > 0. 05) when reared at four different salinities. Food conversion ratios were lowest in prawns reared at salinities of 22 and 34 g/L. Survival of the western king prawn was highest at a salinity of 22 g/L and lowest at a salinity of 10 g/L. Haemolymph osmolality of the western king prawn increased with an increase in salinity and weight. Isosmotic points of the western king prawn calculated from regression lines between haemolymph and medium osmolality were 28. 87, 29. 46 and 31. 73 g / L at 0, 20 and 60 days of rearing (accordingly to 2. 95 f 0. 26; 4. 02 f 0. 47; 5. 79 f 0. 64 g body weight), respectively. Tail moisture content of the western king prawn decreased with the increase of salinity. After 60 days of rearing, the lowest hepatopancreas moisture content of the prawns was at a salinity of 22 gL. Wet weight and dry weight hepatosomatic indices of the prawns were highest when reared at a salinity of 22 gL. Wet weight and dry weight tail muscle indices of the prawns were highest at a salinity of 34 gL. Isosmotic points of the western king prawn were 33. 79; 33. 29; 32. 75 and 33. 10 g/L at 0, 7, 14, and 21 minutes of air exposure, respectively. Isosmotic points of the <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> were 30. 89; 31. 89; 32. 09 and 31. 07 g/L at 0, 7, 14, and 21 minutes of air exposure, respectively. Air exposure reduced OC of both the western king prawn and <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn.</b> OC of both species at a salinity of 10 giL was reduced significantly after 14 minutes of air exposure. Twenty-one minutes of air exposure did not change OC of the western king prawn reared at salinities of 22, 34 and 46 g/L. OC of <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> reared at 22 g/L decreased after 21 minutes of air exposure while OC of the <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> reared at 46 g/L decreased after 7 minutes of air exposure. The results indicate that both species spent less energy on osmoregulation at 34 gL salinity than at other salinities. The results suggest that the optimum salinity for rearing of western king prawns ranges from 22 g/L to 34 g/L. Salinities of 10 and 46 gL are unsuitable for rearing brown tiger prawns and salinity 10 g/L is unsuitable for rearing western king prawns. Furthermore, a salinity range from 30 g/L to 32 gL is suitable for the culture of brown tiger prawns...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Torres Strait Prawn {{fishery is}} a multi-species fishery {{harvesting}} {{in the order}} of 1300 t of <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (Penaeus esculentus) and blue endeavour prawns (Metapenaeus endeavouri) annually. The fishery is primarily controlled by total allowable effort. This was recently reduced from 13570 vessel nights to 9200, 75 % of which is allocated to Australian vessels (6867 nights). With recent economic downturns the size of the active fleet has dropped from 74 to 37 vessels and the observed fishing effort from ~ 10000 to ~ 4000 nights. Industry has raised an urgent need for new spatial management to allow more fishing capacity without compromising biological as well as economical sustainability of the fishery. A multi-species monthly spatially explicit simulation model (TSPFsim) was developed in order to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of an alternate management strategy: a closure designed to protect spawning <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns.</b> This would close fishing in the deeper eastern sector of the trawl ground when effort reaches a trigger level of nights fished. The model divided the stock into multiple spatial regions and tracked the regional population dynamics by applying growth, mortality, recruitment and movement among these regions. Movement was implemented using a spatial transition matrix. The transition probabilities were estimated from tag-recapture data. Temporal and spatial levels of fishing effort were simulated based on a weighted combination of the historical fishing pattern and attractiveness ($ valu...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Northern Prawn fishery (NPF) {{is one of}} the {{few that}} has adopted a dynamic version of a ‘maximum {{economic}} yield’ (MEY) target, and, on this basis, the fishery is undergoing a process of substantial stock rebuilding. This paper details the bioeconomic model that is used to provide scientific management advice for the NPF, in terms of the amount of allowable total (and tradable) gear length in the fishery, both in terms of the MEY target and the path to MEY. It combines the stock assessment process for two species of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (<b>brown</b> and grooved <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns)</b> with a specification for discounted economic profits, where the harvest function in the profit equation is stock dependent. Results for the NPF show a substantial ‘stock effect’, indicating the importance of conserving fish stocks for profitability. MEY thus occurs at a stock size that is larger than that at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved, leading to a ‘win-win’ situation for both the industry (added profitability) and the environment (larger fish stocks and lower impacts on the rest of the ecosystem). Sensitivity results emphasize this effect by showing that the MEY target is much more sensitive to changes in the price of prawns and the cost of fuel, and far less so to the rate of discount. ...|$|R

40|$|A bioeconomic {{model was}} {{developed}} to evaluate the potential performance of <b>brown</b> <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> stock enhancement in Exmouth Gulf, Australia. This paper presents the framework for the bioeconomic model and risk assessment for all components of a stock enhancement operation, i. e. hatchery, grow-out, releasing, population dynamics, fishery, and monitoring, for a commercial scale enhancement of about 100 metric tonnes, a 25 % increase in average annual catch in Exmouth Gulf. The model incorporates uncertainty in estimates of parameters by using a distribution for the parameter over a certain range, based on experiments, published data, or similar studies. Monte Carlo simulation was then used to quantify {{the effects of these}} uncertainties on the model-output and on the economic potential of a particular production target. The model incorporates density-dependent effects in the nursery grounds of brown tiger prawns. The results predict that a release of 21 million 1 g prawns would produce an estimated enhanced prawn catch of about 100 t. This scale of enhancement has a 66. 5 % chance of making a profit. The largest contributor to the overall uncertainty of the enhanced prawn catch was the post-release mortality, followed by the density-dependent mortality caused by released prawns. These two mortality rates are most difficult to estimate in practice and are much under-researched in stock enhancement...|$|E

Homogeneity was tested on each product and each treatment. Results verified that all methods were able to distinguish between nonirradiated and irradiated samples regardless of dose. Silicate methods produced better discrimination than powdered shell, and acid hydrolysis showed some evidence of better separation between the 2 doses than the physical method. Participants received each product in each treatment category for blind analysis. Six participants returned results for acid hydrolysis, 7 for physical separation, and 5 for the powdered shell method. Their results confirmed the homogeneity testing.

Despite large differences in above-ground biomass of seagrass, these beds are both critical nursery areas for postlarval [= 3 mm CL) tiger prawns. Thirty-seven species of fish were found to eat juvenile penaeids, but 76 % of P. semisulcatus and 43 % of P. esculentus (numbers) {{were found in the}} stomachs of 1 species of fish (Scomberoides commersonianus).

Samples of tiger prawns were collected in the Embley River estuary with a small beam trawl at night every 2 wk from September to May for 2 yr (1990 to 1992). The two seagrass sites, which were 11 and 13 km from the river mouth, showed less seasonal variation in salinity than the two algal sites, which were 15 and 20 km from the river mouth. The algal beds at the two upstream sites almost disappeared during the wet season, but the biomass of seagrass did not change significantly between the wet and dry seasons. The grooved tiger prawn (P. semisulcatus), the main species at all sites, comprised 88 % of the total tiger prawn catch over the two years.

Approximately equal numbers of P. semisulcatus were caught in seagrass and algal beds in the pre-wet season. Very few individuals > 10 mm carapace length of either species, were caught.

40|$|Research paperSince October 2013, {{consecutive}} {{cases of}} food mislabeling, such as Black <b>Tiger</b> <b>Prawns</b> being sold {{under the name}} of Kuruma Prawns in famous restaurants, department stores, etc., have begun to surface in Japan, and this has become a social problem. This study conducted a consumer questionnaire in free-answer format in November 2013 with the objective of investigating what kinds of images consumers currently held of Kuruma and Black <b>Tiger</b> <b>Prawns</b> directly after the revelation of mislabeling. By applying text-mining analysis to the responses acquired from the questionnaire, the authors (1) extracted frequently occurring words using simple tabulation analysis, and (2) gained an understanding of the relationships between words using co-occurrence network analysis to illuminate consumer images of Kuruma and Black <b>Tiger</b> <b>Prawns...</b>|$|R

40|$|Postlarval and {{juvenile}} <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (Penaeus esculentus and P. semisulcatus) were sampled by beam trawls in different seagrass {{communities of the}} western Gulf of Carpentaria to test the influence of seagrass characteristics on their distribution and abundance. Two sampling regimes were carried out: fortnightly sampling over a 3 month period {{during the time of}} peak recruitment to investigate the importance of different seagrass types to tiger prawns; and at one time to investigate the wider geographic patterns of distribution and abundance of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns.</b> The results from both studies showed that the pattern of distribution and abundance of 1 – 1. 9 mm carapace length (CL) postlarvae differed from those for the 2 – 2. 9 mm CL postlarvae {{and juvenile}} <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> (≥ 3 mm CL). The 1 – 1. 9 mm CL size class consists of individuals that are about to settle and those that have recently settled: this size class was more widely distributed than the larger postlarvae and juveniles and was sometimes found on substrates where no seagrass was present. Larger <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> were found in higher numbers on seagrass beds where the tall, broad-leaved seagrass Enhalus acoroides was the dominant species. Although seagrass biomass was not a consistent linear predictor of juvenile <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> numbers, mean catches of both the 2 – 2. 9 mm CL postlarvae and juvenile P. esculentus were highest when the biomass of seagrass exceeded 100 g m− 2. However, these high biomass seagrass beds contribute only 6 % to the total extent of seagrasses in the shallow waters (< 2. 5 m deep) of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Although the numbers of juvenile <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> were lower in the low-biomass seagrass beds, because of their extent, these seagrass beds are the main nurseries for sustaining the production of the valuable Northern Prawn Fishery in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Normal 0 false false false IN X-NONE X-NONE Most of {{the life}} cycle of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> were estuarine (Delta Mahakam). In the {{juvenile}} stage life in estuarine and the adult stage in marine. The research objective is to assess the potential of the <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> fry catches in the Mahakam Delta, as a source of <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> fry in the Mahakam Delta area farms. Research using interviews and descriptive analysis through monitoring with fishermen. The results showed that the fry <b>tiger</b> <b>prawn</b> from the Delta Mahakam there on the beaches or the edge of the sea where the water is shallow and slightly brackish, as in the Delta Mahakam. Fry can be captured by using rumpon. <b>Tiger</b> <b>prawns</b> fry from Delta Mahakam durability is relatively higher than fry from the hatchery. However, the number and continuity of fry very limited because it depends on the season. Abundance of fry is determined by the number of larvae produced in the wild and their survival is greatly influenced by the availability of food. /* Style Definitions */ table.
