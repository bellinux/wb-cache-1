5|$|Between 1941 and 1946, Harrison was the ship's {{doctor on}} board the Demodocus, a steam liner {{ferrying}} supplies to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean. After the war, Harrison wanted to assist the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), but had to falsify his records <b>by</b> <b>subtracting</b> seven years off his age to qualify for service. During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90students by sheltering them from a Kuomintang officer. By donning an American army officer's uniform, Harrison was able to convince the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done <b>by</b> <b>subtracting</b> the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, they found that the moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred <b>by</b> <b>subtracting</b> the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E

25|$|After {{migrating}} {{further to}} the Shire, its Hobbits begin Shire Reckoning, {{a new system of}} numbering the year.
