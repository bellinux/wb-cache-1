5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. <b>But</b> <b>surely</b> our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} of the LRV led their purchasers quickly looking for replacements and supplements to their fleet. After the MBTA terminated their contract with Boeing-Vertol, they were free {{to make their own}} modifications to the cars. Several systems were upgraded or improved.

The Spartans got out to a nine-point lead, allowed Duke to get within two, but then, scoring their last ten points of the game on free throws, moved on to the Regional Finals.|$|E

25|$|Day 4 saw a {{much more}} {{determined}} approach from the South Africans, aided by a very flat wicket offering little to the bowlers. Smith and McKenzie batted slowly and cautiously, particularly during the morning where the scoring rate was around 1 run per over. Slowly, <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> they built a partnership and started to chip away at England's lead, whilst frustrating the bowlers in the process. Both men would record a century, and the only wicket to fall in the day was Smith who top edged a pull shot from the new ball off James Anderson's bowling shortly after reaching his 100.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay {{included}} the official {{rights for the}} Russian Empire to encourage settling of Armenians from Iran in the newly conquered Russian territories. This also helped in changing {{the demographics of the}} regions considerably. The Treaty of Adrianople, concluded with Turkey in 1829 granted for more mass settling of Armenians in the newly incorporated territories. Slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> the number of Christians, that formerly made out since the 17th century a relatively small minority in the region (except for Georgia), were starting to compose an ever-growing number of the total population, especially in the former Iranian-ruled Armenian and Georgian territories.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the chaos of the Crusaders army. As it marched across the Anatolian peninsula, it encountered frequent Turkish raids, despite official gestures of friendship from the Sultanate of Rûm under Kilij Arslan II. Not bearing to stand by and do nothing, Frederick sacked Iconium, capital of the Sultanate, before moving on. Isaac did not seize the initiative and Kilij Arslan II returned later to reclaim his fallen capital. Frederick's army would later slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> disband after the Holy Roman Emperor was found dead (presumed to have either drowned in a river, suffered a heart attack or perhaps both). More looting and damage would be done by these weary soldiers as they retreated back to Europe.|$|E

25|$|Rijkaard's {{coaching}} {{career began}} when he was appointed manager of the Netherlands national team in 1998. He had previously served as an assistant coach, along with Johan Neeskens and Ronald Koeman under the managerial tenure of Guus Hiddink. At the time, he was not taken seriously as a manager because of his inexperience, but {{he was able to}} guide his national side to the semi-finals of Euro 2000. During the group phase, the Dutch team won slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> and managed to get three victories: 1–0 against the Czech Republic, 3–0 against Denmark and 3–2 against France. In the quarter-final, his side produced the biggest win of the competition, a 6–1 result against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands played some of the best football of the tournament, but lost their semi-final match to Italy on penalties; Rijkaard resigned immediately.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Napoleon Bonaparte at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo in Waterloo, Brabant, {{sovereignty}} over the Austrian Netherlands – Belgium minus the East Cantons and Luxembourg – was given by the Congress of Vienna (1815) to the United Netherlands (Dutch: Verenigde Nederlanden), the state that briefly existed under Sovereign Prince William I of Orange Nassau, the latter King William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, after the French Empire was driven out of the Dutch territories. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was born. The Protestant King of the Netherlands, William I rapidly started the industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. The political system that was set up however, slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> failed to forge a true union between the northern and the southern parts of the Kingdom. The southern bourgeoisie mainly was Roman Catholic, {{in contrast to the}} mainly Protestant north; large parts of the southern bourgeoisie also primarily spoke French rather than Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether {{he might be}} the other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular nature of his experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised the next time they meet. Estragon awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E

25|$|England's fourth Super Eight {{game was}} against Bangladesh, who had proven {{themselves}} to be tricky opposition, having beaten South Africa in their previous match. However, the Tiger's were bowled out for just 143, with Sajid Mahmood and Monty Panesar each taking three wickets. Nixon took two catches, both off the bowling of James Anderson. In the chase, England struggled, crumbling to 110–6, with an awkward 34 still needed for victory. Nixon, along with Paul Collingwood, slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> chipped away at the total and took England to a four wicket win. Nixon finished on 20 not out, hitting a 4 and a 6 along the way. He faced 39 deliveries, compared to Collingwood's 74, for 23 runs. This crucial partnership of 37 kept their nation's World Cup dream alive. This knock took Nixon's average in the competition to 51.33, bettered in the England team only by the stalwart Collingwood and the expansive Pietersen.|$|E
25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} one of the most {{dramatic}} sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the early Muslim conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries, the {{hitherto}} largely uninfluential Arabic language slowly <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> replaced many (but not all) of the indigenous Semitic languages and cultures of the Near East. Both the Near East and North Africa saw an influx of Muslim Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula, followed later by non-Semitic Muslim Iranian and Turkic peoples. The previously dominant Aramaic dialects gradually began to be sidelined, however descendant dialects of Eastern Aramaic (including the Akkadian influenced Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Turoyo and Mandaic) survive to this day among the Assyrians and Mandaeans of northern Iraq, northwestern Iran, northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey, with up to a million fluent speakers. Western Aramaic is now only spoken by a few thousand Syriac Christians in western Syria. The Arabs spread their Central Semitic language to North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and northern Sudan and Mauritania) where it gradually replaced Egyptian Coptic and many Berber languages (although Berber is still largely extant in many areas), and for a time to the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar) and Malta.|$|E
