5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including <b>broken</b> <b>and</b> healed ribs, a <b>broken</b> (<b>and</b> healed) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, {{about the size of a}} Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E

40|$|Nine lots of {{long-grain rice}} were milled, {{and the basic}} rice {{components}} (hulls, bran, <b>brokens,</b> <b>and</b> head rice) were segregated. Serial dilutions of ground samples were conducted to determine aerobic plate counts (APC) and coliform counts. Signifi-cant differences (p< 0. 05) in bacterial counts {{were found between the}} components for both APCs and coliform counts. The mean APCs in the basic rice components were ranked in the following order from the highest counts to lowest: hulls, bran, <b>brokens,</b> <b>and</b> head rice.
