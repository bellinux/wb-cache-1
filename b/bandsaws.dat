25|$|Power hacksaws (with {{reciprocating}} blades) {{were once}} {{common in the}} metalworking industries, but <b>bandsaws</b> and cold saws have mostly displaced them.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of the}} bandsaw {{dates back}} to at least 1809, when William Newberry {{received}} a British patent for the idea, but <b>bandsaws</b> remained impractical {{largely because of the}} inability to produce accurate and durable blades using the technology of the day. Constant flexing of the blade over the wheels caused either the material or the joint welding it into a loop to fail.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bandsaws</b> {{dedicated}} to industrial metal-cutting use, such as for structural steel in fabrication shops and for bar stock in machine shops, {{are available in}} vertical and horizontal designs. Typical band speeds range from 40 feet (12 meters) per minute to 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) per minute, although specialized <b>bandsaws</b> are built for friction cutting of hard metals and run band speeds to 15,000 feet per minute. [...] Metal-cutting <b>bandsaws</b> are usually equipped with brushes or brushwheels to prevent chips from becoming stuck in between the blade's teeth. [...] Systems which cool the blade with cutting fluid are also common equipment on metal-cutting <b>bandsaws.</b> [...] The coolant washes away swarf and keeps the blade cool and lubricated.|$|E
40|$|Steel {{manufacturers}} and stockholders prefer <b>bandsawing</b> for cutting off raw materials {{compared to other}} techniques as it enjoys competitive advantages of higher accuracy of cut, better surface finish, lower kerf loss, better straightness of cut, long tool life and high metal removal rate. Along with the geometries of the <b>bandsaw</b> tooth, <b>bandsaw</b> cutting edge condition (e. g., edge sharpness and burr) significantly affects the cutting performance of a <b>bandsaw.</b> Currently the production of <b>bandsaw</b> is largely done by milling operation due to the scale of manufacturing and the economics of milling compared to other processes (e. g., grinding). Ideally, the <b>bandsaw</b> teeth should possess sharp cutting edges with no burr. In general, two types of burr are commonly seen in the <b>bandsaw</b> teeth manufactured by milling operation namely tooth tip burr and side burr. Current research undertaken at Northumbria University in collaboration with a major <b>bandsaw</b> producer {{is focused on the}} mechanism of burr formation in the <b>bandsaw</b> teeth. This paper briefly outlines the factors affecting the burr formation in bimetal (High Speed Steel edge wire and soft steel backing material) <b>bandsaw</b> teeth manufactured by milling process and suggests the necessary steps to be considered for manufacturing burr free <b>bandsaw</b> with sharp cutting edges. The investigation showed that flank wear in the milling cutter has a major influence on the side burr formation in the <b>bandsaw</b> teeth, whereas tooth tip burr was influenced by both flank wear and ''V'' type notch wear found at the crossover point on the flank face. It was also concluded that TiN coating on the milling cutter could control the burr formation in <b>bandsaw</b> teeth to some degree...|$|R
30|$|The {{validity}} of a <b>bandsaw</b> roll-tensioning theory {{developed by the}} author is verified based on a model experiment. It is shown that the actual roll-tensioning process can be clearly explained by this theory. Roll-stretching force transmission coefficients are introduced in this theory. These coefficients, which indicate {{the magnitude of the}} compression force parallel to the <b>bandsaw</b> surface at the roll-stretching position, are affected by the thickness of the <b>bandsaw</b> blade, the radius of the <b>bandsaw</b> blade vent at the measurement of tension, and the straightness of the <b>bandsaw</b> blade at the measurement of crown back, among others. For the practical use of this theory, therefore, it is necessary to determine the proper magnitude of these coefficients based on tensioning experiments.|$|R
25|$|The first American <b>bandsaw</b> patent {{was granted}} to Benjamin Barker of Ellsworth, Maine, in January 1836. The first factory {{produced}} and commercially available <b>bandsaw</b> in the U.S. was by a design of Paul Prybil.|$|R
2500|$|Almost all <b>bandsaws</b> {{today are}} powered by an {{electric}} motor. Line shaft versions were once common but are now antiques.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{workshops}} in residential garages or basements and in light industry contain small or medium-sized <b>bandsaws</b> that can cut wood, metal, or plastic. Often a general-purpose blade {{is left in}} place, although blades optimized for wood or metal can be switched out when volume of use warrants. Most residential and commercial <b>bandsaws</b> are of the vertical type mounted on a bench or a cabinet stand. Portable power tool versions, including cordless models, are also common in recent decades, allowing building contractors to bring them along on the truck to the jobsite.|$|E
2500|$|Timber mills use {{very large}} <b>bandsaws</b> for ripping lumber; they are {{preferred}} over circular saws for ripping {{because they can}} accommodate large-diameter timber and because of their smaller [...] (cut size), resulting in less waste.|$|E
40|$|The {{database}} construction {{procedure for}} a <b>bandsaw</b> roll-tensioning manual {{is shown in}} this article. The procedure consists of calculating the amount of tension and crown back, setting the calculation algorithm for the modification of tension and/or crown back, and collecting the quantitative data of <b>bandsaw</b> roll-tensioning of skilled saw fillers. Key words: basic theory of <b>bandsaw</b> roll-tensioning, calculation {{of the amount of}} tension and crown back, modification of tension and/or crown back, database construction 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{ring saw}} {{is a form}} of <b>bandsaw</b> where the band is rigid, rather than flexible. This {{requires}} the band to be circular, rather than the <b>bandsaw's</b> usual oblong of straight runs between two (or three) guide wheels.|$|R
30|$|<b>Bandsaw</b> roll-tensioning was {{theoretically}} {{analyzed by}} amplifying Aoyama's fundamental equations. In the analysis the accumulated amount of tension after several roll-stretching passes was expressed as the linear accumulation {{of the amount}} of tension at each roll-stretching pass. The same condition was applied for the expression of the accumulated amount of crown back. The relations between the distance from the gullet in the transverse direction of the <b>bandsaw</b> blade to the roll-stretching point and the distance from the gullet in the transverse direction of the <b>bandsaw</b> blade at which the amount of tension becomes maximum, minimum, or zero were clarified. To meet the requisites to adjust the amount of tension at an arbitrary distance in the transverse direction of the <b>bandsaw</b> blade or the amount of crown back, an adjusting procedure was developed. The process of <b>bandsaw</b> roll-tensioning can theoretically be controlled by this procedure.|$|R
2500|$|Automatic <b>bandsaws</b> feature preset feed rate, return, fall, part feeding, {{and part}} clamping. [...] These {{are used in}} {{production}} environments where having a machine operator per saw is not practical. [...] One operator can feed and unload many automatic saws.|$|E
2500|$|Head saws {{are large}} <b>bandsaws</b> {{that make the}} initial cuts in a log. [...] They {{generally}} have a [...] tooth space {{on the cutting edge}} and sliver teeth on the back. [...] Sliver teeth are non-cutting teeth designed to wipe slivers out of the way when the blade needs to back out of a cut.|$|E
2500|$|Dual column saws have a pair {{of large}} columns, one {{on either side of}} the work, for very high {{rigidity}} and precision. [...] The dual column setup is unable to make use of a miter base due to inherent design. [...] Dual column saws are the largest variety of machine <b>bandsaws</b> encountered, to the point where some make use of a rotary table and X axis to perform complex cutting.|$|E
40|$|Economical and {{efficient}} machining of titanium alloys {{has always been}} a challenge for the metal cutting industry owing to their poor machinability characteristics, such as high reactivity with tool materials. In recent years, aluminium titanium nitride (AlTiN) coating has attracted increasing attention over traditional TiN coating, due to its superior properties. <b>Bandsawing</b> of titanium alloys has not been investigated in a greater detail compared to other machining operations such as turning, milling and drilling. In the present investigation, AlTiN coating was deposited onto carbide tipped <b>bandsaw</b> teeth and the coating properties were assessed. A modified lathe machine was used for performing the machining tests. Forces experienced by the <b>bandsaw</b> teeth during the machining tests were measured and specific cutting energy was calculated. The results showed that the AlTiN coated <b>bandsaw</b> teeth performed better than the un-coated <b>bandsaw</b> teeth in terms of wear length, force and specific cutting energy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bandsawing</b> {{is a key}} primary {{machining}} operation for cutting off raw material into required dimensions, which is subjected to further secondary {{machining operation}}(s) to manufacture a product or a component. <b>Bandsawing</b> is distinctively characterised from other multipoint cutting operations with small depth of cut or feed per tooth (5 μm - 50 μm) compared to the cutting edge radius (5 μm - 15 μm). <b>Bandsawing</b> performance significantly differs depending on workpiece material characteristics. In the current investigation, performance of <b>bandsawing</b> operation has been scientifically evaluated when cutting two different tool steel materials (Orvar Supreme and Sverker). <b>Bandsawing</b> tests were carried out with 6 different cutting speeds ranging from 31 m/min to 90 m/min and four different depths of cut ranging from 1 μm to 4 μm. Cutting forces and thrust forces were continuously measured throughout the cutting tests. Specific cutting energy parameter calculated based on cutting force and material removal data {{has been used to}} quantitatively measure the efficiency of the metal cutting process at different feeds and speeds. The <b>bandsaw</b> teeth at the worn condition have been studied under a Scanning Electron Microscope to identify wear modes and mechanisms. The chip characteristics at different feeds and speeds have also been discussed. The sawing community including <b>bandsaw</b> end users and design engineers should find the results presented of interest...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} detecting gullet cracks in a <b>bandsaw</b> during sawing by monitoring burst-type acoustic emission (AE) signals with large amplitude. The amplitudes of the AE signal and profile height amplitude distributions based on roughness profiles of the sawn surface were compared for the <b>bandsaw</b> with and without gullet cracks. The amplitudes of the AE signal increased and the sawn surface quality became worse with the increased number of gullet cracks in the <b>bandsaw.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Horizontal <b>bandsaws</b> {{hold the}} {{workpiece}} stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. [...] This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or bar stock to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. [...] Small horizontal <b>bandsaws</b> typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. [...] When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. [...] The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. [...] More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC machining center does.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{full-size}} sawmill, the blades are mounted on wheels with a diameter large {{enough not to}} cause metal fatigue due to flexing when the blade repeatedly changes from a circular to a straight profile. It is stretched very tight (with fatigue strength of the saw metal being the limiting factor). <b>Bandsaws</b> of this size {{need to have a}} deformation worked into them that counteracts the forces and heating of operation. [...] This is called [...] "benching". They also need to be removed and serviced at regular intervals. Sawfilers or sawdoctors are the craftsmen responsible for this work.|$|E
2500|$|A bandsaw (also written band saw) is a {{saw with}} a long, sharp blade {{consisting}} of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action {{as a result of}} an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. [...] Most <b>bandsaws</b> have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may have three or four to distribute the load. The blade itself can come in a variety of sizes and tooth pitches (teeth per inch, or TPI), which enables the machine to be highly versatile and able to cut a wide variety of materials including wood, metal and plastic.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Bandsawing</b> is an {{important}} primary operation {{in a variety of}} industries, particularly steel suppliers who need to cut-off raw material for secondary processes. <b>Bandsawing</b> is a competitive method of cutting to size as it achieves a low kerf width, high metal removal rates, and good surface finish. One specific feature of the <b>bandsaw</b> metal-cutting operation is that the depth of cut per cutting edge is small (5 – 50 µm). Under conditions of low depth of cut and restricted chip formation, metal is removed by a complex combination of fragmented chips, ploughing, and some continuous conventional chips. The process of <b>bandsawing</b> is scientifically evaluated by measuring forces and associated parameters. Wear modes and mechanisms are also monitored, characterized, and their validity discussed...|$|R
