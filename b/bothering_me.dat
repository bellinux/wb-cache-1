500|$|When Charles {{became ill}} in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; {{she had three}} {{children}} and had already lost two infants. During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, [...] "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find out what she wants and stop her from annoying and <b>bothering</b> <b>me.</b> As his illness worsened {{at the turn of}} the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when she moved her residence to the HÃ´tel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, [...] "it would be unjust to blame her if she did not want to live with a madman." ...|$|E

2500|$|Megatokyo began {{publication}} as a {{joint project}} between Fred Gallagher and Rodney Caston, {{along with a}} few internet acquaintances. Gallagher and Caston later became business partners, as well. According to Gallagher, the comic's first two strips were drawn in reaction to Caston being [...] "convinced that he and I could do ... <b>bothering</b> <b>me</b> incessantly about it", without any planning or pre-determined storyline. The comic's title was derived from an Internet domain owned by Caston, which had hosted a short-lived gaming news site maintained by Caston before the comic's creation. With Caston co-writing the comic's scripts and Gallagher supplying its artwork, the comic's popularity quickly increased, eventually reaching levels comparable to those of such popular webcomics as Penny Arcade and PvP. According to Gallagher, Megatokyos popularity was not intended, as the project was originally an experiment to help him improve his writing and illustrating skills for his future project, Warmth.|$|E
