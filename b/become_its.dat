Marduk called forth Cyrus to enter Babylon and <b>become</b> <b>its</b> new ruler.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Pixar {{continued}} its successful relationship with Walt Disney Feature Animation, a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately <b>become</b> <b>its</b> most important partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 {{employees in the}} company's computer hardware department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad, reduced {{the total number of}} employees to just 42, essentially its original number. Yet Pixar made a historic $26million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was Toy Story. By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for Sesame Street the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.|$|E
5|$|General {{elections}} were held on 10 October 2002 under Musharraf to elect the National Assembly.

Abbasi indicated that the exile of Sharif disappointed the people, due to which PML (N) only won 19 out of 342 seats in the National Assembly. People from his constituency claim he contested the election unwillingly, explaining why he lost it. After his defeat, he distanced himself from politics to focus on Airblue Limited, which he founded in 2003. He served as its first chairman until 2007 {{and then went on}} to <b>become</b> <b>its</b> chief operating officer. According to BBC Urdu, he had close contacts with Shujaat Hussain, leader of the then ruling party, and from whom Abbasi gained support for his airline.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s.

Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
