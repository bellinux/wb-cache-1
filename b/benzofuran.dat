Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus.

40|$|<b>Benzofurans</b> are newly used psychoactive substances, {{but their}} {{pharmacology}} is unknown. The {{aim of the}} present study was to pharmacologically characterize <b>benzofurans</b> in vitro.; We assessed the effects of the <b>benzofurans</b> 5 -APB, 5 -APDB, 6 -APB, 6 -APDB, 4 -APB, 7 -APB, 5 -EAPB and 5 -MAPDB and benzodifuran 2 C-B-FLY on the human noradrenaline (NA), dopamine and 5 -HT uptake transporters using HEK 293 cells that express the respective transporters. We also investigated the release of NA, dopamine and 5 -HT from monoamine-preloaded cells, monoamine receptor-binding affinity and 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptor activation.; All of the <b>benzofurans</b> inhibited NA and 5 -HT uptake more than dopamine uptake, similar to methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and unlike methamphetamine. All of the <b>benzofurans</b> also released monoamines and interacted with trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TA 1 receptor), similar to classic amphetamines. Most <b>benzofurans</b> were partial 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonists similar to MDMA, but also 5 -HT 2 B receptor agonists, unlike MDMA and methamphetamine. The benzodifuran 2 C-B-FLY very potently interacted with 5 -HT 2 receptors and also bound to TA 1 receptors.; Despite very similar structures, differences were found in the pharmacological profiles of different <b>benzofurans</b> and compared with their amphetamine analogues. <b>Benzofurans</b> acted as indirect monoamine agonists that interact with transporters similarly to MDMA. The <b>benzofurans</b> also interacted with 5 -HT receptors. This pharmacological profile probably results in MDMA-like entactogenic psychoactive properties. However, <b>benzofurans</b> induce 5 -HT 2 B receptor activation associated with heart valve fibrosis. The pharmacology of 2 C-B-FLY indicates predominant hallucinogenic properties and a risk for vasoconstriction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{oxidation}} of 3 -alkyl <b>benzofurans,</b> indoles, and a benzothiophene by the chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago {{has been}} investigated.
