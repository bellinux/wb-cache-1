40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study investigates mountain effects on a frontal system in three dimensions. A numerical hydrostatic primitive-equation model is employed. The frontal system is {{developed in the}} model from the most unsteady Eady wave in a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>state</b> and is then introduced into a new model domain that contains mountain ridges of difference sizes, shapes and orientations, The cold front experiences a weakening on the upwind slope and strengthening on the downward slope of a mountain. Mountain-induced homogenetic forcing by these winds associated with the front produces frontogenesis/frontolysis at different locations. The deformation and the distortion if the front by a mountain is a superposition effect of the mountain-induced frontogenesis regions and the original front. The front recovers its original horizontal structure after {{moves away from the}} mountain. The frotogenetic forcing is dominated mainly by the convergence/divergence associated with the flow over the mountain. Major intensification occurs on the lee side convergence zone. Frontal intensity returns approximately to the original level when the front moves away from the mountain. Mountain orientation is an important factor that determines the frontal distortion [...] [URL] Republic of China Central Weather Burea...|$|E
40|$|A “most {{probable}} state” equilibrium statistical {{theory for}} random distributions of hetons {{in a closed}} basin is developed here {{in the context of}} two-layer quasigeostrophic models for the spreading phase of open-ocean convection. The theory depends only on bulk conserved quantities such as energy, circulation, and the range of values of potential vorticity in each layer. The simplest theory is formulated for a uniform cooling event over the entire basin that triggers a homogeneous random distribution of convective towers. For a small Rossby deformation radius typical for open-ocean convection sites, the most probable states that arise from this theory strongly resemble the saturated <b>baroclinic</b> <b>states</b> of the spreading phase of convection, with a stabilizing barotropic rim current and localized temperature anomaly...|$|R

The model consisted of an Eady <b>baroclinic</b> basic <b>state</b> and uneven Elkman dissipation at the top and bottom boundaries with/without slopes. The method of solution used a truncated spectral expansion with three zonal waves and one or two meridional modes.

40|$|The {{presence}} of bottom topography in a baroclinic flow modifies {{the properties of}} the propagating baroclinic unstable modes and allows for the appearance of new unstable modes which are nonpropagating, as first shown by Charney and Straus. Mountain form-drag, which provides a coupling mechanism between the zonal flow and the waves, is the essential ingredient for topographic instability. In this paper, the properties of instability for both zonally symmetric and asymmetric <b>baroclinic</b> basic <b>states</b> in the {{presence of}} topographic forcing are investigated. The results in a two-layer and a continuously stratified atmosphere are also compared and discussed. We find that two different types of topographic instability exist, one which is essentially baroclinic and is present in symmetric and asymmetric basic states, the other which is mixed barotropic-baroclinic and is present only in asymmetric basic states...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a novel numerical method for obtaining structures of rapidly rotating stars {{based on a}} self-consistent field scheme. The solution is obtained iteratively. Both rapidly rotating barotropic and <b>baroclinic</b> equilibrium <b>states</b> are calculated self-consistently using this method. Two types of rotating baroclinic stars are investigated by changing the isentropic surfaces inside the star. Solution sequences of these are calculated systematically and critical rotation models beyond which no rotating equilibrium state exists are also obtained. All of these rotating baroclinic stars satisfy necessarily the Bjerknes-Rosseland rules. Self-consistent solutions of baro-clinic stars with shellular-type rotation are successfully obtained where the isentropic surfaces are oblate and the surface temperature is hotter at the poles than at the equator if {{it is assumed that}} the star is an ideal gas star. These are the first self-consistent and systematic solutions of rapidly rotating baroclinic stars with shellular-type rotations. Since they satisfy the stability criterion due to their rapid rotation, these rotating baroclinic stars would be dynamically stable. This novel numerical method and the solutions of the rapidly rotating baroclinic stars will be useful for investigating stellar evolution with rapid rotations.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new formulation to obtain self-gravitating, axisymmetric configurations in permanent rotation. The formulation {{is based on the}} Lagrangian variational principle with a triangulated mesh. It treats not only barotropic but also <b>baroclinic</b> equations of <b>state.</b> We compare the various stellar equilibria obtained by our new scheme with those by Hachisu's self-consistent field scheme for the barotropic case, and those by Fujisawa's self-consistent field scheme for the baroclinic case. Included in these rotational configurations are those with shellular-type rotations, which are commonly assumed in the evolution calculation of rotating stars. Although radiation processes, convections and meridional flows have not been taken into account in this study, we have in mind the application of this method to the two-dimensional evolution calculations of rotating stars, for which the Lagrangian formulation is best suited.

40|$|A {{baroclinic}} model was developed. The model is linear, steady <b>state,</b> <b>baroclinic</b> (2 level) {{and based on}} the primitive equations. The unique features of the model are: (1) The basic state u and T fields are functions of wavelength, theta, and rho, (2) A mean meridional circulation v, w, which may be a function of wavelength, theta, and rho, and p may be included, (3) Dissipation may be a function of theta, wavelength, rho, p (e. g., differ over land and sea). Because the basic state is a function of longitude, the equations are not separable in wavelength and the usual semi-spectral solution procedure is not applicable. The model solutions {{can be found in a}} straight forward (brute force) way by discretizing the model equations directly on a wavelength, theta, rho, p grid. There are six dependent (perturbation) variables: u, v, and geopotential at levels 1 and 2. The thermal forcing is prescribed at the intermediate vertical level. The linearized equations may be written...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new formulation to obtain self-gravitating, axisymmetric configurations in permanent rotation. The formulation {{is based on the}} Lagrangian variational principle, and treats not only barotropic but also <b>baroclinic</b> equations of <b>state,</b> for which angular momentum distributions are not necessarily cylindrical. We adopt a Monte Carlo technique, which is analogous to those employed in other fields, e. g. nuclear physics, in minimizing the energy functional, which is evaluated on a triangulated mesh. This letter is a proof of principle and detailed comparisons with existing results will be reported in the sequel, but some test calculations are presented, in which we have achieved an error of $O(10 ^{- 4 }) $ in the Virial relation. We have in mind the application of this method to two-dimensional calculations of the evolutions of rotating stars, for which the Lagrangian formulation is best suited.

40|$|Context. The {{understanding}} of fossil fields origin, topology and stability {{is one of}} the corner stones of the stellar magnetism theory. On one hand, since they survive over secular time-scales, they may modify the structure and the evolution of their host stars. On the other hand, they must have a complex stable structure since it has been demonstrated by Tayler and collaborators that simplest purely poloidal or toroidal fields are unstable on dynamical time-scales. In this context, the only stable configuration which has been found today is the one resulting of a numerical simulation by Braithwaite and collaborators who have studied the evolution of an initial stochastic magnetic field, which is found to relax on a mixed stable configuration (poloidal and toroidal) that seems to be in equilibrium and then diffuses. Aims. In this work, we thus go on the track of such type of equilibrium field in a semi-analytical way. Methods. In this first article, we study the barotropic magnetohydrostatic equilibrium states; the problem reduces to a Grad-Shafranov-like equation with arbitrary functions. Those latters are constrained by deriving the lowest-energy equilibrium states for given invari-ants of the considered axisymmetric problem and in particular for a given helicity which is known {{to be one of the}} main actor of such problems. Then, we obtain the generalization of the force-free Taylor’s relaxation states obtained in laboratory experiments (in spheromaks) that become non force-free in the self-gravitating stellar case. The case of general <b>baroclinic</b> equilibrium <b>states</b> will be studied in Paper II. Results. Those theoretical results are applied to realistic stellar cases, namely to the solar radiative core and to the envelope of an Ap star, and discussed. In both cases we assume that the field is initially confined in the stellar radiation zone. Key words.

40|$|In situ {{observations}} of tidally driven turbulence were obtained {{in a small}} channel that transects {{the crest of the}} Mendocino Ridge, a site of mixed (diurnal and semidiurnal) tides. Diurnal tides are subinertial at this latitude, and once per day a trapped tide leads to large flows through the channel giving rise to tidal excursion lengths comparable to the width of the ridge crest. During these times, energetic turbulence is observed in the channel, with overturns spanning almost half of the full water depth. A high-resolution, nonhydrostatic, 2. 5 -dimensional simulation is used to interpret the observations in terms of the advection of a breaking tidal lee wave that extends from the ridge crest to the surface and the subsequent development of a hydraulic jump on the flanks of the ridge. Modeled dissipation rates show that turbulence is strongest on the flanks of the ridge and that local dissipation accounts for 28 % of the energy converted from the barotropic tide into <b>baroclinic</b> motion.

40|$|We {{investigate}} processes {{leading to}} uncertainty in forecasts of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). A climate model {{is used to}} supply initial conditions for ensemble simulations in which members initially have identical ocean states but perturbed atmosphere <b>states.</b> <b>Baroclinic</b> transports diverge on interannual timescales even though the ocean is not eddy-permitting. Interannual fluctuations of the model AMOC in the subtropical gyre are caused by westward propagating Rossby waves. Divergence of the predicted AMOC with time occurs because the waves develop different phases in different ensemble members predominantly {{due to differences in}} eastern boundary windstress curl. These windstress fluctuations communicate with interior ocean transports via modifications to the vertical velocity and the vortex stretching term dw/dz. Consequently, errors propagate westwards resulting in longer predictability times in the interior ocean compared with the eastern boundary. Another source of divergence is transport anomalies propagating along the Gulf Stream (and other boundary currents). The propagation mechanism seems to be predominantly advection by mean currents, and we show that the arrival of westward propagating waves can trigger development of these anomalies. The mean state of the AMOC has a small effect on interannual predictability in the subtropical gyre, most likely because eastern boundary windstress curl predictability is not strongly dependent {{on the state of the}} AMOC in the subtropics. Eastern boundary windstress curl was more predictable at 45 {degree sign}N when the AMOC was in a strongly decreasing state, but, unlike at 30 {degree sign}N, no mechanism was found linking windstress curl fluctuations with deep transports...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Prototype Systeme 2 Global (PSY 2 G), {{the first}} Mercator global Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) to assimilate along-track sea level anomaly (SLA) satellite data. Based on a coarse resolution ocean model, this system was developed mainly for climatic purposes and will provide, for example, initial oceanic states for coupled ocean-atmosphere seasonal predictions. It has been operational since 3 September 2003 and produces an analysis and a two-week forecast {{for the global}} ocean every week. The PSY 2 G system uses an incremental assimilation scheme based on the Cooper and Haines [Cooper, M., Haines, K., 1996. Data assimilation with water property conservation. J. Geophys. Res., 101, 1059 - 1077. ] lifting-lowering of isopycnals. The SLA increment is obtained using an optimal interpolation method then the correction is partitioned into baroclinic and barotropic contributions. The <b>baroclinic</b> ocean <b>state</b> correction consists of temperature, salinity and geostrophic velocity increments and the barotropic correction is a barotropic velocity increment. A reanalysis (1993 - 2003) was carried out that enabled the PSY 2 G system to perform its first operational cycle. All available SLA data sets (TOPEX/Poseidon, ERS 2, Geosat-Follow-On, Jason 1 and Envisat) were assimilated for the 1993 - 2003 period. The major objective {{of this study is}} to assess the reanalysis from both an assimilation and a thermodynamic point of view in order to evaluate its realism, especially in the tropical band which is a key region for climatic studies. Although the system is also able to deliver forecasts, we have mainly focused on analysis. These results are useful because they give an a priori estimation of the qualities and capabilities of the operational ocean analysis system that has been implemented. In particular, the reanalysis identifies some regional biases in sea level variability such as near the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, in the eastern Equatorial Pacific and in the Norwegian Sea (generally less than 1 cm) with a small seasonal cycle. This is attributed to changes in mean circulation and vertical stratification caused by the assimilation methodology. But the model's low resolution, inaccurate physical parameterisations (especially for ocean-ice interactions) and surface atmospheric forcing also contribute to the occurrence of the SLA biases. A detailed analysis of the thermohaline structure of the ocean reveals that the isopycnal lifting-lowering tends to diffuse vertically the main thermocline. The impact on temperature is that the surface layer (0 - 200 m) becomes cooler whereas in deeper waters (from 500 to 1500 m), the ocean becomes slightly warmer. This is particularly true in the tropics, between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S. However it can be demonstrated that the assimilation improves the variability in both surface currents and sub-surface temperature in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean...|$|R
