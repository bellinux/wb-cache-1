5000|$|John Harrison, in {{the course}} of his {{development}} of the marine chronometer, solved the problem by a [...] "compensation curb" [...] - essentially a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>thermometer</b> which adjusted the effective length of the balance spring as a function of temperature. While this scheme worked well enough to allow Harrison to meet the standards set by the Longitude Act, it was not widely adopted.|$|E
50|$|The metal-paper coil {{hygrometer}} is {{very useful}} for giving a dial indication of humidity changes. It appears {{most often in}} very inexpensive devices, and its accuracy is limited, with variations of 10% or more. In these devices, water vapour is absorbed by a salt-impregnated paper strip attached to a metal coil, causing the coil to change shape. These changes (analogous to those in a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>thermometer)</b> cause an indication on a dial.|$|E
40|$|Is {{the cook}} really {{responsible}} when someone becomes ill with E. coli O 157 :H 7 from an undercooked hamburger, {{or is it}} the government? In this report, I will point out that it is our government, which tells us that the <b>bimetallic</b> coil <b>thermometer</b> can accurately measure the temperature of the thin, mixed foods such as hamburger and sausage, which are contaminate...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{temperature}} measurement is ever present {{in science and}} industry from requirements for monitoring processes, {{in the management of}} quality control and research. Temperature can be measured by means of direct contact between the medium of interest and the measuring device or by remote observation of a temperature-dependent parameter. The range of devices with which temperature can be measured is extensive, not surprisingly because most physical parameters exhibit a dependency on temperature. In recent years the dominant position of liquid-in-glass and <b>bimetallic</b> <b>thermometers,</b> thermocouples, and resistant temperature detectors has been challenged as the common choice for temperature measurement by infrared thermometers and an increasing array of other noninvasive techniques. This chapter outlines the principal techniques available for the measurement of temperature, describing the physical phenomena exploited, the temperature range of use, equipment required, and typical applications. Recent trends in requirements for traceability and quantification of uncertainty, as well as developments in the areas of instrumentation capability and technique, are described...|$|R
40|$|Temperature is a {{fundamental}} thermodynamic variable, the measurement of which is crucial in countless scientific investigations and technological developments, accounting at present for 75 %– 80 % of the sensor market throughout the world. The traditional liquid-filled and <b>bimetallic</b> <b>thermometers,</b> the thermocouples, the pyrometers and the thermistors are generally not suitable for temperature measurements at scales below 10 m. This intrinsic limitation has encouraged {{the development of new}} non-contact accurate thermometers with micrometric and nanometric precision, a challenging research topic increasingly hankered for. This work describes absolute temperature sensing/mapping − in the 10 - 350 K range and submicrometer spatial resolution − using magnetic siloxane-based hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) co-doped with Eu 3 + and Tb 3 + tris(β-diketonate) chelates. This unique luminescent self-referencing nanothermometer has been recently reported by us [1, 2]. The developed thermometer has up to 4. 9 %·K- 1 temperature sensitivity (1. 5 times larger than the highest value reported previously) and it exhibits high photostability for long-term use. The variation of the Eu 3 +/Tb 3 + ratio affords tunability to the temperature working range as shown in Figure 1...|$|R
50|$|Harrison's last {{home was}} in Red Lion Square in London, now {{a short walk}} from the Holborn Underground station. There is a plaque {{dedicated}} to Harrison on the wall of Summit House in {{the south side of the}} square. A memorial tablet to Harrison was unveiled in Westminster Abbey on 24 March 2006, finally recognising him as a worthy companion to his friend George Graham and Thomas Tompion, 'The Father of English Watchmaking', who are both buried in the Abbey. The memorial shows a meridian line (line of constant longitude) in two metals to highlight Harrison's most widespread invention, the <b>bimetallic</b> strip <b>thermometer.</b> The strip is engraved with its own longitude of 0 degrees, 7 minutes and 35 seconds West.|$|R
