Results indicate that deformation is tiny when steel mesh maintains as an overall ring, and stress caused by vertical bending moment and tension of bottom tie wire are also in the safe range. However, axial forces of lap reinforcement in adjacent steel mesh exceed the ultimate bearing capacity of tie wire. Hence, tie wires are ruptured; single mesh loses lateral connection and turns into monolithic status as the destruction of overall structure. Further more, monolithic steel mesh is led to collapse by the damage of <b>bottom</b> <b>connection.</b> So, in order to prevent connection failure and enhance installation security, the overlapping parts of steel mesh should be taken more reliable measures.

40|$|A typical loop seal {{consists}} of a supply chamber and a recycle chamber {{as well as a}} <b>bottom</b> <b>connection</b> slit in between. The supply chamber is generally operated in the minimum fluidization state, while the recycle chamber in the bubbling fluidization regime. The energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model, as generally used to calculate interphase drag coefficient in previous simulations of the loop seal, is still open to discussion since {{it is based on the}} concept of particle clusters. So an EMMS bubbling model was developed to model dense gas-solid flow by taking into account the interphase interaction between the emulsion and bubble phases. In this article, a heterogeneity index is calculated from an improved EMMS bubbling model to measure the interphase drag coefficient and further integrated into the two-fluid-model (TFM) approach to simulate the loop seal for a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system. This index is dependent on superficial gas velocity in bubbling fluidization, so a region-specific drag correction scheme is proposed to allow the application of various heterogeneity index correlations to different zones of the loop seal, since superficial gas velocity may differ much from the recycle to supply chamber. Several typical cases of drag correction are comparatively investigated by applying various gas velocities and/or drag models in the recycle and supply chambers, and the optimal one is proven to be able to reasonably simulate the parametric effects on gas inverse flow in the loop seal.

40|$|Nonlinear {{coupling}} problems {{between the}} multiple bodies or between the mooring/riser and the offshore platform are {{incorporated in the}} CHARM 3 D-MultiBody, a fully coupled time domain analysis program for multiple bodies with moorings and risers. The nonlinear spring connection module and the three dimensional beam module are added to appropriately solve the structural connection problem. The nonlinear spring connection module includes the hydro-pneumatic tensioner module with the friction & stick/slip implementation, the tendon/mooring disconnection (breakage/unlatch) module with the tendon down-stroke check, and the contact spring with the initial gap with the friction force implemented. The nonlinear coupling may happen in many places for the offshore floating structures, such as hydro-pneumatic tensioner, tendon of TLP down stroke at the bottom joint, stick-slip phenomena at the tie down of the derrick {{and most of the}} fender-to-steel or steel-to-steel contact problem with initial gap during the installation. The mooring/tendon broken and unlatch can be a nonlinear connection problem once the transient mode is taken into account. Nonlinearity of the stiffness and friction characteristics of the tensioner combined with stick-slip behavior of riser keel joint is investigated. The relationship between tensions and strokes for hydro-pneumatic tensioner is based on the ideal gas equation where the isotropic gas constant can be varied to achieve an optimum stroke design based on tensioner stiffness. A transient effect of tendon down-stroke and disconnection on global performance of ETLP for harsh environmental condition is also investigated by incorporating the nonlinear boundary condition of the FE tendon model in CHARM 3 D. The program is made to be capable of modeling the tendon disconnection both at the top and the <b>bottom</b> <b>connection</b> as well as the down stroke behavior for the pinned bottom joint. The performance of the tie-down clamp of derrick is also investigated by using six degrees of freedom spring model and the three(3) dimensional FE beam model. The coupling of the TLP motion with the reaction force at the tie-down clamp is considered by using exact nonlinear dynamic equations of the motion with the reaction forces modeled with the spring or FE beam model. The method reduces too much conservatism when we design the tie-down system by the conventional method, in which all the environmental forces are combined without the phase lag effect between them. The FE beam model is also applied to the connectors between the semisubmersible and the truss for the pre-service and in-place conditions to be verified with the model test results, which shows good agreements...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{daily life}} of {{inhabitants}} of Hagonoy, the Philippines, {{is affected by}} tidal and fluvial floods. Ground subsidence is {{the main cause of}} a worsening trend of these floods. Excessive uncontrolled groundwater subtraction creates a ground level decrease up to 5 cm per year. In combination with yearly six to nine typhoons raging over the country, this leads to unliveable conditions. In order to contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the inhabitants, a modular amphibious structure is designed to keep buildings above the water level. Part I -Background In order to design a suitable amphibious foundation for Hagonoy, a research is done into modular, circular building concepts. Hereby a desired translation of the Dutch building concept of Finch Buildings into a Filipino concept can be made. In combination with criteria concluded from research into floating behaviour of structures and from an analysis of the location, a number of criteria is listed, on which the design of the floating modules and the connections is based. Part II – Structural design By analysing and rating several floating construction types and connection types, a concept design for a modular prefabricated amphibious foundation is made. Timber frame, filled with recycled 200 L barrels is the basis for a flexible building concept. Three scenarios in which the foundation must give a proper structural performance, are outlined. Due to change in water depth, the structure must be able to function in a dry, a just-floating and a floating position. Since this foundation must be able to carry varying configurations of buildings, multiple load cases can occur. The most unfavourable load cases occur during typhoons, due to high wind pressure and high and long wind generated waves. By creating a parametric visualization and calculation model, a first insight in dimensions, and width and length of the amphibious foundation is determined. This concept design for both foundation modules and connections between modules is elaborated more in detail. A timber structure of 1, 20 m x 2, 40 m holds eight 200 L barrels in place. Due to brackish water, the timber structural elements must be protected against shipworm attack. In a brief research several possible solutions are described, of which wrapping structural elements with coir is determined to function best, according to previously stated criteria. In this design, barrels can be replaced in case of damages. Prefabricated foundation modules can be connected by a combination of a U-shaped <b>bottom</b> <b>connection,</b> and a relative fast fixable upper connection. By this connection a rigid wide body can be built in order to provide stability for all scenarios. Two case-studies, one being a foundation with a single building and the second being a foundation with a configuration of eight buildings, are tested by means of SCIA Engineer. For the foundation with a single building in floating position, deflections are too high due to extreme wind-generated wave loads. By increasing the width and length, deflections decreases. The largest bending moments and shear forces occur when the foundation with a configuration of eight buildings touches the soil on one side, due to a large heeling moment. These occurring bending moments and shear forces form an input for optimization of both the foundation module and the connection. In order to reduce the demand for groundwater, and thereby to contribute to reduce of ground subsidence, a design is made for making use of rainwater, and store it in the foundation. In addition waste water can be cleaned by integrated helophyte filters. Bamboo mooring piles create horizontal stability. By replanting bamboo, poles can be replaced over years. Part III - Conclusions A design for a prefabricated modular amphibious structure that is applicable in and adjusted to a flood and typhoon prone area, such as Hagonoy is delivered. Concluded from theory of floating behaviour and a rough cost estimation, a foundation for a single building is not recommended. In order to start building the pilot version, knowledge of actual behaviour of wind generated waves, optimization in the field of structural behaviour and costs are recommended.

40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor, {{involved in the}} wind energy market. Nowadays SHL is preparing on expanding T&I capabilities to include WTGs, after the experiences with foundations, platforms and met-masts. The company desires to enter in this market with innovative and highly efficient solutions. In order to achieve this goal, Oleg Strashnov HLV, SHL’s flagship, has been selected as the ideal means for this path. Indeed, the potential of such a vessel is seen, by the offshore experts, as possibly being applied to the T&I of WTGs in single pieces, including the nacelle. Current practice is to perform the scope in parts, by means of jack-up vessels, addressing {{a great amount of}} the work offshore. Offering an integrated solution would definitely mark a turning point for the market, providing that this new proposal has the economical and efficiency characteristics required. The main challenge for such a proposal, from the structural point of view, is to provide a proper sea-fastening for safe and stable logistical procedures, ensuring structural integrity of both vessel and transported elements. The goal of this thesis is to propose a sea-fastening solution able to meet such requirements. An articulated and detailed path has been followed, from general to more detailed analyses, in order to reach the proposed objectives. Firstly, the definition of the boundary conditions and company’s choices took place, according to the specific needs of the chosen vessel and the solution effectiveness requirements. Current offshore wind energy market situation and trends have been investigated and analysed, in order to find specific WTG designs to use for the study. After the definition of sea state conditions, vessel accelerations have been quantified and the most critical load combination for the WTGs was found. Then, possibilities of sea-fastening arrangements have been analysed, through a conceptual study. In order to deal with the destructive bending moment effects on the WTGs, the concept providing a free moment connection at foundation level has been selected. It was required to provide additional external structures, clamping the WTGs at a certain height, in order to doubly support the transported elements. A parametric study has been carried out to compare the best achievable solution using such a hinged <b>bottom</b> <b>connection,</b> against the best achievable solution adopting a fixed connection. Higher requirements in stiffness, for the external supporting structures, have been found in the case of fixed connection. Among other advantages, important steel savings resulted and it was ensured that final solution did not exceed them. Detailed design has been provided for bottom support, due to its challenges from a structural point of view. Besides rotation, main requirements were vertical and horizontal loads constraint. After a dedicated conceptual analysis, a combination of rubber and steel elements was found to be most effective for the purpose. Linear structural analysis have been carried out, supported by parametric studies. The unusual utilization of rubber for sea-fastening has been analysed and proven to be feasible. Starting from the defined model, additional studies for linear buckling and free vibration analyses followed. Subsequently, focus moved to the intermediate support connection. Where design was less detailed, {{because of the presence of}} features more related to mechanical engineering, considerations and suggestions have been proposed. An innovative flexible clamping connection has been designed and proven to be effective; this involved rubber fenders, steel rings and bracings. Finally, the design was carried out for the bottom grillage system, connecting the above sea-fastening to the vessel deck. Practical considerations led to a conservative solution, able to meet the structural integrity requirements and available for further optimisations. Once all the individual parts were designed, adaptation of initial assumptions and solution final assessment were proposed. With its 8050 tonnes of total weight, such a system is proven to provide safe and efficient T&I activities for six WTGs per voyage. Among the selected models, the ALSTOM 6 MW is chosen for the analysis, because of its most onerous configuration. Structural feasibility and integrity are assessed through hand calculations and FEAs. Boundary conditions are all met and effective features are finally pointed out. Because of the choice of taking advantage of flexibility and the unusual application of rubber elements, the final solution demonstrates clear innovative features. According to the initial conditions, such a sea-fastening system provides a solution for extremely critical sea-states, probably unlikely to appear in real operations.

The intent was to be able to replicate failures in a structural engineering laboratory that were observed during laboratory experiments of hydraulic loading on wood walls at the NEES Tsunami Facility at Oregon State University. The elastic and inelastic response of shear walls, out-of-plane walls, and a full light-frame wood structural system subjected to varying lateral loads were observed using Digital Image Correlation (DIC). DIC provided a non-contact, three-dimensional measurement system that returned displacement results measured at multiple areas of interest on the wall surface. Overall, these experiments show that the elastic stiffness and ultimate capacity of the shear wall is significantly higher at full height compared to intermediate heights on the wall, and the ultimate lateral capacity was higher in comparison to the a full structural system. The results indicate that the out-of-plane wall behaves like a one way slab with limited contribution from adjacent studs in carrying load.

The new model does not utilise bi-d rectional synapses, match-reset loops and vigilance parameter. Novel subsystem is added to select the winning F 2 node conserving competitive learning concept applied to reset wave. It relies on different sequence of operations of ART 2 algorithm, but the classification of the input patterns remains unchanged. In the new architecture, algorithm execution takes almost equal time for each input pattern to be clustered and it has a new strategy in accessing an appropriate node in F 2 with ut having bottom-up connections, generated from F 1 to F 2. However, top-down c nnections {{play an important role in}} matching and resonance. MART 2 classifier of Arabic letters signals is implemented. The raw input signals are segmented and preprocessed depending on two criterions, amplitude average and zero crossings rate which determine voiced and unvoiced frames. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to transform the signals from time domain to frequency domain. The most important features of the letters are extracted to reduce data size. The reduced data are then presented to MART 2 for training and classification. ART 2 and MART 2 are employed for clustering Arabic letters. Experimental results show that the new algorithm of MART 2 generally exhibits faster learning, better clustering performance, lower error level, an improved recognition ability and more accuracy; even without a need of <b>bottom</b> up <b>connections,</b> match-reset loops and a vigilance parameter.

Further details are available here: [URL] axial capacity of large-diameter plain-pipe grouted connections has recently been observed in offshore wind turbine substructures across Europe. Aimed at understanding the implications of this phenomenon, a campaign of structural condition monitoring was undertaken. The measurements showed significant axial displacements occurring between the transition piece and the monopile, which in turn resulted in a considerable amount of wear. Given the existing lack of technical data on the implications that this relative movement has on the wear of grouted connections, a methodology was developed to quantify the likely risk to the foundation integrity of the wear failure mode. The proposed approach consists of a numerical model which applies the wear rate derived from previous experimental testing to the conditions experienced by typical offshore grouted connections, as indicated by the wind turbine generators' supervisory control and data acquisition systems. The output of this model showed that, for a representative sample of the wind farm substructures analysed as a case study, the accumulated lifetime wear would be minimal in the majority of the grouted connection, i. e. less than 0. 4 mm over 75 % of the connection, but a much greater loss in thickness, of the order of 4 mm, was predicted at the very top and <b>bottom</b> of the <b>connection.</b> This assessment is based on the assumptions that no significant changes occur in the surrounding environmental conditions and that the degradation in the grouted connection does not significantly affect the dynamic response of the foundation structure over its life span. Importantly, these assumptions may affect the model's predictions in terms of cumulated wear over time, not in terms of identifying the individual connections to be prioritised when performing remedial work, which is indeed the main intended use of the model...|$|R
