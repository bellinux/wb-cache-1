40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} an idea {{we refer}} to as sufficient bootstrapping, {{which is based on}} retaining only distinct individual responses, and also develop a theoretical framework for the techniques. We demonstrate through numerical illustrations that the proposed sufficient bootstrapping may be better than the conventional bootstrapping in certain situations. The expected gain by the sufficient bootstrapping has been computed for small and large sample sizes. The relative efficiency shows that there could be significant gain by the sufficient bootstrapping and it could reduce computational <b>burden.</b> <b>Variance</b> expressions for both the conventional and sufficient bootstrapping sample means are derived. Here the word "sufficient" is being used {{in the sense that it}} is "sufficient to take just one of any duplicated items in the bootstrap sample" and is not tightly connected to sufficiency in terms of any likelihood perspective. R code for comparing bootstrapping and sufficient bootstrapping are provided. A huge scope of further studies is suggested.

40|$|Background: Currently {{there are}} no known cures and few {{effective}} treatments for mitochondrial disorders. It is also true {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about suitable clinician rated outcomes and how these change over time in this patient cohort. Objective: We sought to evaluate the validity and responsiveness to change of clinician rated outcome measures in patients with m. 3243 A>G-related mitochondrial disease. Methods: We assessed the six minute timed walk (6 MTW), 10 meter walk / test (10 MWT), Timed up and Go (TUG) and the 5 times sit to stand (5 XSTS), in 18 patients (12 sedentary controls), at baseline and a subgroup of 10 control-matched patients following a 16 -week structured aerobic exercise intervention program. Results: All outcome measures assessed were valid and able to differentiate between patients and controls. Disease severity, as measured by the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale, correlated with TUG (r = 0. 54, p = 0. 020) and 10 MWT (r = 0. 47, p = 0. 050). Receiver Operating Curve analysis revealed 5 XSTS to be the most responsive measure (AUC 0. 931; 95 % CI 0. 84 – 1. 00) with responsiveness to change, post intervention, emulating disease <b>burden</b> <b>variance.</b> Conclusions: The 5 XSTS can be used to discriminate between mitochondrial patients and sedentary controls with high accuracy. The 10 MWT and TUG may serve as suitable and clinically relevant clinician rated measures to track disease progression and assess intervention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Family {{caregivers}} play a {{key role}} in palliative care at home, and understanding the interdependencies in the constellation of patient, family caregivers and service providers is important. As few longitudinal studies have examined the influence of patient quality of life (QoL) in palliative care on burden of family caregivers, the aim of this study was to identify correlations between changing patient QoL and changing burden of family caregivers that need consideration in patient management. Methods: Palliative patients with cancer in primary care evaluated their QoL (Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Care, QLQ-C 15 -PAL). They were assessed monthly for an interval of 6  months or until death of the patient. Family caregivers reported the burden they perceived while supporting the patient (Short form of the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers, BSFC). Longitudinal data were analysed for all patients with at least 3 available assessments, considering the most recent data for participants with more than 3 assessments. Changes in patient QoL were analysed using the Friedman test. In a stepwise regression analysis, influences of change in patient QoL on changing caregiver burden were investigated. Results: One hundred patients (63 men, 37 women; average age: 68  years) were enrolled in the study. The most common primary diagnoses were colon, lung or breast cancer. In 58 cases, assessments were available from both patients and caregivers. Patients reported overall quality of life increasing towards end of life, although reporting that physical functioning deteriorated. Symptoms of pain and fatigue bothered patients most. Caregiver burden was moderate and on average did not change over time. In a stepwise regression model, the difference in emotional functioning and the difference in dyspnoea showed an influence on the development of caregiver <b>burden</b> (explained <b>variance</b> of 19. 3  %). Conclusions: Patients’ dyspnoea, feelings of depression and anxiety impacted on the perceived burden of family caregivers, but are manageable symptoms. Our results corroborate the need of regular assessment of patients’ needs taking into account caregiver burden. In this way, general practice teams can intervene early and may more likely meet patients’ needs in the end of life care process.

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{statistical}} framework for meta-analysis of gene- or region-based multimarker rare variant association tests in sequencing association studies. In genome-wide association studies, single-marker meta-analysis {{has been widely}} used to increase statistical power by combining results via regression coefficients and standard errors from different studies. In analysis of rare variants in sequencing studies, region-based multimarker tests are often used to increase power. We propose meta-analysis methods for commonly used gene- or region-based rare variants tests, such as <b>burden</b> tests and <b>variance</b> component tests. Because estimation of regression coefficients of individual rare variants is often unstable or not feasible, the proposed method avoids this difficulty by calculating score statistics instead that only require fitting the null model for each study and then aggregating these score statistics across studies. Our proposed meta-analysis rare variant association tests are conducted based on study-specific summary statistics, specifically score statistics for each variant and between-variant covariance-type (linkage disequilibrium) relationship statistics for each gene or region. The proposed methods are able to incorporate different levels of heterogeneity of genetic effects across studies and are applicable to meta-analysis of multiple ancestry groups. We show that the proposed methods are essentially as powerful as joint analysis by directly pooling individual level genotype data. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our methods by varying levels of heterogeneity across studies, and we apply the proposed methods to meta-analysis of rare variant effects in a multicohort study of the genetics of blood lipid levels...|$|R
40|$|Background. Aging is {{associated}} with greater risk for many illnesses {{and the prospect of}} multiple, concurrent disease states. Chronic pain is also very common in advanced age, and there {{is likely to be a}} relationship with comorbid burden, but few studies have examined this issue. This study tests the hypothesis that comorbid burden {{is associated}} with greater levels of self-reported pain and associated disturbance in mood and function. Methods. Psychometric and medical data were collected from 562 patients (mean age 76. 3 years) attending a geriatric pain clinic. The number of categories endorsed on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) score was used to measure accumulated comorbid burden. These groups were tested for differences in the severity of self-reported pain. The predictive capacity of comorbid <b>burden</b> for explaining <b>variance</b> in mood disturbance and functional disability was assessed after controlling for any differences in age and severity of pain. Results. Over 50 % of the sample had three or more comorbid problems. Groups with greater levels of comorbidity scored higher on the Present Pain Intensity Index, the sensory and affective subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis showed that the CIRS score explained a significant proportion of the variance in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale (4. 1 %), Human Activities Profile (4. 8 %), and the physical domain of the Sickness Impact Profile (5. 9 %). Conclusion. Greater levels of comorbidity are associated with reports of more severe pain, more depressive symptoms...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: So far, little {{attention}} has been paid to the value of dialysis adequacy for patients' quality of life (QL). Therefore we studied the impact of demographic, clinical, and dialysis characteristics on physical symptoms and perceived QL. METHODS: The study population consisted of 120 incident chronic haemodialysis (HD) and 106 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, starting dialysis treatment in 13 Dutch centres. Data were collected 3 months after the start of dialysis. Nine physical symptoms were assessed with a self-administered questionnaire. Patient's self-assessment of QL was measured with the 36 -item MOS Short Form (SF- 36). RESULTS: The most common symptoms in HD and PD were fatigue (respectively 82 and 87 %) and itching (73 and 68 %). In HD only a medium to high comorbidity [...] age risk index was associated with greater symptom burden. In PD also a lower percentage lean body mass, a lower rGFR, and past episodes of underhydration were associated with greater symptom <b>burden.</b> The explained <b>variance</b> by these variables was only 12 % in HD and 21 % in PD. However, greater symptom burden explained a substantial additional amount of impaired physical and mental QL on top of demographics and clinical status. Dialysis variables were associated neither with symptoms nor with QL. CONCLUSION: Symptom burden can be explained to a limited extent by demographic and clinical variables and not by dialysis characteristics. Addition of symptom burden to the other variables makes it possible to explain one-third of perceived QL. This underlines the importance of symptom reduction in order to improve patient's Q...|$|R
40|$|Tolerance to infections {{is defined}} as the ability of a host to limit the impact of a given {{pathogen}} burden on host performance. Uncoupling resistance and tolerance is a challenge, and {{there is a need to}} be able to separate them using specific trait recording or statistical methods. We present three statistical methods that can be used to investigate genetics of tolerance. Firstly, using random regressions, tolerance can be analyzed as a reaction norm slope in which host performance (y-axis) is regressed against an increasing pathogen <b>burden</b> (x-axis). Genetic <b>variance</b> in tolerance slopes is the genetic variance for tolerance. Variation in tolerance can induce genotype re-ranking and changes in genetic and phenotypic variation in host performance along the pathogen burden trajectory, contributing to environment-dependent genetic responses to selection. Such genotype-by-environment interactions can be quantified by combining random regressions and covariance functions. To apply random regressions, pathogen burden of individuals needs to be recorded. Secondly, when pathogen burden is not recorded, the cure model for time-until-death data allows separating two traits, susceptibility and endurance. Susceptibility is whether or not an individual was susceptible to an infection, whereas endurance denotes how long time it took until the infection killed a susceptible animal (influenced by tolerance). Thirdly, the normal mixture model can be used to classify continuously distributed host performance, such as growth rate, into different sub-classes (e. g., non-infected, infected), which allows estimation of host performance reduction specific to infected individuals. Moreover, genetics of host performance can be analysed separately in healthy and affected animals, even in the absence of pathogen burden and survival data. These methods provide novel tools to increase our understanding on the impact of parasites, pathogens and production diseases on host traits...|$|R
