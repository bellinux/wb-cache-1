30|$|The WV ranks {{second in}} the nation for {{explosives}} consumption (Apodaca 2010). Almost 350, 000 tonnes were used in WV surface coal mining in 2009. Considering an average price of blasting agents (bulk emulsions, slurry and ANFO) of $ 1.14 per kg, the surface coal mines in WV spent almost $ 400 million for explosives alone. This does not include additional <b>blasting</b> <b>accessories</b> such as detonators, boosters, detonating cords, lead lines, additional costs for labor, explosives truck-delivery, and shot services. The addition of the drilling, digging and loading costs for the blasted material amounts to a significant overall cost to mine operators.|$|E

On detonation, explosives and <b>blasting</b> <b>accessories</b> produce various types of energy like shock, gas, light, heat, sound, seismic etc,. A good energy product enhances the production and productivity of the mine. It has been experienced that the open pit mining operations are feasible up to 90 m depth and below this it is neither economical nor technically convenient. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} dig out the coal through underground mining operations below this depth to fulfill the demand of power. An underground coal-mine contains methane air mixture and coal dust which are highly inflammable in nature. During blasting they may ignite and causes accidents. Every year, in India and abroad many accidents occur in underground coal mines during the firing of explosive and its accessories. The flame characteristics and detonation temperature of explosives and its accessories are mainly responsible for the ignition of methane air mixture and coal dust. In this paper authors have studied the under water blasting energy and flame characteristics of detonators and detonating fuse which are used in underground mining operation, in detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} for {{protection against the}} hazards of lightning manifests itself {{from time to time}} in the mining industry by reason of loss of life, damage to electrical equipment, fires in surface structures at mines, and accidents in the handling and use of explosives. This paper is intended to assemble, correlate, and present some of the salient. points embodied in the available literature on the subject and at the same time give some factual data concerning instances of such loss of, life and damage to property, with special application to the mining industry The annual loss of life and destruction of property by lightning is considerable; the former may be prevented to a limited extent, though use of common sense as to exposure is required and not always followed; the latter can be prevented to a considerable degree. The manufacturers of electrical equipment,, through improved types of lightning arresters,, have done much toward the protection of electrical equipment, with consequent safeguarding of life and of property. Education based on unfortunate experiences has gone far to discourage the handling of explosives and <b>blasting</b> <b>accessories</b> during thunder storms, especially in open pits and quarries, and to a much smaller extent in underground workings. The lowly lightning rod plays an important role in the protection of certain types of buildings (especially isolated buildings), stacks, monuments, and other structures. LIGHTNING PHENOMENA In 1751, Franklin proved that lightning was simply a visible display of electricity - an extended spark; and until a generation ago little had been added to his exposition, to define the various phases of the phenomenon. Matters pertaining to lightning are discussed in the following references...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of initiation device on environmental effect of blasting. The objectives of the research were achieved through field measurement and data collection. Vibration and noise generated during blasting operations were estimated using mathematical models. Various <b>blasting</b> agents and <b>accessories</b> used for <b>blasting</b> operations were also collected. The results revealed that the noise and vibration generated during blasting with NONEL is minimal {{as compared to the}} safety fuse and the electrical methods. It also has high blasting efficiency of 99. 1 %...|$|R
