50|$|The {{technique}} {{originated in}} 16th century eastern Europe—probably {{in what is}} now the Czech Republic—but remains associated with England because of its popularity there during the 19th century. In the Victorian era, <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise</b> typically had open areas in many sizes. Transfers were used first to lay out the design on the material. In some cases, the holes were punched out with an embroidery stiletto before finishing the edge; in other cases, the fabric was embroidered first, and the hole was cut afterwards, with scissors. Beginning in the 1870s, the designs and techniques of <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise</b> could be copied by the Swiss hand-embroidery machine. Today, most <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise</b> is created by machine.|$|E

50|$|Pantalettes {{originated}} in France {{in the early}} 19th century, and quickly spread to Britain and America. Pantalettes were a form of leggings or long drawers. They could be one-piece or two separate garments, one for each leg, attached at the waist with buttons or laces. The crotch was left open for hygiene reasons. They were most often of white linen fabric and could be decorated with tucks, lace, cutwork or <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{two women}} both wrote fictional {{accounts}} that {{referred to this}} love affair (Challenge by Sackville-West and <b>Broderie</b> <b>Anglaise</b> a roman à clef in French by Trefusis).

50|$|Embroidery {{can also}} be {{classified}} by the similarity of appearance. In drawn thread work and cutwork, the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in {{the same color as}} the foundation fabric. When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as whitework. However, whitework can either be counted or free. Hardanger embroidery is a counted embroidery and the designs are often geometric. Conversely, styles such as <b>Broderie</b> <b>anglaise</b> are similar to free embroidery, with floral or abstract designs that are not dependent on the weave of the fabric.|$|E

5000|$|Techniques or {{styles that}} {{normally}} use openwork {{include all the}} family of lace and cutwork types in textiles, including <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise</b> and many others. Fretwork in wood is used for various types of objects. There has always been great use of openwork in jewellery, not least to save on expensive materials and weight.

[...] Other techniques used casting with moulds, or built up the design with wire or small strips of metal. Essentially flat objects are straightforward to cast using moulds of clay or other materials, and this technique was known in ancient China since before the Shang Dynasty of c. 1600 to 1046 BC. On a larger scale in metal, wrought iron and cast iron decoration more often than not has involved openwork.|$|E

Incidentally, she was also taught little dances for student recitals. She received more substantial dance training from Helen White, an assistant at Webb's studio who had studied abroad with the Italian maestro Enrico Cecchetti. By her, Howes was thoroughly schooled in the fundamentals of ballet technique.

5000|$|A fashionable garment in {{the early}} 20th century was the [...] "peekaboo waist", a blouse made from <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise</b> or sheer fabric, which led to {{complaints}} that flesh could be seen through the eyelets in the embroidery or through the thin fabric. In 1913 the so-called [...] "x&#8209;ray dress", defined as a woman's dress that {{was considered to be}} too sheer or revealing, caused similar consternation. In August that year the Chief of Police of Los Angeles stated his intention to recommend a law banning women from wearing the [...] "diaphanous" [...] x‑ray dress on the streets. H. Russell Albee, the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, ordered the arrest of any woman caught wearing an x‑ray dress on the street, which was defined as a gown cut too low at the neck or split to the knee. The following year in 1914, Jean-Philippe Worth, designer for the renowned Paris couture House of Worth, had a client object to the thickness of the taffeta lining of her dress, which was described as [...] "thinner than a cigarette paper". Worth stated that using an even thinner, sheerer lining fabric would have had the effect of an [...] "x&#8209;ray dress".|$|E

The second item is an ankle length skirt, again trimmed with lace and red ribbons; which has two gathers towards {{the lower end of the}} garment. The third item is the shorter outer skirt, made of Madras material, to which the costume is named. The Madras material is used again in the fourth item, the head piece, known as the Tête en l'air or tèt anlè; a square or rectangular piece of cloth worn over the forehead and folded to display varying numbers of peaks. The head scarf can be tied in a ceremonial fashion or can be worn to show the availability of the woman in courtship, depending on the number of peaks tied into it. One peak represents that the woman is single, two that she is married, three that she is widowed or divorced, and four that she is available to any who tries. The final item is a triangular silk scarf, foulard, pinned to the left shoulder, its apex at the end of the elbow and tucked into the waist of the skirt.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shows how}} the notion of {{androgyny}} works in the fiction of Violet Trefusis. It also posits her writing in connection to some novels by Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf. Working within a theoretical framework provided by Julia Kristeva's psychoanalytical theory this thesis focusses on and seeks to redress the traditional conceptualization of androgyny providing a notion of the androgyne more in accordance to Woolf's androgynous ideal. The androgyne is understood in this thesis as a carnivalesque figure that disrupts the patriarchal system of hierarchical binary oppositions. Chapter Two provides a historical framework to Woolf's androgynous ideal. The research focuses, in Chapter Three, on the literary relationship sustained by Sackville-West, Woolf, and Trefusis which produced an, up to now unexplored, intertextual space where Challenge (1919), Orlando (1928) and <b>Broderie</b> <b>Anglaise</b> (1935) are interwoven. The apprehension of androgyny is an attempt {{on the part of}} these three women writers to find a different type of sentence whose construction has been theorised by Kristeva as Poetic language. This literary practice is an uncomfortable and dangerous one since it implies the avowal of the maternal serniotic in symbolic language. The difficulties in achieving the symbolic positionality of the subject of poetic language are addressed in Chapter Four in the analysis of Trefusis's Echo (1931) and Woolf's Between the Acts (1941). Chapter Five concentrates on Trefusis's discomforting sense of outsiderness. In Pirates at Play (1952) Trefusis explores the dialectics of foreignerness. Through the transubstantiation of her self into an armchair in Memoirs of an Armchair (1960) Trefusis acknowledges her abject in an attempt to relax the boundaries that separate self from other. Finally Chapter Six examines the search of a feminine Jowssance and its connections to death, or rather undeath, in two novels: Sackville-West's All Passion Spent (1931) and Trefusis's Hunt the Slipper (1937) ...|$|E

Clinical care and pedagogic concern would be cast onto the rubbish-tip of civilization. -Barbara Sichtermann, "The Lost Eroticism ofthe Breasts" It's often speculated in the breastfeedingliterature that one reason breastfeeding has been such a hard sell in the post-industrial West is that we prefer to think ofthe female breast as the most sociable of sex aids, rather than as a customized food delivery system for babies and young children. I t is not just that the breast is considered by some to be too sexy for motherhood, hence the property of adult males, and an object that must be protected from the wear and tear that breastfeeding is sometimes reputed to involve. Instead, {{if you look at this}} argument more closely, the breast in question [...] which is an idealized, deodor-ized, and denatured breast [...] promises a certain kind of Disneyfied, cartoon sex that is free fiom many of the risks relating to real, grungy, grown-up sex. Whiie on the one hand this breast is being protected from the hard yakka oflong-term lactation, it is also being straight-jacketed into a particularly narrow concept of nooky, a kind of second-base substitute for the real thing. Not just adult males, but women too, have been seduced by this notion of the breast as both exquisitely refined, yet erogenous, a part of the sexual body that can be adored without the ambivalence or horror that the genitals are apt to inspire. This is sex with arrested development, safely packaged in <b>broderie</b> <b>anglaise,</b> and draped by a cashmere twin-set, awaiting its first grope in the secure darkness of cinema or car.
