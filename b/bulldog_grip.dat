6000|$|Acton nodded. [...] "Oh, yes;" [...] he agreed, [...] "that's quite comprehensible. There's a {{good deal}} of tone about him, but except with women that's not a thing that counts in this country. It's the <b>bulldog</b> <b>grip</b> and grit that goes {{farthest}} here--anyway, when a man has no money behind him." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} fright of surprise, the black's finger {{pulled the trigger}} and his throat loosed an unearthly yell. Knocked forward on his face, he rolled over and grappled with Jerry, who slashed cheek-bone and cheek and ribboned an ear; {{for it is the}} way of an Irish terrier to bite {{repeatedly}} and quickly rather than to hold a <b>bulldog</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Piccolo Wright {{showed how}} he could have tripped him up, and Archie Hawkins said that snuff would make a <b>bulldog</b> loosen his <b>grip,</b> because {{he would have to}} keep sneezing. None of them seemed to have seen either Bunty's shotgun or his bulldog, but they all {{believed}} that he had them because Jim Leonard said so, just as they had believed that Bunty had got done with his melon patch, until all at once one of them said, [...] "Where is Jim Leonard, anyway?" ...|$|R
2500|$|For safety reasons, many show {{societies}} require bulls over 12 {{months to}} be led with a nose ring. [...] A bull may be led by a rope tied through the ring, although a halter (headcollar) is usually also used {{so as not to}} rely unduly on the nose ring for control. If the bull has horns, the lead rope may also be fastened around those and then passed down through the nose ring. [...] Some shows require other cattle {{to be led}} with nose <b>grips</b> (<b>bulldogs).</b> Several methods exist for handling a bull with a ring installed. [...] One method of leading a bull is to have one person {{on either side of the}} bull with both halter lead ropes through the ring, which prevents the bull from gaining pace and also from running into the handlers. Another practice is for one handler to use a rope and the other a bull-staff attached to the ring.|$|R
60|$|But it was {{a desperate}} business. The attackers were five to one, and the five were {{soldiers}} of De Wet, the hard-bitten veterans of a hundred encounters. The captured wagons in a long double row stretched out over the plain, and under this cover the Dutchmen swarmed up to the kraal. But the men who faced them were veterans also, and the defence made up for the disparity of numbers. With fine courage the Boers made their {{way up to the}} village, and established themselves in the outlying huts, but the Mounted Infantry clung desperately to their position. Out of the few officers present Findlay was shot through the head, Moir and Cameron through the heart, and Strong through the stomach. It was a Waggon Hill upon a small scale, two dour lines of skirmishers emptying their rifles into each other at point-blank range. Once more, as at Bothaville, the British Mounted Infantry proved that when it came to a dogged pelting match they could stand punishment longer than their enemy. They suffered terribly. Fifty-one out of the little force were on the ground, and the survivors were not much more numerous than their prisoners. To the 1st Gordons, the 2nd Bedfords, the South Australians, and the New South Welsh men belongs the honour of this magnificent defence. For four hours the fierce battle raged, until at last the parched and powder-stained survivors breathed a prayer of thanks as they saw on the southern horizon the vanguard of De Lisle riding furiously to the rescue. For the last hour, since they had despaired of carrying the kraal, the Boers had busied themselves in removing their convoy; but now, {{for the second time in}} one day, the drivers found British rifles pointed at their heads, and the oxen were turned once more and brought back to those who had fought so hard to hold them. Twenty-eight killed and twenty-six wounded were the losses in this desperate affair. Of the Boers seventeen were left dead in front of the kraal, and the forty-five had not escaped from the <b>bulldog</b> <b>grip</b> which held them. There seems for some reason to have been no effective pursuit of the Boers, and the British column held on its way to Kroonstad.|$|E
