500|$|Lee {{conceptualized}} {{the video}} around {{the lyrics to}} the song: [...] "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more {{along the lines of}} exposing the real behind-the-scenes [...] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldnâ€™t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} would say that; <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that I have been right to tell you. I am sure you will believe my {{assurance}} that Jack knows nothing of all this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, my friends," [...] cried Mr. Howel, as {{he walked}} away towards Grace and Sir George, [...] "this is a {{different}} thing from what I at first thought it, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you undervalue the periodical." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{not quite}} such a black swan with me as he is with you; <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he will succeed, if he takes care of himself. It is {{astonishing}} how that absurd story of his duel with Chiltern has got about." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a final irony, {{the printer}} gave the entire print {{run of the}} {{magazine}} to the Niggerati, {{in the hope that}} they would sell better in quantity, only for several hundred copies to be lost in a fire in the basement in which they were stored. [...] Hurston later commented [...] "I suppose that 'Fire' has gone to ashes quite, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> the idea is good.".|$|E
2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. We had to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 people, have people saying and doing things others said or did. We had people take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} the album's first single [...] "This Is Music" [...] in May, and it reached No.35, their first single {{to reach the}} Top 40. It was followed by [...] "On Your Own" [...] in June which performed even better, reaching No.28. This single was particularly new for the Verve {{as it was a}} soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single [...] "History", which reached No.24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: [...] "I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because {{it could have been the}} greatest time of our lives, with [...] "History" [...] doing well, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.' The others had been through the same thing. It was a mixture of sadness and regret, and relief that we would have some time away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One could {{consider}} the venture our friend has undertaken a folly, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he will succeed," [...] he said. [...] "One could almost fancy that the Powers above us hold {{the men who}} attempt such follies in their special keeping." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2005, Rice went to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin. On {{the plane}} trip over, she related {{comments}} critical of Russia's democratic progress to reporters. [...] "Trends {{have not been}} positive on the democratic side," [...] said Rice. [...] "There have been some setbacks, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>still</b> <b>think</b> there is {{a considerable amount of}} individual freedom in Russia, which is important." [...] In person Rice told Putin: [...] "We see Russia as a partner in solving regional issues, like the Balkans or the Middle East." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily. Well, I know, of course, how {{important}} it is not to keep a business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives. I know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.|$|R
60|$|Strickland was an odious man, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> {{he was a}} great one.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{believe you}} are right, you kind Robin,' said Honor. 'The journey might be a great danger for Lucy, and if I went, I know she would not stay behind. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> she will insist on seeing him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that may}} be so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> {{that there must be}} some way out from here. Why should men go to the labour of cutting this long stair, and {{excavating}} this chamber here, without any reason whatever? Let us look through the window, Meinik." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have him}} turned out, mamma? God forbid! I'd sooner {{he should be}} here than anywhere, for here he must be out of harm's way; <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that if he comes to a house of mourning, he might, for a short time, submit {{to put up with}} its decent tranquillity." ...|$|R
6000|$|It seem'd so hard at first, mother, {{to leave}} the blessed sun, [...] And now it seems as hard to stay, and yet His will be done! [...] <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it can't be long before I find release; [...] And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of peace. [1] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{said the}} Emperor, 'but {{there are so}} many who ask for a place that I don't know whether there will be one for you; <b>but,</b> <b>still,</b> <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> of you. Stay, it has just {{occurred}} to me that I want someone to look after the swine, for I have so very many of them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> {{it would}} be better were we to heap less ridicule upon the institution. Matrimony cannot be [...] "holy" [...] and ridiculous at the same time. We have been {{familiar}} with it long enough to make up our minds in which light to regard it.|$|E
6000|$|This {{picture of}} her {{consequence}} had some effect, for no one loved better to lead than Maria; and with far more good-humour she answered, [...] "I am much obliged to you, Edmund; you mean very well, I am sure: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> you see things too strongly; and I really cannot undertake to harangue all the rest upon a subject of this kind. There would be the greatest indecorum, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{good deal}} more, lad, if you like. I {{calculate}} these contracts that I have got {{will bring in}} a pound a head so that, {{by the time that}} the war is over, I hope to have cleared 8000 pounds, which will be about what you will make by your rubies; and when trade begins again, we shall {{be in a position to}} do it on a big scale. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that it will not be fair to take that money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{next thing}} I've called 'The Pot'," [...] he said, {{unfolding}} the manuscript. [...] "It has been refused by {{four or five}} magazines now, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is good. In fact, I don't {{know what to think}} of it, except that I've caught something there. Maybe it won't affect you as it does me. It's a short thing--only two thousand words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Harry!" [...] {{cried the}} lad, with {{a ripple of}} laughter. [...] "Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible, and his evenings in doing what is improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go to you, Basil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must ask}} him for it {{yourself}} then; I'll not propose to him any such thing. Upon my soul, he'll be a great fool to give the five hundred, because he's no occasion to meddle {{with you in the}} matther at all, at all. <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he may give it; but as for asking for more--at any rate I won't do it; you can do what you like, yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{that was}} my visit to Sir Thomas Rossiter, the famous beetle-hunter, and that was also my first step upon the ladder of success, for Lady Rossiter and Lord Linchmere {{have proved to be}} staunch friends, and they have never {{forgotten}} my association with them in the time of their need. Sir Thomas is out and said to be cured, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that if I spent another night at Delamere Court, I should be inclined to lock my door upon the inside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well nigh four hours, Master Lionel. Then, even if {{it keeps}} a stark calm like this, we shall {{be able to get}} across the sands and a mile or two up the channel before we meet the tide. There we must anchor again till the first {{strength}} is past, and then if the wind springs up we can work along {{at the edge of the}} sands against it. There is no tide close in to the sands after the first two hours. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> this is going to turn into wind presently; and if it does it will be sharp and heavy, I warrant. It's either that or rain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miranda Pryor {{spent an}} {{afternoon}} {{here a few}} days ago, helping me cut out certain Red Cross garments known by the charming name of 'vermin shirts.' Susan thinks that name is not quite decent, so I suggested she call them 'cootie sarks,' which is old Highland Sandy's version of it. But {{she shook her head}} and I heard her telling mother later that, in her opinion, 'cooties' and 'sarks' were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about. She was especially horrified when Jem wrote in his last letter to mother, 'Tell Susan I had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fifty-three!' Susan positively turned pea-green. 'Mrs. Dr. dear,' she said, 'when I was young, if decent people were so unfortunate as to get--those insects--they kept it a secret if possible. I do not want to be narrow-minded, Mrs. Dr. dear, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it is better not to mention such things.' ...|$|E
5000|$|No, I {{never liked}} that song [...] "Athena". It's a great record. I think what {{happened}} with that song, it was originally called [...] "Teresa" [...] and then Pete was {{talking to me about}} Nick Roeg's girlfriend and how he fancied her, and that song was written about her - but then it changed into 'She's a bomb' and I think I've got a psychological problem with it. I listened to it on the record the other day, and it's a great record; there's so much energy on that thing <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> don't <b>think</b> there's a center to that song. The fact that he changed the title in that and didn't stick to what {{it was supposed to be}} lost its center to me. Roger Daltrey, The News of the World, 2010 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My breast {{has been}} all weakness, is so yet; [...] <b>But</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can collect my mind; [...] My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set, [...] As roll the waves before the settled wind; [...] My heart is feminine, nor can forget-- [...] To all, except one image, madly blind; [...] So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole, [...] As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not in {{the least}} doubt," [...] said the Colonel, [...] "the {{efficacy}} of your qualifications to lay the devil; <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> some odd mistake has occasioned this confusion amongst them, if there has any such in reality existed. Desborough is a blockhead, to be sure; and Harrison is fanatic enough to believe anything. But there is Bletson, on the other hand, who believes nothing.--What do you know of this matter, good Master Mayor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The second {{horse is}} still alive, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> dying. [...] The first was buried this morning. My proofs are done; {{it was a}} rough two days of it, but done. CONSUMMATUM EST; NA UMA. I believe the WRECKER ends well; if I know what a good yarn is, the last four {{chapters}} make a good yarn - but pretty horrible. THE BEACH OF FALESA I still think well of, but it seems it's immoral and there's a to-do, and financially it may prove a heavy disappointment. The plaintive request sent to me, to make the young folks married properly before 'that night,' I refused; you will see what would be left of the yarn, had I consented. This is a poison bad world for the romancer, this Anglo-Saxon world; I usually {{get out of it}} by not having any women in it at all; but when I remember I had the TREASURE OF FRANCHARD refused as unfit for a family magazine, I feel despair weigh upon my wrists.|$|E
6000|$|We had an {{ordinary}} run to Charleston, {{and began to}} prepare for the reception of our cargo. At this time, there were two French privateers on the southern coast, that did a great deal of damage to our trade. One went into Savannah, and got burned, for her pains; and the other came into Charleston, and narrowly escaped the same fate. A mob collected--made a fire-raft, and came alongside of our ship, demanding some tar. To own the truth, though then clothed with all the dignity of a [...] "Dicky," [...] [5] I liked the fun, and offered no resistance. Bill Swett had come in, in a ship called the United States; and he was on board the Sterling, at the time, on a visit to me. We two, off hatches, and whipped a barrel of tar on deck; which we turned over to the raftsmen, with our hearty good wishes for their success. All this was, legally, very wrong; <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think,</b> it was not so very far from being morally just; at least, as regards the privateersmen. The attempt failed, however, and those implicated were blamed a great deal more than they would have been, had they burned up the Frenchmen's eye-bolts. It is bad to fail, in a legal undertaking; but success is indispensable for forgiveness, to one that is illegal.|$|E
60|$|Was {{this the}} same Moreau? He had {{published}} some very astonishing facts {{in connection with}} the transfusion of blood, and in addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career was closed. He had to leave England. A journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house. It was in the silly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation. It {{was not the first time}} that conscience has turned against the methods of research. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be that he deserved to be; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that the tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific workers was a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, nay, my lord," [...] {{said the}} good-humoured citizen, interposing, [...] "I {{have been the}} means of {{bringing}} the fellow's blunder to light-- allow me interest enough with your lordship to be bail for his bones. You have cause to be angry, <b>but</b> <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the knave mistook more out of conceit than of purpose; and I judge you will have the better service of him another time, if you overlook this fault--Get you gone, sirrah--I'll make your peace." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for the Reading Eagle, Kimberly Foster described her character, [...] "Michelle doesn't have a limit on how far she'll go with anything or anybody. She's very smart and devious and conniving. She lies, too, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>still</b> she has some vulnerability. She's always {{trying to find out}} everyone else's business, but she has secrets going on with just about everybody, too. She has some pain in her heart. I think it's because she grew up in the shadow of her sister".|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Madam Rachel, {{though she}} spoke in rather a {{doubtful}} tone. [...] "I rather {{think it would have}} had some influence--not much, but some. He would not have thought of it very often, <b>but</b> <b>still,</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>think,</b> at least I hope, that Dwight has some desire to please God, and that it now and then influences him a little. But in boys generally, I don't think that such a motive would have any influence at all." ...|$|R
