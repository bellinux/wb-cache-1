5|$|The trio {{flies to}} the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is {{preparing}} to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With {{the last of his}} strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his soul to the underworld and must not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal lich form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow. At the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the Potos waterfall.|$|E

The Germans, on the other hand, landed an {{estimated}} 1,000 troops and artillery during that night.

He also argued that Gatineau residents should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a referendum on a proposed cultural centre, called for all mayoral candidates to declare their financial interests, and proposed a new municipal code of ethics. On election day, he lost to Bob Labine by only 174 votes.|$|E
25|$|Three {{major changes}} were seen {{starting}} in the 2009 season. First, starting that season, four clubs entered the AFC Champions League. Secondly, the number of relegation slots increased to three. Finally, the AFC Player slot was implemented starting this season. Each club will <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a total of four}} foreign players; however, one slot is reserved for a player that derives from an AFC country other than Japan. Also, as a requirement of {{being a member of the}} Asian Football Confederation, the J.League Club Licence regulations started in 2012 as one criterion of whether a club was allowed to stay in its division or to be promoted to a higher tier in professional level league. No major changes happened to J.League Division 1 as the number of clubs stayed at 18.|$|E

25|$|When Egyptian rebels {{returned}} to Madina, {{outraged by the}} official letter ordering the punishment of their leaders, Ali as the guarantor of Uthman's promises asked him {{to speak with the}} rebels directly. Uthman denied any knowledge about the letter and Ali and Muhammad Ibn Maslamah attested to this. But at this time the choices offered by the rebels amounted to resignation or abdication by Uthman and selection of another caliph. As turmoil broke out Ali left them. Ali seems to have broken with Uthman in despair over his own inability to break the influence of Marwan on the caliph. Ali intervened only after being informed that the rebels were preventing the delivery of water to the besieged caliph. He tried to mitigate the severity of the siege by his insistence that Uthman should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> water. Ali went to the extent of even sending his own sons to protect Uthman's house when he was in danger of being attacked. The rebels protested against this and committed excesses as a result.|$|E
25|$|Kartir, a very {{powerful}} and influential Persian cleric, served under several Sassanid Kings and actively campaigned {{for the establishment of}} a Pars-centred Zoroastrian orthodoxy across the Sassanid Empire. His power and influence grew so much that he became the only 'commoner' to later <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his own rock inscriptions carved in the royal fashion (at Sar Mashhad, Naqsh-e Rostam, Ka'ba-ye Zartosht and Naqsh-e Rajab). Under Shapur I, Kartir was made the 'absolute authority' over the 'order of priests' at the Sassanid court and throughout the empire's regions too, with the implication that all regional Zoroastrian clergies would now for the first time be subordinated the Persian Zoroastrian clerics of Pars. To some extent Kartir was an iconoclast and took it upon himself to help establish numerous Bahram fires throughout Iran in the place of the 'bagins / ayazans' (monuments and temples containing images and idols of cult-deities) that had proliferated during the Parthian era. In expressing his doctrinal orthodoxy, Kartir also encouraged an obscure Zoroastrian concept known as khvedodah among the common-folk (marriage within the family; between siblings, cousins). At various stages during his long career at court, Kartir also oversaw the periodic persecution of the non-Zoroastrians in Iran, and secured the execution of the prophet Mani during the reign of Bahram I. During the reign of Hormizd I (the predecessor and brother of Bahram I) Kartir was awarded the new Zoroastrian title of mobad – a clerical title that was to be considered higher than that of the eastern-Iranian (Parthian) title of herbad.|$|E

[...] According to Zhenping County officials, authorities had contacted Feng in March 2012 and told her that she needed to obtain documentation, including a new household registration (referred to as hukou), in order to file an application to have the child. Her family denies this, saying that officials did not notify them until several days before the abortion was induced.|$|E

By his own native capacity, alike unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his practice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine, whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness of his application, this extraordinary man must <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1919, Lloyd {{was again}} {{left off the}} cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies {{compared}} Lloyd to a [...] "talented old aunt who must <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz {{or go to the}} Picture Palace". She toured Cardiff in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning £11,000 a year. Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness. Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of writs from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family, resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rules of}} the UFC were {{modified}} so that only the official [...] "cut men" [...] would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> or apply Vaseline to the fighters. The procedures governing {{the transition from the}} fighters walk-in to the cage and while in the cage were also changed. Previously, fighters would walk up next to the cage, see the cut man who would apply Vaseline, be checked by the referee, and then have an opportunity to speak with or hug their coaches or cornermen before entering the cage. To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage. Finally, no cornermen will <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Vaseline in the cage between rounds. In this way, the fighter's contact with Vaseline is fully controlled by the cut men and referee, who work independently of the UFC.|$|E
