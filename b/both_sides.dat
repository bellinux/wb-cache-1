5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures.

Not only did <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E

Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state. Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of this convention.|$|E
