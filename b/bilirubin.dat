5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is produced}} naturally {{by the body}} as a byproduct of converting protoporphyrin into <b>bilirubin.</b> This carbon monoxide also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, <b>bilirubin,</b> and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated <b>bilirubin,</b> γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised <b>bilirubin,</b> alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{non-specific}} {{nature of}} the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires {{a high degree of}} suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, enlarged spleen, fever, low number of platelets in the blood, and higher-than-normal levels of <b>bilirubin</b> in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells. Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing <b>bilirubin</b> and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{sample is}} also {{examined}} for xanthochromia—the yellow appearance of centrifugated fluid. This {{can be determined}} by spectrophotometry (measuring the absorption of particular wavelengths of light) or visual examination. It is unclear which method is superior. Xanthochromia remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache. An interval of at least 12hours between {{the onset of the}} headache and lumbar puncture is required, as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into <b>bilirubin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and <b>bilirubin</b> from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum <b>bilirubin,</b> and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of <b>bilirubin</b> (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the terms}} direct and {{indirect}} <b>bilirubin</b> are used equivalently with conjugated and unconjugated <b>bilirubin,</b> this is not quantitatively correct, because the direct fraction includes both conjugated <b>bilirubin</b> and δ <b>bilirubin</b> (<b>bilirubin</b> covalently bound to albumin, which appears in serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated <b>bilirubin</b> is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease). Furthermore, direct <b>bilirubin</b> tends to overestimate conjugated <b>bilirubin</b> levels due to unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct <b>bilirubin).</b>|$|E
25|$|Indirect <b>bilirubin</b> is fat-soluble {{and direct}} <b>bilirubin</b> is water-soluble.|$|E
25|$|Elevations in <b>bilirubin</b> must be {{expected}} with RMP treatment (RMP blocks <b>bilirubin</b> excretion) and usually resolve after 10 days (liver enzyme production increases to compensate). Isolated elevations in <b>bilirubin</b> {{can be safely}} ignored.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> {{depends on its}} reaction with diazosulfanilic acid to create azobilirubin. However, unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> also reacts slowly with diazosulfanilic acid, so that the measured indirect <b>bilirubin</b> is an underestimate of the true unconjugated concentration.|$|E
25|$|Total <b>bilirubin</b> is now often {{measured}} by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct <b>bilirubin</b> is often {{measured by}} the method of Jendrassik and Grof.|$|E
25|$|Like {{these other}} pigments, {{some of the}} double-bonds in <b>bilirubin</b> isomerize when exposed to light. This {{is used in the}} {{phototherapy}} of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of <b>bilirubin</b> formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed. This allows the excretion of unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> in bile.|$|E
25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated <b>bilirubin</b> leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> in the blood. Because the unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in <b>bilirubin</b> in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine <b>bilirubin</b> and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bilirubin</b> {{is created}} by the {{activity}} of biliverdin reductase on biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. <b>Bilirubin,</b> when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, {{in addition to the}} demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of <b>bilirubin,</b> has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin's main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{the other}} chief complication {{that leads to the}} basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of <b>bilirubin</b> in the blood. <b>Bilirubin</b> is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of <b>bilirubin</b> overwhelms that of albumin and some of the <b>bilirubin</b> remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally <b>bilirubin</b> {{would not be able to}} diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. <b>Bilirubin</b> is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus.|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of <b>bilirubin</b> in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called <b>bilirubin</b> encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and <b>bilirubin</b> can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased <b>bilirubin</b> in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated <b>bilirubin</b> in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated <b>bilirubin</b> is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bilirubin</b> {{should be}} tested from cord blood.|$|E
25|$|Mixed ("Brown Pigment") stones {{typically}} contain 20–80% cholesterol (or 30–70%, {{according to}} the Japanese- classification system). Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, <b>bilirubin</b> and other bile pigments (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of β-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes <b>bilirubin</b> glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> in bile. Between 4% and 20% of stones are mixed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bilirubin</b> – Levels normal when {{compensated}} but may elevate as cirrhosis progresses.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the Van den Bergh {{reaction}} {{was used for}} a qualitative estimate of <b>bilirubin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cholelithiasis (gallstones) and {{cholecystitis}} {{may result}} from excessive <b>bilirubin</b> production and precipitation due to prolonged haemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Cirrhosis {{may cause}} normal, {{moderately}} high or {{high levels of}} <b>bilirubin,</b> depending on exact features of the cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Because free {{radicals}} {{are necessary for}} life, the body {{has a number of}} mechanisms to minimize free-radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase. In addition, antioxidants {{play a key role in}} these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E and polyphenol antioxidants. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that <b>bilirubin</b> and uric acid can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain {{free radicals}}. <b>Bilirubin</b> comes from the breakdown of red blood cells' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of purines. Too much <b>bilirubin,</b> though, can lead to jaundice, which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes gout.|$|E
25|$|Some {{textbooks}} and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of <b>bilirubin.</b> The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer.|$|E
25|$|Gilbert's syndrome, {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} of <b>bilirubin</b> metabolism {{that can result}} in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population.|$|E
25|$|Jaundice is classified, {{depending}} upon whether the <b>bilirubin</b> is free or conjugated to glucuronic acid, into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice..|$|E
25|$|Iron {{is removed}} from heme and {{salvaged}} for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called <b>bilirubin,</b> which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise <b>bilirubin</b> into urobilinogen. Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin. Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bilirubin</b> {{consists}} of an open chain of four pyrrole-like rings (tetrapyrrole). In heme, these four rings are connected into a larger ring, called a porphyrin ring.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides are {{contraindicated}} {{in infants}} less than 2 months old (exception when used with pyrimethamine in treating toxoplasmosis) as they increase unconjugated <b>bilirubin</b> leading to kernicterus.|$|E
