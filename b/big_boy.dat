5|$|Big Boy's {{business}} thrives {{until the}} Blank frames him for Tess' kidnapping. Released by his colleagues on New Year's Eve, Tracy interrogates Mumbles and {{arrives at a}} shootout outside Big Boy's club where his men are killed {{by the police and}} Tracy. Abandoning his crew, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> flees to a drawbridge and ties Tess to the gears before he is confronted by Tracy. Their fight is halted when the Blank appears and holds both men at gunpoint, offering to share the city with Tracy after <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> is dead. <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> takes advantage of a distraction and opens fire before Tracy sends him falling to his death in the bridge gears. Mortally wounded, the Blank is revealed to be Breathless Mahoney, who kisses Tracy before dying. All charges against Tracy are dropped.|$|E
5|$|Burger King and McDonald's {{opened on}} the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1983. This marked a {{transition}} from sit-down to fast-food dining on the turnpike by popular demand. The Marriott Corporation purchased the remaining Howard Johnson's restaurants in 1987, incorporating it into its Host Marriott division and replacing them with restaurants such as Roy Rogers and Bob's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Caglione and Drexler were {{recommended}} for the prosthetic makeup designs by Canonero, {{with whom they}} had worked on The Cotton Club (1984). The rogues gallery makeup designs were directly taken from Gould's drawings, {{with the exception of}} Al Pacino (<b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Caprice), who improvised his own designs, ignoring the rather overweight character of the strip. His makeup took 3.5 hours to apply.|$|E

After a Bad Brains show in Austin that ended in controversy involving Biscuit (and later inspired the songs [...] "Brickwall" [...] by <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> and [...] "Pay to Come Along" [...] by MDC), conflicts began to arise within the band, specifically between Biscuit and Chris. The <b>Big</b> <b>Boys</b> played their last show very unexpectedly. Biscuit and Chris never spoke to each other again.|$|R

25|$|On Parkway Pumpin' {{there were}} no contracts, and artists {{including}} KLC himself often simultaneously worked at other labels. In 1994, KLC played keyboards and 39 Posse produced EXD's No Elevation for In the House Records. Mystikal recorded his debut album with <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Records, where KLC also produced a track for veteran New Orleans rapper Sporty T. In 1995, Magnolia Slim a.k.a.

25|$|In 1965, Coppola won {{the annual}} Samuel Goldwyn Award {{for the best}} {{screenplay}} (Pilma, Pilma) written by a UCLA student. This secured him {{a job as a}} scriptwriter with Seven Arts. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for This Property Is Condemned (1966) and Is Paris Burning? (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the David Benedictus novel You're a <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Now and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in You're a <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> Now (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967.|$|E

25|$|In addition, López {{played in}} the {{professional}} leagues of Cuba, México and Puerto Rico, overcoming color line prejudice throughout a career that lasted 21 years. He was well known for his solid batting, his long home runs and dominant pitching, while his popular nickname, El Muchachote de Barlovento (The <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> of Barlovento), was a testimony to his naive face and burly frame.|$|E
25|$|UP 4018 – A Union Pacific <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> 4-8-8-4 {{articulated}} steam locomotive, originally {{on display}} at Texas State Fair Grounds, Dallas, Texas. Number 4018, currently residing at the Museum of the American Railroad in Frisco, TX, almost saw a return to operation in 1998 when a film director proposed restoring the locomotive {{for use in a}} movie. However, it has been 9 years since anything has been heard of this proposal, and it is considered to have been only a whim.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from playing, López remained active by coaching and instructing youth players in Caracas. Everyman's ballplayer, he worked {{to overcome the}} challenges he faced in life and baseball. Although he had no opportunity to play at Major League Baseball, he simply took {{the best he could}} find and took advantage of it. He permanently adjusted and readjusted his hitting style and pitching mechanics, came back from many injuries, but the <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> of Barlovento (el Muchachote de Barlovento in Spanish) persevered and won recognition as pitcher and slugger in all leagues where he played.|$|E

25|$|Filet-O-Fish – a {{fish fillet}} with tartar sauce {{and a half}} slice of cheese, on a steamed bun. It was {{introduced}} in Cincinnati in 1962 when {{it was discovered that}} many Roman Catholics chose to eat at Frisch's <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> on Fridays and during Lent, as it offered a fish sandwich so they could go without meat. This was replaced with the Fish Filet Deluxe in 1996 and brought back in 1998 albeit a larger fish patty. During the Easter period in Hawaii and Guam, a Double Filet-O-Fish meal is offered with two pieces of fish on one bun.|$|E
25|$|UP 4014 is a 4-8-8-4 Articulated type, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy,</b> freight steam locomotive. On July 23, 2013, it was {{announced}} that the UP was acquiring UP 4014 from The Southern California Chapter of The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in Pomona, with the goal of restoring it to service. 4014 was moved from Pomona to the Union Pacific West Colton yard on January 26, 2014 and then to Cheyenne, Wyoming. Restoration to full operating condition is currently in progress, expected to be finished between 2017 and 2019. Volunteers and paid contractors are assisting the UP steam crew in the rebuild predominantly at the UP Steam Shop in Cheyenne.|$|E
25|$|Before the 1st Academy Awards {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} May 1929, honoring films released between August 1927 and July 1928, The Jazz Singer was ruled ineligible for the two top prizes—the Outstanding Picture, Production and the Unique and Artistic Production—on the basis {{that it would have}} been unfair competition for the silent pictures under consideration. By mid-1929, Hollywood was producing almost exclusively sound films; by the end of the following year, the same was true in much of Western Europe. Jolson went on to make a series of movies for Warners, including The Singing Fool, a part-talkie, and the all-talking features Say It with Songs (1929), Mammy (1930), and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> (1930).|$|E

25|$|Jolson {{continued}} to make features for Warner Bros., very similar in style to The Singing Fool, Say It with Songs (1929), Mammy (1930), and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> (1930). A restored version of Mammy, which includes Jolson in some Technicolor sequences, was first screened in 2002. (Jolson's first Technicolor appearance was in a cameo in the musical Show Girl in Hollywood (1930) from First National Pictures, a Warner Bros. subsidiary.) However, these films gradually proved a cycle of diminishing returns due to their comparative sameness, the regal salary that Jolson demanded, and a general shift in public tastes away from the vaudeville-style musical as the 1930s began. As a result of this, Jolson {{decided to return to}} Broadway, and starred in a new show, Wonder Bar, which was not very successful.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> coerces club owner Lips Manlis into signing {{over the}} deed to Club Ritz. He then kills Lips with a cement {{overcoat}} (referred to onscreen as [...] "The Bath") and steals his girlfriend, the seductive and sultry singer, Breathless Mahoney. After Lips is reported missing, Tracy interrogates his three hired guns Flattop, Itchy, and Mumbles, then {{goes to the}} club to arrest <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> for Lips' murder. Breathless is the only witness. Instead of providing testimony, she unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Tracy. <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> cannot be indicted and he is released from jail. Big Boy's next move {{is to try to}} bring other criminals, including Spud Spaldoni, Pruneface, Influence, Texie Garcia, Ribs Mocca, and Numbers, together under his leadership. Spaldoni refuses and is intentionally killed, leaving Dick Tracy, who discovered the meeting and was attempting to spy on it, wondering what is going on. The next day, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> and his henchmen kidnap Tracy and attempt to bribe him; Tracy refuses, prompting the criminals to attempt to kill him. However, Tracy is saved by Kid, who gets prized by the police with a Honorary Detective Certificate, which will remain temporary until he decides a name for himself.|$|E
500|$|Breathless {{shows up}} at Tracy's apartment, once again {{in an attempt to}} seduce him. Tracy shows he is only human by {{allowing}} her to kiss him. Tess witnesses this and eventually leaves town. Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz, but it is actually a diversion so officer [...] "Bug" [...] Bailey can enter the building to operate a secretly installed listening device so the police can hear in on Big Boy's criminal activities. The resultant raids all but wipe out Big Boy's criminal empire. However, <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> discovers Bug and captures him for a trap planned by Influence and Pruneface to kill Tracy in the warehouse. In the resulting gun battle, a stranger with no face called [...] "The Blank" [...] steps out of the shadows to save Tracy after he is cornered and kills Pruneface. Influence escapes as Tracy rescues Bug from the same fate given to Lips Manlis, and <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> is enraged upon hearing that The Blank foiled the hit. Tracy tries again to get the testimony from Breathless he needs to put <b>Big</b> <b>Boy</b> away. She agrees to testify only if Tracy agrees to give in to her advances. Tess eventually has a change of heart, but before she can tell Tracy, she is kidnapped by The Blank, with the help of Big Boy's club piano player, 88 Keys. Tracy is drugged and rendered unconscious by The Blank, framed for murdering the corrupt District Attorney John Fletcher, and is detained. The Kid, meanwhile, adopts the name [...] "Dick Tracy, Jr." ...|$|E
