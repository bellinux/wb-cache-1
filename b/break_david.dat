40|$|David was {{regarded}} {{by some of}} his former teachers as a lost cause. His behavioral antics, while in high school, led to multiple suspensions from school. As a result, David’s academic achievement suffered due to missed instruction and incomplete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed and forgotten by the establishment, David {{dropped out of school}} at the age of fifteen. At 19, David decided to return to school and reenrolled at his former high school. David did this without the support of his mother or any other family member. For the first two months of school, David was an adept student; receiving above average grades in all of his classes. He was a tremendous help to his peers, whom he tutored, and his teachers. However, prior to the Thanksgiving break, his success ended. On his way home from school, David was jumped by a group of well-respected boys. He reported the assault the following day to the assistant principal who immediately blamed David; attributing it to his prior transgressions. The opinions expressed by the administrator directly led to David’s undoing, and after winter <b>break,</b> <b>David</b> once again dropped out of school. David began hanging out with members of a local gang. Within three months, David was arrested for breaking into a house and killing an innocent man. Presently, he is serving a 60 year sentence...|$|E
