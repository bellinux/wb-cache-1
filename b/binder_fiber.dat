40|$|Abstract Thennobonding {{is widely}} used in {{producing}} of nonwovens. In this study various layers of thennobonded nonwovens were produced by altering the pressure, binder fibers and quality of blending. Mechanical properties of the so-called layers such as breaking strength and breaking elongation, bending rigidity and air penneability were assessed consequently. The stmcture of the layers was then studied by scmming electron microscope (SEM) and {{the interaction between the}} structure and mechanical properties and failure mechanism of the layers was investigated. This study shows that the interstmcture appears in the fonn of point stmcture and agglomerate stmcture when bicomponent PET and PP fibers were used as the binder respectively. The detrimental effect of the interstmcture on the mechanical behavior of layers was spotted during the experiments. The results indicate that the magnitude of the pressure, the type of the <b>binder</b> <b>fiber</b> and stages of blending affect the interstmcture enonnously.

40|$|Acoustical {{insulation}} and absorption properties of nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically lapped fabrics are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic <b>binder</b> <b>fibers.</b> The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure acoustical insulation in this research.

During PIM process fibers in skin region of moldings are aligned as these regions experience higher shear flow caused by the mold walls. Fibers in the core region remain randomly aligned as these regions are far from mold walls and experience lesser shear flow. In this study short carbon fiber (CF) reinforced copper matrix composite was developed by PIM process. Two copper composite feedstock formulations were prepared having 5 vol % and 10 vol % CFs and a wax based <b>binder</b> system. <b>Fiber</b> orientation was controlled during injection molding by using a modified mold that has a diverging sprue.

With the {{implementation}} of mechanistic-empirical pavement design methods, dynamic modulus (|E*|) has become the predominant characteristic of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) used as the elastic modulus in the computation of stresses and strains in pavement structures. The predictions of |E*| obtained with the Witczak models currently used in the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) do not account for some HMA characteristics such as polymer modified <b>binders,</b> <b>fibers,</b> confinement and aging effects related to climatic conditions. Therefore, development of models more representative of local materials and conditions are desirable. In this study, a predictive model for dynamic modulus of HMA was developed taking into consideration several HMA characteristics and testing conditions. 6821 observations of 257 mix specimens from three different laboratory datasets, two from Hawaii and one from Costa Rica, were used to estimate the model parameters. All three data sets contain information about some variables in common such as air voids, binder content, and gradation; however, some datasets contain mix characteristics and testing conditions not available in other datasets such as confinement level, available only in the Hawaiian datasets, {{and the number of}} freeze-thaw cycles, available only in the Costa Rican dataset. Important characteristics observed from these datasets include confinement, number of freeze-thaw cycles, binder modifiers (SBS polymers) and mixture additives (e. g. fibers and anti-stripping agents), all of which together with other commonly used variables were found to have statistically significant effects. The model was developed by using joint estimation and mixed-effects techniques. Joint estimation allowed the identification of model parameters available from only some of the databases and the determination of bias parameters. It also resulted in more efficient parameter estimates. The mixed-effects approach was used to account for unobserved heterogeneities between samples. Using these approaches, together with proper consideration of heteroscedasticity, allowed the estimation of a comprehensive statistical predictive model that satisfies closely all the regression assumptions and that provides accurate values of |E*| for Hawaiian and Costa Rican conditions for any combination of temperature and frequency. These can be used to generate the |E*| inputs that the MEPDG needs to compute |E*| master curves...|$|R
40|$|Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) is a gap graded mix, {{characterized}} by high coarse aggregates, high asphalt contents and polymer or fiber additives as stabilizers. High concentration of coarse aggregate maximizes stone-to-contact and interlocking {{in the mix}} which provides strength, and the rich mortar binder provides durability.

In comparison to dense graded mixtures SMA has higher proportion of coarse aggregate, lower proportion of middle size aggregate and higher proportion of mineral filler. It resists permanent deformation and {{has the potential for}} long term performance and durability. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the engineering properties of mixtures of stone matrix asphalt made with three types of binders namely conventional bitumen 80 / 100 and 60 / 70 and modified binder CRMB 60, with a non-conventional natural fiber, namely coconut <b>fiber.</b> The <b>binders</b> and <b>fibers</b> in different proportions are used for preparation of mixes with a selected aggregate grading.

Thereafter, the draindown characteristics, both static and repeated indirect tensile strength parameters and moisture susceptibility characteristics in terms of tensile strength ratio and retained stability of different SMA mixtures values have been studied for such mixes. It is observed that only 0. 3 % addition of coconut fiber significantly improves the Marshall properties of SMA mixes.

Jinghua and Huxin [10] said that materials used in C 3 DP mainly come from construction waste. Thus, the cost of construction material should be lower than traditional construction. Liping et al.

The properties and uses of geopolymers are being explored in many scientific and industrial disciplines: modern inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, colloid chemistry, mineralogy, geology, {{and in other}} types of engineering process technologies. Geopolymers are part of polymer science, chemistry and technology that forms {{one of the major}} areas of materials science. Polymers are either organic material, i.e. carbon-based, or inorganic polymer, for example silicon-based. The organic polymers comprise the classes of natural polymers (rubber, cellulose), synthetic organic polymers (textile fibers, plastics, films, elastomers, etc.) and natural biopolymers (biology, medicine, pharmacy). Raw materials used in the synthesis of silicon-based polymers are mainly rock-forming minerals of geological origin, hence the name: geopolymer. Joseph Davidovits coined the term in 1978 and created the non profit French scientific institution (Association Loi 1901) Institut Géopolymère (Geopolymer Institute). According to T.F. Yen geopolymers can be classified into two major groups: pure inorganic geopolymers and organic containing geopolymers, synthetic analogues of naturally occurring macromolecules. In the following presentation, a geopolymer is essentially a mineral chemical compound or mixture of compounds consisting of repeating units, for example silico-oxide (-Si-O-Si-O-), silico-aluminate (-Si-O-Al-O-), ferro-silico-aluminate (-Fe-O-Si-O-Al-O-) or alumino-phosphate (-Al-O-P-O-), created through a process of geopolymerization. This mineral synthesis (geosynthesis) was first presented at an IUPAC symposium in 1976.|$|R
