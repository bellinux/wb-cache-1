2500|$|In January 2009, Josh Farro {{spoke about}} the band's next studio album. Talking to Kerrang!, Farro said: [...] "We're gonna try to [...] it in Nashville. I think writing the album there will inspire us, and then if we record there too it'll <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> since we can sleep in our beds at night rather than in hotels like the other 300 days out of the year! We're not sure who's going to produce the record yet. We did [...] "Decode" [...] with [...] Rob Cavallo, which was a good experience, but we're looking around and don't want to make any {{decisions}} {{until we have a}} lot of songs and we know what we're looking for. We really enjoy our live sound and we want a producer who can really capture that." [...] Paramore wrote and completed their third album Brand New Eyes in early 2009. The first single from the album was [...] "Ignorance" [...] and was released July 7, 2009. Paramore was the special guest with Bedouin Soundclash, The Sounds and Janelle Monáe at the No Doubt Summer Tour 2009, starting in May 2009 in outdoor amphitheaters and arenas across the US and Canada. The official music video for [...] "Ignorance" [...] aired on all MTV platforms, networks, and websites on August 13, 2009. Paramore, along with Paper Route and The Swellers, toured in support of Brand New Eyes in the fall of 2009. Some tour dates were postponed due to Hayley Williams becoming infected with laryngitis. [...] "Brick By Boring Brick", [...] "The Only Exception", [...] "Careful" [...] and [...] "Playing God" [...] were the album's following singles. To promote the album, the band recorded a performance for MTV Unplugged.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} over usual betting arbitrage {{is that it}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to find bets with an acceptable loss, instead of an actual profit. Since most bookmakers offer these bonuses this can potentially be exploited to harvest the sign up bonuses.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave him}} the eye. The evening had begun to draw in a bit by now and the visibility, in consequence, was not so hot, but there still {{remained}} ample light to enable me to see him clearly. And what I saw convinced me that I should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> in my mind with a stout rustic bench between us. I rose, accordingly, modelling my style on that of a rocketing pheasant, and proceeded to deposit myself {{on the other side}} of the object named.|$|E
6000|$|... "Finally Mr. Rabbit {{had made}} the round of all his friends and neighbors, and he once more reached his tumble-down house. 'Oh, dear,' sighed Mr. Rabbit, {{as he looked at}} the tangle of brambles which almost hid the little old house, 'I never, never can clear away all this! It will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to work when all my friends are here to help,' So he sighed once more and folded his arms, instead of {{beginning}} work as he should have done. And then, because the sun was bright and warm, and he was very, very comfortable, old Mr. Rabbit began to nod, and presently he was fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] replied Honker, [...] "Old Mother Nature {{has given}} him very short legs and has placed them so far back on his body that he can't keep his balance to walk, and has to use his wings and bill to help him over the ground. On shore he is about the most {{helpless}} thing you can imagine. But on water he is another fellow altogether. He's just as much at home under water as on top. My, how that fellow can dive! When he sees the flash of a gun he will get under water before the shot can reach him. That's where he {{has the advantage of}} us Geese. You know we can't dive. He could swim clear across this river under water if he wanted to, and he can go so fast under water that he can catch a fish. It is because his legs have been placed so far back that he can swim so fast. You know his feet are nothing but big paddles. Another funny thing is that he can sink right down in the water when he wants to, with nothing but his head out. I envy him that. It would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> for us Geese to escape the dreadful hunters if we could sink down that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Bleeckere {{looked to}} his {{assistant}} {{for help in}} the decision, but no confirmation could be made. TV replays reached no verdict either {{as to whether it}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> goal. Ayala <b>was</b> furious at referee Bleeckere for failing to award the goal and Argentine striker, Hernán Crespo later said, [...] "It would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> if that had counted." ...|$|R
50|$|From Bulawayo there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{very strong}} head wind which slowed the riders significantly, {{especially}} {{in view of}} the fact that they were carrying all their provisions with them in GO-HOME bags.

5000|$|Richter {{lived in}} Paris and {{spent more time}} abroad than in Germany. He was open about his {{opposition}} to the rise of Hitler and his National Socialism. Sepp Dinkelkamp, a Swiss sprinter, said:"I say with confidence that Albert <b>was</b> <b>an</b> anti-Nazi. If he had followed the Nazis, it would certainly have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> for him, and to his advantage. But Albert chose another way." ...|$|R

5000|$|The candy itself <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hard/chewy candy {{depending}} on its temperature. While chilled, or merely not warmed, the candy <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hard, brittle consistency {{that will give}} off more of the [...] "fizzing" [...] that the candy can cause while being eaten. While warm though the candy is much like the American candy Air Heads; it loses some of the fizz while soft but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to eat which can be more enjoyable.|$|R
50|$|CSV datafeeds {{are mostly}} being used within the {{affiliate}} marketing. Affiliate or so called publisher websites load the CSV file to load product information from online webshops. This way it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to load thousands of product to the website. CSV {{is not like}} XML and is not as semantic {{but it does have}} a good basic structure. This file format can easily be created and loaded with any spreadsheet program like Excel.|$|R
50|$|The SIM-5 also {{features}} the quick barrel removal. As it only requires only one pin {{to be pulled}} out before the whole barrel can be removed, thoroughly cleaning the barrel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> on the field. Though {{the downside is that}} this special design is that the barrel cannot have a thread, and makes it harder to get an aftermarket barrel upgrades. Unlike most markers though, Ariakon has incorporated a high-quality barrel as a standard, so barrel upgrades will not be necessary.|$|R

50|$|Once we {{have the}} answer to these three questions, then {{creating}} and consuming the WCF service will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> for us. The WCF service has the concept of endpoints. A WCF service provides endpoints which client applications can use {{to communicate with the}} WCF service.

5000|$|However, social {{mobility}} in the U.S. {{is lower than}} in some European Union countries if defined regarding income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile {{are much more likely}} to stay there compared to similar people in the Nordic countries or the United Kingdom. Many economists, such as Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reflection of income disparity: [...] "Moving up and down <b>a</b> short ladder <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> than moving up and down a tall one." ...|$|R
5000|$|McDaniel would {{generally}} {{begin with}} a row of six beer cans located {{at a distance of}} 21 feet (6.5m) from the student and spaced about one foot (30 cm) apart apiece. When the student could hit these targets regularly by hip-shooting the BB gun, which generally took very little time to master, since this type of shooting involved the same basic principles as the aerial shooting, but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier,</b> McDaniel would then line up empty shotgun shells as targets, then empty [...]38 Special cartridge cases, then empty [...]22-short cartridge cases and finally BB's.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Asgardia {{hopes to}} have a colony in orbit. This will be expensive: the International Space Station cost $100bn to build, and flights to it cost over $40m per launch. Asgardia has been {{compared}} to the troubled Mars One project, which aims to establish a permanent colony on Mars. Asgardia’s organisers point out that setting up a small nation in orbit will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> than colonising distant Mars.

5000|$|The Bo-Weevils <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} blending psychedelic music, pop music, garage rock and rock music which formed in early 1985. Their early garage incarnation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to classify and won fans easily, but the band evolved {{away from these}} roots from the late 1980s into more cerebral and accomplished directions. They released four studio albums, Where Particular People Congregate (1988), Destroyer of Worlds (1990), Reap (1992), and Burn (1994) before they disbanded in 1999. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane described the group as [...] "one of the first Australian bands of the 1980s to play wild, 1960s-inspired garage-punk".|$|R
50|$|Calculating {{the true}} social {{marginal}} cost can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> than measuring the social marginal benefit. Because {{of the uncertainty}} involved with calculating benefits, problems may arise e.g., should a dollar amount be put on time based on average wages, contingent valuations or revealed preferences? One of the big problems today is putting a value on a life. While some might say that a life is priceless, economists usually state the value to be somewhere between three and ten million dollars. Another problem is that because the current generation will often be paying {{for most of the}} costs while future generations will be reaping most of the benefit, whether current and future benefits ought to be weighed differently.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the film, Lee resists the white matron of the prison's lesbian advances, even though she knows that her life in prison will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> if she engages with her. Karen, on the other hand, readily submits to the matron's advances so that she does not have to work in the field, placing a greater burden on the other prisoners. This greatly irks Lee, as she sees it as a selfish move. Though both women play strong roles, Lee is unique in that she never lets a single character walk over her. The film may also be symbolic in that Lee is mentioned first in the title and the credits. The ending also implies that her strength exceeded Karen's.|$|E
5000|$|The {{culture that}} has been {{connected}} with the wave of extinctions in North America is the paleo-Indian culture associated with the Clovis people (q.v.), who were thought to use spear throwers to kill large animals. The chief criticism of the [...] "prehistoric overkill hypothesis" [...] {{has been that the}} human population at the time was too small and/or not sufficiently widespread geographically to have been capable of such ecologically significant impacts. This criticism does not mean that climate change scenarios explaining the extinction are automatically to be preferred by default, however, any more than weaknesses in climate change arguments can be taken as supporting overkill. Some form of a combination of both factors could be plausible, and overkill would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> to achieve large-scale extinction with an already dying population due to climate change.|$|E
