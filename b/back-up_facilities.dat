40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{safety of}} {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCI) performed in centers without surgical back-up is controversial, but data from several western countries indicates {{that this approach}} can be extended to {{a larger number of}} hospitals. We assessed the safety and efficacy of performing angiography and PCI with a mobile C-arm angiograph in a center without on-site surgical back-up, and compared our data with that reported in the literature. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1485 coronary angiograms and 172 PCI procedures performed in our center from January 2001 to May 2003 using a mobile angiograph. Half of the patients that have undergone PCI had refractory unstable angina and one-third had acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The safety of PCI was assessed by the analysis of in-hospital complications (death, urgent need for repeated revascularization, AMI with or without ST elevation and stroke). The PCI procedures were considered effective when the post-PCI residual stenosis did not exceed 50 &#x 0025; with distal Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow. RESULTS: In patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography there were no deaths, anaphylatic shock, acute renal failure or major ischemic complications.

40|$|Introduction: The Dutch Major Incident Hospital (MIH) is a standby, highly prepared, 200 -bed {{hospital}} strictly reserved {{to provide}} immediate, large-scale, and emergency care {{for victims of}} disasters and major incidents. It has long-standing experience training for various major incident scenarios, including functioning as a <b>back-up</b> <b>facility</b> for the Netherlands. In 1995, the MIH had experience with overtaking an evacuated hospital when that hospital was threatened by flooding. In November 2014, an exercise was performed to transfer an evacuating hospital to the MIH. The scenario again became reality when a neighbouring hospital had to evacuate in September 2015. This article evaluates the events and compares the exercise to the real events {{in order to further}} optimise future training. Methods: All three events were analysed using the Protocol for Reports from Major Accidents and Disasters, a standardised protocol to evaluate medical responses to a major incident. Results: During the 2014 exercise, 72 patients were received, compared with 143 and 70, respectively, in the real events in 1995 and 2015. Personnel from the evacuating hospitals accompanied the patients and continued working in the MIH. The patient surge differed on all three occasions. The information technology (IT) systems proved to be more prone to fail during the real event, and legal implications to have staff from another hospital work in the MIH had to be put in protocol during the deployment. The acute phase was comparable in all three events, and performance was good. However, the exercise did not last long enough to analyse the implications on multiday care, as experienced during a multiday deployment. Conclusion: Large-scale major incident exercises are a great benchmark for the medical response in the acute phase of relief. The MIH was shown to be highly prepared to admit an entire evacuating hospital or large groups of patients in such a scenario. Experiences from the past, combined with regular training that closely resembles reality, guarantee the level of preparedness. Key differences between a true deployment and an exercise are the inability to train multiple days, and in our experience, a successful operation of IT systems in test environments does not guarantee their successful use during live events...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of the refurbishment of Waroona Dam by the Water Corporation of Western Australia, a management plan to mitigate {{the negative effects of}} draining on the biodiversity and recreational fishing values within Lake Navarino (the reservoir created by Waroona Dam) was instigated. The plan, {{the first of its kind}} in Australia, was devised and implemented by collaboration between the Water Corporation, the Department of Fisheries, Murdoch University, Alcoa and volunteers to meet the following objectives; 1. De-stock Lake Navarino of large numbers of target species of aquatic fauna prior to draining (marron - Cherax tenuimanus, gilgie - Cherax quinquecarinatus, western minnow - Galaxias occidentalis, western pygmy perch - Edelia vittata, rainbow trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout - Salmo trutta); 2. Establish breeding populations of marron, gilgies and endemic fishes in secure, purpose built facilities at the Pemberton Freshwater Research Centre (PFRC – Department of Fisheries) and Alcoa’s Willowdale marron farm (AWF) to produce animals for re-stocking into Lake Navarino following the completion of the refurbishment works; 3. Transport aquatic animals surplus to breeding requirements and trout to adjacent waters to boost recreational fishing opportunities; 4. Control feral species, principally redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis), within the residual coffer dams during refurbishment of Waroona Dam; 5. Install appropriate artificial habitats within the basin of Lake Navarino; and 6. Re-stock Lake Navarino with the ex-broodstock and progeny of marron, gilgies and native fishes, and eventually rainbow trout. The de-stocking of Lake Navarino was successful in providing adequate numbers of three species to establish breeding populations. As considerable numbers of targeted aquatic animals were removed prior to drainage, the scale of post-drain faunal mortality was reduced. The success of the de-stocking program was the direct result of the valuable participation of volunteers that facilitated a large amount of de-stocking effort in a short period of time. The high level of volunteer involvement highlights the community’s interest and support for such integrated natural resource projects. Overall, the captive breeding programs performed better than expected. At the PFRC, high berry-up (i. e. spawning) rates of marron, high production of juveniles, and high survival rates of juveniles and adults were reported. This is the first demonstrated re-use of marron broodstock, likely a result of proven, intensive husbandry practices. Further, the project involved utilising very large nursery ponds for the mass production of juveniles to an advanced stage. The use of existing ponds at AWF was largely aimed at providing a secure, cost-effective <b>back-up</b> <b>facility</b> at which considerable numbers of all target species could be maintained throughout the project as part of risk minimisation. That is, should an unforeseen catastrophic loss of stock have occurred (e. g. outbreak of disease) at the purpose-built PFRC ponds, considerable numbers of Lake Navarino brood-stock and juveniles would still be available to re-stock the reservoir from an alternate facility. The control of feral aquatic animals involved netting, draining and concussive (blasting) methods. The control techniques reduced the number of redfin perch by over 99...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe onshore {{tank farm}} {{operations}} {{has become more}} useful and handy, {{as a result of}} increased international sea-borne trade, particularly, the unprecedented higher volume of petroleum products and hazardous chemicals traffic globally. The onshore tank farm is a facility used for safe discharge, loading and storage of petroleum products and other hazardous chemicals at the ports. It has become an important element in the supply chain system because of the increased universal energy demand and the fact that large number of modern tanker vessel is busy and efficiently moving cargo to different destinations around the world. The tank farm serves as a <b>back-up</b> <b>facility</b> to the ports. However, it has high degree of system-wide challenges of potential major incidents/accidents, as evidenced in various tank farm recorded accidents, which occurred at different times with estimated losses valued in millions of US dollars. The accidents could be catastrophic, leading to deaths, extensive damages and adverse impact on environment. To eliminate or minimize the risk of major incident/accidents, as well as minimize the magnitude and severity, it is acutely urgent to uncover and assess all potential hazards, with a view to adopt the best preventive/mitigative policy direction in the management of this strategic facility. This thesis presents multiple safety/risk assessment approaches, uncertainties treatments and decision making techniques that are capable of finding optimal solutions that will ensure safety of tank farm operations. The standard tools of analysis employed in this tank farm operational risk assessment are Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Faulty Tree Analysis (FTA), fuzzy logic, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Firstly, the FMEA-Fuzzy Rule Based (FRB) is applied in Hazard Identification (HAZID) and risk evaluation of tank farm operations. The methodology is utilized to discover five possible causes of catastrophic accidents in tank farm operations. The causes/hazards are described as the automatic shut-down oil safety valve failure, pipe corrosion protection system failure, automatic tank gauge system failure, leak detection device system failure, and secondary containment monitoring system failure. In the risk assessment conducted, the leak detection system failure was identified as the riskiest hazard using the Expected Utility Theory. Consequent upon the need for further investigation, another technique, Fuzzy Fault Tree (FFT), as novel model is used successfully to investigate and understand the causes of the leak detection system failure. The main aim of these two exercises is to assess risks and facilitate proper manage of these risks in tank farm operations, in order to forestall accidents that could cause damage to the facility, workers and the port environment. Nevertheless, the tank farm operations need to be optimized by ensuring the efficiency and safety of all systems and sub-systems through the adoption of best safety management decisions, which is achieved by employing AHP-TOPSIS model. This method is used to solve a complex multi-criteria decision-making problem such as selection of best Safety Control Design (SCD) among various SCDs identified. Finally, the results produced from the developed models and frameworks are summarized and other areas where they can effectively make impacts in HAZID, risk assessment and safety improvement are defined...|$|R

Meanwhile the IT department places a strong emphasis on network security as the data archived are available from outside the JRC via web services and from inside via file protocols. The CID team wishes to favour the use of open source software, to maximise the use of existing knowledge, and to choose a design allowing for the setup of scalable and modular systems (service-wise and performance-wise). In order to address the storage and network security related requirements, we decided to opt for a NAS serving NFSv 4 and CIFS protocols and to rely on the existing IT infrastructure for backups (dedicated NAS connected to a tape library). Minimal downtime and service reliability are ensured by having made almost all services highly available. This implies having an appropriate hardware infrastructure and setting-up all services in failover with possibly load balancing capacity. The flexibility required for authentication and authorization is met by keeping strictly separated the user directory, the authentication and authorization process and by having a Single Sign On to all web based services. With respect to data services, the approach taken has been to use open protocols (e. g. ftp, OGC) or standard ones such as ecwp and kml {{and to make sure that}} their implementation within the CID environment could allow for the enforcement of the Intellectual Property Rights applicable to the datasets being served. After having gathered the requirements, analysed them and decided on the general approach to take, the actual implementation of the CID portal could start. The hardware infrastructure currently consists of 22 servers out of which 14 are virtual ones running on two XenEnterprise servers. Apart from the two virtualization engines and three Windows servers, all machines are running Debian 4. The storage is provided by a NetApp FAS 6030 purchased for this purpose. Due to the costs of this type of device it has been decided not to make it redundant for the time being. As a consequence this is the only critical component of the CID portal. The base infrastructure relies on MySQL and PostgreSQL with PostGIS as database engines, on CAS, Kerberos, Samba and SASL for the authentication and on OpenLDAP as user directory. [ [...] . ]JRC.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{organization}} should {{design their}} supply chains (SCs) and use risk mitigation strategies to meet different performance objectives. To do this, we develop two mixed integer nonlinear (MINL) lean and responsive models for a four-tier SC {{to understand these}} four strategies: i) holding back-up emergency stocks at the DCs, ii) holding back-up emergency stock for transshipment to all DCs at a strategic DC (for risk pooling in the SC), iii) reserving excess capacity in the facilities, and iv) using other facilities in the SC’s network to <b>back-up</b> the primary <b>facilities.</b> A new method for designing the network is developed which works based on the definition of path to cover all possible disturbances. To solve the two proposed MINL models, a linear regression approximation is suggested to linearize the models; this technique works based on a piecewise linear transformation. The efficiency of the solution technique is tested for two prevalent distribution functions. We then explore how these models operate using empirical data from an automotive SC. This enables us to develop a more comprehensive risk mitigation framework than previous studies and show {{how it can be}} used to determine the optimal SC design and risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainties faced by practitioners and the performance objectives they wish to meet...|$|R
