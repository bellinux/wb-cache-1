Measuring mtDNAcn in DNA extracted from whole blood (WB) instead of from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} or buffy coat may yield different results due to mitochondrial DNA present in platelets. The aim of this work is to quantify the contribution of platelets to mtDNAcn in whole blood [mtDNAcn(WB) ] and to propose a correction formula to estimate leukocytes' mtDNAcn [mtDNAcn(L) ] from mtDNAcn(WB). Blood samples from 10 healthy adults were combined with platelet-enriched plasma and saline solution to produce artificial <b>blood</b> <b>preparations.</b> Aliquots of each sample were combined with five different platelet concentrations. In 46 of these <b>blood</b> <b>preparations,</b> mtDNAcn was measured by qPCR. MtDNAcn(WB) increased 1. 07 (95 %CI 0. 86, 1. 29; p< 0. 001) per 1000 platelets present in the preparation. We proved that leukocyte count should also be taken into account as mtDNAcn(WB) was inversely associated with leukocyte count; it increased 1. 10 (95 %CI 0. 95, 1. 25, p< 0. 001) per unit increase of the ratio between platelet and leukocyte counts. If hematological measurements are available, subtracting 1. 10 the platelets/leukocyte ratio from mtDNAcn(WB) may serve as an estimation for mtDNAcn(L). Both platelet and leukocyte counts in the sample are important sources of variation if comparing mtDNAcn among groups of patients when mtDNAcn is measured in DNA extracted from whole blood.

The design of the devices was based on 2 -D fluidic simulation of a T-shaped model. This novel approach was proved to be effective in predicting device performance. The critical particle size for separation was clearly defined in the bifurcated region by simulation under the established theoretical framework. We validated the operation principle of the devices by separating 5 - and 10 -μm polystyrene beads. Human leukocytes were also successfully separated from erythrocytes with 97 % efficiency. The separation region of the device had a small footprint for the separation of particles in micrometer range, which makes this device a good candidate to be integrated into a lab-on-a-chip system. The particles were collected in different exit channels after they were separated, which facilitated further sensing and processing. Similar to cross-flow filters, particles were separated perpendicular to the flow direction. The filtering effect was achieved with the collection zones established by the fluidic field. Clogging was minimized by designing the minimal channel width of the devices larger than the largest particle diameter. Solvent exchange could be accomplished for particles...|$|E
