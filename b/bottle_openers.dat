500|$|Lithograph {{copies of}} September Morn were mass-produced for popular sale, {{extending}} {{the success that}} followed the scandal, and were widely hung in private homes. Reproductions were featured {{on a variety of}} products, including cigar bands, postcards, <b>bottle</b> <b>openers,</b> statuettes, watch fobs, and candy boxes; the model was also popular as a tattoo. September Morn was the first nude used for calendars, and by the late 1950s it had featured on millions. A couplet referring to Chabas's work, [...] "Please don't think I'm bad or bold, but where its deep it's awful cold", was widely circulated.|$|E
500|$|The {{ball was}} {{designed}} to cater for [...] "very, very high-class people" [...] according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. In the 1960 event, prizes given included a Ford Thunderbird car, a Chinchilla coat, a Renault Dauphine, a TV Hi-Fi system, an electric typewriter, 25 cases of expensive French wines, original paintings and porcelains, jewels, clocks, evening bags and a pedigree poodle; guests were given gift boxes containing gold key rings and jewelry, champagne and brandy, Maxim ashtrays, pipes, silver <b>bottle</b> <b>openers,</b> hats and scarves, and flowers. Every guest {{was said to have}} gone home with at least one gift in return. In the 1979 event, some US$106,000 worth of prizes were given out. Over its history, the ball, which was exempt from tax, earned millions of dollars, which went primarily to over 20 American charities such as the American Cancer Society, with 15 to 20% going towards French charities. A staff of three people were paid full-time throughout the year to organize it. Of the expenses of the ball, founder Philippe stated [...] "We charge the most, give the most, and make the most – it's a success formula". Bernard F. Gimbel served as chief treasurer.|$|E
2500|$|Multitool knives {{often have}} more than one blade, {{including}} an assortment of knife blade edges (serrated, plain, saws) as well as a myriad of other tools such as <b>bottle</b> <b>openers,</b> corkscrews, and scissors. A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by Victorinox and Wenger and issued to military services and sold to the public. [...] Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the German Army knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners. [...] The U.S. Military utility knife (MIL-K-818), issued by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the Camillus Cutlery Company and Imperial Schrade as well as many other companies. [...] It was originally produced with carbon steel blades and brass liners (both vulnerable to corrosion), but with the onset of the Vietnam War was modified to incorporate all-stainless steel construction. [...] The current-issue U.S. military utility knife has textured stainless grips and four stainless blades/tools opening on both sides in the camper or scout pattern and has an extremely large clevis or bail.|$|E
50|$|Under most use, a <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> {{functions}} as a second-class lever: the fulcrum is {{the far end of}} the <b>bottle</b> <b>opener,</b> placed on the top of the crown, with the output at the near end of the <b>bottle</b> <b>opener,</b> on the crown edge, between the fulcrum and the hand: in these cases, one pushes up on the lever.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{distinct}} designs of such <b>bottle</b> <b>openers.</b> Wall mounted openers are typically found behind bars in pubs, whilst hand-tool <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> {{tend to be}} found and used in domestic environments. Whereas the functional elements of <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> (a tooth or lip to catch {{the underside of the}} cap, a fulcrum across which to exert the force that will remove the cap, and usually a lever for mechanical advantage) tend to be consistent (sometimes the lever is the bottle itself), their aesthetic design is subject to very great variety, and a great many decorative types are available.|$|E

50|$|It {{is played}} as a rhythm {{instrument}} by stroking either <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> or spoons down it. Many of these instruments are home-made, but Don Landry of Louisiana is a renowned maker of frottoirs - or rub-boards {{as they are}} also known - making them for Clifton Chenier's band and Elvis Fontenot and the Sugar Bees, amongst others.|$|E
50|$|Chenier is {{credited}} with redesigning the wood and crimped tin washboard into the vest frottoir, an instrument that would easily hang from the shoulders. Cleveland Chenier, Clifton's older brother, also played in the Red Hot Louisiana Band. He found popularity {{for his ability to}} manipulate the distinctive sound of the frottoir by rubbing several <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> (held in each hand) along its ridges.|$|E

50|$|Today's bayonets {{are often}} {{multi-purpose}} knives {{such as the}} American M9 which is also an effective fighting knife or the Soviet AKM bayonet which was also a ground breaking survival knife {{that can be used}} as a wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. Some bayonets can also be used as utility knives, <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> or throwing knives. Also, issuing one modern multi-purpose bayonet/knife is obviously more cost effective than issuing separate specialty bayonets, field knives and combat knives.|$|E
5000|$|Wine <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> are {{required}} to open wine bottles that are stoppered with a cork. They are slowly being supplanted by the screwcap closure. There are many different inceptions of the wine bottle opener ranging from the simple corkscrew, the screwpull lever, to complicated carbon dioxide driven openers. The most popular is the wine key, sommelier knife or [...] "waiter's friend" [...] which resembles a pocket knife and has a small blade for cutting foil and a screw with a bottle brace.|$|E
50|$|While most lever-type <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> {{can be used}} {{in either}} configuration, the {{designed}} use can be determined if one of the edges is curved, in which case this edge is designed to sit {{in the middle of the}} crown, as the curve concentrates pressure, deforming the crown, and a curved edge does not connect with as much of the crown edge, hence being suboptimal and slipping more frequently if used to connect with the crown edge. This difference can be seen in comparing the traditional opener and contemporary bar blade at right.|$|E
