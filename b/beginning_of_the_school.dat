25|$|In USA {{domestic}} politics, Schneerson supported {{government involvement}} {{in education and}} welcomed {{the establishment of the}} United States Department of Education in 1980, yet insisted that part of a school's educational mission was to incorporate the values espoused in the Seven Laws of Noah.

25|$|At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year 1918–19, Slovakia had 3,642 {{elementary}} schools. Only 141 schools {{taught in}} the Slovak language, 186 in Slovak and Hungarian and 3,298 in Hungarian. This large deformation was {{a direct result of}} previous magyarization activities of the Hungarian government. After system reform, Czechoslovakia provided an educational network for the Hungarian minority which was several times larger than the Kingdom of Hungary had for the whole Slovak nation before 1918. Due to the lack of qualified personnel among Slovaks – a lack of schools above elementary level, banned grammar schools and no Slovak teacher institutes – Hungarian teachers were replaced in large numbers by Czechs. Some Hungarian teachers resolved their existential question by moving to Hungary. According to government regulation from 28 August 1919, Hungarian teachers were permitted to teach only if they took an oath of allegiance to Czechoslovakia.|$|E

25|$|Molly Weasley (née Prewett) {{is married}} to Arthur Weasley and mother of seven children, {{including}} Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry Potter's best friend. Molly is born into the pure-blood Prewett family, being the sister of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. The character is first introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she kindly tells Harry how to cross the barrier through to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is furious with Fred, George, and Ron after she discovers that they flew their parents' enchanted car to rescue Harry from his aunt and uncle who had imprisoned him in his room. At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year, Molly sends Ron a Howler, screaming at him in anger that he and Harry flew the family car again, this time to Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Weasleys win the Daily Prophet draw and use the gold {{on a trip to}} Egypt to visit Bill. They return to Britain and stay at the Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Hermione. Harry overhears Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing one night about telling Harry the truth about the supposed connection between Sirius Black and Harry; Arthur feels Harry should know the truth but Molly, feeling the truth would terrify him, assures him Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts with Dumbledore's protection, and orders Percy Weasley {{to keep an eye on}} Harry at the school.|$|E
500|$|The {{progressive}} {{legacy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern curriculum, which retains many traditions and educational activities {{dating back to the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school.</b> Students work a minimum of one year above their current grade level, and explore broad themes allowing them to learn across subjects and engage in creative and collaborative projects, using instructional technology extensively. Opportunities to build on classroom studies are offered through a range of extracurricular activities. Admission is competitive and an IQ score of at least 124 is required. ACS is notable for its record of success in academic competitions at the state and national levels in mathematics, science, geography, and other subjects. ACS was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School by the United States Department of Education in 1988. Avery Coonley attracted national media attention in 1994 when the school was banned from competition in the Illinois State Science Fair after winning for the fourth year in a row. Although the decision was later reversed, the controversy was decried by the press {{as an example of the}} [...] "dumbing down" [...] of education and the victory of self-esteem over excellence in schools.|$|E

2500|$|Students turning five {{enter at}} Year 1 if they begin {{school at the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year or before the cut-off date (31 March in legislation, later for most schools). Students who turn five {{late in the year}} might stay in Year 1 for the next school year {{depending}} on their academic progress. The Ministry of Education draws a distinction between academic and funding year levels, the latter being based on when a student first starts school—students first starting school after July, who therefore do not appear on the July roll returns, are classified as being in Funding Year 0 that year, and are recorded as being in Year 1 on the next year's roll returns.|$|E
2500|$|The Week of Welcome program, more {{commonly}} known as [...] "WOW", serves as a volunteer-based orientation program for new students {{during the first week}} after move-in during the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> year in September. Its purpose is to introduce students to the campus and the community and prepare them for a successful college career. Freshmen are placed in a group with 10–12 other new students while transfer students are in groups of 40-60; each group is led by two current Cal Poly student orientation leaders. [...] The [...] "WOW" [...] groups participate in an array of orientation events in addition to activities both on- and off-campus. In 2010, the awareness section of the program won the 2010 National Orientation Directors Association (NODAC) Media & Publications Showcase Award in the Emerging Technologies. The awareness section was entirely developed by student volunteers. The program started in 1956 and is now the largest volunteer orientation program in the nation.|$|E
