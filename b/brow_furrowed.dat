6000|$|Captain Mitchell's guest, staring curiously, {{would see}} a figure in a long-tailed black coat walking gravely, with downcast eyelids in a long, {{composed}} face, a <b>brow</b> <b>furrowed</b> horizontally, a pointed head, whose grey hair, thin at the top, combed down carefully on all sides and rolled at the ends, fell low on the neck and shoulders. This, then, was the famous bandit of whom Europe had heard with interest. He put on a high-crowned sombrero with a wide flat brim; a rosary of wooden beads was twisted about his right wrist. And Captain Mitchell would proceed-- ...|$|E
60|$|On Thursday of Camp Jackson week, {{an event}} {{occurred}} in Mr. Carvel's store which excited a buzz of comment. Mr. Hopper announced to Mr. Barbo, the book-keeper, {{that he should}} not be there after four o'clock. To be sure, times were more than dull. The Colonel that morning had read over some two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest, telling of the impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the country. The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his <b>brow</b> <b>furrowed.</b> On the other hand, Mr. Hopper's equanimity was spoken of at the widow's table.|$|E
60|$|The {{agony of}} these {{thoughts}} was mitigated by the scorching hatred that had replaced her love, {{the desire for}} retaliation, revenge. Occasionally, however, that stream of consciousness was broken by the recollection {{of what she had}} permitted and even advised her sister to do; and though the idea of the place to which Lise was going sickened her, though she achieved a certain objective amazement at the transformation in herself enabling her to endorse such a course, she was glad of having endorsed it, she rejoiced that Lise's child would not be born into a world that had seemed--so falsely--fair and sweet, and in reality was black and detestable. Her acceptance of the act--for Lise--was a function of the hatred consuming her, a hatred which, growing in bigness, had made Ditmar merely the personification of that world. From time to time her hands clenched, her <b>brow</b> <b>furrowed,</b> powerful waves of heat ran through her, the craving for action became so intense she could scarcely refrain from rising in her seat.|$|E

60|$|The Bishop swung then upon Vasquez, and his <b>brow</b> became <b>furrowed</b> with contemptuous anger.|$|R
60|$|And {{the first}} chap I ran into was young Tuppy. His <b>brow</b> was <b>furrowed,</b> {{and he was}} moodily bunging stones at a flowerpot.|$|R
60|$|My {{father and}} my mother lived to see the Protestant {{religion}} regain its place once more, and to see England become the champion of the reformed faith upon the Continent. Three years later I found them in Havant much as I had left them, save {{that there were more}} silver hairs amongst the brown braided tresses of my mother, and that my father's great shoulders were a trifle bowed and his <b>brow</b> <b>furrowed</b> with the lines of care. Hand in hand they passed onwards down life's journey, the Puritan and the Church woman, and I have never despaired of the healing of religious feud in England since I have seen how easy it is for two folks to retain the strongest belief in their own creeds, and yet to bear the heartiest love and respect for the professor of another. The days may come when the Church and the Chapel may be as a younger and an elder brother, each working to one end, and each joying in the other's success. Let the contest between them be not with pike and pistol, not with court and prison; but let the strife be which shall lead the higher life, which shall take the broader view, which shall boast the happiest and best cared-for poor. Then their rivalry shall be not a curse, but a blessing to this land of England.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{features}} the then-unique {{sound of a}} reversed guitar duet played by Harrison in a five-hour late-night recording session with producer George Martin. Harrison perfected the part with the tape running backwards so that, when reversed, it would fit the dreamlike mood. One guitar was recorded with fuzz effects, the other without. Engineer Geoff Emerick described the meticulous process as [...] "interminable". [...] "I can still picture George hunched over his guitar for hours on end", Emerick wrote in 2006, [...] "headphones clamped on, <b>brows</b> <b>furrowed</b> in concentration." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the bronze}} work The Shangaan (1907) {{we see a}} {{reserved}} person. He looks slightly down, the <b>brow</b> is <b>furrowed</b> and arms tightly crossed over his chest {{as if he is}} cutting himself off from the onlooker.|$|R
60|$|He was silent, his <b>brow</b> {{a little}} <b>furrowed,</b> and drummed {{with his fingers}} upon the table.|$|R
6000|$|In the ante-room he {{came upon}} Lord Rotherby, striding to and fro, his <b>brow</b> all <b>furrowed</b> with care. At sight of Mr. Caryll, the viscount's scowl grew blacker. [...] "Oons and the devil!" [...] he cried. [...] "What make you here?" ...|$|R
5000|$|His biographer, Eric Midwinter, {{writes of}} Hare's {{characters}} in these farces: Hare created a cosily familiar style and was identified completely with, in effect, one part, {{that of the}} prissy little man, constantly {{in a state of}} unease and agitation, invariably sucked into some maelstrom of domestic upset and dislocation, unfailingly compromised and often trouserless. The bald dome, with <b>brows</b> <b>furrowing</b> anxiously beneath it; the spectacles, emphasizing the shock and bewilderment with which he responded to his travails; the jerky, staccato movements as his distress grew - these made him a highly recognisable stage figure. In concert with the worldly wise Tom Walls and the affable Ralph Lynn … {{he became one of the}} premier exponents of English farce.|$|R
5000|$|The Patriarch (Air and Water): An old philosopher, with a {{long face}} and long white hair and long white beard and moustache; white bushy eyebrows; all around are shapes like flowers or snowflakes; the <b>brow</b> is <b>furrowed</b> upwards from the nose in a fan-like fashion.|$|R
60|$|This naive {{suggestion}} did {{not affect}} {{him as much as}} the fact that this fair young girl had confessed herself his friend. He did not look at Myrtle now; he stared straight ahead, at the wall paper, and his <b>brow</b> was <b>furrowed</b> as if he was thinking deeply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} shuddered {{to think}} of his perplexity should he catch the rabbit, which however was extremely unlikely; nevertheless he did catch it, I know not how, but presume it to have been another than the one {{of which he was}} in chase. I found him with it, his <b>brows</b> <b>furrowed</b> in the deepest thought. The rabbit, terrified but uninjured, cowered beneath him. Porthos gave me a happy look and again dropped into a weighty frame of mind. 'What is the next thing one does?' was obviously the puzzle with him, and the position was scarcely less awkward for the rabbit, which several times made a move to end this intolerable suspense. Whereupon Porthos immediately gave it a warning tap with his foot, and again fell to pondering. The strain on me was very great.|$|R

60|$|Here I stopped abruptly. Wild {{thoughts}} were crystallizing into words I might not speak, and I grew hot with {{the struggle to}} check them, while I fancied that Grace blushed before she turned her face away. I know my <b>brow</b> was <b>furrowed</b> and my fingers trembled, {{so that it was}} a relief presently to hear her musical laugh.|$|R

50|$|KSL, {{like other}} sign languages, {{incorporates}} non-manual markers with lexical, syntactic, discourse, and affective functions. These include <b>brow</b> raising and <b>furrowing,</b> frowning, head shaking and nodding, and leaning and shifting the torso.|$|R

40|$|In a noisy, crowded, stuffy hallway, rank {{with the}} odors of stale sweat and urine, {{a group of}} 11 men stand or slouch disconsolately in a cage of iron bars. Their clothes are rumpled and dirty. They are disheveled and {{obviously}} haven't washed their faces for some time. These are prisoners, called “overnighters, ” arrested {{only a few hours}} ago by the Chicago police. They are awaiting a bond hearing before a judge on drug charges. Standing up at the bars, a line of prisoners (mostly Black and Latino men) are being interviewed by obviously middle-class young men and women (mostly white) with clipboards and pens. These are Pre-Trial Services' officers. They will make a report to the judge regarding whether these men should go free while awaiting trial. The officers shout their questions, hoping {{to be heard over the}} din in the lockup. The prisoners listen hard and intently, staring at the officer's faces, looking for meanings in their expressions. Their <b>brows</b> <b>furrow</b> as they answer the questions they are asked. They know the answers they give could decide whether they go free or are forced to remain in jail...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally made of leather, Pulcinella's mask {{is either}} black or dark brown, to imply {{weathering}} from the sun. His nose varies, but {{is always the}} most prominent feature of the mask by far. It can be long and curved, hooking over the mouth, {{or it can be}} shorter, with a more bulbous bridge. But either way, the nose is to resemble that of a bird's beak. There is often a wart somewhere on the mask, typically on the forehead or nose. Furrowed eyebrows and deep wrinkles are also important, though there is tons of room for artistic interpretation there. He can have a protruding brow ridge, knitted <b>brows,</b> a <b>furrowed</b> <b>brow,</b> or simply raised eyebrows. No matter the implication behind them, it is simply important that they are deeply wrinkled and prominent enough to match the exaggerated style of commedia dell'arte masks. The mask used to feature a bushy black mustache or beard, but this was abandoned through the 17th century for the most part.|$|R
50|$|Unlike many emotions, resentment {{does not}} have {{physical}} tags exclusively related to it that telegraph {{when a person is}} feeling this emotion. However, physical expressions associated with related emotions such as anger and envy may be exhibited, such as <b>furrowed</b> <b>brows</b> or bared teeth.|$|R

40|$|Portrait of Dr. Albert Abraham Michelson, {{the first}} American {{to receive the}} Nobel Prize in sciences, ca. 1930. Dr. Michelson {{can be seen at}} center from the waist up in a dark jacket and vest. His <b>brow</b> is <b>furrowed</b> over his beady eyes and his {{mustache}} sits above his thin lips. His thin, lightly-colored hair stands out {{against the backdrop of the}} large, glistening, metal pipe which runs behind him. He pushes his left shoulder towards the pip to avoid the large bolt which stands on the right. Originally, the photograph was captioned as "Portrait of aqueduct engineer William Mulholland, ca. 1950 "...|$|R

40|$|In a major {{speech that}} has already <b>furrowed</b> <b>brows</b> amongst the Tory right wing, Ken Clarke set out {{proposals}} for wide-ranging criminal justice reform. Simon Bastow listened to his speech and sets it against the overall picture of pressures on the Ministry of Justice, where 25 per cent cuts might come, {{and the future of}} the prisons system especially. ...|$|R

[...] The heroic {{follower}} of Garibaldi, {{at the thought}} of the eternal stillness and silence fallen upon the shrouded form stretched out on the bed upstairs, averted his face and raised his hand to his <b>furrowed</b> <b>brow.</b> [...] "She was dead before I could seize her hands," [...] he stammered out, pitifully.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of a Cahuilla Indian with her child and baby, 1897. The woman stands at center, her body facing right, her head turned towards the viewer. Her <b>brow</b> is <b>furrowed,</b> and she holds a metal pail full of rags at her side with a muscular, veiny hand. Behind her and to the left, a young boy can be seen following her. On her back, a baby can be seen slung into the kerchief papoose she has fashioned. She wears a dress and blouse, {{as well as a}} bundle of rags on her head. A long building, possibly adobe, {{can be seen in the}} right distance...|$|R
60|$|On these {{occasions}} {{there was}} one person only who really interested him. This was a man, somewhat over middle age, of singularly noble and distinguished bearing. His <b>brow</b> was <b>furrowed</b> with lines, but they spoke of cares of the past. Benevolence had settled on his face. It was as if, after a weary struggle, the sun had broken through the heavy clouds. He was attired in the ordinary dress of an English gentleman; but once, when {{he raised his head}} to see if it rained, Andrew noticed that he only wore a woollen shirt, without a necktie. As a rule, his well-trimmed, venerable beard hid this from view.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Merrick was a {{model of}} the close-shaven {{clear-cut}} London consultant. His shirt-front was as impeccable as his moral character was spotless--in the way that Belgravia and Harley Street still understood spotlessness. He was tall and straight, and unbent by age; the professional poker which he had swallowed in early life seemed to stand him in good stead after sixty years, though his hair had whitened fast, and his <b>brow</b> was <b>furrowed</b> with most deliberative wrinkles. So unapproachable he looked, that not even his own sons dared speak frankly before him. His very smile was restrained; he hardly permitted himself for a moment that weak human relaxation.|$|R
60|$|In uniform succession, {{the thirty}} wives ruled {{queen of the}} king's heart. An {{arrangement}} most wise and judicious; precluding much of that jealousy and confusion prevalent in ill-regulated seraglios. For as thirty spouses must be either more desirable, or less desirable than one; so is a harem thirty times more difficult to manage than an establishment with one solitary mistress. But Donjalolo's wives were so nicely drilled, {{that for the most}} part, things went on very smoothly. Nor were his <b>brows</b> much <b>furrowed</b> with wrinkles referable to domestic cares and tribulations. Although, as in due time will be seen, from these he was not altogether exempt.|$|R
6000|$|Wade Atsheler is dead--dead {{by his own}} hand. To {{say that}} this was entirely {{unexpected}} by the small coterie which knew him, would be to say an untruth; and yet never once had we, his intimates, ever canvassed the idea. Rather had we been prepared for it in some incomprehensible subconscious way. Before the perpetration of the deed, its possibility is remotest from our thoughts; but when we did know that he was dead, it seemed, somehow, that we had understood and looked forward to it all the time. This, by retrospective analysis, we could easily explain by the fact of his great trouble. I use [...] "great trouble" [...] advisedly. Young, handsome, with an assured position as the right-hand man of Eben Hale, the great street-railway magnate, there could be no reason for him to complain of fortune's favors. Yet we had watched his smooth <b>brow</b> <b>furrow</b> and corrugate as under some carking care or devouring sorrow. We had watched his thick, black hair thin and silver as green grain under brazen skies and parching drought. Who can forget, {{in the midst of the}} hilarious scenes he toward the last sought with greater and greater avidity--who can forget, I say, the deep abstractions and black moods into which he fell? At such times, when the fun rippled and soared from height to height, suddenly, without rhyme or reason, his eyes would turn lacklustre, his brows knit, as with clenched hands and face overshot with spasms of mental pain he wrestled on the edge of the abyss with some unknown danger.|$|R
