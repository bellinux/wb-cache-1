40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to assess (by means of the {{synthesis}} of interdisciplinary sciences) whether we could trace any changes in clothing style {{during a period of}} Hussit wars with an overlap to the years 1400 - 1450 on the basis of surviving fragments of historic textiles, visual and material sources with the references to literary documents. The thesis focuses more thoroughly on the earlier development of the structure of male and female pieces of clothing and their possible form in the period of Hussit wars. Specifically, it follows the evolution of the form of both male and female <b>body</b> <b>linen,</b> under garments and outer garments, and it also focuses on head coverings, hose, shoes and accessories of the particular period. The document is enriched by a large variety of pictures attached straight to the text due to better orientation within the written content. At the end there are tables and figures which widely cover the traces of individual parts of garments found in illuminated manuscripts dated back to the delimited period. Key words: clothing, archeological textiles, illumination, Bohemia, Hussite wars, late middle ages...|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{maintained}} an elaborate set of burial customs {{that they believed}} were necessary to ensure immortality after death. These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife. Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation. The arid, desert conditions were a boon {{throughout the history of}} ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite. Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the <b>body</b> in <b>linen,</b> and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin. Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find, analyse and systematise the basic ways of embalmment and their {{application}} in contemporary methods of plastination. In most of the ancient mummies the internal organs and the brain were removed. Usually the best-preserved samples were under additional protective circumstances- low temperatures, dry air, draught, or isolating cover of the body. Chinchoros used NaCl and, later on, fire for drying of body cavities. The dehydration factors in the Pacific mummies were warmness and smoke, while ancient Egyptians used sodium salts. Chinchoros covered the whole body with manganese dust, brilliant ochre or clay. The skin of the mummies from Melanesia was coated with fats mixed with red ochre, and Egyptians impregnated the dead <b>bodies</b> and <b>linen</b> bandages with herbal oils derived from Cedar Tree (Cedrus atlantica). The ancient principles of embalmment – dehydration and impregnation are used also in modern plastination technologies, including plastination with products of type "Biodur Sn"...|$|R

A little more than thirty-six hours afterwards (Friday 6 P.M., to Sunday 6 A.M., or a little after) three women visit the tomb and find it empty. And they are told by a young man [...] "arrayed in a white robe" [...] that Jesus is gone to his native country of Galilee, and that the disciples and Peter will find him there.|$|R
60|$|Jacopo had tranquilly {{placed his}} person before the block. His head was bare, his cheek colorless, {{his throat and}} neck {{uncovered}} from the shoulders, his <b>body</b> in its <b>linen,</b> {{and the rest of}} his form was clad in the ordinary dress of a gondolier. He kneeled with his face bowed to the block, repeated a prayer, and rising he faced the multitude with dignity and composure. As his eye moved slowly over the array of human countenances by which he was environed, a hectic glowed on his features, for not one of them all betrayed sympathy in his sufferings. His breast heaved, and those nearest to his person thought the self-command of the miserable man was about to fail him. The result disappointed expectation. There was a shudder, and the limbs settled into repose.|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} part, the author {{responds}} on the fundamental questions: whose picture {{is on the}} Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen? In that sense, he points out numerous and detailed similarities between Gospel 2 ̆ 7 s reports and Picture on Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen (for example whiping, crowning with thorny crown, carring of the cross, falls on the Way of the Cross, crucifying with nails, flank pierced by spear, the dead <b>body</b> wraped in <b>linen).</b> Starting from these similarities some scientists, {{on the basis of}} probability, worked out that there is a great probability, according to some almost certeinty, that the Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen is that Linen the Gospels talk about and in which the dead Christ 2 ̆ 7 s body was wraped. If the Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen is funeral Christ 2 ̆ 7 s linen, there are farther questions how it was preserved through the history and was transmited to us. The author brings out some facts that direct to that Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen is identical with Linen that was kept and honored in Constantinople (X-XII c.) and in Edessa (VI-X c). In Edessa it was probably brought from Jerusalem as late as the lst century. A question is also asked how the Picture originated on Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen. The author brings out opinions of the modern investigators of the Picture from Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen and they conclude that the picture is not forgery, that did not originate neither physical nor chemical effect of the dead <b>body</b> on <b>Linen.</b> It is the best explained with method of the thermal influence on Linen (by parching). However, to the scientists are not possible to influence on linen to gain similar picture nor with the most modern technical devices (mild shades of the colour gives three-demensional picture but the traces of the picture do not change {{to the other side of}} the linen). The science, therefore, can not explain the origin of the Picture on Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen! At the end the author asks questions, isn 2 ̆ 7 t that thermal energy, so nuanced and short-lived in intesity that it could create such Picture, could originate on the occasion of the resurrection of the Christ 2 ̆ 7 s body, about what teli us Gospels? That, really, is not answer of the scientist but meditation of the believer. In that case the Turin 2 ̆ 7 s Linen would be the sign for the man of XXth century, for the man of modern scientific investigations; the sign which directs in supernatural processes...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{theories}} on ancient Egyptian mummification postulate {{that in the}} prehistoric period (i. e. the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, 5 th and 4 th millennia B. C.) bodies were naturally desiccated through {{the action of the}} hot, dry desert sand. Although molding of the <b>body</b> with resin-impregnated <b>linen</b> is believed to be an early Pharaonic forerunner to more complex processes, scientific evidence for the early use of resins in artificial mummification has until now been limited to isolated occurrences during the late Old Kingdom (c. 2200 B. C.), their use becoming more apparent during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000 - 1600 BC). We examined <b>linen</b> wrappings from <b>bodies</b> in securely provenanced tombs (pit graves) in the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries at Mostagedda in the Badari region (Upper Egypt). Our investigations of these prehistoric funerary wrappings using a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermal desorption/pyrolysis (TD/Py) -GC-MS have identified a pine resin, an aromatic plant extract, a plant gum/sugar, a natural petroleum source, and a plant oil/animal fat in directly AMS-dated funerary wrappings. Predating the earliest scientific evidence by more than a millennium, these embalming agents constitute complex, processed recipes of the same natural products, in similar proportions, as those utilized at the zenith of Pharaonic mummification some 3, 000 years later. The antibacterial properties of some of these ingredients and the localized soft-tissue preservation that they would have afforded lead us to conclude that these represent the very beginnings of experimentation that would evolve into th...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{simulation}} {{techniques are}} widely used in computer graphics to produce realistic animations of complex natural phenomenon. The behavior of a physical simulator is governed {{by a set of}} parameters, typically specified by the animator. Tuning complex simulations, like rigid bodies and cloth is extremely laborious because of the large number of parameters that must be adjusted to achieve the desired motion. This proposal presents a set of techniques to create physically realistic animations from video. Our first technique uses optimization to estimate the simulation parameters from a video sequence of the real physical phenomenon. This framework has been applied to estimate the parameters of rigid body and cloth simulations from video using simple image features like silhouettes or local curvature measurements. Our optimization framework tunes the parameters of the simulation by minimizing the least square error between the features from simulation and video. This framework has produced compelling simulations of tumbling rigid <b>bodies</b> and fabrics (<b>linen,</b> satin, fleece and knit) that closely match their real-world footage. Our second technique is a video editing framework for creating animations of chaotic natural systems like fluids. Here, the goal is to create new animations by editing existing video footage. The proposed algorithm obtains velocity fields from the original footage and modifies them to satisfy a set of user specified flow constraints, while preserving the local statistics of the original velocity field. It then uses color from the original video to render the modified sequence in simulation. The velocity fields in the proposed editing framework can be defined in 2 D or 3 D, depending on the phenomenon that is being modelled. We have already implemented our framework for estimating the parameters of rigid bodies and cloth simulations from video. During the course of this thesis, we plan to implement the video editing framework and test it on several interesting video sequences of complex fluid motion with both stationary and transient temporal dynamics. ...|$|R
