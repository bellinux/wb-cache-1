Taylor performed strongly in the ODIs, {{with a total of}} 302 runs at 60.40. However, it was a disappointing tour for the team; the solitary Test in Delhi was lost, as were all five ODIs played during the Titan Cup.|$|E
500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology. Christman told Morning Edition: [...] "It feels like we've <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, {{and all of a}} sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..." [...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've never seen anything like that before. This is incredible. I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it on a Web cam." ...|$|E
500|$|... io9 {{felt the}} {{character}} of Danes to be a cross between Freddy Krueger and Jesus. Commenting on the Christ comparison, Pullman felt that his character {{was sort of the}} [...] "doppelganger of Jesus or something." [...] He stated of Danes: [...] "It's like he's <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the desert, and he comes back in, and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride." [...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die [...] "becomes the pivot for a whole world that has changed"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E

500|$|Miller {{caused a}} {{stoppage}} {{after his first}} ball in order to sprinkle sawdust on the crease. With the second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 2/1. However, despite the early wicket, the bowlers appeared to lack confidence in their run-up on the soggy ground. Bradman made an early bowling change and brought Johnston into the attack to replace Miller after the latter had bowled three overs for the concession of two runs. At this time, Bradman adopted relatively defensive field settings despite the early breakthrough. Bill Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around [...] Lindsay Hassett took the catch just behind square leg, diving sideways and getting two hands to the ball. This left England at 10/2 as Denis Compton came to the crease. Lindwall bounced Compton, drawing an edge that flew towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball narrowly evade the slips catchers and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for Compton to regain his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to run him out. However, this sporting gesture did not cost Australia many runs because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton went for a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch. Bradman later said he had remembered how Compton had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> exactly the same position in the corresponding match at the same ground during the 1938 series. Fingleton described Morris's effort as [...] "one of the catches of the season". England were 17/3, and Crapp came in to join Hutton. At this point, Bradman began to put in place more attacking field settings. Johnston then hit Hutton on the fingers with a ball that rose sharply after pitching. Bradman took Lindwall off after 50 minutes and replaced him with Miller, who then removed Crapp, caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 23/4. When play was adjourned for lunch with England on 29/4, Hutton was 17 while Yardley was on four. According to Fingleton, Hutton [...] "had never been in the slightest difficulty". He had played cautiously but did not seem hurried by the bowling. Miller had taken 2/3 from six overs.|$|E

It was shot over seven days {{under the direction of}} Pete Bishop and Marc Kitchen-Smith, while the company No Strings were responsible for the model construction.

2500|$|If the English {{team had}} learned any {{lessons from the}} First Test, it was that they, and the English press had vastly underestimated the {{abilities}} of Allan Border's well-picked young batting line-up who had scored over 800 runs between them at Headingley. So when David Gower won the toss again at Lord's he wasn't going to repeat his mistake of sending Australia in again. The irony this time being that cloudy skies prevailed and bowling {{would have been the}} best option. [...] He chose to bat, but Hughes and Alderman soon had England three wickets down by lunch, including Gatting first ball to another bat pad catch (he had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a similar fashion during the Old Trafford Texaco game). [...] Gooch made 60 and Gower 57 but the England batsmen seemed intent on attack, and while this was reflected in a score of 280 well before the close of play, they lost all 10 wickets in getting there.|$|E
2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban on 6 February against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw at Anfield; Dalglish reacted to his return by saying [...] "It's fantastic to have him back. He should never have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his arms up in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez {{not to talk about}} the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single convincing proof that [...] had done any of the things they accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character that will probably be there forever".|$|E
2500|$|Ian Redpath (21) and Rick McCosker (35) {{upset the}} England plans by adding 52 in 83 {{minutes for the}} first wicket. Geoff Arnold made the ball cut and lift immediately, but Bob Willis {{struggled}} and after six overs Derek Underwood replaced Arnold, who changed ends so as to {{have the advantage of}} the wind behind him. [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] (7/113) was called an umbrella bowler – there in case of a rain-affected wicket – {{and he was able to}} make the ball leap and turn from his first over. The openers managed to survive, and by surviving most of the first session they ensured that the Australian middle order would be able to play on a less lethal wicket. Denness failed to bring on Fred Titmus at the other end until the last over before lunch in conditions tailor made for spin bowling, a decision for which he was greatly criticised though E.W. Swanton thought the damps patches were not on Titmus's length. As it was Underwood had to do all the work, bowling 29 overs compared to 31 by the other five bowlers. He achieved the breakthrough when McCosker clipped a ball to Cowdrey in the slips, then both Chappell brothers, Ian was surprised by a leaping ball and skyed it to Knott, while Greg was lbw to a ball that turned from leg to middle stump while he tried to run a leg-bye. With the last ball before lunch Redpath edged the ball the Greig at silly-point and Australia were 77/4. After lunch Marsh tried to hit Underwood out of the attack, but was taken by Greig at mid-wicket at 84/5 with the Kent bowler having taken all the wickets 5/35. The South Australian sun was now drying out the wicket, which reverted to its normal, placid self in the afternoon. The brilliant Doug Walters hit 55 off 66 balls with 7 fours and a six, adding 80 with Terry Jenner who made his only Test fifty on his home ground. Titmus replaced Underwood just as the pitch was losing its turn and Walters was getting into his stride. The Australian batsmen took 24 runs off two overs and Walters's six was caught one handed in the member's stand. The tired Underwood was brought back as his left arm spin could not be hit so easily and Walters spooned a catch to a surprised Willis at mid-off. The tall Max Walker had yet to fail in the series and hit 41, adding 77 with Jenner until the latter became Underwood's seventh successive wicket when he misjudged the flight and hit over a ball. Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee while Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee walked to keep Walker in until Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go and the umpire agreed. Lillee (26) added 36 with Mallett (23 not out) and hooked Willis for four until the new ball was taken. Willis then spread Lillee's stumps and Arnold those of Thomson and Australia were out for 304, the mystery being why they had not <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the morning such a poor wicket.|$|E
