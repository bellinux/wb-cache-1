5|$|Using wells, {{freshwater}} {{is available}} at a reasonable depth for irrigation and domestic purposes. Until the installation of a pump in 2006, however, drinking water had to be sent by <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Elinkine.|$|E
5|$|John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company was {{centered}} on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for common whitefish and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Detroit.|$|E
50|$|The town lies on Lulu Bay. Its {{ruggedness}} prevents <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> landing; {{such small}} boats as regularly ply {{the area are}} mainly fishing <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> nearby Haiti.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 May 1811, <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> Cherokee, [...] and , made {{an attempt}} to cut out some galliots at Egersund, {{on the coast of}} Norway, but were thwarted by the arrival of <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> HDMS Lolland.|$|R
50|$|The {{competition}} comprised heats, semifinals, {{and a final}} round. The {{top three}} <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> each heat advanced to final. The other boats in each heats advanced to the semifinal. The top three <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> semifinal advanced to final.|$|R
5|$|On 1 July 1921, Pisa was {{reclassified}} from a second-class battleship to {{a coastal}} battleship {{and became a}} training ship. In 1925 she was modified to operate a Macchi M.7 flying <b>boat.</b> <b>From</b> 1925 to 1930, the ship was used to train naval cadets and lieutenants. Pisa was stricken on 28 April 1937 and subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|The Persians were {{alerted to}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Greeks by a <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Histiaea, but did not at first believe it. They sent some ships to see if this was the case, and finding that it was, the whole fleet set sail for Artemisium in the morning. The Persians then sailed on to Histiaea and sacked the surrounding region.|$|E
5|$|Within days, the blacksmith, postman, and laundress were persuaded or {{volunteered to}} stop serving Boycott. Boycott's young nephew volunteered {{to act as}} postman, but he was intercepted en route between Ballinrobe and Lough Mask, and told {{that he would be}} in danger if he continued. Soon, shopkeepers in Ballinrobe stopped serving Boycott, and he had to bring food and other {{provisions}} by <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Cong.|$|E
50|$|Though as noted, Hai {{has never}} been a major {{international}} competition class, some regattas between <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> different countries have been organized, especially in the 1930s when boat was gaining popularity around Baltic, but also in recent years, featuring <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> Finland, Germany and France.|$|R
50|$|From 1953 to 1971, Qantas Empire Flying <b>Boats</b> {{operated}} <b>from</b> Redland Bay. These {{were mainly}} Sunderland flying <b>boats</b> traveling <b>from</b> Sydney to the United Kingdom. Ansett, {{formerly known as}} Barrier Reef Airways also operated flying <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> Redland Bay, taking tourists to Hayman Island in North Queensland.|$|R
50|$|Several French {{naval vessels}} {{undertook}} an extensive sea search for Bague; the Ministry of the Marine despatched the destroyer Arbalète and six torpedo <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> Ajaccio and the destroyer Mousqueton and six torpedo <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> Toulon. However, {{no trace of}} Bague or his airplane was found, then or subsequently.|$|R
5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} unable to do so as his ship's boats had all been destroyed. Allemand sent a <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the nature of his recent combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E
5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|Delta drifted {{slowly and}} erratically southwards {{for several days}} before {{accelerating}} north-eastwards then eastwards towards the Canary Islands and north Africa. During this period, it twice approached hurricane strength, although it never achieved hurricane intensity. On November 28 it merged with a frontal system northwest of the Canaries and became a vigorous extratropical storm. It caused severe damage in the Canary Islands and claimed at least seven lives, including six who drowned while attempting to reach the Canary Islands by <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Africa. El Dedo de Dios, or God's Finger, a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was toppled during the storm. Delta also caused power outages, leaving some 200,000people without power and forcing airports to close down.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 June 1812 <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> HMS Unite, [...] and Cerberus {{captured}} three {{vessels of}} from eighty {{to one hundred}} tons in the small port of Badisea, near Otranto. A little over a month later, on 17 July, <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> [...] and Cerberus captured or destroyed, off Venice, 12 enemy trabaccolos.|$|R

5|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as ideal for lake-fishing and duck-shooting, and being {{exhibited in the}} Great Exhibition of 1851, Halkett's boat designs were not commercially successful and never entered general use outside the specialised field of Canadian exploration. Later promoted to Captain, Halkett died on 23 March 1885, aged 65, and the manufacture of his boat designs was abandoned. John Rae gave his <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall, and it lay forgotten on the rafters of a Kirkwall woodyard. It was identified and recovered many years later, and is now displayed in the Stromness Museum at Orkney. A second surviving example is held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. The river was used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|In August 1936 the Middletons made {{a leisurely}} drive to New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines. The trip took them 42 days and {{included}} {{passage through the}} Panama Canal with stops in Panama, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. When they arrived in Hawaii, they were greeted by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed {{it back to the}} states {{at the end of his}} tour.|$|E

5|$|Strong waves caused {{extensive}} {{damage to the}} coastline, especially on the southern portion of Bermuda. The strong waves broke a <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> its moorings at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two people, tried to save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot (6m) waves, which dropped several feet {{of water in the}} ship; however, ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a sea wall in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.|$|E
5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east {{along the coast}} {{as far as the}} Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> reaching the shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{notice that}} Geiger {{has set the}} ship to crash into an oil tanker {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving {{underneath}} it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, causing it to break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> the ship's stern.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} cancelled several flights {{in and out of}} the Bermuda International Airport, stranding hundreds of travellers. Cruise ships and cargo ships also cancelled or delayed their arrivals. The strongest winds of Erin remained to the east of the island. As a result, the highest winds on the island peaked at 41mph (66km/h). Moderate winds downed several trees onto power lines, leaving dozens of homes without power for several hours. Prolonged durations of strong waves resulted in coastal beach erosion. Large waves broke a <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> its moorings, though two men swam through the rough seas to prevent the yacht from running aground. The storm produced rainfall on the island, yet no flooding was reported. Little structural damage occurred on Bermuda, and there were no reported injuries or casualties.|$|E
5|$|This {{fire had}} more {{troubles}} {{due to the}} age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters {{were not to be}} sent onto the bridge; a <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used to put out the fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose that could reach the blaze on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Winds from Hurricane Erika {{peaked at}} 37mph (60km/h) with {{a gust of}} 47mph (76km/h) in the Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas. The outer rainbands {{produced}} light to moderate rainfall in the Virgin Islands, peaking at 3.28inches (83mm) at the University of the Virgin Islands in Saint Thomas and 1.32inches (36mm) in Saint John. The precipitation produced localized street flooding, while the combination of winds and rain caused power interruptions. Offshore, strong waves capsized one dinghy and broke a 50-foot (15m) <b>boat</b> <b>from</b> its moorings. On Saint Croix, the hurricane produced sustained winds of 25mph (40km/h) and a peak wind gust of 29mph (46km/h) at the Henry E. Rohlsen Airport. Rainfall on the island was light, peaking at 0.83inches (21mm) at Christiansted. The wind gusts downed a few power lines, and damage was minor.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 Mar 1813, <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> [...] {{captured}} a large trabaccoló armed with three 9-pounders, and burnt a similar one laden with oil, off {{the town of}} Vasto. On the 26th, <b>boats</b> <b>from</b> Havannah captured five armed trabaccolos and five feluccas laden with salt, {{near the town of}} Fortore. These operations cost Havannah only two men wounded.|$|R
