50|$|Having {{served on}} the <b>board</b> <b>of</b> the {{national}} <b>regulator</b> <b>of</b> the NHS in England and two local NHS Trust boards Museji identifies the NHS in England {{as a victim of}} its own success. He was asked to lead the Wye Valley Trust during tough periods of the NHS. With huge cost pressures facing the NHS he entered the national debate about its cost and value by writing about how the NHS could save money. Faced with turning around a failing hospital, these challenges came into sharp focus. In 2015 writing jointly with the local MP for Hereford Jesse Norman he co-authored an article published by the Centre for Policy Studies “How Much Do We Use the NHS?” (Ref). In October 2016 shortly after his resignation, Wye Valley NHS Trust was taken out of “Special Measures” by the Care Quality Commission.|$|R

His growing credentials as a consumers’ champion were recognised when Ian Duncan Smith MP, Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) appointed him to Chair of The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS). A position he held for less than a year, resigning after failing to resolve a personal business matter that led to bankruptcy.|$|R

The RapidMiner Data Mining was used to analyze data obtained from the Pharmacy and Poison <b>Board,</b> the <b>regulator</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical products in the country, covering the period 2008 to 2010. The CRISP method was used to get a business understanding <b>of</b> the <b>Board,</b> understand the nature of the data held, prepare the data for analyze and actual analysis of the data. The results of the study discovered various patterns through correlation and association analysis of various product groups. The results were presented through various graphs and discussed with the domain experts. These patterns are similar to prescription patterns from studies in Ethiopia, Nigeria and India. The research will provide <b>regulators</b> <b>of</b> pharmaceutical products, not only in Kenya but other African countries, a better insight into the patterns of imports and exports of pharmaceutical products. This would result into better controls, not only in import and exports of the products, but also enforcement on their usage in order to avert negative effects to the citizens...|$|R
