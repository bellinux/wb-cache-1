25|$|Up {{until the}} late 1990s baboons {{occurred}} on all the mountains of the Peninsula, including the <b>Back</b> <b>Table</b> immediately behind Table Mountain. Since then they have abandoned Table Mountain and the <b>Back</b> <b>Table,</b> and only occur on the Constantiaberg, and {{the mountains to the}} south. They have also abandoned the tops of many of the mountains, in favour of the lower slopes, particularly when these were covered in pine plantations which seemed to provide them with more, or higher quality food than the fynbos on the mountain tops. However these new haunts are also within easy reach of Cape Town's suburbs, which brings them into conflict with humans and dogs, and the risk of traffic accidents. In 2014 there were a dozen troops on the Peninsula, varying in size from 7 to over 100 individuals, scattered on the mountains from the Constantiaberg to Cape Point. The baboon troops are the subject of intense research into their movements (both of individuals and of the troops), their physiology, genetics, social interactions and habits. In addition, their sleeping sites are noted each evening, so that monitors armed with paint ball guns can stay with the troop all day, to ward them off from wandering into the suburbs. From when this initiative was started in 2009 the number of baboons on the Peninsula has increased from 350 to 450, and the number of baboons killed or injured by residents has decreased.|$|E
2500|$|The Peninsula's {{vegetation}} types {{form part}} of the Cape Floral Region protected areas. These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain range - which {{are at least as}} many as occur in the whole of the United Kingdom. Many of these species, including a great many types of proteas, are endemic to these mountains and can be found nowhere else. The Disa uniflora, despite its restricted range within the Western Cape, is relatively common in the perennially wet areas (waterfalls, streamlets and seeps) on Table Mountain and the <b>Back</b> <b>Table,</b> but hardly anywhere else on the Cape Peninsula. It is a very showy orchid that blooms from January to March on the Table Mountain Sandstone regions of the mountain.

2500|$|Remnant {{patches of}} {{indigenous}} forest {{persist in the}} wetter ravines. However, much of the indigenous forest was felled by the early European settlers for fuel for the lime kilns needed during {{the construction of the}} Castle. The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of Devil's Peak, Table Mountain and the <b>Back</b> <b>Table</b> where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klaassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch [...] "bosch" [...] means forest; and [...] "boomen" [...] means trees) [...] Hout Bay (in Dutch [...] "hout" [...] means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests. In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes {{all the way from the}} Constantiaberg to the front of Devil’s Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous Afromontane forests have not survived, or never existed.|$|E

These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,285 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain and the Cape Peninsula range, of which a great proportion, including many species of proteas, are endemic to these mountains and valleys {{and can be found}} nowhere else. Of the 2,285 species on the Peninsula 1,500 occur in the 57 km2 area comprising Table Mountain and the <b>Back</b> <b>Table,</b> a number at least a large as all the plant species in the whole of the United Kingdom.
