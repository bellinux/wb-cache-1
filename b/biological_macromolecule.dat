30|$|Studies on the {{biological}} effects of nanomaterial are often {{focused on their}} cytotoxicity, deposits in target organs and ecological toxicology, while relatively less {{attention was paid to}} their interactions with <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Almost all the life processes are inseparable from the participation of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> (including proteins and nucleic acids). Following the process of translocation across biological barriers, nanomaterials can be transported into the blood, combine with <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> in the blood and other tissues, and through the blood transport be deposited in target organs where they exert potential toxic effects[1 – 3]. Therefore, in-depth understanding of their interactions with <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecules</b> is not only one of the important contents of their potential biomedical applications such as drug delivery, but also related to some basic problems such as the existence of specific roles of the interactions and {{the biological}} safety issues of nanomaterials, and thus attracts extensive attention of research communities.

50|$|The Gaussian {{network model}} (GNM) is a {{representation}} of a <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> as an elastic mass-and-spring network to study, understand, and characterize the mechanical aspects of its long-time large-scale dynamics. The model has {{a wide range of}} applications from small proteins such as enzymes composed of a single domain, to large macromolecular assemblies such as a ribosome or a viral capsid. Protein domain dynamics plays key roles in a multitude of molecular recognition and cell signalling processes.Protein domains, connected by intrinsically disordered flexible linker domains, induce long-range allostery via protein domain dynamics.The resultant dynamic modes cannot be generally predicted from static structures of either the entire protein or individual domains.|$|E
50|$|RNA is a <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> made of sugars and {{nitrogenous}} bases {{that plays}} {{a number of}} crucial roles in all living cells. There are several subtypes of RNA, with the most prominent in the cell being tRNA (transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA), and mRNA (messenger RNA). All three of these {{are involved in the}} process of translation, with the most prominent species (~85%) of cellular RNA being rRNA. As a result, this is the most immediately visible species when RNA is analyzed via electrophoresis and is thus used for determining RNA quality (see Computation, below). rRNA comes in various sizes, with those in mammals belonging to the sizes 5S, 18S, and 28S. The 28S and 5S rRNAs form the large subunit and the 18S forms the small subunit of the ribosome, the molecular machinery responsible for synthesizing proteins.|$|E
50|$|Allostery is {{a direct}} and {{efficient}} means for regulation of <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> function, produced by the binding of a ligand at an allosteric site topographically distinct from the orthosteric site. Due to the often high receptor selectivity and lower target-based toxicity, allosteric regulation {{is also expected to}} play an increasing role in drug discovery and bioengineering. The AlloSteric Database (ASD, http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD) provides a central resource for the display, search and analysis of the structure, function and related annotation for allosteric molecules. Currently, ASD contains allosteric proteins from more than 100 species and modulators in three categories (activators, inhibitors, and regulators). Each protein is annotated with detailed description of allostery, biological process and related diseases, and each modulator with binding affinity, physicochemical properties and therapeutic area. Integrating the information of allosteric proteins in ASD should allow the prediction of allostery for unknown proteins, to be followed with experimental validation. In addition, modulators curated in ASD can be used to investigate potential allosteric targets for a query compound, and can help chemists to implement structure modifications for novel allosteric drug design.|$|E

5000|$|The Anisotropic Network Model was {{introduced}} in 2000 (Atilgan et al., 2001; Doruker et al., 2000), inspired by the pioneering work of Tirion (1996), succeeded {{by the development of}} the Gaussian network model (GNM) (Bahar et al., 1997; Haliloglu et al., 1997), and by the work of Hinsen (1998) who first demonstrated the validity of performing EN NMA at residue level. It represents the <b>biological</b> <b>macromolecule</b> as an elastic mass-and-spring network, to explain the internal motions of a protein subject to a harmonic potential. In the network each node is the Cα atom of the residue and the springs represent the interactions between the nodes. The overall potential is the sum of harmonic potentials between interacting nodes. To describe the internal motions of the spring connecting the two atoms, there is only one degree of freedom. Qualitatively, this corresponds to the compression and expansion of the spring in a direction given by the locations of the two atoms. In other words, ANM is an extension of the Gaussian Network Model to three coordinates per atom, thus accounting for directionality.|$|E
