5000|$|Founded in 1898 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as the Star <b>Ball</b> <b>Retainer</b> Company, Star <b>Ball</b> <b>Retainer</b> Company {{merged with}} the Bretz Company in 1910 to form the Bearing Corporation of America. NTN Corporation then {{acquired}} Bearing Corporation of America in 1996, establishing NTN-BCA Corporation in Lititz, Pennsylvania the following year. [...] The company produced ball, mounted and needle roller bearings used in clutch releases, engines and heavy industrial equipment in addition to constant velocity joints for aerospace, automobile, forklift and manufacturing customers. The company made an announcement that they had plans to close the plant in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Bearing shields {{reduce the}} entry of dirt into the bearing. Metal and rubber {{non-contact}} shields are commonly used, of which rubber shields are slightly more effective. Neither shield type is totally effective, often resulting in the need for bearing maintenance.The <b>ball</b> <b>retainer</b> is usually made of either metal, plastic, or glass. Plastic types are preferred since they are quieter.|$|E
50|$|The main {{components}} of a VMCM are its two orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors, that directly measure the components of horizontal velocity parallel to their axes. The orientation of the instrument with respect to magnetic north is sensed with a flux-gate compass, which permits to evaluate the direction of flux, providing {{the angle of the}} Y axis with respect to the magnetic North.A microprocessor rotates the X-Y coordinates in the conventional East-West and North-South components of velocity. This is done once each sample interval and, {{at the end of the}} record interval, the conventional components of velocity are averaged and the averages are stored on a cassette magnetic tape. Other components of the system are a bearing retainer, an end cap, an outer bearing race, a <b>ball</b> <b>retainer</b> and bearing balls, an encoder and an epoxy or Noryl plastic disk with four magnets, pressure window, an aluminum disk, two magnetodiodes mounted asymmetrically on a printed circuit ring, a hub, and a shaft with inner races machined in it. The function of the magnetodiodes is detecting the rotation of the propeller sensors.|$|E
50|$|The {{bearings}} {{are normally}} {{open to the}} elements and easily contaminated, although this rarely causes failure. <b>Ball</b> <b>retainers</b> (caged bearings) are used to facilitate assembly and {{to reduce the number}} of balls required.|$|R
40|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{with glass}} fiber reinforced Teflon <b>ball</b> <b>retainers</b> from hot-fired liquid oxygen turbopumps {{were analyzed by}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy {{to determine the extent}} of Teflon transfer and/or chemical reaction at the bearing surface. No Teflon, but metal fluorides could be found on the metal surface. This indicates that Teflon decomposes and reacts with the bearing steel to form fluorides. Hence, Teflon does not appear to function directly as a lubricant under these operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) {{instrument}} scan {{system on}} the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) spacecraft has experienced several randomly occurring increased torque 'events' since its on-orbit activation in November 2011. Based on a review of on-orbit telemetry data and data gathered from scan mechanism bearing life testing on the ground, the conclusion was drawn that some degradation of Teflon toroid <b>ball</b> <b>retainers</b> was occurring in the instrument Scan Drive Mechanism. A life extension program was developed and executed on-orbit with very good results to date. The life extension program consisted of reversing the mechanism for {{a limited number of}} consecutive scans every day...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{spin axis}} ball {{bearings}} have been unreliable in spacecraft, often failing by two heretofore uncontrolled processes: <b>ball</b> <b>retainer</b> instability and lubricant breakdown. The Space Cartridge Bearing System (SCBS) addresses {{each of these}} mechanisms directly, leading to a bearing system with absolute freedom from retainer instability and negligible lubricant degradation rate.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{application}} of explicit dynamics and probability finite element method, reliability virtual experiment of {{deep groove ball bearing}} is carried out. Based on self â€“adaptive mesh module of the ANSYS/LS-DYNA, true numerical simulation of the working process is presented after the three-dimensional finite element bearing model is built. Then, the contact stress and strain among <b>balls,</b> <b>retainer</b> and inner (outer) race and also the pressure law during the contact process are obtained. As the randomness of manufacture and assemblage tolerance is inevitable, Monte Carlo method is adopted when samples the bearing system. From the random sampling, a large sample data of the maximum contact stress is got and the reliability coefficient is calculated; and the contribution of each original manufacture error to the reliability sensitivity of the bearing is analyzed. Reliability virtual experiment offers a theoretical reference to fatigue strength calculation and dynamic optimum design of the bearing system, and the analysis process is easy to be program controlled...|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1947 as Acme Spring Incorporated. During the 1950s the major product {{manufactured}} at the company was miniature <b>ball</b> bearing <b>retainer</b> rings. In 1958 Acme Spring was featured in the April 7th edition of Life magazine. The company was featured because they were a supplier for General Motors. In February 1969 Acme Monaco supplied New Hampshire Ball Bearing Company with retaining rings which were then put onto the Apollo vessel. The product line was expanded to include orthodontic hardware in 1970 {{with the addition of}} rolling and wire shaping. By 1984 the company had merged with Monaco Spring, to create Acme Monaco, and its product line was increased to include springs, wireforms, and stampings. Non-sterile medical assemblies, such as surgical staples, guidewires, and stylets were added in 1983. In 1989 a second manufacturing facility was opened in Presque Isle, Maine, USA. This expansion allowed the company to double capacity. In 2006 another facility was opened in Presque Isle, Maine. Also in 2007 the company opened a medical division Acme Monaco Asia Pte. Ltd. in Singapore.|$|R
40|$|A {{ball bearing}} life test program was {{performed}} to obtain data on the efficiencies of various lubricated and self-lubricating <b>ball</b> <b>retainer</b> systems for instrument bearings in a vacuum environment. The program utilized light to moderate radial loads at relatively low speeds on a NASA-GSFC designed and supplied test rig. Several systems were found which gave acceptable bearing life under the test conditions used, but the most consistent low running torques after testing resulted from oil lubrication...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} longer-lived {{satellites}} and spacecraft {{has resulted in}} the requirement for a greater understanding of lubricant loss pathways. At The Aerospace Corp., we have been engaged in research to understand these phenomena. In this paper, we will present a review of this work which includes the following topics: vapor pressure modeling of oils and additives for loss rate prediction, additive effectiveness, and oil uptake into cotton-phenolic <b>ball</b> <b>retainer</b> material. These studies allow us to make much more accurate estimates of lubricant lifetime in moving mechanical assemblies. 1...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of spin bearings for momentum wheels (control-moment gyroscope, reaction wheel assembly) {{is critical to}} satellite stability and life. Repeated bearing retainer instabilities hasten lubricant deterioration {{and can lead to}} premature bearing failure and/or unacceptable vibration. These instabilities are typically distinguished by increases in torque, temperature, audible noise, and vibration induced into the bearing cartridge. <b>Ball</b> <b>retainer</b> design can be optimized to minimize these occurrences. A retainer was designed using a previously successful smaller retainer as an example. Analytical methods were then employed to predict its behavior and optimize its configuration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{ultrasonic}} motor using thrust {{ball bearing}} with dimple structure on the friction surface has been proposed. The bearing balls are rotated by the friction force caused by the ultrasonic vibration of the stator, and transfer torque to the rotor. The dimple structure on the sliding surface can hold the ball position and rotate the balls and the rotor without a retainer. The newly proposed motor can avoid the friction loss between <b>balls</b> and the <b>retainer.</b> The <b>balls</b> of 2. 4 mm in radius are used and the radii of the curvature of the dimples of 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm are used in this research. The radius difference changes the contact condition between the balls and the dimple structure. Fundamental motor characteristics are measured and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two used {{turbopump}} mainshaft {{support bearings}} were examined to determine steps {{needed to achieve}} turbopump lifetimes of 27, 000 seconds. The two bearings, which had been run in a high pressure oxygen turbopump, are angular contact ball bearings, applied as a preloaded pair, locked to the shaft, inner race rotating, with the outer races unrestrained axially. Examination showed that both bearings had been subjected to overloads, leading to fatigue spalling on the races and <b>balls</b> and advanced <b>retainer</b> wear. This is clear evidence of unintended high internal loads in the high pressure oxygen pump which would lead to complete bearing failure and extensive secondary pump damage. Action {{must be taken to}} reduce the applied bearing loads or to incorporate bearings of sufficient size to withstand the high loads...|$|R
40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{technology}} {{allows the}} fabrication of small mechanical systems in silicon using standard micro-fabrication pro- cesses. MEMS techniques have found wide acceptance in such devices as ac- celerometers, micro-mirrors, resonators, probes, and micro-tweezers {{to name a}} few. Though small linear motions are common in MEMS applications, few devices exhibit reliable rotary motion. This work explores several methods of fabricating rotary bearings using micro-balls as the support mechanism. Micro-ball bearings have several advantages over other MEMS bearing tech- nologies in that they provide robust mechanical support, require no external control systems, and basic designs require very few fabrication steps. <b>Ball</b> cages or <b>retainers</b> are common in macro-scale bearings, providing uniform spacing between the balls. Several cage designs are proposed and explored in this work: a radial ball bearing with an integrated ball cage, a dual-row style cage, and ve unique cage geometries integrated into silicon micro-turbines (SMTs.) Also, {{an example of a}} curved or angular contact race- way is presented as an example of this type of raceway geometry in MEMS devices. Each is presented with a discussion of the design considerations and fabrication process. This is followed by a characterization of the performance of each design. These studies found that the integrated cage in the radial ball bearing performs well at speeds ranging up to 20 000 RPM. Minimal wear was ob- served after 6 hours of continuous testing. However, the solder bond in the cage was a common failure point in these devices, limiting the reliability and longevity. The dual groove style cage was designed to eliminate the solder bond. However, the higher frictional forces between the ball and the cage in this design resulted in higher losses during operation. Taking into account the higher losses and the added complexity of the design, it seems unlikely that this approach would be appropriate for further study. However, the design does represent a novel approach for releasing multi-wafer rotary structures and is presented here as example of this technique. Testing of the cage de- signs for the SMTs indicated that a full ring design (a full annulus with holes for the balls) performed the best of the 5 cage geometries. However, these devices do not perform as well as cage-less designs for high speed applications due to higher ctional forces and increased raceway wear at the interface be- tween the ball and the raceway edge. Finally, the curved raceway has shown excellent performance up to 2500 RPM with normal loads up to 40 mN in tribometer testing. SMTs with this raceway desing were also tested for over 10 million revolutions and at speeds over 70 000 RPM. The test results for all of the bearings designs presented here show that the devices exhibit stable operation at low to moderately high speeds. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Flaking {{failure of}} {{bearings}} {{is caused by}} crack growth and stress concentration. The contact conditions between <b>ball,</b> <b>retainer</b> and race affect the durability of the bearings. Non-destructive methods that {{can be related to}} contact conditions are necessary to study and understand the phenomena caused by the contact stresses. In the present work, a scanning Hall probe microscope (SHPM) equipped with a GaAs film sensor was used to observe the asymmetric distribution of three-dimensional magnetic fields in bearing steel plates (JIS-SUJ 2) before and after light load contact tests of 19. 6 N. It was found that only vertical components of the magnetic fields are slightly affected by the spherical Hertzian contact. Furthermore, the change in the three-dimensional magnetic fields is asymmetric to the contact center and magnetization center...|$|E
