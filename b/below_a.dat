5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands <b>below,</b> <b>a</b> problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E

5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped <b>below</b> <b>a</b> thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82.

It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced <b>below</b> <b>a</b> viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E

5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and {{dendritic}} cells. HIV infection leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline <b>below</b> <b>a</b> critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter.

In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere in space and time.|$|E
