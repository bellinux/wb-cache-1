5000|$|The {{escape wheel}} is {{geared to the}} watch's wheel train, which applies torque to it from the mainspring. The {{rotation}} of the escape wheel {{is controlled by the}} pallets. The escape wheel has specially shaped teeth of either ratchet or club form, which interact with the two jewels called the entrance and exit pallets. The escape wheel, except in unusual cases, has 15 teeth and is made of steel. These pallets are attached solidly to the lever, which has at its end a fork to receive the ruby impulse pin of the <b>balance</b> <b>roller</b> which is fixed to the balance wheel shaft. The balance wheel is returned towards its static center position by an attached balance spring (not shown in the diagram). In modern design it is common for the pallet mountings and the fork to be made as a single component. The lever is mounted on a shaft and is free to rotate between two fixed banking pins.|$|E
3000|$|Drilling fluids are {{designed}} to assist drilling by minimizing reservoir damage and increasing productivity of pay zone. Excess fluid loss due to degradation of additives of drilling fluids causes {{a major problem in}} real-time drilling. Usages of excess biocides are threat to the environment and cause handling problems. Effect of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, a cationic surfactant, on rheology, fluid loss and biocide has been studied in a polymer-based drilling fluid. Inhibitive polymer mud was formulated using XC polymer, shale inhibitors like KCl, K 2 SO 4 and CaCO 3 as bridging agent. Rheology and other properties were studied using Fann VG meter, API filter press, mud <b>balance,</b> <b>roller</b> oven apparatus. Dissolved oxygen meter was used to check the microbicidal property of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide. Addition of cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide increased fluid retention capacity of the fluid even at very low concentration 0.1 %(w/v) without affecting the mud properties. Also it is compatible with the commercially available fluid loss preventers like pre-gelatinized starch when used in combination. It also performed well in dissolved oxygen test, suggesting eliminating need of any other biocide to prevent degradation of bio-polymer-based drilling fluid. The dissolved oxygen test results are comparable with commercial available biocides. Thermal stability studies were carried out by using roller oven at different temperatures. It was found suitable for application in high-concentrated brine conditions and at high temperatures up to 120  °C without effecting the rheology and shear thinning property of the fluid. Bridging efficiency was investigated by analysing the mud cake using scanning electron microscope.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of printing or coating processes for paper products the velocity of the web and the roller width can be increased. However, these measures cause deformations of the rollers, heating effects and streak print defects due to undesirable oscillations. The vibration characteristic is significant for the quality and efficiency of the printing or coating processes. Approved methods like <b>balancing</b> of the <b>rollers</b> and maximizing the bending stiffness have come to technical limits. This paper describes a new promising technology for further optimization of printing and coating machines. Piezoelectric actuators are integrated in the bearings of a roller of a flexographic printing machine and generate counterforces to compensate undesired bending vibrations. Strain gauges applied on the roller measure the vibrations. A simulation model of the mechatronic overall-system has been developed to design the control strategy. The oscillations of roller systems in printing machines and other industrial applications are mainly stimulated by disturbances that occur periodically with each rotation. A feedback control strategy combined with a feed forward compensation of predictable disturbances has shown promising results in simulation and experiments. Due {{to the fact that}} the excitations of the oscillations are periodically with the rotation of rollers, another approach for vibration reduction has been developed. The forces for vibration reduction are not generated by an active mechatronic system but by passive profile rings...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division of Industrial and Economical Development, at Linköping University of Technology. The project was carried out on behalf of Fanerami AB, Mjölby and {{includes}} 20 weeks of full time schedule work. Cabinets with vertical mounted roller shutters all share the same problem, namely weight <b>balancing.</b> A <b>roller</b> shutter has an equilibrium area where the sum of the different forces acting on the shutter equals zero. As the shutter leaves that area it will pick up speed as it falls towards the bottom. When the shutter hits the bottom of the cabinet there is a potential risk of getting fingers caught and in this project a solution to prevent this from happening was to be presented. In this project, three concepts have been generated with the following different purposes: •In concept 1 the risk of getting any fingers caught when the shutter closes was to be eliminated in an efficient and inexpensive way. •In concept 2 the roller shutter had to be balanced at all time providing the possibility to keep the cabinet open in any position. •The last and most challenging task was to create a remote controlled TV cabinet. The shutters were mounted horizontally and were to be opened simply by pushing the bottom either on the remote transmitter unit or the cabinet. The first concept uses a small oil damper, often seen in kitchen cabinets and drawers. The roller shutter applies pressure on the damper via a lever that transforms the shutter motion along a certain path to a smaller motion in the direction of the damper. By doing so, a smaller damper with higher pressure can be used. Dampers are available with several different pressures and can be mounted in five different positions; therefore the concept can be adjusted to fit almost any cabinet. Concept 2 consists of a thin cord winded around a wheel. The wheel is equipped with a spring that tightens when the cord is pulled in. The spring produces an equal and opposite force that holds the shutter in balance. As the wheel is mounted in the upper front of the cabinet, underneath the shutter, it will almost be invisible. The concept is easy to adjust to most cabinets by simply attach the shutter at different levels. In that way the spring will be tightened to equal the weight of the shutter. The design of the TV cabinet has been a working progress throughout the whole project. A couple of prototypes were produced before the final concept. The mechanical solution is based on two pinion rackets placed one on each side of a rotating pinion powered by a motor through a planetary gearbox. To control the cabinet Electronic Solutions AB developed an electronic system that made it possible to open and close the shutters with a remote control or a switch on the cabinet...|$|R
