25|$|Citizens of Zwolle are colloquially {{known as}} Blauwvingers (Bluefingers). This {{dates back to}} 1682, when the StMichael's church tower collapsed. The {{authorities}} were strapped for cash and saw {{no option but to}} sell the church bells to neighbouring city Kampen. To make sure that Kampen would not make too much profit from the deal, the local authorities asked a high price for the church bells. Kampen accepted, yet after the arrival of the bells it became clear, they were too damaged to be played. In revenge, Kampen paid in copper coins of four duiten (the equivalent of two-and-a-half cents). Zwolle distrusted Kampen and wanted to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> truly paid the entire price. After the rigorous counting of this vast amount of money, their fingers had turned blue from the copper.|$|E
25|$|In 1971 a magnitude-6.6 {{earthquake}} in San Fernando caused some {{damage to the}} Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating {{from the early days}} of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked. These were some of the first reinforced concrete buildings, and their plans did not contain enough details (such as how much reinforcing bar had been embedded in the concrete) to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were safe, so the engineers recommended demolition. However, demolishing these historic structures required considerably more effort than would have been necessary had they been in real danger of collapse. A large wrecking ball was used to demolish Throop Hall, and smashing the concrete revealed massive amounts of rebar, far in excess of safety requirements. The rebar had to be cut up before the pieces could be hauled away, and the process took much longer than expected.|$|E
500|$|Banquo's {{status as}} a {{contrast}} to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play. In act two, scene one, Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ("Hold, take my sword... Take thee that too"). He also explains {{that he has been}} having trouble sleeping due to [...] "cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose!" [...] On Macbeth's approach, he demands the sword returned to him quickly. Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth's accomplice to take the throne for his own family, as the Three Witches prophesied to him. In this reading, his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> do not come true, but is so nervous at Macbeth's approach that he demands them back. Other scholars have responded that Banquo's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth. They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night. Then, when Macbeth approaches, Banquo, having had dreams about Macbeth's deeds, takes back his sword as a precaution in this case.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, considering {{that despite the}} [...] "convoluted plot" [...] the episode [...] "pays off in white-knuckle tension." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club labeled the episode as a [...] "good" [...] stand-alone story. He described it as [...] "a memorable episode, due {{in no small part}} to its humor", praising the [...] "simultaneously absurd and frightening" [...] story with scenes that make the viewer [...] "snicker even as you shudder". In addition, Handlen praised William Sanderson's performance, as well as the ending, calling it [...] "the punchline [...] of Mulder's deepest fears, a group [...] so secret that you never <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> exist at all". Starpulse named the episode the tenth best of the series, defining it as [...] "very creepy" [...] and what turned The X-Files [...] "from a mere creepfest to a show that offered real psychological thrills". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of the episode's flourishes, noting [...] "minute by minute, there is tons to enjoy." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson argue that the premise is [...] "disjointed and not a little frustrating" [...] {{due to the lack of}} overall coherence and narrative. The plot for [...] "Blood" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Fear.|$|E

2500|$|This Christian {{influence}} {{was evident in}} much of their magical praxes. For instance, the historian Owen Davies believed that the written charms supplied by cunning folk displayed the [...] "intrinsic Christian content of [...] magic" [...] {{and the influence of}} mystical and magical words taken from the Bible. Historian Ronald Hutton concurred with this assessment, remarking that [...] "Looking at the recorded charms dispensed by magical practitioners, it is obvious that many – perhaps the majority – are Christian in character. They quote from the Bible, or appeal to the Trinity, or to Jesus, or to saints. In most cases, to <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>they</b> are using the trappings and symbols of Christianity with little regard to what the churchmen would have regarded as its essence; the Bible... This is, however, a large part of what popular Christianity had always been about, and something that had caused learned and devout members of the faith to tear their hair at intervals ever since the time of the Church Fathers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Representatives from Telenor and Teleplan {{testified that}} Kristiansen's phone {{could not have}} been in the {{vicinity}} {{at the time of the}} murders. This gave Kristiansen an alibi since he was using the phone several times. Telenor found six other cell sites covering the area of the crime, but Kristiansen's phone was not connected to any of these. Instead, Kristiansen's phone was exclusively connected to a cell site called [...] "EG_A", a cell site Telenor was unable to make contact with even with the other cell sites disconnected. Even the police tried for days to make contact with [...] "EG_A", but without succeeding. Furthermore, since cell phones always connect to the strongest cell site, and cell phones rescan quite frequently to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> are continuously connected to the strongest cell site, it was clear, even if [...] "EG_A" [...] against all odds had coverage at that particular time, that Kristiansen {{could not have been}} near the crime site.|$|E
2500|$|A team of UF {{physicists}} has {{a leading}} role in one of the two major experiments planned for the Large Hadron Collider, a -long, $5 billion, super-cooled underground tunnel outside Geneva, Switzerland. [...] More than 30 university physicists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students and now undergraduates are involved in the collider's Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of its two major experiments. [...] About 10 are stationed in Geneva. [...] The group is the largest from any university in the U.S. to participate in the CMS experiment. The UF team designed and oversaw development of a major detector within the CMS. The detector, the Muon system, is intended to capture subatomic particles called muons, which are heavier cousins of electrons. Among other efforts, UF scientists analyzed about 100 of the 400 detector chambers placed within the Muon system to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were functioning properly. Scientists from the University of Florida group {{played a central role in}} the discovery of the Higgs particle. The bulk of the UF research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.|$|E

2500|$|Originally named Greenland Mountain, in {{the mid-19th}} century the {{mountain}} was renamed. Like {{the town and the}} village, Hunter takes its name from John Hunter, a somewhat despised local landlord. It is not known when the mountain was first climbed, or by whom. A popular local legend has it that Hunter, or some other later landowner, went to the summit with a hand level in order to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> had indeed purchased the Catskills' highest peak, and were satisfied until an [...] "unknown" [...] peak appeared on the southern horizon — Slide Mountain, the range's true highest peak but not identified as such until 1886 (which makes this legend unlikely to have any basis in fact, as the necessary clearing at the summit for the fire tower was made well afterwards). For a time before Arnold Henry Guyot identified Slide, either Hunter or nearby Black Dome, central peak of the Blackhead Mountains, was thought to be the range's highest, in contrast to the claims of nearby hoteliers for Kaaterskill High Peak.|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest {{granted the}} plaintiffs' motion for a {{permanent}} injunction of § 1021(b)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 in a 112-page opinion. The permanent injunction issued by Judge Forrest barred the government from relying on the defense authorization law to hold people in indefinite military detention on suspicion that they [...] "substantially supported" [...] Al Qaeda or its allies — at least if they had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Forrest held that the law's definitions of [...] "substantially supported" [...] and [...] "associated forces" [...] were unconstitutionally vague in that a reporter or activist could not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> would not be covered under the provision if they worked with a group deemed {{to be associated with}} terrorists, or perhaps circulated the message of an associated individual by printing an interview. Forrest acknowledged the importance of the government's efforts to safeguard the country from terrorism, but ruled that the law's broad language violated First Amendment right to free speech, as well as the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process that holds that a person must be able to understand what actions would subject them to penalties.|$|E
2500|$|The {{account by}} the Blackwater firm {{stated that the}} driver of the Kia sedan had kept driving toward the convoy, {{ignoring}} verbal orders, hand signals, and water bottles which were thrown at the car, and continued to approach even when fired upon. [...] An Iraqi policeman went over to the car possibly to help the passenger, but the vehicle kept moving and it looked to the guards as if the policeman was pushing it. In their view, this confirmed that they were under attack by a vehicle bomb, whereupon they fired at the car, killing both people in it as well as the Iraqi policeman. In response to the guards' killing of the Iraqi policemen, other Iraqi police officers began to fire at the Blackwater men. [...] Since insurgents in Iraq often disguise themselves by wearing police uniforms, the guards could not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> were dealing with actual police. [...] They communicated to the State Department operations center that they were under attack. A State Department employee who was walking into the department's Baghdad operations center {{on the day of the}} incident heard a radio call from the convoy: “Contact, contact, contact! We are taking fire from insurgents and Iraqi police.” According to Blackwater vice-president Marty Strong, the convoy was hit with [...] "a large explosive device" [...] and [...] "repeated small arms fire" [...] which disabled a vehicle. Several sources have stated that the explosion was caused by a mortar round, though this is not reflected in the Department of State incident report. Blackwater has denied Iraqi allegations that one of their helicopters fired from the air during the incident.|$|E
