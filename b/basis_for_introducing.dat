40|$|Glucose {{homeostasis}} {{is controlled}} by endocrine pancreatic cells, and any pancreatic disturbance can result in diabetes. Because 8 % to 12 % of diabetic pregnant women present with malformed fetuses, there is great interest in understanding the etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment of gestational diabetes. Hyperglycemia enhances the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress, which is involved in diabetic teratogenesis. It has also been suggested that maternal diabetes alters embryonic gene expression, which might cause malformations. Due to ethical issues involving human studies that sometimes have invasive aspects and the multiplicity of uncontrolled variables that can alter the uterine environment during clinical studies, {{it is necessary to}} use animal models to better understand diabetic pathophysiology. This review aimed to gather information about pathophysiological mechanisms and fetal outcomes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. To understand the pathophysiological mechanisms and factors involved in diabetes, the use of pancreatic regeneration studies is increasing in an attempt to understand the behavior of pancreatic beta cells. In addition, these studies suggest a new preventive concept as a treatment <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> diabetes, <b>introducing</b> therapeutic efforts to minimize or prevent diabetes-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, and teratogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Low {{physician}} availability {{in rural}} areas of the United States is a long-standing issue. While most research has focused upon the locational decisions of physicians to understand {{the causes of the}} problem, a relatively new and neglected research focus is the retention of rural physicians. This paper takes the perspective that integration of physicians within rural communities is the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> retention. It <b>introduces</b> concepts of self and community as a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> understanding "domains" of rural physician integration. From data collected during in-depth qualitative research in rural Kentucky, a framework of integration domains is developed. The three domains of physician self, medical community, and community-at-large are elaborated with examples from the data. To further explain the relationships among the integration domains and their value, the findings are combined with three concepts from social theory. Social capital, core participation, and community reconstruction add dynamic and meaningful aspects to the context in which integration and retention occur, and they provide a conceptual basis to use when investigating or devising actions to facilitate integration. community self integration retention social capital core participation...|$|R
40|$|Three postulates asserting the {{validity}} of conventional quantum theory, semi-classical general relativity and the statistical <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> thermodynamics are <b>introduced</b> {{as a foundation for}} the study of black hole evolution. We explain how these postulates may be implemented in a ``stretched horizon'' or membrane description of the black hole, appropriate to a distant observer. The technical analysis is illustrated in the simplified context of 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton gravity. Our postulates imply that the dissipative properties of the stretched horizon arise from a course graining of microphysical degrees of freedom that the horizon must possess. A principle of black hole complementarity is advocated. The overall viewpoint is similar to that pioneered by 't~Hooft but the detailed implementation is different.
