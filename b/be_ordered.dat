5|$|In 1861, Abdülaziz became {{sultan of}} the Ottoman Empire, and {{thereafter}} began a construction program {{to strengthen the}} Ottoman Navy, which had incurred heavy losses during the Crimean War of 18531856. The Navy ordered ironclad warships from shipyards in Britain and France, though the program was limited by the Ottoman Empire's limited finances. The Osmaniye class were the first ironclads to <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> {{as part of the}} program.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, it was {{believed}} the B-1 could be in operation before the ATB, covering the transitional period between the B-52's increasing vulnerability and the ATB's introduction.

5|$|Most {{new cars}} were sold through {{automobile}} dealerships in the 1950s, but Crosley automobiles {{were still on}} sale at any number of appliance or department stores, and Allstate (a rebadged Henry J) could <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> at any Sears and Roebuck in 1952 and 1953.

5|$|Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts (along with a {{possible}} third, to match Brazil should a third ship <b>be</b> <b>ordered)</b> and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by open tender.

5|$|All this {{economic}} power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, {{were subject to}} the state corvée system, which conscripted labor for royal projects. They could also <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> to provide supplies for some specific purposes. Harkhuf's trading expedition in the Old Kingdom was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at Deir el-Medina. Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.|$|E
5|$|Bayan, {{named after}} the bard Boyan, had to <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> in May 1898 from the French {{shipyard}} Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne-sur-Mer {{because there was no}} capacity available in Russian shipyards. The ship was laid down in February 1899 and launched on 12 June 1900. Bayan was completed in February 1903 and, under the command of Captain 1st Rank Robert Wiren, made port visits in Greece, Italy and North Africa before sailing for Kronstadt. Arriving in April 1903, she was only there for several months before departing for Port Arthur on 7 August. Together with the French-built battleship , Bayan arrived on 2 December and they were both assigned to the First Pacific Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E

5|$|RAF Fighter Command and Bomber Command {{attempted}} to warn {{all of their}} airborne units of the potential danger and bomber units were ordered to plan alternate landing sites {{in the event of}} an attack on their airfields. All bomber and fighter groups were linked by telephone and ground control passed on all details of intruder operations to pilots including height and heading when they occurred. Station Commands organised blackouts of airfields and pilots could <b>be</b> <b>ordered</b> to switch the navigation lights off at any time. Only the Mosquito groups remained active against intruders, though the majority of these units were supporting Allied operations on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another center section, adding another axle and articulation, but these plans have been {{rejected}} by the company. Such a center section would be low-floor and give much easier access for strollers and wheelchairs, and allow the whole tram network to have step-free access. As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced. No plans {{have been made}} for new trams to <b>be</b> <b>ordered.</b>|$|E
