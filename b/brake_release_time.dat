5000|$|Gladhands are {{designed}} to allow the driver to disconnect without a mechanic or tools. They sometimes utilize a quick release style to speed up <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> <b>time.</b> A tractor / trailer typically has two gladhands - one for service brakes and another for emergency brakes. Gladhands are color coded. Within the United States service lines are blue and emergency brake lines are red and are standardized by SAE J318. Where ISO standards are used, the Supply lines are Red and the Control Lines are Yellow per ISO 1728. The SAE [...] "Service" [...] lines are synonymous with the ISO [...] "Supply" [...] lines and the [...] "Emergency" [...] lines are synonymous with ISO [...] "Control" [...] lines ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} various {{methods of}} the energy efficient use of medium and high payload industrial robots. Approaches and according savings potential are evaluated for methods like intelligent <b>brake</b> management - <b>release</b> <b>time</b> and power reduction, the temporal storage of the robot’s kinetic energy with capacitive energy buffer of controller’s DCBus, the energy exchange among robot controllers is proposed. Strategic usage alternatives like robot choice, shutdown during the production-free time and setting into a particular standby mode are compared. The energy saving potentials per each method are estimated according to real body-shop production characteristics...|$|R

50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>release</b> {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and <b>releases</b> the <b>brakes</b> to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|R
50|$|Landing {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} as it lands at the destination. This is the <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> weight minus the trip fuel burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and reserve fuel.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} aircraft takeoff performance from <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> to air-phase height that requires fewer tests than conventionally required {{is evaluated with}} data for the XB- 70 airplane. The method defines the effects of pilot technique on takeoff performance quantitatively, including the decrease in acceleration from drag due to lift. For a given takeoff weight and throttle setting, a single takeoff provides enough data to establish a standardizing relationship for the distance from <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> to any point where velocity is appropriate to rotation. The lower rotation rates penalized takeoff performance in terms of ground roll distance; the lowest observed rotation rate required a ground roll distance that was 19 percent longer than the highest. Rotations at the minimum rate also resulted in lift-off velocities that were approximately 5 knots lower than the highest rotation rate at any given lift-off distance...|$|R

50|$|Engine {{failure on}} {{take-off}} (EFTO) is a situation, when flying an aircraft, where an engine has failed, {{or is not}} delivering sufficient power, at any <b>time</b> between <b>brake</b> <b>release</b> and the wheels leaving the ground / V2. The phases of flight are de-lineated to allow simplified standard procedures for different aircraft types to be developed. If an aircraft suffered engine failure on takeoff, the standard procedure for most aircraft would be to abort the takeoff.|$|R

50|$|The {{main part}} of the set up is the winding motor which is driven by the dc motor. Two double deck cages are {{attached}} to the two ends of the winding rope. At the start of the winding cycle, power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>released.</b> The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of 6 m/s until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake.|$|R
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the parking <b>brake</b> cylinders to <b>release</b> the parking <b>brake,</b> or <b>release</b> the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the parking <b>brake</b> being <b>released</b> if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the parking <b>brake</b> to be <b>released,</b> or the <b>brake</b> shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{train braking}} systems use {{pneumatic}} valves {{to control and}} generate brake applications on the cars {{along the length of}} the train. In general, this conventional system consists of a brake pipe that runs the length of the train which supplies air to reservoirs mounted on each of the cars. When the brake pipe and car components are charged with air, the <b>brakes</b> <b>release.</b> When the engineer needs to make a brake application, control valves in the locomotive reduce the brake pipe pressure. As the brake pipe pressure reduces, the service portion on each car divert air from their reservoirs to their <b>brake</b> cylinders. To <b>release</b> the <b>brakes,</b> the engineer charges the brake pipe. This method of controlling the brakes on freight and passenger cars has been virtually the same since its invention by George Westinghouse in 1868.|$|R
