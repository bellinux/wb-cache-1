5000|$|The Bottle Rack (also called <b>Bottle</b> <b>Dryer</b> or Hedgehog) (Egouttoir or Porte-bouteilles or Hérisson) is an artwork {{created in}} 1914 by Dada artist Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp labeled the piece a [...] "readymade", a term {{he used to}} {{describe}} his collection of ordinary, manufactured objects not commonly associated with art. The readymades {{did not have the}} serious tone of European Dada works, which criticized the violence of World War I, and instead focused on a more nonsensical nature, chosen purely {{on the basis of a}} [...] "visual indifference".|$|E
40|$|Volatile-bearing {{minerals}} (e. g., Fe-oxyhydroxides, phyllosilicates, carbonates, and sulfates) may {{be important}} phases {{on the surface of}} Mars. In order to characterize these potential phases the Thermal Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA), which was onboard the Mars Polar Lander, was to have performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and evolved-gas analysis of soil samples collected from the surface. The sample chamber in TEGA operates at about 100 mbar (approximately 76 torr) with a N 2, carrier gas flow of 0. 4 seem. Essentially, no information exists on the effects of reduced pressure on the thermal properties of volatile-bearing minerals. In support of TEGA, we have constructed a laboratory analog for TEGA from commercial instrumentation. We connected together a commercial differential scanning calorimeter, a quadruple mass spectrometer, a vacuum pump, digital pressure gauge, electronic mass flow meter, gas "K" <b>bottles,</b> gas <b>dryers,</b> and high and low pressure regulators using a collection of shut off and needle valves. Our arrangement allows us to vary and control the pressure and carrier gas flow rate inside the calorimeter oven chamber...|$|R
