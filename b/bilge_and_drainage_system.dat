40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the nature a of monsoonic climate affecting the irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> activities. It {{has been established}} that in a monsoonic climate both irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> are needed for potential agricultural crop production. In the past the irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> have been designed, installed and managed independently by different agencies. But, for the efficient performance of irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> their integration is necessary. Four different aspects (1) Land development for receiving irrigation water <b>and</b> releasing <b>drainage</b> water; (2) Design of irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> components; (3) Operational aspects of irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> (4) Institutional aspects of irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> management were identified for the integration of irrigation <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
