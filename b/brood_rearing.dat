25|$|Colonies {{are often}} {{founded by a}} group of L. vechti females using what is known as {{associative}} foundation. They begin by constructing small nests in the center, and eventually other wasps join the colony and build nests around the initial central one. The nests last for multiple years, and colonies grow and contain up to 600 nests or more. Temperature does not play a serious limiting factor in the lives of these wasps, and there is no particular season during which the colonies of these wasps are not present and active. However, <b>brood</b> <b>rearing</b> and reproduction is more likely to occur during the dry season, and the population of the nest tends to increase during that time as well, although <b>brood</b> <b>rearing</b> and reproduction also occurs during the wet season.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for <b>brood</b> <b>rearing.</b> In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.|$|E

40|$|Although most (> 90 %) {{species of}} birds have biparental care, {{little is known about}} the {{consequences}} of such care for offspring behaviour and fitness-related traits. We examined the effect of biparental care on chick growth and begging behaviour in zebra finches, by comparing biparental broods with uniparental broods in which the male parent was removed and the brood size halved to control for potential parental workload. Differences in patterns of growth and begging behaviour between treatments therefore resulted from the difference in (1) the number of parents providing care and/or (2) the number of chicks per brood. Collaborating parents did not appear to act in concert and fed chicks independently of each other's feeding bouts. <b>Broods</b> <b>reared</b> by two parents were fed more frequently than those fed by one, and because biparental feeding bouts were less predictably spaced in time with less food available for each chick per feeding bout, competition was greater than in <b>broods</b> <b>reared</b> by single parents. Furthermore, chicks in biparental broods sustained an additional cost of begging: they had to beg almost twice as hard as chicks reared by single parents to receive a given amount of food, and they received less food per chick. Despite these effects, they grew faster. Growth rate may depend not just on the amount of food available but also on the frequency and predictability with which it is delivered, and, in particular, it reflects an adaptive response to competition for the available resources...|$|R

50|$|The annual cycle differs {{slightly}} for eusocial and solitary bees, {{in terms}} of the number of worker bees and foundresses that are born in the broods. For example, in solitary populations, the females’ first <b>brood</b> <b>rears</b> 40% females who are all able to mate before the next hibernation season. However, in eusocial populations, the emergence from hibernation occurs about a month earlier, and results in a brood with mostly worker females. Nesting for solitary populations begins between May and June. The absence of a brood of female workers defines this nest type as solitary, so solitary populations produce only one reproductive brood that is provisioned by a gyne. The emergence of this brood is at approximately the same time as the emergence of the second brood in the social colony cycle. Upon emergency, the offspring mate and then females enter hibernation away from the nesting site. As in social colonies, the males and nest foundresses die at the end of the season.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Empirical {{evidence}} is growing that the off-spring sex ratio in birds can be biased {{in relation to}} the body condition of parents during breeding. The sex ratio bias may come about because (1) the actual production of the two sexes may be skewed and/or (2) there may be a sex bias in early nestling mortality contingent on pa-rental condition. By manipulating parental condition and giving them a control <b>brood</b> to <b>rear,</b> thereby eliminating effects operating via the eggs, we examined the extent to which parental condition influences the post-hatching survival of male and female lesser black-backed gulls, Larus fuscus. We found that the pre-fledging survival of male chicks was strongly reduced in all-male <b>broods</b> <b>reared</b> by parents in poor condition. Pre-fledging surviv-al of female chicks was, however, unaffected by parental condition or brood sex composition. Thus, independently of any production biases, sex differences in nestling mortality alone can bias the offspring sex ratio at fledg-ing {{in relation to the}} prevailing rearing conditions. In other studies on gulls we have, however, also shown that females in poor condition at laying preferentially pro-duce female eggs. Clearly a bias in fledging sex ratio can occur within the same species due to a combination of differential production and differential post-laying mor-tality; the latter can involve a differential effect of poor egg quality on male and female offspring, differential ef-fects of brood sex composition on their survival and a difference in the capacity of parents to rear males and fe-males. All of these processes need to be taken into ac-count in attempting to understand offspring sex ratios...|$|R

50|$|Breeding {{occurs during}} the summer wet season, but its {{initiation}} is very varied {{and the number of}} <b>broods</b> <b>reared</b> depends on the consistency of rainfall. The breeding system of the southern black tit has been intensively studied and is often regarded as a classic example of the differences in breeding strategies between warm regions with unpredictable rainfall and cold regions with severe winters. Unlike the great tit or blue tit which can provision up to twenty-five nestlings per year in unassisted pairs, the southern black tit, living on a much poorer food supply, can as an unassisted pair seldom provision even one nestling in a breeding season. As a result, most males must stay in the parental territory for several years to help rear the usually three nestlings that each breeding female produces under favourable conditions. An interesting feature of the southern black tit is that the breeding female, who incubates continuously during the fifteen days of incubation and is fed by her mate and the helpers, will mimic venomous snakes when she feels threatened to prevent depredation of the nest.|$|R

2500|$|The nest, {{consisting}} of a single comb, {{is the heart of}} the colony, where [...] food is stored and the immature <b>brood</b> <b>reared.</b> It is also the central spatial reference where the majority of individuals spend their time. P. dominula does not occupy the comb in random distribution. Each wasp spends the majority of its time on the comb in a relatively small area, around 12% of the comb. This small use of space is the norm, regardless of the number of wasps on the nest. However, this area could occasionally cover up to 50% of the comb. Dominant females occupy a smaller area than do subordinate foundresses and workers. Superimposition rates are low, which suggests that wasps limit each other's spaces. Workers prefer to overlap areas with other workers, while foundresses prefer to overlap areas with other foundresses. Around 70% of workers are active and occupy a small area of the comb, while the rest do not have particular fidelity areas and spend most of their time away from the nest or remaining motionless behind the nest. Alpha females are affected by cell content, resting more frequently on capped cells and avoiding empty ones.|$|R

Although there is a significant increase in productivity as the number of foundresses increase, the per capita productivity does not increase as a function of group size.
