25|$|When he {{returned}} to France, Cartier-Bresson applied for a job with renowned French film director Jean Renoir. He acted in Renoir's 1936 film Partie de campagne and in the 1939 La Règle du jeu, for which he played a butler and served as second assistant. Renoir made Cartier-Bresson act so he could understand {{how it felt to}} <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the camera. Cartier-Bresson also helped Renoir make a film for the Communist party on the 200 families, including his own, who ran France. During the Spanish civil war, Cartier-Bresson co-directed an anti-fascist film with Herbert Kline, to promote the Republican medical services.|$|E
25|$|Brockie {{was killed}} at Ypres in 1915, but a {{simmering}} controversy broke out between Churchill and Haldane {{until his death}} in 1950 as to the exact events of that night. Haldane claimed that the party had again agreed to defer their escape, but that Churchill had then gone over the wall by himself. Churchill's account describes him waiting behind the wall {{for more than an hour}} for the others to join him, and then a discussion between them through the wall, where the others told him the sentry was suspicious and they could not escape. Haldane agreed a conversation took place, but not how Churchill had come to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the wall while they had not.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally a boat is {{organized}} so that alternate rowers row on {{port and starboard}} (or strokeside and bowside), with stroke on port side (having their blade to their own right) (strokeside). This is sometimes reversed, so that stroke {{is on the other}} side (having their blade to their own left); such a boat is usually described as 'bow rigged'. This is often on the basis of the abilities of the available personnel, to allow putting an experienced starboard side (bowside) rower in the stroke seat, for example but it is the norm for UK coastal rowers where racing is done clockwise around buoys. The eight in the illustration at the top of this article is rigged strokeside. If the eight were bow rigged, the oar for the stroke (number 8) rower would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the boat (bowside/starboard).|$|E

500|$|Betty was the longest-serving barmaid of the soap's public house, The Rovers Return. She first served {{behind the}} bar in 1969 and had been shown to work there for 42 years, as of 2011. There have been brief breaks however, as storylines {{have led to the}} {{character}} being fired or quitting her post. She was fired by Annie Walker (Doris Speed), who accused her of theft, and she quit her post in 1995 when Jack (Bill Tarmey) and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) took over as landlords. In the summer of 2009, Betty was sacked again temporarily by manager Poppy Morales. A Coronation Street insider reassured The Sun that Betty was not being written out of the show, however, stating: [...] "She’ll be here {{for a long time to}} come – she’ll just <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the bar for a change". In a storyline that aired in February 2010, Betty – at 90 years old – was named Manchester's Oldest Barmaid. In a plot twist, a 91-year-old rival came forward, resulting in Betty fearing she killed her, when the rival consumes a two-month-old hotpot.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well <b>be.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

Vorse is mentioned again in the squadron history on 12 January, when VF-80 flew a record 144 sorties and sunk an estimated 51,000 tons worth of escorts, oilers and merchant vessels.

2500|$|After their meeting, Fertility calls Tender {{thinking}} she {{has called the}} crisis hotline. [...] Tender soon realizes it's Fertility, so he begins {{to talk to her}} in a fake voice. Because it is revealed later that Fertility is psychic and knows [...] "everything", it is understood that she knows at this point that she is speaking to Tender. She talks about her brother's suicide and how she met Tender ("a pretty weird guy") at the mausoleum, mentioning how he reminded her of a Creedish cult member, and adding that he was extremely unattractive and she believed him to be Trevor's ex-homosexual lover. Eventually, she asks the man at the [...] "crisis hotline" [...] (i.e. Tender) to have phone sex with her, but he hangs up after turning her down. He then stops answering his phone in fear that Fertility will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> line, wanting to have phone sex or growing more attracted to him as a mysterious voice than as a person.|$|E

I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
