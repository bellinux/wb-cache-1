25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, <b>bus</b> <b>unit,</b> instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), LCC (leadless chip carrier) and PGA (pin grid array) packages.|$|E

50|$|Bus fares are {{pre-paid}} {{by means}} of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the <b>bus</b> <b>unit.</b> The interurban lines have differential fares and some allow payment in cash only.

5000|$|According to Atty. Omar Mayo, lawyer {{of the bus}} company, {{he claimed}} that Joanna Jesh Transport did not violate any {{franchise}} laws. Mayo disputed and questioned the suspension and the so-called [...] "use of illegal and unauthorized business name" [...] as a sanction against the company. This evidence was supported by QCPD Traffic Sector Police Officer 2 Renato Sunga. According to Sunga, as based on the investigation, the Commuters <b>Bus</b> <b>unit</b> {{was responsible for the}} traffic violation because the driver stopped the bus outside the loading/unloading bay to load/unload the passengers.|$|E
50|$|CEM Trans has put up also a bad {{image of}} their employees, {{especially}} their bus conductors. In {{an article on}} People's Tonight last May 12, 2009, a bus conductor aboarding CEM Trans with bus no. 9114-47 (which means 47 animated roadrunners) plying Alabang-Malanday route had allegedly disrespected a disabled passenger. The conductor charged that passenger a PHP30.00 ticket, though the fare must be discounted because the passenger is actually disabled, resulting to a unanimous debate between the two. Glicerio Cabigayan, the conductor aboarding the said <b>bus</b> <b>unit,</b> was given expulsion by the operator Crisinciano E. Mahilac {{as a result of}} his grievance against the passenger.|$|E

50|$|The Pentium OverDrive is {{a heavily}} modified, 3.3 volt Pentium P54 core {{manufactured}} on 0.6 micrometer technology. It is {{fitted with a}} 486-compatible <b>bus</b> <b>unit</b> (though with an increased pin-count), an integrated heatsink and fan, and 32 kB of level 1 cache, double the 16 kB offered on regular P54C chips. As the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width, per-clock performance was much {{lower than that of}} a 'regular' Pentium, though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the Pentium's architectural improvements, such as the much improved FPU. It was also equipped with an integrated 3.3 volt power regulator as many 486 motherboards only provided 5 volt power.|$|E
50|$|LituanicaSAT-2 is {{commanded}} by NanoAvionics SatBus 3C1 {{which is a}} main system <b>bus</b> <b>unit</b> based on high-performance, low power consumption STM ARM Cortex 32 bit architecture that integrates 3 in 1 functionality on a single board.The propulsion sub-system {{is designed to provide}} 0.3N thrust and up to 200 m/s of delta V. The fuel used is a contemporary green monopropellant fuel blend based on ADN. It gives 252s of Isp, has a density of 1.24 g/cm3 with a chamber temperature of 1600 °C. Key fuel selection factors were non-toxicity, stability and benign handling properties at the same time giving very similar or even better performance as a worldwide proven hydrazine monopropellants. Current TRL is at level 5/6.|$|E
50|$|Core Duo {{contains}} 151 million transistors, {{including the}} shared 2 MB L2 cache. Yonah's execution core contains a 12-stage pipeline, forecast to eventually {{be able to}} run at a maximum frequency of 2.33 - 2.50 GHz. The communication between the L2 cache and both execution cores is handled by a <b>bus</b> <b>unit</b> controller through arbitration, which reduces cache coherency traffic over the FSB, at the expense of raising the core-to-L2 latency from 10 clock cycles (in the Dothan Pentium M) to 14 clock cycles. The increase in clock frequency offsets the impact of the increased clock cycle latency. The power management components of the core features improved grained thermal control, as well as independent scaling of power between the two cores, resulting in very efficient management of power.|$|E
50|$|The company started {{replacing}} its aging fleet with {{brand new}} units which started {{to arrive in}} 2014, {{with the arrival of}} 5 new Sunlong <b>Bus</b> <b>units</b> and followed by several others.|$|R

But the company {{decided to change}} these units into all ordinary buses when the company bought two ordinary Daewoo buses, and later, 14 UD Nissan Diesel and 4 Hino ordinary units (in addition with its only one Japayuki unit, which was converted into ordinary). There were additional 10 <b>bus</b> <b>units</b> (UD Nissan Diesel and Hino) which were named as Amtrak Transport Inc.

50|$|In {{order to}} regain losses after the strike, {{the company had}} to sell many of its assets, {{including}} <b>bus</b> <b>units,</b> franchises, and real properties. Its area of coverage was narrowed, since the company {{had to give up}} in favor of other players some of its routes.|$|R
