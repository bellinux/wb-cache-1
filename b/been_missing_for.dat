5|$|On 20 June, Company C, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry (C/2-503) {{discovered}} {{the bodies of}} a Special Forces CIDG unit that had <b>been</b> <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> four days on Hill 1338, the dominant hill mass south of Dak To. Supported by A/2-503, the Americans moved {{up the hill and}} set up for the night. At 06:58 the following morning, Alpha Company began moving alone up a ridge finger and triggered an ambush by the 6th Battalion of the 24th PAVN Regiment. Charlie Company was ordered to support, but heavy vegetation and difficult terrain made movement extremely difficult. Artillery support was rendered ineffective by the limited range of visibility. Close air support was impossible for the same reasons. Alpha Company managed to survive repeated attacks throughout the day and night, but the cost was heavy. Of the 137 men that comprised the unit, 76 had been killed and another 23 wounded. A search of the battlefield revealed only 15 dead North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has <b>been</b> <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} its last album, in November 2008, Guns N' Roses {{released}} Chinese Democracy exclusively via the electronics retailer Best Buy. Rose did {{not contribute to the}} album's promotion; by December, he had reportedly <b>been</b> <b>missing</b> <b>for</b> at least two months and had not returned phone calls or other requests from his record label. In a subsequent interview, Rose stated that he felt he had not received the necessary support from Interscope Records. A year after the album's release, in December 2009, Guns N' Roses embarked on another two-and-a-half years of touring, including a headlining performance at Rock in Rio 4. Rose was subsequently sued by former band manager Irving Azoff, who sought $1.87million in unpaid fees related to the tour. In a countersuit, Rose alleged Azoff had deliberately mismanaged the band and their album's promotion to force him to join his former bandmates for a reunion tour. Both cases were settled. According to Rose in 2011, part of the settlement agreement dictated that Rose and the current Guns N' Roses had to do a number of performances with Azoff's company Live Nation as the promoter.|$|E
