50|$|A notable recent {{development}} in LCD technology is dynamic contrast (DC), also called advanced contrast ratio (ACR) {{and various other}} designations. When {{there is a need}} to display a dark image, a display that supports dynamic contrast underpowers the <b>backlight</b> <b>lamp</b> (or decreases the aperture of the projector's lens using an iris), but proportionately amplifies the transmission through the LCD panel; this gives the benefit of realizing the potential static contrast ratio of the LCD panel in dark scenes when the image is watched in a dark room. The drawback is that if a dark scene contains small areas of superbright light, the resulting image will be over exposed.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{portable}} computing {{devices such}} as notebook computers, palm-size PCs, PDAs (Personal Data Assistants) and even cell phones are equipped with color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays) {{as well as a}} high-performance CPU and a high-bandwidth, large-capacity mem-ory system as a demand on multi-media applications and quality graphical user interfaces increases. Despite the limited power available in a battery-operated mobile embedded system, a quality LCD system is now the default configuration for hand-held embedded systems. It is composed of a high-resolution (i. e. 640 × 480 pixels or above) and high-color (i. e. 16 bits per pixel or higher) LCD panel, a high-wattage <b>backlight</b> <b>lamp</b> and a large-capacity frame buffer memory. These display components lead to the high power consumption although they become much more energy-efficient than before thanks to previous component-level power optimizations. The energy reduction for the display technology is still immature al...|$|E
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 1990s, with the {{succession}} of technologies in the field of televisions, SAES Getters, sensing the importance of new market developments, expanded its own field of production and focused on technologies widespread in the flat display sector, in particular, mercury dispensers for <b>backlight</b> <b>lamps</b> for LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) for monitors and televisions.|$|R
5000|$|The FE {{series was}} {{designed}} as an entertainment notebook that is suitably portable. The FE series includes FE11, FE21, FE28, FE31, FE41 and FE48 models. They possess various types of a 15.4" [...] 1280x800 X-Black screen either {{with one or two}} <b>backlight</b> <b>lamps.</b> It is not widely known that the type and quality of the LCD matrix has also widely varied. The FE11 (and supposedly FE21) series has a rare type of a 72% TrueColor screen whose colour reproduction quality makes it suitable for graphics applications. FE31 series possesses a low quality screen whose colour reproduction is of the market average level at best. Some improvements have been made to the FE41 series screens, which have become better but do not reach the FE11 screen quality.|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, white {{light-emitting}} diodes (WLEDs) have attracted significant interest for solid-state illumination {{due to their}} low power consumption, long operating time, and environmental benefits [1 – 3]. Hence, WLEDs are the most promising alternatives to replace conventional light sources, such as <b>backlighting,</b> interior <b>lamps,</b> and general lightings [4]. Currently, the prevailing method {{is to use a}} blue LED coated with a yellow-emitting phosphor. However, during a long period of optical pumping, the degradation of the phosphor would decline the output efficiency of the WLEDs. Another way to obtain white light is to mix the emissions from different light sources [5]. In particular, InGaN with a continuously variable bandgap from 0.7 to 3.4 eV has attracted considerable interest, and thus, InGaN/GaN WLEDs are regarded as the most promising solid-state lighting device which can work in the whole visible and part of the near UV spectral regions [6]. Some groups have fabricated dichromatic InGaN-based WLEDs [7]. However, compared with WLEDs with a mixture of blue, green and red emissions, they had lower color rendering index.|$|R
40|$|Comparing {{with the}} {{conventional}} CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent <b>Lamp)</b> <b>backlight,</b> three-basic-color LEDs backlight has some advantages such as good color reproduction, long life and lead free etc. Theoretically, the color gamut {{is determined by}} x, y coordinates of the three basic colors in CIE chromaticity diagram, and the x, y coordinates of each basic color can derived from the relative spectrum distribution (RSD) of the LED. In this paper, the red, green and blue LEDs' RSD models are established to calculate and analyze the color gamut of a backlight. By simulating those models, the relationships that the color gamut of a LED backlight varies with each color are analyzed, and the optimum combination of three colors is obtained within the given wavelengths ranges. Moreover, the combinations of three colors for the gamut of 115 % NTSC and 110 % NTSC are plotted in pictures, respectively. SPIE.; Chinese Opt Soc...|$|R
40|$|A reduced-thickness backlighter for an autostereoscopic {{display is}} {{disclosed}} having a lightguide {{and at least}} one light source parallel to an edge of the lightguide so as to be substantially coplanar with the lightguide. The lightguide is provided with a first surface which has a plurality of reflective linear regions, such as elongated grooves or glossy lines, parallel to the illuminated edge of the lightguide. Preferably the lightguide further has a second surface which has a plurality of lenticular lenses for reimaging the reflected light from the linear regions into a series of thin vertical lines outside the guide. Because of the reduced thickness of the backlighter system, autostereoscopic viewing is enabled in applications requiring thin backlighter systems. In addition to taking up less space, the reduced-thickness <b>backlighter</b> uses less <b>lamps</b> and less power. For accommodating 2 -D applications, a 2 -D diffuser plate or a 2 -D lightguide parallel to the 3 -D backlighter is disclosed for switching back and forth between 3 -D viewing and 2 -D viewing...|$|R
40|$|Backlight {{application}} {{specializes in}} supplying light, with notable examples including {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD), hand-phone LCD, and PDA LCD. The integrated process capability and integrated process yield for cold cathode fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>backlight</b> are unknown. Process capability analysis is a highly effective means of assessing the process ability of backlight that meets specifications. A larger process capability index (PCI) implies a higher process yield, and lower expected process loss. Chen et al. [Int. J. Product. Res. 39 (2001) 4077], applied indices Cpu, Cpl, and Cpk to evaluate the integrated process capability for a multi-process product with smaller-the-better, larger-the-better, and nominal-the-best specifications, respectively. However, Cpk suffers from the weakness of being unable to reflect the specific process yield. This study selects index Cps to replace Cpk. Meanwhile, an integrated PCI for the entire backlight module is proposed, {{and the relationship between}} the PCI and process yield is described. A multi-process capability analysis chart, which reasonably accurately indicates the status of process capability for the backlight module, is designed for practical applications...|$|R
25|$|Jepsen has {{described}} {{the removal of the}} filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens at the time used cold cathode fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>backlights</b> which were fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, required a high voltage power supply, were relatively power-hungry, and accounted for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.|$|R
50|$|Personal {{computing}} can fulfill individual needs, {{but that}} fulfillment may {{come at a}} cost to society as well, especially in terms of environmental impact, although this impact differs between desktop computers and laptops. Toxic chemicals found in some computer hardware include lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, plastic (PVC), and barium. Overall, a computer is about 17% lead, copper, zinc, mercury, and cadmium; 23% is plastic, 14% is aluminum, and 20% is iron. Lead is found in a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, and on all of the printed circuit boards and most expansion cards. Mercury may be present in an LCD screen's fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>backlight.</b> Plastic is found mostly in the housing of the computation and display circuitry. While daily end-users are not exposed to these toxic elements, the danger arises during the computer recycling process, which involves manually breaking down hardware and leads to the exposure of a measurable amount of lead or mercury. A measurable amount of lead or mercury can easily cause serious brain damage or ruin drinking water supplies. Computer recycling is best handled by the electronic waste (e-waste) industry, and kept segregated from the general community dump.|$|R
40|$|An LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a {{standard}} display device for hand-held embedded systems. Today, color TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) LCDs are common even in cost-effective equipments. An LCD display system is composed of an LCD panel, a frame buffer memory, an LCD and frame buffer controller, and a <b>backlight</b> inverter and <b>lamp.</b> All of them are heavy power consumers, and their portion becomes much more dominant when running interactive applications. This is because interactive applications are often triggered by human inputs and thus result {{in a lot of}} slack time in the CPU and memory system, which can be effectively used for dynamic power management. In this paper, we introduce low-power LCD display schemes as a system-level approach. We accurately characterize the energy consumption at the component level and minimize energy consumption of each component without appreciable display quality degradation. We develop several techniques such as variable-duty-ratio refresh, dynamic-color-depth control and backlight luminance dimming with brightness compensation or contrast enhancement. Each method exhibits power reduction of 260 mW, 250 mW and 480 mW, respectively. The aggregate energy reduction ratio is 28 % out of total energy consumption including the CPU and the main memory system when we execute a document viewer. We also demonstrate that we can extend the battery life about 38 % and 20 % for a text editor and an MPEG 4 player, respectively...|$|R
