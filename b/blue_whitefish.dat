40|$|Identification of ecologically {{mediated}} {{mechanisms that}} drive population dynamical changes in fish communities and polymorphic fish stocks {{such as those}} of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, requires data that are seldom available in freshwater systems. We assessed the stock of each morphologically distinguishable whitefish form (native lesser sparsely-rakered whitefish, native <b>blue</b> <b>whitefish</b> and stocked northern densely-rakered whitefish) in the Lake Oulujärvi during 1973 – 2014, and related temporal variations in population dynamics to environmental data and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) data on other species having fisheries significance. The results demonstrated a synchronous major decline in the abundance of the native whitefish forms and a decline in the length-at-age of all forms. During the study period, summer time water temperature increased and surface water phosphorous concentration decreased. Recruitment in all whitefish forms showed Ricker-type dependence on spawning stock biomass but little residual correlation with the environmental parameters. Cross-correlation analyses suggested that the re-establishment of pikeperch Sander lucioperca population affected negatively both the recruitment and biomass of whitefish but the exact effect mechanisms require further assessment. Our results exemplify that ecosystem-based fisheries management in inland waters must take into account both natural and human-induced environmental changes as well as stockings, and that knowledge-based inland fisheries management is inherently data-intensive...|$|E
