These materials {{are commonly used}} as cathodes in non-aqueous electrolyte lithium batteries. The main aim of the work was {{to determine how the}} electroreduction/oxidation {{behavior of}} these materials in aqueous LiOH compares with that reported in the literature in non-aqueous electrolytes in connection with lithium batteries. An objective was to establish whether these materials could also be used to develop other battery systems using aqueous LiOH as electrolyte. The electrochemical characteristics of the above materials were investigated by subjecting them to slow scan cyclic voltammetry and determining the charge/discharge characteristics of Zn/cathode material-aqueous LiOH batteries. The products of electroreduction/oxidation were characterized by physical techniques using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron micrography (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and infra-red spectrometry (IR). The reduction of gamma-MnO 2 (EMD) in aqueous lithium hydroxide electrolyte is found to result in intercalation of Li+ into the host structure of gamma-MnO 2. The process was found to be reversible for many cycles. This is similar to what is known to occur for gamma-MnO 2 in non-aqueous electrolytes. The mechanism, however, differs from that for reduction/oxidation of gamma-MnO 2 in aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. KOH electrolyte is used in the state-of-art aqueous alkaline Zn/MnO 2 batteries. Alkaline batteries based on aqueous KOH as the electrolyte rely upon a mechanism other than K+ intercalation into MnO 2. This mechanism is not reversible. This is explained in terms of the relative ionic sizes of Li+ and K+. The lithium-intercalated MnO 2 lattice is stable because Li+ and Mn 4 + are of approximately the same size and hence Li+ is accommodated nicely into the host lattice of MnO 2. The K+ ion which has almost double the size of Li+ cannot be appropriately accommodated into the host structure and hence the K+ -intercalated MnO 2 phase is not stable. Chemically prepared <b>battery</b> <b>grade</b> MnO 2 (BGM) is found to undergo electroreduction/oxidation in aqueous LiOH via the same Li+ intercalation mechanism as for the EMD. While the Zn/BGM- aqueous LiOH cell discharges at a voltage higher than that for the Zn/EMD- aqueous LiOH cell under similar conditions, the rechargeability and the material utilization of the BGM cell is poorer. The cathodic behavior of TiO 2 (anatase phase) in the presence of aqueous LiOH is not reversible. In addition to LiTiO 2, Ti 2 O 3 is also formed. The discharge voltage of the Zn/TiO 2 - aqueous LiOH cell and material utilization of the TiO 2 as cathode are very low. Hence TiO 2 is not suitable for use in any aqueous LiOH electrolyte battery. LiFePO 4 (olivine-type structure) as a cathode undergoes electrooxidation in aqueous LiOH forming FePO 4. However the subsequent reduction forms not only the original LiFePO 4 but also Fe 3 O 4. Thus the process is not completely reversible and hence LiFePO 4 is not a suitable material for use as a cathode in aqueous battery systems. LiMnPO 4 (olivine-type structure) undergoes reversible electrooxidation in aqueous LiOH forming MnPO 4. The charge/discharge voltage profile of the Zn/MnPO 4 -aqueous LiOH cell, its coulombic efficiency and rechargeability are comparable to that of the cell using gamma-MnO 2. EMD and LiMnPO 4 both have the potential for use in rechargeable batteries using aqueous LiOH as the electrolyte. Recommendations for further developmental work for such batteries are made...|$|E

Sri Lanka has been well known for processing a variety of economically useful vein type graphite, which are mainly being exported as cheap raw materials but played a main role in modern manufacturing industry internationally. Natural graphite (NG) is an attractive material for Li-ion batteries (LIB) because of its high capacity (372 mAh/g) and low working voltage yields with high energy density (Wh/kg). Introducing performance enhanced cheaper NG electrodes for LIB will definitely reduce their cost and improve the capacity. The objective of the research is to introduce cost effective, time saving, highly economical and more convenient method to convert Sri Lankan vein graphite directly in to the <b>battery</b> <b>grade</b> anode material for Li-ion batteries. Powdered natural graphite sample was treated with mixture of HF, HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 acids at 120 0 C till the evaporation of mixture.

One of the major themes of this program {{is the development of}} highly capable small satellites, generally referred to as 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 LightSats, 2 ̆ 2 which can perform selected defense missions at relatively low cost. A key element of the programmatic approach is the utilization of commercial grade parts and practices where practical, as opposed to the much more conservative aerospace grade parts. ASTP has incorporated commercial <b>grade</b> <b>batteries</b> into its first generation LightSats; however, an attempt has been made to study the trade-offs and design considerations to optimally employ these batteries on small satellites. For certain applications, particularly for small relatively inexpensive satellites, commercial grade cells may be a viable alternative to aerospace cells. Differences between aerospace and commercial grade cells range from physical construction and technology incorporated, to the level of quality control in manufacturing. These differences are reflected in both greater cost and increased lead time for the aerospace cells. Our research and experience suggest that certain manufacturing technologies are preferable when considering commercial cells for space applications. Once the cell type is chosen, candidate cells must be thoroughly screened to insure survival and acceptable performance in the space environment. To insure optimal performance, cells should be rigorously matched in electrical characteristics when forming batteries. Test procedures should be tailored to fit the application in order to yield the best performance in a specific physical, electrical, and operational environment.

40|$|Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is {{a method}} for {{treating}} diseases like Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and various other movement disorders. An Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) {{is placed in the}} chest and wires are run through the neck to provide electrical pulses to a certain target in the brain via an electrode. Results with this treatment are good but today’s stimulators are bulky and last only three to five years. Furthermore the electrode and pulse generator are often placed in two different surgeries. The device should be miniaturized {{so that it can be}} placed in the skull while inserting the electrode. This reduces the number of placement surgeries and eliminates lead failures. The size of the device is dominated by the battery volume, however no compromises on battery life can be made since battery replacement requires, again, surgery. Switching to a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery that can be recharged through the skin is a way to reduce battery size without compromising the lifetime of the device. Lithium-Ion batteries are, however, delicate devices and should be charged and discharged with care. The classic method to ensuring safe charging of these types of batteries is the Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) method. Here a fixed current is pushed into the battery until the battery reaches its maximum voltage. After this the voltage is kept constant and the current slowly decreases to a small fraction of the initial current. Although this method ensures safe and complete charging of Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries it also has some downsides. The abrupt switch from constant current to a constant voltage might introduce stability issues. Furthermore, characteristics of a battery vary depending on their state of charge and this is not taken into account by this algorithm. In this research a possible new algorithm that smoothly regulates charge current is investigated. It turns out that this algorithm is slightly less efficient and slower than the classical CCCV method. The best method to charge the battery of an implantable device is via the CCCV method. An implementation of this method is proposed where both Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) phases are controlled by the same control loop and the transition between the two phases is a smooth hyperbolic tangent function. An inductively powered system was designed that reaches an average efficiency, in circuit simulation, of 87. 36 % from antenna output to battery. For this implementation, the rectifier is the only part in series with the inductive link and the battery. The efficiency is therefore mostly limited by the diodes used for the AC to DC rectifier. An prototype of the designed system was built and the correct operation of the system was verified by wirelessly charging a 160 mAh Li-Ion battery. The results of the performed measurements showed that the inductive link had a poor power transfer efficiency. Mismatch between the resonance capacitor value and coil inductances caused the resonance frequency to deviate from the desired value. The efficiency of the charger was, as expected, mostly determined by losses in the rectifier. Further research should be done in optimization of the inductive link to provide good efficiency even when the device is poorly aligned with the charger. Furthermore the parameters of the system should be tuned to a medical <b>grade</b> <b>battery</b> and the possibility of combining the power transfer with data communication can be investigated.
