40|$|Age-related {{differences}} in updating knowledge about strategy effectiveness after task experience {{have not been}} consistently found, perhaps because the magnitude of observed knowledge updating has been rather meager for both age groups. We examined whether creating homogeneous <b>blocks</b> of recall <b>tests</b> based on two strategies used at encoding (imagery and repetition) would enhance people’s learning about strategy effects on recall. Younger and older adults demonstrated greater knowledge updating (as measured by questionnaire ratings of strategy effectiveness and by global judgments of performance) with <b>blocked</b> (versus random) <b>testing.</b> The benefit of <b>blocked</b> <b>testing</b> for absolute accuracy of global predictions was smaller for older than younger adults. However, individual {{differences in}} correlations of strategy effectiveness ratings and postdictions showed similar upgrades for both age groups.

40|$|Aims: To {{measure the}} force {{required}} to dislodge three different orthodontic temporary anchorage devices (TADs) from artificial <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> and {{to investigate whether}} varying the cortical thickness of the <b>test</b> <b>block</b> will affect these forces. Materials and Method: The TADs were embedded into <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of polyurethane foam, laminated with either 2 mm or 3 mm short-fibre-filled epoxy sheets and a horizontal dislodging force applied, using an Instron universal testing machine. The maximum force applied before the TAD was fully dislodged was recorded. Three TADs were tested: InfinitasTM, Ancor ProTM and Ortho ImplantTM. 150 of each design were tested in the 2 mm thickness <b>test</b> <b>block</b> and a further 150 of each were tested in the 3 mm thickness <b>test</b> <b>block.</b> Results: The mean force required was 468 N in the 2 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> and 567 N in the 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> No significant difference was observed between the InfinitasTM and Ancor ProTM TADs, however {{there was a significant}} difference (P> 0. 05) between both of these TADs and the Ortho ImplantTM. The force required in the 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> was significantly higher than the force required in the 2 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> Conclusion: All of the TADs were functionally acceptable, in terms of resistance to dislodgement forces. The Ortho ImplantTM required a significantly higher force to be dislodged from both the 2 mm and 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> The thickness of the <b>test</b> <b>block</b> had a significant effect on the force required to dislodge each of the TADs. ...|$|R

40|$|A microtiter {{solid-phase}} radioimmunoassay (RIA) {{was developed}} for detection of human calicivirus in stool specimens. Seventy-eight stool specimens were tested by RIA. All 17 specimens positive for human calicivirus by electron microscopy (EM) were also positive by RIA. In addition, of 21 specimens obtained from an outbreak of caliciviral gastroenteritis, 11 were positive by RIA but negative by EM. Of 20 specimens positive for rotavirus by EM and 20 nondiarrheic specimens with no virus, 2 and 1, respectively, were positive by RIA but were subsequently shown to be falsely positive by a <b>blocking</b> <b>test.</b> There was no cross-reaction between human and feline caliciviruses. Thus, the test was more sensitive than EM and, with an appropriate <b>blocking</b> <b>test,</b> was specific for human calicivirus.

40|$|Abstract [...] The memory <b>blocks</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{separate}} testing procedure followed in VLSI <b>testing.</b> The memory <b>blocks</b> <b>testing</b> involve writing a specific bit sequences in the memory locations and reading them again. This type of test is called March test. A particular March test consists of a sequence of writes followed by reads with increasing or decreasing address. There are several test circuits available for testing the memory chips. However no test setup is developed so far for <b>testing</b> the memory <b>blocks</b> inside the FPGA. The BRAMs of FPGA are designed to work at much higher frequency than the FPGA core logic. Hence testing the BRAMs at higher speed is essential. The conventional memory test circuits cannot be used for this purpose. Hence the proposed work develops a memory testing tool based on March tests for FPGA based BRAM...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> norm in a sub-Saharan population and to compare these data with published norms for North American adults. METHODS: A total of 692 healthy Beninese people, age range 20 – 85 years, were recruited. These {{subjects were asked}} to perform the Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> with both hands. RESULTS: Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> scores (mean and standard deviation (SD)) for women and men were, respectively, 81. 3 (15. 4) and 79 (16. 6) for the dominant hand and 73. 2 (13. 7) and 72 (14. 8) for the non-dominant hand. Mean Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> scores ranged from 89. 1 (12. 7) for people under the age of 25 years to 55. 23 (10. 5) for people over the age of 74 years. Discussion: Manual dexterity was better for women than men, for dominant hand than non-dominant hand, and for younger subjects. In comparison with published results for US subjects, Beninese subjects had better dexterity below the age of 50 years in both sexes for the right hand and worse dexterity over 64 years of age in both sexes for the right hand.

40|$|This study {{provides}} new norm {{scores for the}} Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> for gross manual dexterity in children ages 3 - 10 yr. Two hundred fifteen Dutch children performed the Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> separately with each hand.

The Box and <b>Block</b> <b>Test</b> is an easy, feasible, valid, and reliable measurement for gross manual dexterity in young children.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the usefulness, {{sensitivity and specificity}} of a new neurophysiological test for partial conduction block. Methods. In 17 patients (17 nerves) with clinical pictures strongly suggesting the presence of motor conduction block and 20 healthy subjects (40 nerves), motor nerve conduction studies were performed with the conventional surface technique and with a new technique developed by us: the single fiber EMG (SFEMG) conduction <b>block</b> <b>test.</b> Moreover, we also evaluated patients with other neurological diseases. The recent American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AAEM) consensus criteria for partial conduction block {{were used for the}} standard conduction block tests. Results: According to AAEM consensus criteria, 5 / 17 cases presented 'definite' partial conduction block and 6 presented 'probable' partial conduction block.
