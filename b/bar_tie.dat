40|$|The CH. 46 <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> is a {{multiple}} leaf, stainless steel system that attaches the rotor blade to the rotating hub and carries rotor blade centrifugal force. The <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> twists as the rotor blade feathers and bends slightly as the Pitch Housing bends. Originally designed to last 3, 000 hours without any component breakages, the <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> has experienced field failures that have necessitated inspections every 10 flight hours. Traditional fatigue qualification and life methodology have not reconciled the unusually {{large number of}} CH- 46 <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> component failures. One CH- 46 experienced 15, 10, and 6 component failures on the three aft rotor head <b>Tie</b> <b>Bars</b> after only 93 flight hours. One complete <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> (140 components) failed and caused an aircraft crash. This research developed a probability modeling predictive method that can aid {{the design of a}} <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> that will meet desired life and reliability levels. Laboratory coupon tests were interpreted to provide material properties for several manufacturing processes. Finite element analysis of the current <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> design as well as two modified designs was used to determine the <b>Tie</b> <b>Bar</b> stress state for many component failure combinations. The reduced constraint design produced a dramatic stress concentration reduction and may provide large gains in life over the current and elliptical slot designs. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

50|$|A lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is an alloy/steel <b>bar</b> that <b>ties</b> {{the lower}} {{suspension}} pick-up points {{of a vehicle}} (with an independent suspension) together. It increases chassis rigidity by bracing {{the left and right}} lower-control-arm sheet metal mounting points. The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is designed to reduce the non-pivoting movement of the control arms and to stiffen the subframe to lessen the distortion of the lower suspension, especially during hard cornering. As a result, it improves the handling and steering response of the vehicle. It may also provide additional benefits in front-wheel drive vehicles by reducing wheel hop and torque steer. The bar may lower ground clearance by as much as 30 millimeters on some aftermarket installations.The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is mostly an aftermarket car component. Some of the few exceptions to this rule are the Honda Integra and Civic Type-R, as well as the Daihatsu Charade GTti. Since the lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is one of the cheapest upgrade that tuners can install on their cars, it {{is probably one of the}} first performance accessories is acquired. The lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is a bolt-on device and no stock parts will have to be replaced or removed when it is being installed on the vehicle (unless the vehicle already has one on it). These characteristics make the lower <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> a popular performance upgrade among car tuning enthusiasts for its appearance and slight performance gain.|$|R
40|$|The H- 46 {{helicopter}} {{has experienced}} early in-service failures in its <b>tie</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> is a multi-component {{system that is}} {{a critical part of}} the linkage, which attaches the rotor blade to the rotating hub of the helicopter. This research developed methodology to predict the life of the <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> under nominal operational flight loads. A probability model is indispensable because a revised design has yet to accumulate field data, and laboratory testing can never be sufficiently extensive for non-parametric reliability prediction. An algorithm was developed for three and four component systems that will generate the probability of system failure based on the probability of failure in its components. Finite element analysis was conducted on the <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> to determine stress on each component for all possible damage configurations of the <b>tie</b> <b>bar.</b> A given set of flight loads was resolved into boundary conditions for the stress analysis. A methodology was developed to determine the probability of failure of each component using an idealized load history, based on the expected stress- life (S-N) relation of the component at the stress levels experienced by the component. The result is a prediction method that can fortify laboratory results to predict the probability of failure of a system given the system load history. This model will be verified using the early in-service failure statistics of the current design and can be used to assess revised designs. The model will provide a prediction of the failure distributions, (the bell-shaped distribution) as a fabrication of flight hours, or one, two, three, and four elements of failures within the leaves of the <b>tie</b> <b>bar.</b> (MM) NANAU.

40|$|AbstractConcrete-filled-steel-tube (CFST) columns {{have been}} adopted due to its {{superior}} strength and ductility performance contributed by the composite action.

40|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> provide load {{transfer}} along longitudinal joints and prevent lane separation in jointed concrete pavements. <b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> are normally {{located within the}} middle third of the pavement thickness and span the longitudinal joint of two slabs. <b>Tie</b> <b>bars</b> are placed by staking or by using <b>tie</b> <b>bar</b> baskets prior to {{the placement of the}} concrete or during paving via automatic inserters. Inspection of South Dakota pavements after construction using ground penetrating radar (GPR) has revealed that many bars were misaligned or missing. More bars were reported missing or misaligned when automatic inserters were used. Many states, including South Dakota, have banned the use of automatic inserters based on a lack of confidence regarding the placement of <b>tie</b> <b>bars.</b> The long-term effect on the pavement from misaligned or missing bars is unknown, but it can be assumed that additional maintenance costs and reduced pavement life are both possible.
