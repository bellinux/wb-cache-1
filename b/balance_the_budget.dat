5|$|Paul {{held one}} of his {{numerous}} press conferences in Helena, Montana, where he pushed for the Reagan administration to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> and cut spending and taxes.

Paul stated that Treasury Secretary James Baker should be removed from his office for the administration's monetary policy.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several {{of his family and}} friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious than those of the Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E

50|$|The central {{tenets of}} the CSR were tax reduction, <b>balancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> {{reducing}} <b>the</b> size and role of government, and an emphasis on individual economic responsibility (often summarized by an opposition to government hand-outs).

5|$|Paul was {{assigned}} {{to be on the}} Energy and Natural Resources, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and Small Business committees. Paul also formed the Senate Tea Party Caucus with Jim DeMint and Mike Lee as its inaugural members. His first legislative proposal was to cut $500billion from federal spending in one year. This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget,</b> and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was {{in better shape}} financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed {{of many of the}} bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to <b>balance</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget.</b> In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E
