5|$|Europa (Jupiter II), {{the second}} of the four Galilean moons, is the second closest to Jupiter and the {{smallest}} at 3121.6 kilometers in diameter, which is slightly smaller than the Moon.

5|$|Arthur Holmes (1890–1965) {{was born}} in England and became Regius Professor of Geology at the University of Edinburgh in 1943. His magnum opus was Principles of Physical Geology, first {{published}} in 1944, in which he proposed the idea that slow moving convection currents in the Earth's mantle created 'continental drift' {{as it was then}} called. He also pioneered the discipline of geochronology. He lived long enough to see the theory of plate tectonics <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> accepted, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} most influential geologists of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Michel de Nostredame (depending on the source, 14 or 21 December 1503 – 2 July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French {{physician}} and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> famous. He {{is best known}} for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since the publication of this book, which has rarely been out of print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{analyses of}} the name must account for {{the origins of the}} different forms found in early sources Latin (usually Londinium), Old English (usually Lunden), and Welsh (usually Llundein), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from British Celtic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as * or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into West Germanic, the ancestor-language of English, already before English had <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> spoken in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Piperazine-based stimulants {{began to}} appear in Europe in 2000 but {{remained}} virtually unavailable {{in the rest of the}} world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the active ingredients BZP and TFMPP {{began to appear}} in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 piperazine based party-pill formulations started to <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as Health Canada and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets.|$|E
5|$|This {{new class}} of GRB-like events was first {{discovered}} through the detection of GRB 110328A by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission on 28 March 2011.

It occurred {{at the center of}} a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534.

5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau had <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due}} to her role as Mother Superior and {{partly due to}} the endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E
5|$|During Blamey's absence in Greece, AIF units had <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> scattered, with forces being {{deployed}} to Cyprus, and the 9th Division and the 18th Infantry Brigade coming under siege in Tobruk. Blamey {{would spend the}} rest of the year attempting to reassemble his forces. This led to a clash with Auchinleck over the relief of Tobruk, where Blamey accepted Burston's advice that the Australian troops there should be relieved on medical grounds. Menzies, and later his successor, John Curtin, backed Blamey, and Auchinleck and Churchill were forced to give way resulting in the relief of most of the Australian troops by the British 70th Division. For his campaigns in the Middle East, Blamey was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1942. He was Mentioned in Despatches for the eighth time, and was awarded the Greek War Cross, First Class.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1929, {{but did not}} <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> known until it was rediscovered in 2003 at which point it was legal to produce and possess in many countries. By 2007, mephedrone {{was reported to be}} available for sale on the internet, by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound, and by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries and in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand and the United States, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the US Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the US temporarily classified mephedrone as a Schedule I drug, effective October 2011. This classification was made permanent in July 2012 {{with the passage of the}} Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act (SDAPA).|$|E

Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E

5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra, {{also known}} as Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia and The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia, is an oil {{painting}} by English artist William Etty. It was first exhibited in 1821, {{and is now in}} the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight across the River Mersey from Liverpool. During the 1810s Etty had <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> respected among staff and students at the Royal Academy of Arts, in particular for his use of colour and ability to paint realistic flesh tones. Despite having exhibited at every Summer Exhibition since 1811 he attracted little commercial or critical interest. In 1820 he exhibited The Coral Finder, which showed nude figures on a gilded boat. This painting attracted the attention of Sir Francis Freeling, who commissioned a similar painting on a more ambitious scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{was aware}} of the severe {{reaction}} {{in some parts of the}} scientific community against the suggestion made in Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation that humans had arisen from animals by a process of transmutation. Therefore, he almost completely ignored the topic of human evolution in On the Origin of Species. Despite this precaution, the issue featured prominently in the debate that followed the book's publication. For most of the first half of the 19th century, the scientific community believed that, although geology had shown that the Earth and life were very old, human beings had appeared suddenly just a few thousand years before the present. However, a series of archaeological discoveries in the 1840s and 1850s showed stone tools associated with the remains of extinct animals. By the early 1860s, as summarized in Charles Lyell's 1863 book Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, it had <b>become</b> <b>widely</b> accepted that humans had existed during a prehistoric period—which stretched many thousands of years before the start of written history. This view of human history was more compatible with an evolutionary origin for humanity than was the older view. On the other hand, at that time there was no fossil evidence to demonstrate human evolution. The only human fossils found before the discovery of Java Man in the 1890s were either of anatomically modern humans or of Neanderthals that were too close, especially in the critical characteristic of cranial capacity, to modern humans for them to be convincing intermediates between humans and other primates.|$|E
