40|$|The <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> is the {{predominant}} method of underwriting SEOs in Canada. Offer prices are set and underwriters commit to purchase offerings several days earlier for <b>bought</b> <b>deals</b> than for firm commitment issues, implying stronger underwriter certification for <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> issues. Consistent with the certification hypothesis, this study finds a significantly smaller negative stock price reaction around {{the announcement of}} <b>bought</b> <b>deals</b> compared to firm <b>commitment</b> issues. <b>Bought</b> <b>deals</b> are further shown to have smaller offer price discounts and smaller underwriting fees, implying superior pricing and thus, higher quality offerings. These findings suggest that investment banks' underwriting method of choice is informative of issue quality. SEOs <b>Bought</b> <b>deal</b> Information asymmetry Underwriter certification...|$|R

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of the <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> from the underwriter's perspective {{is that if}} it cannot sell the securities, it must hold them.

Advocates argue that businesses receiving government contracts or subsidies should pay a living wage that allows workers to support the average family in reasonable comfort.

The paper particularly emphasized inefficient mill designs which subsequently led to higher operating costs. The first step was taken in October 2005, when the general meeting approved the new name, Catalyst Paper, to signal that the group was leaving Norske Skog. The Norwegian group sold its 29.4 percent of Catalyst for $186 million in a <b>bought</b> <b>deal</b> on 30 January 2006.

40|$|Abstract. We propose {{an agent}} {{interaction}} model {{to express the}} meaning of messages of ACL between agents that coordinate in medical domain. While many researchers have shown the beneficial communication in multi-agent systems, very few have applied how agents interact focused on clinical domain. In developing of medical application, {{it is very important}} to organize agent systems as following international standard, because medical application is sensitive as being related to human life whether directly or not. We consider CDA, which is a clinical document standard for exchange. As it is worked by trigger event we develop commitment based agent communication. In current environment, however, speech act based communication is more common, we again modify it as speech act based ACL. In this paper we propose 1) agent interaction model formalization in medical domain, and 2) present how to <b>deal</b> <b>commitment</b> based communication and speech act. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Newcastle New Deal for Communities {{is working}} to {{change the face of}} Newcastle upon Tyne's West End over a ten-year period. Since it began in 2000, the {{programme}} has aimed to tackle deprivation in the areas of Arthur's Hill, Cruddas Park, Rye Hill and Elswick, through community-led regeneration. More than 100 projects are aiming {{to bridge the gap between}} those communities in the West End and those in wealthier parts of the city. The programme tackles five key themes: poor job prospects; high levels of crime; educational under-achievement; poor health; and problems with housing and the environment. New <b>Deal's</b> <b>commitment</b> to put residents in charge of the area's regeneration is reflected in the organization's structure - the Board of Directors includes a majority of twelve elected residents. As of September 2006, recorded crime in the New Deal catchment area had fallen by 21 per cent thanks to a £3.4m package of crime-busting measures.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between idiosyncratic <b>deals</b> and organizational <b>commitment.</b> In particular, it examines how two individual differences which reflect self-worth (core self-evaluations and age) moderate that relationship. We predicted that employees with feelings of high self-worth will expect and will feel entitled to these deals, but employees with feelings of low self-worth will feel particularly obligated to reciprocate positively for special treatment. Data were collected from 375 managers at two points in time. As predicted, the relationship between idiosyncratic deals and affective organizational commitment was stronger for those managers who had low core self-evaluations. While the two-way interaction effect between idiosyncratic deals and age was not significant, we did find modest evidence for a three-way interaction effect. As predicted, the strongest relationship between idiosyncratic <b>deals</b> and organizational <b>commitment</b> occurred for older workers who had low core self-evaluations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
