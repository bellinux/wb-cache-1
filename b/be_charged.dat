5|$|The iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad is designed to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector {{at one end and}} a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E
