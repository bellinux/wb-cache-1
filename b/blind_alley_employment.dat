60|$|Supposed to be incarcerated there, {{because the}} time had rather outgrown the strong cells and the <b>blind</b> <b>alley.</b> In {{practice}} {{they had come to}} be considered a little too bad, though in theory they were quite as good as ever; which may be observed to be the case at the present day with other cells that are not at all strong, and with other <b>blind</b> <b>alleys</b> that are stone-blind. Hence the smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors (who received them with open arms), except at certain constitutional moments when somebody came from some Office, to go through some form of overlooking something which neither he nor anybody else knew anything about. On these truly British occasions, the smugglers, if any, made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the <b>blind</b> <b>alley,</b> while this somebody pretended to do his something: and made a reality of walking out again as soon as he hadn't done it--neatly epitomising the administration of most of the public affairs in our right little, tight little, island.|$|R
