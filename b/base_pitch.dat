40|$|As {{the energy}} demand and {{greenhouse}} gases emission is increasing day by day the popularity of renewable energy systems is also being raised. One {{of the most popular}} renewable energy systems over the past decade has been the wind energy or wind turbines. Wind turbine extracts kinetic energy from the wind. Currently much research has concentrated on improving the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. Variable speed horizontal axis wind turbines use blade pitch control to meet specified objectives for three regions of operation named low wind, medium wind and high wind conditions. In this paper a control strategy is being developed for variable speed horizontal axis wind turbine which will allow the turbine to run at its maximum efficiency. For this purpose the PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system is used to control the aerodynamic power of wind turbine. MATLAB Simulink power system tool is used to develop the model of PID controller. In this paper a model for the simulation of the PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system is constructed using properly selected sub blocks. Step response of this PID controller <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator system will be analyzed. The above presented model can be a useful tool for wind power industry to study the behavior of wind turbines...|$|R

50|$|A Shepard tone {{is another}} illustrative {{example of a}} strange loop. Named after Roger Shepard, it is a sound {{consisting}} of a superposition of tones separated by octaves. When played with the <b>base</b> <b>pitch</b> of the tone moving upwards or downwards, it {{is referred to as}} the Shepard scale. This creates the auditory illusion of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower.

5000|$|Tone {{terracing}} {{is particularly}} {{common in the}} languages of West Africa, where typically only the low tone causes downstep. However, a somewhat more intricate system {{is found in the}} Twi language of Ghana. Twi has three phonemic tones: high, mid, and low. A word, and therefore a prosodic chunk of speech, may only start with a high tone or a low tone on its first syllable. As in many languages, a low tone starts out and remains {{at the bottom of the}} speakers range. After a low tone, a subsequent high tone is downstepped. (A temporary exception occurs when a single low tone is found between two high tones. In this case the low tone is raised from its base value, but the second high tone is still downstepped, and subsequent low tones return to the <b>base</b> <b>pitch.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Originally, the dan bau {{was made}} of just four parts: a bamboo tube, a wooden rod, a coconut shell half, and a silk string. The string was strung across the bamboo, tied on {{one end to the}} rod, which is perpendicularly {{attached}} to the bamboo. The coconut shell was attached to the rod, serving as a resonator. In present days, the bamboo {{has been replaced by a}} wooden soundboard, with hardwood as the sides and softwood as the middle. An electric guitar string has replaced the traditional silk string. While the gourd is still present, it is now generally made of wood, acting only as a decorative feature. Also, most dan bau now have modern tuning machines, so the <b>base</b> <b>pitch</b> of the string can be adjusted. Usually the instrument is tuned to one octave below middle C, about 131 Hz, but it can be tuned to other notes to make it easier to play in keys distant from C.|$|E
5000|$|Thread limit or pitch {{diameter}} limit {{is a standard}} used for classifying the tolerance of the thread {{pitch diameter}} for taps. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the pitch diameter is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than <b>base</b> <b>pitch</b> diameter and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 pitch thread = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHarmony search (HS), as an {{emerging}} metaheuristic technique mimicking the improvisation behavior of musicians, has demonstrated strong efficacy in solving various numerical and real-world optimization problems. This work presents a harmony search with differential mutation <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> adjustment (HSDM) algorithm, which improves the original pitch adjustment operator of HS using the self-referential differential mutation scheme that features differential evolution - another celebrated metaheuristic algorithm. In HSDM, the differential mutation <b>based</b> <b>pitch</b> adjustment can dynamically adapt {{the properties of}} the landscapes being explored at different searching stages. Meanwhile, the pitch adjustment operator's execution probability is allowed to vary randomly between 0 and 1, which can maintain both wild and fine exploitation throughout the searching course. HSDM has been evaluated and compared to the original HS and two recent HS variants using 16 numerical test problems of various searching landscape complexities at 10 and 30 dimensions. HSDM almost always demonstrates superiority on all test problems...|$|R

50|$|Oxford {{opened their}} lfﬂey Road sports complex on 6 March 1999, amid much {{university}} cerernony, incorporating a water <b>base</b> <b>pitch</b> using {{state of the}} art astroturf technology and named the Fletcher Field. This is in honour of Dr Robin Fletcher (Marlborough & Trinity, Oxford) a former resident of the Hockey Association and an Olympic and England international. Dr Fletcher was a fellow of Trinity, Oxford, for many years before being appointed Warden of Rhodes House which partly financed the project. Robin Fletcher played in the Varsity Hockey Match in 1947, 1948 and 1949 (Captain). Cambridge opened the Wilberforce road ground in 1994, adjoining the modern pavilion complex and the new athletics track. From an early stage, these developments were watched by the University Captains each year. One of them, Richard Dodds, Captain I981 (Kingston Grammar School & St Catharine's) won Bronze Medal in the Los Angeles Olympic Games and went on to captain the gold medal side in Seoul in 1988. The University Captains were not short of advice and with Lord’s in no mood to lay a synthetic pitch on the nursery Ground, the move to the excellent water based ground laid at the Reading Hockey Club took place in 1991. This was an excellent choice and returned to the match some of the intimate atmosphere that was generated during the years at Beckenham and which sometimes was lost in the 40,000 seats at Lord’s.|$|E

40|$|The tonic is a {{fundamental}} concept in Indian classical music since it constitutes the <b>base</b> <b>pitch</b> from which a lead performer constructs the melodies, and accompanying instruments use it for tuning. This makes tonic identification an essential first step for most automatic analyses of Indian classical music, such as intonation and melodic analysis, and raga recognition. In this paper we address the task of automatic tonic identification. Unlike approaches that identify the tonic from a single predominant pitch track, here we propose a method based on a multipitch analysis of the audio. We use a multipitch representation to construct a pitch histogram of the audio excerpt, out of which the tonic is identified. Rather than manually define a template, we employ a classification approach to automatically learn {{a set of rules}} for selecting the tonic. The proposed method returns not only the pitch class of the tonic but also the precise octave in which it is played. We evaluate the approach on a large collection of Carnatic and Hindustani music, obtaining an identification accuracy of 93 %. We also discuss the types of errors made by our proposed method, as well as the challenges in generating ground truth annotations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Visual images {{induced by}} music or other sounds {{represent}} a relatively {{common type of}} synaesthesia that is fairly well documented in the synaesthesia literature. It sometimes occurs in certain altered states of consciousness and in individuals with (visual) sensory loss in addition to healthy synaesthetes. Furthermore, {{it has been suggested}} that there are some common trends between synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes when it comes to matching sounds with colours. Specifically, brighter colours tend to matched with high pitched sounds. Here we report a novel study looking at colours matched to dynamic auditory stimuli. We used stimuli with high/low <b>base</b> <b>pitch,</b> rising/falling pitch and increasing/decreasing spectral brightness. We replicated the finding that brighter colours are chosen for higher pitch sounds. We also found that rising pitch tends to be associated with brighter colours (regardless of average pitch), however, changes in spectral brightness did not affect colour choices. The same pattern of results was obtained for synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, indicating further similarities between the two groups than previously documented. A second novel observation we have noted concerning auditory-visual synaesthesia is that it may be experienced by non-synaesthetes between sleep and wakefulness, adding to the list of altered states of consciousness in which synaesthetic perception may be encountered...|$|E
