5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may <b>be</b> <b>pleasant</b> or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
25|$|Sour {{and salt}} tastes can <b>be</b> <b>pleasant</b> in small {{quantities}}, but in larger quantities {{become more and}} more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, which can be dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals acids, which can cause serious tissue damage.|$|E

500|$|Winters are {{generally}} cool, cloudy and damp with little temperature variation. Snowfall occurs occasionally {{and can cause}} travel disruption when this happens. Snowfall {{is more common in}} outer London. Spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can <b>be</b> <b>pleasant.</b> As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect, making the centre of London at times [...] warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. The effect of this can be seen below when comparing London Heathrow, 15 miles west of London, with the London Weather Centre, in the city centre.|$|E
500|$|Other parks include: Alexandra Park {{on a hill}} {{overlooking}} the city; Parade Gardens, along the river near the abbey in the city centre; Sydney Gardens, an 18th-century pleasure-garden; Henrietta Park; Hedgemead Park; and Alice Park. Jane Austen wrote [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>pleasant</b> to be near the Sydney Gardens. We could go into the Labyrinth every day." [...] Alexandra, Alice and Henrietta parks were built into the growing city among the housing developments. There is a linear park following the old Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway line. Cleveland Pools were built around 1815 close to the River Avon, now the oldest surviving public outdoor lido in England, and plans have been submitted for its restoration.|$|E

500|$|At Yekaterinburg, Tatiana {{occasionally}} {{joined her}} younger sisters in chatting {{with some of}} the guards over tea, asking them questions about their families and talking about her hopes for a new life in England when they were released. On one occasion one of the guards forgot himself and told the grand duchesses an off-color joke. The shocked Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death," [...] and her younger sister Maria scolded the guards for their bad language. She [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>pleasant</b> to the guards if she thought they were behaving in an acceptable and decorous manner," [...] recalled another of the guards in his memoirs. Later, when a new commander was placed in charge of the Ipatiev House, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the rules of their confinement became more strict. Tatiana, still the family leader, was often sent by her parents to question the guards about rules or what would happen next to the family. She also {{spent a great deal of}} time sitting with her mother and ill brother, reading to her mother or playing games to occupy the time. At the Ipatiev House, Tatiana and her sisters were required to do their own laundry and make bread. Her nursing skills were called upon at the end of June 1918 when she gave an injection of morphine to Dr. Eugene Botkin to ease his kidney pain.|$|E

The first RAF pilot to fly it was [...] Flt, Lieut. S.N. Webster, who reported its flight characteristics to <b>be</b> <b>pleasant,</b> although the engine still tended to cut out: this led to some alarming episodes when the aircraft was later flown by Flying Officer H.M.

[...] During July a number of modifications were made: a new engine was fitted, together with a forged duralumin racing propeller, an additional fuel tank was fitted in the right-hand float to provide sufficient range to complete the Schneider course, high-temperature spark plugs were fitted and changes {{were made to the}} air inlets in a further attempt to cure the engine problems.|$|E
