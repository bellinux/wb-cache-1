40|$|Introduction High {{mobility}} group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> is {{a versatile}} protein involved in gene transcription, extracellular signaling, {{and response to}} inflammation. Extracellularly, high mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> binds to several receptors, notably the receptor for advanced glycation end-products. Expression of high mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products has been described in many cancers. Objectives To systematically review the available literature using PubMed and Web of Science to evaluate the clinical value of high mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Data synthesis A total of eleven studies were included in this review. High mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and many clinical and pathological characteristics of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas patients. Additionally, the receptor for advanced glycation end-products demonstrates potential value as a clinical indicator of tumor angiogenesis and advanced staging. In diagnosis, high mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> demonstrates low sensitivity. Conclusion High mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products are associated with clinical and pathological characteristics of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Further investigation of the prognostic and diagnostic value of these molecules is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Forkhead box O {{proteins}} have critical {{roles in}} a number of cellular processes, including apoptosis. Acetylation and phosphorylation of forkhead box O proteins are posttranslational modifications that attenu-ate their transcriptional activity. As supracervical fetal membranes are characterized by increased cell death, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the expression of forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1,</b> acetylated-forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1,</b> and Ser- 256 phosphorylated forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1</b> at supracervical and distal site fetal membrane. Fetal membranes overlying the cervix were identified in situ in women undergoing term elective Caesarean section. Immuno-histochemistry (n 7) was used to analyze the protein expression of forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1,</b> acetylated-forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1,</b> and Ser- 256 phosphorylated forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1.</b> There was no difference in forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1</b> and Ser- 256 phosphorylated forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1</b> protein expression between the 2 sites. However, when com-pared with distal site, the intensity and extent of staining of acetylated-forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1</b> were greater in amnion and chorion obtained from the supracervical site. In summary, supracervical fetal membranes are characterized by increased acetylated-forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1</b> protein expression. Although the precise role and contribution of acetylated-forkhead <b>box</b> O <b>1</b> in the process of human fetal membrane rupture are unknown, it has been implicated in apoptosis and/or cell cycle regulation...|$|R

40|$|Upstream binding factor (UBF) is a {{eukaryotic}} RNA polymerase I-specific transcription factor. Its predominant DNA-binding motif, ubfHMG <b>box</b> <b>1,</b> preserves DNA assembling {{activity that}} can bind {{two or more}} DNA duplexes simultaneously to form a crossover DNA junction. Here we investigate the basis of crossover DNA-assembling activity of ubfHMG <b>box</b> <b>1</b> by extensive mutagenesis analyses and mobility shift assay. Although the ubfHMG <b>box</b> <b>1</b> preserves a high mobility group (HMG) core structure, changing {{a number of the}} consensus hydrophobic and aromatic residues to alanine did not inhibit its crossover-assembling activity. This indicates that these residues do not directly participate in protein-DNA interaction. However, altering a series of basic residues in the helices 1 and 2 regions or the N-terminal extended strand of the ubfHMG <b>box</b> <b>1</b> motif had severe effects on DNA-assembling activity; however, certain non-specific DNA binding activity still remained. This suggests that the ubfHMG <b>box</b> <b>1</b> motif might extensively contact the backbone of a crossover junction through its multiple basic residues. Mutating a hydrophobic residue in the terminal dimerization domain inhibited the association of truncated Xenopus UBF, but had little effect on its crossover-assembling activity. This indicates that the UBF-crossover DNA complex is not established by the association of individual DNA-bound peptides...|$|R

40|$|The antiapoptotic {{function}} of the interleukin- 7 (IL- 7) receptor is related to regulation of {{three members of the}} Bcl 2 family: synthesis of Bcl 2, phosphorylation of Bad, and cytosolic retention of Bax. Here we show that, in an IL- 7 -dependent murine T-cell line, different regions of the IL- 7 receptor initiate the signal transduction pathways that regulate these proteins. Both <b>Box</b> <b>1</b> and Y 449 are required to signal Bcl 2 synthesis and Bax cytosolic retention. This suggests a sequential model in which Jak 1, which binds to <b>Box</b> <b>1,</b> is first activated and then phosphorylates Y 449, leading to Bcl 2 and Bax regulation, accounting for approximately 90 % of the survival function. Phosphorylation of Bad required <b>Box</b> <b>1</b> but not Y 449, suggesting that Jak 1 also initiates an additional signaling cascade that accounts for approximately 10 % of the survival function. Stat 5 was activated from the Y 449 site but only partially accounted for the survival signal. Proliferation required both Y 449 and <b>Box</b> <b>1.</b> Thymocyte development in vivo showed that deletion of Y 449 eliminated 90 % of αβ T-cell development and completely eliminated γδ T-cell development, whereas deleting <b>Box</b> <b>1</b> completely eliminated both αβ and γδ T-cell development. Thus the IL- 7 receptor controls at least two distinct pathways, in addition to Stat 5, that are required for cell survival...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{receptor}} {{for advanced}} glycation end products mediates {{a variety of}} inflammatory responses. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products has been suggested {{to function as a}} decoy abrogating cellular activation. High-mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> is a high-affinity binding ligand for the receptor for advanced glycation end products with cytokine activities and plays a role in sepsis. Design: Controlled, in vivo laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory of a health sciences university. Subjects: C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Interventions: Peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli. Mice received soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products or anti-high-mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> immunoglobulin G, or the appropriate control treatment. Measurements and Main Results: Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products-treated mice demonstrated an enhanced bacterial dissemination to liver and lungs, accompanied by increased hepatocellular injury and exaggerated systemic cytokine release, 20 hrs after intraperitoneal administration of Escherichia coli. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products administration in healthy, uninfected mice did not induce an immune response. Remarkably, lung inflammation was unaffected. Furthermore, high-mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> release was enhanced during peritonitis and anti-high-mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1</b> treatment was associated with higher bacterial loads in liver and lungs. Conclusions: These data are the first to suggest that receptor for advanced glycation end products ligands, including high-mobility group <b>box</b> <b>1,</b> limit bacterial dissemination during Gram-negative sepsis.

40|$|AbstractWe {{provide a}} {{cognitive}} analysis of how children represent belief using mental files. We explain why children who pass the false belief test {{are not aware}} of the intensionality of belief. Fifty-one 3 ½- to 7 -year old children were familiarized with a dual object, e. g., a ball that rattles and is described as a rattle. They observed how a puppet agent witnessed the ball being put into <b>box</b> <b>1.</b> In the agent’s absence the ball was taken from <b>box</b> <b>1,</b> the child was reminded of it being a rattle, and emphasising its being a rattle it was put back into <b>box</b> <b>1.</b> Then the agent returned, the object was hidden in the experimenter’s hands and removed from <b>box</b> <b>1,</b> described as a “rattle,” and transferred to box 2. Children who passed false belief had no problem saying where the puppet would look for the ball. However, in a different condition in which the agent was also shown that the ball was a rattle they erroneously said that the agent would look for the ball in <b>box</b> <b>1,</b> ignoring the agent’s knowledge of the identity of rattle and ball. Their problems cease with their mastery of second-order beliefs (she thinks she knows). Problems also vanish when the ball is described not as a rattle but as a thing that rattles. We describe how our theory can account for these data as well as all other relevant data in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} Vibrio cholerae phoBR {{expression}} by PhoB involves its binding to Pho boxes at − 35 (<b>box</b> <b>1),</b> − 60 (<b>box</b> 2), and − 80 (box 3) from the putative phoB translation start site. These loci {{were located in}} the sense (<b>box</b> <b>1)</b> and antisense (<b>boxes</b> 2 and 3) strands of the phoBR regulatory region, and PhoB binds to these individual boxes with distinct affinities. Fusions of sequences containing different combinations of these boxes upstream of the lacZ reporter in a plasmid demonstrated that only those carrying <b>boxes</b> <b>1,</b> 2, and 3, or 1 alone, activated transcription under inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation. When a fragment, including only <b>boxes</b> <b>1</b> and 2, was fused to lacZ, expression was no longer induced by low Pi, suggesting a repressive role for PhoB∼box 2 (PhoB bound to box 2) over the transcriptional activity induced by PhoB∼box 1. The similarity between lacZ expression levels from promoter fragments containing the three <b>boxes</b> or <b>box</b> <b>1</b> alone showed that PhoB∼box 3 eliminated the repressive effect imposed by PhoB∼box 2 on phoBR transcription. Complementation assays with a phoBR-containing plasmid demonstrated that the 234 -bp promoter fragment carrying the three boxes is absolutely required for operon expression in Vibrio cholerae ΔphoBR cells. This was observed under Pi abundance, when phoBR was expressed at a basal level and, also in low Pi conditions, when Pho regulon genes were fully expressed. Thus, under Pi limitation, PhoB exerts dual regulatory functions by binding sequentially distinct Pho boxes to enable the fine-tuning and precise control of phoBR expression in V. cholerae cells...|$|R
