2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A <b>bottom</b> <b>heat</b> of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} are solved numerically for a Boussinesq fluid with infinite Prandtl number in a square 2 -D box where the viscosity increases with depth. Three heating modes are employed: <b>bottom</b> <b>heating,</b> internal <b>heating,</b> and half <b>bottom</b> and half internal heating. In all cases the boundaries are free slip. The range of Rayleigh numbers employed is 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 7. The viscosity increases as 10 ^(β(1 -y)), where y is distance measured from the bottom upwards and β is a free parameter. In the <b>bottom</b> <b>heated</b> cases, the convective velocities slow near the bottom and result in a large temperature drop between the bottom boundary and interior compared with the top boundary and the interior. This results in increased buoyancy in the ascending limb. In the internally heated case, the flow in {{the top half of}} the box resembles Rayleigh-Bènard convection and in the bottom half it approaches a conductive thermal regime for β greater than about 2. In this case the top surface heat flux decays from ascending to descending limb and the ascending and descending limbs become more equal in their buoyancy. Increasing β decreases the efficiency of heat transport, but has little effect on the exponents of Nu-Ra and Pe-Ra relations. There is a larger decrease in heat transport efficiency for a given β in the <b>bottom</b> <b>heated</b> case compared to the internally heated case...|$|R

A wide configuration scan shows that the EC driven current is strongly dependent on the magnetic ripple structure where the EC power is deposited. As the EC power is deposited on the deeper ripple bottom, the EC driven current flowing in the Fisch-Boozer direction decreases, and the reversal of directly measured EC driven current is observed. High energy electrons are suppressed for ripple <b>bottom</b> <b>heating,</b> indicating that generation and confinement of trapped electrons have an important role on ECCD. For ripple top heating, the typical ECCD efficiency is estimated ��neIECR/PEC = 0. 8 � 10 17 A/Wm 2 and ���e 3 neIECR/� 0 2 PECTe, = 0. 05.

40|$|The {{effect of}} mixed {{convection}} on low Reynolds numbers flow inside a horizontal square channel heated from below {{have been investigated}} experimentally. The channel flow rate ranged from 0. 0210 kg/s to 0. 0525 kg/s which correspond to Reynolds numbers between 300 and 750 {{in the absence of}} <b>heating.</b> The channel <b>bottom</b> surface temperature was controlled and varied from 30 ºC to 55 ºC (Grashof number ranged between 6. 37 × 106 and 3. 86 × 107). Planer Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique was used to measure two-dimensional velocity fields in the channel mid-vertical plane and two horizontal planes close to the <b>bottom</b> <b>heated</b> wall. Stereo-PIV technique was used to measure velocity fields in the channel cross plane. Natural convection was dominant over forced convection at all measurement conditions and Gr/Re 2 ranged between 9 and 206. Mean and turbulent velocity fields were computed and analyzed. It was found that buoyancy-induced secondary flow alters the mean flow behaviour. The mean streamwise velocity in the vertical plane was asymmetric and skewed towards the <b>bottom</b> <b>heated</b> surface. Back flow was observed near the top unheated wall when Gr/Re 2 3 ̆e 55 and its magnitude increased with the increase of bottom surface temperature and/or decrease in the flow rate. Turbulence was induced mainly due to buoyancy-induced secondary flow. The streamwise and spanwise turbulent velocity magnitudes were largest close to the <b>bottom</b> <b>heated</b> surface. The underlying physical processes associated with the low Reynolds number mixed convection were investigated by applying the POD technique on the turbulent velocity fields and through the characterization of turbulent coherent structures formed in the flow. POD analysis revealed intriguing features within the vertical turbulent velocity fields. Local convective cells at different mode levels were observed near the <b>bottom</b> <b>heated</b> wall. Coherent structures were formed extensively in all planes due to the interactions between rising plumes, falling parcels and shear flow. The results showed that the bottom wall temperature had a direct effect on the number of coherent structures generated and their associated characteristics. The flow development was also investigated at five different locations along the channel in the vertical mid-plane. It was found that the flow development length increased with the increase of bottom wall temperature and/or decrease of the flow rate (i. e. increasing Gr/Re 2) ...|$|R

40|$|Stratified stable layered mantle {{convection}} in {{a three-dimensional}} (3 -D) spherical shell is investigated {{for a range}} of depth of layer, intrinsic density contrast between the layers (Δρ), and heating mode. Three heating modes are studied: internal <b>heating,</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>heating</b> across core-mantle boundary, and both combined. For each heating mode, layers were investigated centered at depths from 500 km to 2500 km in 500 km steps and with Δρ from 1 to 5 % in 1 % steps. We did not find stable layering for Δρ of 1 %. Cases with no <b>bottom</b> <b>heating</b> were stable with Δρ of 2 %, but Δρ of at least 3 % were required by cases with a component of <b>bottom</b> <b>heating.</b> All cases with Δρ of 4 % or more were stable. We found that the stability of the layer is strongly dependent on the buoyancy ratio B (B = Δρ ÷ ραΔT, where Δρ is the chemical density increase across the boundary, ρ is the density in the upper layer, α is the thermal expansivity and ΔT is the radial temperature difference across the whole system) with a dense layer becoming unstable B ≈ 0. 5. We characterize the height and length scale of the undulations and the area of the interface. Deformations of the interface are largest for cases in which interface is in the midmantle and for cases with small density contrasts. We find that the heating mode does not affect the thermal structure of the layered system, which can be explained with energy balance considerations. The amplitude of the interfacial deformation is found to be unaffected by the heating mode and can be predicted using B. Our results suggest the interfacial thermal boundary layers require large temperature contrasts; therefore the lack of evidence for thermal boundary layers in global seismology studies between 500 and 2500 km depth suggests interfaces at these depths are unlikely...|$|R
