A radiotracer 2 ̆ 010 weight method {{was used to measure}} sodium ion and water transport numbers for two Nafion perfluorosulfonate membranes. A homogeneous film shows rapidly decreasing sodium ion transport numbers with increasing Formula catholyte concentration, reaching a value of 0. 56 mol F 2 ̆ 2121 with 12. 5 M solution at 800 C. A fabric 2 ̆ 010 <b>backed</b> <b>material</b> with a sulfonamide exchange site layer yields considerably higher values with a more complicated concentration dependence.

40|$|The Pegasus Coating Removal System (PCRS) was {{demonstrated}} at Florida International University (FIU) {{where it was}} being evaluated for efficiency and cost. In conjunction with the FIU testing demonstration, a human factors assessment was conducted to assess the hazards and associated safety and health issues of concern for workers utilizing this technology. The PCRS is a chemical paste that {{is applied to the}} surface using a brush, roller, or airless sprayer. After the type of PCRS, thickness, and dwell time have been determined, a laminated <b>backed</b> <b>material</b> is placed on top of the chemical paste to slow down the drying process and to provide a mechanism to strip-off the chemical. After the dwell time is reached, the chemical substrate can be removed. Scrapers may be used to break-loose the layers as necessary or to break-loose the layers that are not removed when the laminated paper is picked up. Residue may also be cleaned off of the surface with a damp sponge with an agitating motion, absorbent sponges, or a vacuum, as needed. The paint and removal agent is then placed in drums for disposal at a later time. During the assessment sampling was conducted for organic vapors and general observational techniques were conducted for ergonomics. Recommendations for improved worker safety and health during application and removal of the PCRS include: (1) work practices that reflect avoidance of exposure or reducing the risk of exposure; (2) assuring all PPE and equipment are compatible with the chemicals being used; (3) work practices that reduce the worker`s need to walk on the slippery surface caused by the chemical or the use of special anti-slip soles; (4) careful control of overspray (if a spray application is used); and (5) the use of ergonomically designed long-handled tools to apply and remove the chemical (to alleviate some of the ergonomic concerns) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the electromagnetic scattering of targets with thin-coating accurately, a conformal finite-difference time-domain (CFDTD) method based on effective constitutive parameters is presented in this paper. Two kinds of coating problems are considered. For a coated target with medium <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> the CFDTD formulations on conformal cells {{are the same as}} those of the conventional FDTD, but the parameters in FDTD formulations are replaced by effective constitutive parameters to include the curved coating message of target. For a coated target with perfectly conducting (PEC) <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> the contour-path integral is used to exclude the curved PEC part, and effective constitutive parameters are then introduced to include the coating message. The bistatic radar cross section (RCS) of coated spheres with medium <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> and with PEC <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> are computed, respectively, to validate the presented CFDTD scheme. The backscattering of a composite airfoil, which is made of radar absorbing material (RAM) and metal framework, and coated by fiberglass-reinforced plastics, is also analyzed to demonstrate the feasibility of presented scheme. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{reproducible}} method for increasing desktop scanner uniformity {{for the analysis}} of radiochromic films is presented. Scanner uniformity, especially in the non-scan direction, for transmission scanning is well known to be problematic for radiochromic film analysis and normally corrections need to be applied. These corrections are dependant on scanner coordinates and dose level applied which complicates dosimetry procedures. This study has highlighted that using reflectance scanning in combination with a matt, white <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> instead of the conventional gloss scanner finish, substantial increases in the scanner uniformity can be achieved within 90 % of the scanning area. Uniformity within +/- 1 % over the scanning area for our epsonV 700 scanner tested was found. This is compared to within +/- 3 % for reflection scanning with the gloss <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> and within +/- 4 % for transmission scanning. The matt <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> used was simply 5 layers of standard quality white printing paper (80 g/m(2)). It was found that 5 layers was the optimal result for <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> however most of the improvements were seen with a minimum of 3 layers. Above 5 layers, no extra benefit was seen. This may eliminate the need to perform scanner corrections for position on the desktop scanners for radiochromic film dosimetry...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{ultrasound}} <b>backing</b> <b>materials</b> {{based on}} polymer composites with improved dimensional stability and low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} {{are being developed}} and analyzed. For this purpose a filled epoxy resin (Stycast 1265), a commonly used <b>backing</b> <b>material,</b> was considered reference material and polyurethane composites (PU 2305, PU 2350) were proposed as better alternatives. When compared to the reference, the PU 2350 filled with a mixture of Al 2 O 3 and tungsten exhibited an approximately 15 times lower glassy transition temperature and a 2. 5 time lower longitudinal thermal expansion at 20 °C. This ensures that within the entire operational temperature range the <b>backing</b> <b>material</b> is flexible, minimizing the thermal stresses induced onto transducer elements soldered joints and piezoceramic core. For the same material, the attenuation at 5 MHz was similar to the reference material while at 7 and 8. 5 MHz it was 33 % and 54 % higher respectively. From these analyses it is concluded that the newly developed polyurethane composites outperform the reference backing with respect to the thermal dimensional stability {{as well as to the}} damping properties. An integrated rigorous mechano-acoustical approach is being proposed as an appropriate passive material design path. It can be easily extended to any other passive materials used for ultrasound transducer conception. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
