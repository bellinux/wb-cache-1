30|$|In the <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> of damo coupled anammox, nitrite, nitrate and {{ammonium}} {{were added}} into reactor B at day 261. After anammox {{got used to}} the environmental condition, nitrite supply was stopped.

30|$|Two {{short-term}} <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{were performed}} when a steady state was {{reached in the}} system. <b>Batch</b> <b>test</b> A was conducted to identify the nitrite removal capacity of damo bacteria in the system.

Fed with methane and nitrite in two reactors, the concentration of nitrite decreased gradually. A stable nitrite removal rate of 51.91  mg NO 2 −-N L− 1  day− 1 was obtained, which was nearly two times higher than that of nitrate removal. The <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> B was undertaken to investigate the nitrogen and methane turnover rate of damo culture and verify the mass balance.

40|$|<b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{to measure}} maximum acetate {{utilization}} rates {{were used to}} determine the distribution of acetate utilizers in expanded-bed sand and expanded-bed granular activated carbon (GAC) reactors. The reactors were fed a mixture of acetate and 3 -ethylphenol, and they contained the same predominant aceticlastic methanogen, Methanothrix sp. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> were performed both on the entire reactor contents and with media removed from the reactors. Results indicated that activity was evenly distributed within the GAC reactors, whereas in the sand reactor a sludge blanket on top of the sand bed contained approximately 50 % of the activity. The Monod half-velocity constant (Ks) for the acetate-utilizing methanogens in two expanded-bed GAC reactors was searched for by combining steady-state results with <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> data. All parameters necessary to develop a model with Monod kinetics were experimentally determined except for Ks. However, Ks was a function of the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration, and <b>batch</b> <b>test</b> results demonstrated that maximum acetate utilization rates were not a function of the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration. Addition of a competitive inhibition term into the Monod expression predicted the dependence of Ks on the effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentration. A two-parameter search determined a Ks of 8. 99 mg of acetate per liter and a Ki of 2. 41 mg of 3 -ethylphenol per liter. Model predictions were in agreement with experimental observations for all effluent 3 -ethylphenol concentrations. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> measured the activity for a specific substrate and determined the distribution of activity in the reactor.

50|$|However {{at higher}} and top {{competitive}} levels, even these variations are thought too coarse-grained and match pellets are batch tested; that is, the specific gun is mounted in a machine rest test rig and pellets from a specific production {{run on a}} specific machine with the same ingredients fed into the process (a batch) are test-fired through the gun. Many different batches will be tested in this manner, and the pellets which give the smallest consistent group size without fliers (shots which fall outside of the main group) will be selected (small but inconsistent group sizes are not useful to a top competitor); and the shooter will then purchase several {{tens of thousands of}} pellets from that batch. Group sizes of 4.5 mm diameter are theoretically possible, but practically shot groups of 5.0 mm are considered highly competitive. Unbatched ammunition, especially if the air gun is not regularly cleaned, is generally thought to be capable of only 8.0 mm diameter group sizes. <b>Batch</b> <b>testing</b> match pellets for a particular gun is not generally thought to be worthwhile until the shooter reaches a high proficiency level (around the 95% level (570 for men, 380 for women).|$|E
50|$|Issues which affect data {{longevity}} of nominally archival-grade discs include the following: dye failure (discs with premium organic and pthalocyanine-based long-life dyes are more suitable); bonding failure (premium bonding agents and edge-to-edge coverage improve longevity); scratches,minimised by careful handling and a scratch-resistant coating; production quality (some factories have better quality control standards, and discs from a batch {{known to be}} good may be more reliable than another <b>batch).</b> <b>Testing</b> is required since conditions vary from machine to machine and from disc to disc; environmental control is required to prevent damaging conditions. When these conditions are met {{it is believed that}} the life of an archival-quality CD-R or DVD-R can be as long as 100 years, compared to the typical five to ten years for non-archival quality optical discs. The ISO 9660 standard specifies a stable room temperature of 18 - 23°C (64-73 º F) with relative humidity of 30% to 50%. Keeping multiple copies of discs is necessary for added protection. “One Master, stored under optimal conditions, one Working copy to be used for access purposes or copying, and one Safety copy to be stored at a different location.” According to the Institute of Conservation the container most suitable for storage is a rigid high-quality case made from inert polyester placed vertically.|$|E
50|$|Although an {{international}} toy safety standard exists, nations {{around the world}} still create their own legislation and standards to address the issue.Current toy safety standards focus on design principles and rely on <b>batch</b> <b>testing</b> of samples to assure safety. As has {{been seen in the}} large scale recalls of 2007, sample testing can miss non-conforming product. A design may be conceptually safe, but without control of the production, the design may not be met by the manufacturer. Similarly, the applicable toy safety standards to which a toy is tested by a laboratory may not discover a hazard in a product: in the case of 2007's magnetic toy recalls and the Bindeez recall, the products in question met the requirements laid down in the applicable safety standard, yet were found to present an inherent risk.Proposed process and quality control standards, similar to the ISO 9000 systems, seek to eliminate production errors and control materials to avoid deviation from the design.The creation of manufacturing quality standards for toys will help ensure consistency of production. Using a continual improvement model, production can be subject to constant scrutiny, rather than assuming the compliance of all production by testing random samples.In October and November 2007, mandatory third party testing by companies such as LGA, Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS Consumer Testing Services was proposed by regulators in the EU and US, to a (possibly new) international standard, requiring a new safety mark. There is no indication that the proposals will address manufacturing control.|$|E

In this study, parallel aerobic and anoxic <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> {{were conducted on}} the same mixtures of wastewater and mixed liquor drawn from anoxic-aerobic activated sludge systems. By equating the readily biodegradable (RB) COD concentrations in the aerobic and anoxic <b>batch</b> <b>tests,</b> the anoxic yield was determined {{in terms of the}} respective measured oxygen and nitrate utilizations and the aerobic yield. Additionally, the aerobic and anoxic yield coefficients were directly determined by using defined quantities of the artificial RBCOD acetate. The wastewater <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> demonstrated that the OHO anoxic yield is reduced to approximately 81 % (0. 54) of the aerobic value (0. 67 mgCOD/mgCOD). The anoxic:aerobic yield ratio (0. 81) was confirmed independently in the acetate <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> at 0. 84, and closely equals that predicted theoretically from thermodynamic and bioenergetic principles (0. 83).

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} the soil solids {{concentration}} in <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> on the measured values of the partition coefficient (Kp) of organic pollutants in landfill liner-soil material was inves-tigated. Since this study {{was based on the}} results of <b>batch</b> and column <b>tests</b> conducted independently, there were limitations to the conclusions derived. The organic com-pounds tested were benzene, methylene chloride, toluene, trichloroethylene, and p-xylene. The results of this study showed that as soil solids concentrations increased, the measured Kp values of these organic compounds strongly decreased. The observed values of Kp stabilized when the soil solids concentration was above a certain value. Typical Kp values obtained from <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> conducted under high soil solids concentrations were close to those obtained from column tests. It was concluded that the Kp values of organic compounds measured under low soil solids concentrations, i. e., less than 100 g/l, may not correctly simulate the field situation. Consequently, the values of Kp obtained with low soil solids concentrations can result in an overestima-tion of the retardation factor of the landfill liner material.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{suitability}} of food wastes for anaerobic digestion is made difficult because of variable and uncertain degradation parameters. Simpler tests that can estimate degradation kinetics can make it quicker and less expensive to assess suitability. The purpose of the research {{was to examine the}} correspondence of first-order rate constants between laboratory <b>testing</b> of <b>batch</b> and continuous-feed systems. The feedstock for the experiments was a food waste developed to simulate residential collection. <b>Batch</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted using 120 g of food waste with 1. 5 L of digested sewage sludge as inoculum. Continuous feed tests were conducted in 30 L digesters with daily feed/wasting and a hydraulic retention time of 30 days. Methane production was fit to a first-order rate equation with a resulting 0. 22 d- 1 rate over 13 reactors. The overall fitted methane yield for <b>batch</b> <b>tests</b> varied greatly from 0. 15 to 0. 56 L CH 4 /g VS, although no signs of souring were seen.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} a generalization {{of the classic}} sequential testing problem, asking to identify the correct state of a given series system that consists of independent stochastic components. In this setting, costly tests are required to examine the state of individual components, which are sequentially tested until the correct system state can be uniquely identified. The goal is to propose a policy that minimizes the expected testing cost, given a-priori probabilistic information on the stochastic nature of each individual component. Unlike the classic setting, where variables are tested one after the other, we allow multiple tests to be conducted simultaneously, {{at the expense of}} incurring an additional set-up cost. The main contribution of this article consists in showing that the <b>batch</b> <b>testing</b> problem can be approximated in polynomial time within factor inline image, for any fixed inline image. In addition, we explain how, in spite of its highly nonlinear objective function, the <b>batch</b> <b>testing</b> problem can be formulated as an approximate integer program of polynomial size, while blowing up its expected cost by a factor of at most inline image. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments, to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of these algorithms as well as to evaluate their limitations...|$|E

In North America, alum is a common coagulant used in this process, resulting in the requirement for disposal of significant amounts of alum residual solids. Anticipated improved water quality treatment guidelines for trace metals such as arsenic in North America will result in more alum waste being generated in the future and hence increased pressure on water utilities to examine monofilling of alum-based residual solids to reduce waste management costs. GCLs are a potential cost-effective liner system for this type of application. However, there is currently a paucity of literature related to aluminium migration through GCLs. This paper presents results of GCL hydraulic conductivity, diffusion, and <b>batch</b> <b>testing</b> performed with a simulated WTP monofill leachate. Results of both short term and long term hydraulic conductivity tests show only modest increases in hydraulic conductivity, k, are observed for the tests conditions employed (k< 5 x 10 - 11 m/s).
