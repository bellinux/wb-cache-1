5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> some reported cases.|$|E

5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert <b>Burns</b> <b>in</b> the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|Another riot {{occurred}} in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, during a co-headlining tour with Metallica. Prior to Guns N' Roses' appearance, Metallica's set {{was cut short}} after singer-guitarist James Hetfield suffered second-degree <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> a pyrotechnics accident. However, Guns N' Roses was unable to go on stage early, because Rose once again was late arriving at the venue. Nearly an hour into their show, Rose complained of voice problems before walking off stage, following which a riot erupted in downtown Montreal, resulting in an estimated $400,000 in damages. In November of that year, Rose was convicted of property damage and assault {{in relation to the}} Riverport riot; he was fined $50,000 and received two years' probation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} possible to remedy screen burn-in {{through the use}} of remedial software and remedial devices. This displays random colors on every pixel of the panel to fix the burn-in, but in severe cases (like physical damage) this may not resolve the problem. In the case of OLED screens on Android phones, burn-in reduction apps can display an inverted image of the navigation and status bars (which are constantly displayed and therefore the most likely elements to be <b>burned</b> <b>in)</b> to <b>burn</b> <b>in</b> opposite pattern, resulting in a screen that is entirely <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> (i.e. the entire display is dimmer than it was from the factory, but there are now no visibly <b>burned</b> <b>in</b> patterns).|$|R

5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
5|$|Radioland Murders is a 1994 comedy mystery film {{directed}} by Mel Smith and co-written and produced by George Lucas. Radioland Murders {{is set in}} the 1939 atmosphere of old-time radio and pays homage to the screwball comedy films of the 1930s. The film tells the story of writer Roger Henderson trying to settle relationship issues with his wife while dealing with a whodunit murder mystery in a radio station. The film stars an ensemble cast, including Brian Benben, Mary Stuart Masterson, Scott Michael Campbell, Michael Lerner and Ned Beatty. Radioland Murders also features numerous small roles and cameo appearances, including Michael McKean, Bobcat Goldthwait, Jeffrey Tambor, Christopher Lloyd, George <b>Burns</b> (<b>in</b> his final film appearance), Billy Barty and Rosemary Clooney.|$|E

5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree <b>burns,</b> <b>In</b> the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously <b>burns</b> <b>in</b> air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
