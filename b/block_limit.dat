50|$|The {{system is}} {{failsafe}} {{in that the}} lack of code would display a Restricting signal. The codes would be transmitted to the train from the <b>block</b> <b>limit</b> in front of it. This way if the rail was broken or another train entered the block, any codes would not reach the onrushing train and the cab signal would again display Restricting. Trains with an insufficient number of axles will not short out all of the cab signal current so that following trains might receive an incorrect aspect. Trains of this type must be given absolute block protection to the rear.|$|E

40|$|Rigid <b>block</b> <b>limit</b> {{analysis}} {{provides a}} simple method for computing rigorous upper bound solutions on {{the stability of}} geotechnical problems. The method requires the topology of a collapse mechanism to be defined a priori, from which an expression for stability is derived. For complex mechanisms optimizing these expressions using multivariate search algorithms requires enormous computational effort, and the initial feasible solution needed for local optimisation algorithms are difficult to obtain. This paper describes a method for successively subdividing blocks within a collapse mechanism, increasing its complexity gradually and allowing simple univariate optimization algorithms to be used. The performance of this technique is demonstrated by computing the bearing capacity factor for a strip footing on weightless fissured clay and the undrained stability of a circular tunnel. The techniques developed in this paper are shown to provide a robust method for solving rigid block problems with demanding material behaviour and complex geometry...|$|E

40|$|In rigid <b>block</b> <b>limit</b> {{analysis}} of masonry structures, an infinite compressive is usually assumed at contact interfaces. This assumption is generally suitable to model unreinforced masonry structures with dry-joint or poor quality mortar joints, such as historical buildings, whose behaviour is mainly governed by nil or low tensile strength, sliding and rocking failure. Nevertheless, crushing could significantly affect the collapse behaviour of masonry structures, {{as it is}} the case of strengthened masonry. Indeed, the use of strengthening devices, such as metal ties or composite strips, may produce stress concentration in compression and, as a consequence, crushing failure of masonry panels. In this paper an efficient iterative solution procedure is presented to model crushing failure in 3 D limit {{analysis of}} masonry block structures using mathematical programming. A concave contact model is adopted for interfaces, with contact points located at the corners of the interface to represent interactions. A no-tension and non-associative frictional behaviour with limited compressive strength is considered for joints. The limit analysis problem is formulated as a second order cone programming problem (SOCP). The accuracy and the computational efficiency of the proposed formulation are evaluated comparing the results of the proposed formulation with those obtained from experimental tests and alternative formulations from the literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an investigation about {{the capabilities of}} simplified kinematic limit analysis for the safety evaluation and {{for the design of}} strengthening of masonry historical buildings. Limit analysis allows, with a reduced number of mechanical properties and for a given ultimate condition of the structure, affordable safety analysis and design of strengthening to the practitioners. Masonry buildings subjected to earthquake show in most cases local failure mechanisms rather than global failure mechanisms {{due to the lack of}} integrity of structure. For this reason, simplified kinematic limit analysis has been accepted as a method to design the strengthening of masonry buildings, according to the Italian Ordinance (O. P. C. M. 3431). To validate the applicability of this method, its results had been compared with those provided by three dimensional macro <b>block</b> <b>limit</b> analysis (Bustamante, 2003) for the Via Arizzi house. It is worth noting that results of simplified kinematic limit analysis provided similar results as those achieved by 3 D macro block. Also this method was implemented to seismic safety assessment of Tekyeh Amir Chakhmagh in Iran based on the results obtained for the out of plane and in plane behaviour of walls. Tekyeh Amir Chakhmagh is an early 19 th century tiled edifice that was built to serve as grand-stand for watching religious rites and also provided an imposing entrance to Amir Chakhmagh bazaar.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate {{the reliability of the}} two formulations most commonly used in modeling the geometric contact of dry-stacked stone blocks, i. e. those based on concave and convex contact assumptions. Methods: A comparison between these two formulations for the yield domains of torsion and torsion-shear interaction is carried out; the analytical results are then compared with experimental outcomes existing in the literature and difference percentages are evaluated in terms of shear forces. For both formulations, the reference model of two dry-stacked rigid blocks is adopted with the hypotheses of infinite compressive strength for blocks, absence of tensile strength and frictional behaviour at their contact. Findings: The analysis underlines that the convex formulation provides more reliable results in terms of both pure torsion and interaction between torsion and shear. In fact, the percentage difference between experimental and analytical shear forces results to be very small in this case, while a great difference is estimated for concave formulation, both for pure torsion and torsion-shear interaction. Then a possible correction of the torsion capacity in the concavity model is proposed assuming a proper reduction of the contact area. This simple criterion allows obtaining a good agreement of the yield domains with those obtained by convexity model and experimental results. With the proposed correction the simplicity of the algorithms of the concave formulation can find interesting applications in rigid <b>block</b> <b>limit</b> analysis, especially for non-associative friction solutions of 3 D masonry block assemblages, thanks to the very low computational effort compared with all the other existing solution procedures. Application/Improvements: Additional experimental work is being carried out to fully validate such correction and to investigate its effect on the torsion-bending moment interaction...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} a comparison {{has been made}} between on one side the Dutch signalling system with ATB-EG train protection {{and on the other}} side the European signalling system ETCS Level 2. The minimum feasible headway times at bottlenecks for both systems have been compared. A selection has been made of the 22 most relevant train sequences on six often occurring infrastructure layouts. For each layout, the positioning of signals (for ATB) or block limits (for ETCS) has been sought that leads to the lowest feasible headway time for between one and four train sequences. To enable fast calculation and comparison of the headway times at different signal positionings a spreadsheet calculation model has been developed for both signalling systems. In 15 of the 22 train sequences, the European system ETCS L 2 yielded a shorter headway time than the Dutch system ATB-EG. The improvements ranged from 1, 1 s to 21, 3 s, which corresponds to savings of up to 21 %. In the other 7 train sequences, the headway times found in {{this research}} for ETCS L 2 were higher than those that could be reached in the Dutch signalling system when applying the appropriate signal positions. When averaged over all 22 train sequences, ETCS L 2 gives a 4, 5 % reduction of the headway time. When only averaging the 16 train sequences that don’t involve freight trains, the reduction more than doubles to an average of 9, 3 %. The main differences between the two signalling systems that contribute to the better performance of the European system are the fact that the braking curves are block-independent, train-dependant and speed-dependant and that there is a very low minimum block length. The research presented three types of limitations that could prevent signals from being placed on the exact location where they would be needed (level crossings, overhead section breaks and neutral overhead section breaks) and investigated the sensitivity of the found minimum headway times, which showed that the values found for ETCS L 2 are much more robust and that the required <b>block</b> <b>limit</b> positionings contain much more flexibility. The results from the research were applied on the corridor Weesp – Almere Oostvaarders, showing again that ETCS would bring more buffer time increases and require less infrastructure adaptations. To improve the accuracy of future studies comparing the Dutch and European signalling systems, focus should be put on obtaining more certainty about the ETCS braking curves of the representative Dutch passenger rolling stock.
