40|$|The debt {{collection}} process in Anglo-American law {{is based on}} the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right to receive payment from liquidation of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets.</b> Judicial procedures are available to the unsecured creditor for the purpose of converting the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets</b> to cash. Whenever the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s matured liabilities are greater than his assets, the collection process may be characterized as one of 2 ̆ 2 grab law 2 ̆ 2 in which the first creditors to take the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets</b> succeed in effectuating collection. It is an economic necessity for creditors to have an efficient collection mechanism which gives them maximum protection in the event of default by the debtor. Nonetheless, all states shield the debtor from complete destitution by keeping certain property, for example, life insurance proceeds, beyond the reach of creditors. By permitting the debtor to keep those assets necessary for his economic survival, state exemption laws fulfill important social policies which must be balanced against the need for creditor protection. When a debtor files a petition in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee takes title to most of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s property, thereby enabling the trustee to liquidate the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets</b> for the benefit of creditors. The twofold purpose of federal bankruptcy law is to give the debtor a fresh start by discharging his debts and to make an efficient, fair, and equitable distribution of the debtor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>assets</b> among his creditors. By recognizing exemptions, both the Bankruptcy Act now in effect and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 permit the debtor to keep those assets needed for a fresh start while protecting the rights of creditors with respect to the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s nonexempt property...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) on U. <b>S.</b> <b>asset</b> prices (nominal and inflation-indexed bonds, stocks, and U.

Estimation {{results show that the}} LSAP news has economically large and highly significant effects on asset prices, even after controlling for the surprise component of the Fed's conventional target rate decision and communication about its future path of policy. This study documents that the cumulative financial market impact of the Fed's LSAP program is equivalent to an unanticipated cut in the federal funds target rate that ranges between zero (for three-month yields) and 197 basis points (for ten-year yields), with the response of stock prices and foreign exchanges lying within this interval. These point estimates are, however, surrounded by considerable uncertainty. By looking at the cross-asset reactions, this work concludes that, for most U. <b>S.</b> <b>asset</b> prices, the effects of asset purchases are not statistically different from an unanticipated cut in the fed funds target rate. Finally, the response of U.

40|$|The global {{imbalance}} {{explanation of}} the financial crisis of 2007 – 09 suggests that demand for riskless assets from countries with current account surpluses created fragility in countries with current account deficits, most notably in the United States. This paper examines this explanation by analyzing the geography of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits set up by large commercial banks. The paper shows that banks in surplus countries as well as banks in deficit countries manufactured riskless assets, totaling over $ 1. 2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U. S. money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U. <b>S.</b> <b>assets.</b> As negative information about U. <b>S.</b> <b>assets</b> became apparent in August 2007, banks in both surplus and deficit countries experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result suffered significant losses.

In the total default scenario, the value of the risky asset drops to zero when default occurs whereas, in the partial default case, the proceeds from the liquidation of the risky asset amount to 50...|$|R

Working Papers describe research in progress by the author(s) and are published to elicit comments and to further debate. We use a general-equilibrium model to explain the rise in global trade and payments imbalances since the mid- 1990 s, and then to construct adjustment paths to a steady state. Assuming that the shocks giving rise to the imbalances do not suddenly reverse, simulated movements in the U. S. trade deficit and exchange rate are smaller and more gradual than suggested by partial-equilibrium analyses. An important factor reducing the size of the adjustments is a simulated real interest rate on U. S. external liabilities that is below both the interest rate on external assets and the U.

In addition, the adjustment takes place over an extended period without significantly raising the share of U. <b>S.</b> <b>assets</b> in foreign portfolios, in part because depreciation of the dollar requires continued foreign accumulation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>assets</b> just to keep their portfolio share constant...|$|R

Yet within this rapid increase in total assets lies a remarkable fact: the percentage of all assets that can be considered “safe ” has remained very stable over time.
