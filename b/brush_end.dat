Larvae {{hatching}} from eggs enter wheat kernels to complete immature development. Four laboratory experiments {{were conducted to}} understand the wheat kernel infestation by first instars of R. dominica at 28 °C and 65 % r. h. The first experiment compared different kernel to first instar ratios on sound hard red winter (HRW) wheat class, probability of successful infestation, and subsequent adult development as affected by site of feeding on the kernels. Infested kernels were dissected 21 d after infestation to determine stage of development and larval weight. Development of larvae to adulthood was monitored for 50 d from time of infestation. Different kernel to first instar ratios did not affect probability of infestation, entry site preferences, larval development and weight, and days to adult emergence. In the second experiment one first instar was placed with a kernel on each of seven different wheat classes. Wheat kernels were artificially-damaged with a microdrill at the germ, endosperm, and <b>brush</b> <b>end,</b> and the sound kernels served as the controls. At 21 d, 82 - 90 % of artificially-damaged HRW wheat kernels were infested by larvae versus 12 % for sound kernels. Five times fewer hard white (HW) wheat sound kernels were infested by larvae compared with infestation in soft white (SW) wheat kernels. Sound kernels of durum, soft red winter (SRW), hard red spring (HRS), and hard white spring (HWS) wheat classes were more resistant to larval infestation than artificially-damaged kernels. Majority of first instars preferred germ as the entry site on HRW, HWW, SRW, and HWS wheat classes. Germ entry promoted faster larval development, leading to heavier larvae, and higher kernel weight losses. Adult emergence was earlier by 3 - 7 d compared with other sites across all 6 wheat classes, except for SWW class, where adult emergence was nil at 50 d. In the third experiment, speed of larval development on artificially-drilled HRW wheat kernels on different kernel sites. Three-hundred kernels each were drilled near the germ, endosperm, and <b>brush</b> <b>end,</b> and one first instar was placed per kernel in a glass vial. Kernels from glass vials were dissected every 3 d for 30 d and larval head capsule was measured. Larval development was fastest on the germ, followed by endosperm, and <b>brush</b> <b>end.</b> In the fourth experiment short-term feeding by R. dominica adults on infestation by first instars on sound wheat kernels was determined. Two laboratory tests were conducted with single and grouped (10) kernels using either two adults or two first instars per kernel. Signs of feeding were monitored for 21 d in single kernels and 7 d in grouped kernels. There was a significant association between adult feeding and larval infestation responses in single and group kernel tests. In conclusion, understanding {{factors that contribute to}} first instar establishment in wheat kernels will have impacts in breeding varieties that could be resistant and designing grain-handling equipment to minimize grain damage to mitigate R. dominica infestation of wheat...|$|E

40|$|Flat carbon anodes placed near a cathode in a {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) are adversely affected by oxygen crossover, but graphite fiber brush anodes placed near the cathode produce high power densities. The impact of the brush size and electrode spacing was examined by varying {{the distance of the}} <b>brush</b> <b>end</b> from the cathode and solution conductivity in multiple MFCs. The startup time was increased from 8 ± 1 days with full brushes (all buffer concentrations) to 13 days (50 mM), 14 days (25 mM) and 21 days (8 mM) when 75 % of the brush anode was removed. When MFCs were all first acclimated with a full brush, up to 65 % of the brush material could be removed without appreciably altering maximum power. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the main source of internal resistance (IR) was diffusion resistance, which together with solution resistance reached 100 Ω. The IR using EIS compared well with that obtained using the polarization data slope method, indicating no major components of IR were missed. These results show that using full brush anodes avoids adverse effects of oxygen crossover during startup, although brushes are much larger than needed to sustain high power. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} polyurethane percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube degradation and the role played by fungi. The inner surfaces of 20 used polyurethane tubes were brushed, and the <b>brushing</b> <b>end</b> was incubated for 7 days in Saburaud broth and cultured if fungal growth occurred. Three tubes used for 12 (sample 12 w), 17 (sample 17 w), and 96 (sample 96 w) weeks and two new tubes were cut to produce several 4 -cm-long equal halves. Six samples from the new tubes were considered control samples (Co sample), seven were incubated in Saburaud broth (Co sample + Sa.), and seven in the broth supplemented with Candida albicans (Co sample + Sa. + Ca). All samples underwent morphological examination by electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC). All tubes had fungal colonization. DSC showed deterioration in all tubes including the new ones; adding Candida albicans had no additional effects. Morphological examination by electron microscopy showed a regular pattern in the Co sample, and thick biofilm, holes, and crevices in samples 12 w, 17 w, and 96 w. The more the tubes had been used, the more severe were the changes. The Co sample + Sa and the Co sample + Sa + Ca showed no changes in the inner surface, but cryogenically fractured surfaces had holes and crevices. Yeasts constantly colonize PEG tubes and are likely to contribute to polyurethane deterioration. The impairment of new PEG tubes incubated in Saburaud broth suggests that other factors also play a role in polyurethane deterioration...|$|R
