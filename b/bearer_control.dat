5000|$|BICC {{signaling}} {{messages are}} {{nearly identical to}} those in ISDN User Part (ISUP); the main difference being that the narrowband circuit identification code (CIC) has been modified. The BICC architecture consists of interconnected serving nodes that provide the call service function and the <b>bearer</b> <b>control</b> function. The call service function uses BICC signaling for call setup and may also interwork with ISUP. The <b>bearer</b> <b>control</b> function receives directives from the call service function via BICC <b>Bearer</b> <b>Control</b> Protocol (ITU-T recommendation Q.1950) and is responsible for setup and teardown of bearer paths {{on a set of}} physical transport links. Transport links are most commonly Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Internet Protocol (IP).|$|E

40|$|Wide-spread {{provision}} of broadband multimedia services requires a powerful signaling system, {{which does not}} exist yet. Future signaling will have to support calls with several participants, several connections and heterogeneous terminals. This paper introduces a new framework for an overall signaling system {{designed to meet the}} requirements of multimedia services. An object-oriented call model allows the composition of complex multimedia calls. Three major innovations concern the control tasks in the network. The proposed approach uses condensed call and resource control, i. e. only a single network node is active for a single call. This simplifies control tasks and reduces coordination efforts. An additional resource control level supports calls with heterogeneous terminals by introducing special resources, like e. g. coding converters. Finally, signaling protocols for call control, resource control and <b>bearer</b> <b>control</b> are separated and independent. This offers the possibility to have [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Sophisticated {{signalling}} protocols {{are required to}} properly handle the complex multimedia, multiparty services supported by the forthcoming BISDN. The implementation feasibility of these protocols should be evaluated during their design phase, so that possible performance bottlenecks are identified and removed. In this paper we present a methodology for evaluating the performance of BISDN signalling systems under design. New performance parameters are introduced and their network-dependent values are extracted through a message flow model which has the capability to describe the impact of call and <b>bearer</b> <b>control</b> separation on the signalling performance. Signalling protocols are modelled through a modular decomposition of the seven OSI layers including the service user to three submodels. The workload model is user descriptive {{in the sense that}} it does not approximate the direct input traffic required for evaluating the performance of a layer protocol; instead, through a multi-level approach, it describes the actual implications of user signalling activity for the general signalling traffic. The signalling protocol model is derived from the global functional model of the {{signalling protocols}} and information flows using a network of queues incorporating synchronization and dependency functions. The same queueing approach is followed for the signalling transfer network which is used to define processing speed and signalling bandwidth requirements and to identify possible performance bottle-necks stemming from the realization of the related protocols.

50|$|Guy Gardner {{was trained}} to use a Green Lantern power ring, which is only limited by the user's will power. He later {{acquired}} Sinestro's Qwardian power ring, which was later revealed {{to be based on}} the <b>bearer's</b> <b>control</b> of fear. This early version of a yellow power ring was powered by absorbing plasma radiation that had been expelled from a Green Lantern ring and seemed to make Guy more invulnerable than a normal Green Lantern power-ring. He used both for basic Lantern abilities including constructs, flight, and energy projection, though it also caused him some difficulty on occasion. For example, if he asked it a question he would get an answer in Qwardian, which he didn't speak. In Green Lantern: Rebirth #6 it is mentioned that Guy Gardner's ring is constantly sparking with energy, as if unable to contain the power of his will. Following Kyle Rayner's apparent death, Guy's rage caused a red power ring to latch onto him, bestowing on him the ability to generate napalm like flames that would burn even in space. Unlike most Red Lanterns, Guy retained his intelligence, and, like Hal Jordan when he was under the thrall of a red ring, Guy was able to shape the red flames into solid constructs. Unlike Hal, Guy's green ring remained active, allowing him to combine the two lights and obliterate the Black Lanterns and their rings. Guy was also the first male character seen to wield a love-powered Star Sapphire ring, wearing it in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring (he stated that the result felt like he had blood and sugar in his mouth). During the events of the Green Lanterns: The Lost Army, Guy created a new uniform using both his green and red rings. Later during the final battle, the Power Converters used by Lightsmiths, converted Guy's Red Lantern Ring to a Green Lantern ring, thus ending his connection to the Red Lantern Corps.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} notorious chameleonic and {{metamorphic}} abilities, capitalism modifies societies, through silent historical pathways, indelible processes and accurate objectives. Following its nature, capitalism appropriates the formerly autonomous realm of arts, until then {{ruled by the}} independence and specific rules of the artists, <b>bearers</b> of <b>control</b> instruments, and specific mechanisms of choice and selection. The primal incompatibility between the artistic field and capitalism move into a stage where societies are steadily transformed in the consecration of an ‘artsy’ world, present in multiple dimensions, from the fashion industry to architecture, cinema and shopping malls, uttered in tasteless and swift changes. The authors reflect {{on the existence of}} a society based on hybridity, a constant search for pleasure, seduction and novelty, enterprising an impoverished artistic economy, disconnected from the erudite culture which reaches its climax in the ‘hypermodern epoch’, being characterised by ‘trans-aesthetic capitalism’ globally. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The village was one of seven northern bases for the Iroquois from which to hunt beaver and other fur <b>bearers</b> and to <b>control</b> the flow of furs from the north and west to the markets at Albany. The village was located on or near the fertile and productive soils of the Hay Bay area, near Fredericksburg and Cataraqui. The exact location of the village has not been determined.|$|R
50|$|The {{final three}} {{strategies}} {{appear to be}} theoretical at this point. One {{is the creation of}} a <b>bearer</b> corporation which <b>controls</b> the land. The upside to this from the artists' perspective is that the land would have strong legal protection, but they question whether corporate control is the proper way to achieve it. Another is creating a Limited Common Property Regime. This is seen as acceptable if one can include the entire world as members of the regime, but they have doubts about whether or not that would be possible. The final is creating a land trust. However, this would require private ownership and thus is likely to be rejected.|$|R
50|$|Created by Jorsin Alkestes and Ezra, Curoch is {{the partner}} blade to Iures. Like Iures, Curoch can take any form that the bearer wishes, as Neph Dada {{demonstrated}} in the Hall of Winds. However, while Iures gives the <b>bearer</b> greater <b>control</b> over magic (allowing them to create or undo weaves with greater precision) Curoch amplifies the bearer's power to an extreme degree. With {{the vast majority of}} mages, this amplification exceeds what the bearer's body can handle, with only the strongest mages in the trilogy being capable of handling Curoch even at its lowest levels of power. The two best examples of Curoch's power are when Solon Tofusin used it to kill all the meisters using their vir during Roth's coup in Cenaria, when Jorsin Alkestes used it to blow apart the magic that was giving the krul form in the Alkestian Cycle (an era predating the time in which the Trilogy is set), and when Kylar uses Curoch to kill Neph Dada, euthanise Elene, and kill Khali, who was possessing her at the time. Curoch is also responsible for the destruction of the vir as it destroyed Khali, the goddess who supplied the vir to the Khalidorians. Curoch is the blade that Lantano Garuwashi originally believed to be the Blade of Heaven.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{signaling}} and the Intelligent Network (IN) concept can be exploited to support mobility in an ATM-based network with wireless access parts and mobile users. The proposed architecture exploits the enhanced service control processing features offered by the IN technology to support location management. The access signaling protocol structure {{is based on the}} principles of separation between call and <b>bearer</b> channel <b>control,</b> employed in fixed broadband access networks. The design objective is to minimize the changes required to the wired network signaling, by taking advantage of the well-developed capability sets. This allows the easy introduction of the wireless ATM technology (W-ATM) into the real world. It is shown that the proposed signaling protocol model provides cost-effective implementations without degrading the agreed Quality of Service (QoS) and the system's performance. A comparative signaling performance evaluation is carried-out to demonstrate the impact of the proposed signaling protocol architecture onto various performance measures and to quantify the relative gains. The obtained results can be used for network design purposes in a large-scale private installation supporting many users. The signaling protocol architecture aims for private W-ATM networks, but can be readily extended to fulfill the signaling requirements of public environment broadband wireless systems.

30|$|Other {{algorithms}} {{have focused}} on providing a guaranteed bit rate. In [13], Mongha et al. present a decoupled time/frequency domain scheduler intended for providing a target bit rate to GBR <b>bearers</b> and fairness <b>control</b> to non-GBR <b>bearers.</b> The proposal of Zaki et al. in [14] {{is based on the}} previous one, but it includes a relative prioritization between the bearers of the different QoS classes. Mongha’s and Zaki’s proposals do not increase the user’s priority when the HOL packet delay approaches its upper bound, and therefore, they are not well suited to satisfy the PDB. In [15], Gora proposes a QoS-aware resource management for LTE-A-based relay networks. Although his proposal concentrates on multi-hop relays, it presents valuable utility functions to satisfy the GBR and/or the PDB for real-time traffic. However, his proposal has been neither designed nor evaluated in a traffic mix scenario with several QCIs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{environment}} in which services are provisioned in existing networks {{has a number of}} shortcomings. Neither the service domain nor the services therein have a standardised structure. Signalling between terminals and services uses network protocols that are inappropriately oriented towards <b>bearer</b> management. The <b>control</b> of <b>bearer</b> connections, and the view of call states, is maintained in the network layer, making bearer management difficult and limited. A service-centric service provisioning environment is proposed, which advocates a structured service domain, and a structured approach to service development and provisioning. A direct communication path between terminals and services at the application layer, that utilises high-level, service-oriented protocols, is proposed. Control of the call / session layer and the bearer network, and view of connection states is relocated to the application layer, facilitating bearer manipulation by services located in the service domain. It is shown that the capabilities and features of services provisioned in the proposed service provisioning environment are of a greater range, more advanced and more complex. It is also shown that the proposed service provisioning environment brings about potential efficiency gains for the initiation of 2 -party calls, and significant efficiency gains for the initiation of multiparty calls...|$|R
50|$|On rare occasions, she {{can decide}} to grant a male {{follower}} or a follower with no priestly powers who nevertheless follow her cause with the temporary ability to manifest her moonfire. It is Dark Maidens most iconic spell, {{a beacon of}} light, whose intensity and color can be controlled by the creator at will (ranging from a faint glow to a clear, bright -but not blinding- light). Moonfire has the same intensity as moonlight, and it is generally used as a light source for reading, {{to see in the}} dark, as a signal for communication or for artistic purposes. Manifested moonfire can move as the creator wished and around the creators body as fast as desired, however it moves up to 6.6 feet per second when far from the casters body. The manifester can guide it in any direction, through any opening, and cause the glow to appear in any size. Eilistraee gifts her moonfire to show her blessing or support, or simply to provide some light. However, the lucky <b>bearer</b> has no <b>control</b> over the moonfires duration, intensity, or location—such things are solely up to the goddess.|$|R
40|$|Seasonal hair {{replacement}} in the brushtail possum {{was described}} using skin histology and fibre measurement. Possums {{were held in}} individual cages under conditions of natural light and temperature for an observation period of 26 months, and skin and fibre samples taken from the mid dorso-lateral position at three week intervals. Counts of hair follicles from transverse sections were used to measure hair follicle activity, and changes in compound follicles. Periods of hair growth were poorly synchronized between individuals, and peak levels of follicle activity did not exceed 40 percent. Derived follicles continued to form in mature possums. The number of follicles present in compound follicles increased {{by an average of}} 23 percent per annum, amongst six adult animals of various ages. Much of the fibre growth in possum skin was therefore attributable to follicle neogenesis. On average, only 13 percent of fur fibres were replaced per annum. Primary central follicles producing guard hairs undergo normal shedding and replacement cycles. Levels of growth and seasonal variation amongst members of the original wild population were similar to those of captive animals. Using skin pigmentation as an indicator of hair growth (or "moult"), a survey of commercially collected pelts also verified the high individual variation and tendency for spring-summer growth. Also, variation in the proportions of pigmented pelts over time differed between males and females, and pigmentation was greater in juveniles than in adults. A diffuse topographic growth pattern in possums was demonstrated by fur dyeing and skin pigment patterns. However, much fur growth in possums occured in discrete patches which were attributable to repair of fur lost in intraspecific encounters. Growth of this type was most prevalent about the time of breeding in May, when 89 percent of pelts showed moderate or heavy patchy growth. The median duration of pluck induced follicle activity was 82 days, and growth time of guard hairs was 99 days. These times did not vary with differing ambient temperatures. Peak growth rates were 0. 63 mm/day for pluck induced, and 0. 58 mm/day for spontaneously growing guard hairs. The force required to extract fibres varied from 0. 88 g/fibre under anaesthesia to 0. 05 g/fibre shortly after death. Findings were discussed in relation to hair growth in eutherian fur <b>bearers,</b> possible <b>control</b> factors, and commercial management of the species...|$|R
