40|$|The authors present {{simulation}} {{results on the}} benefits of alternative power tariffs for Nigeria and Indonesia, based on several closely related models of the firm. Nigeria is representative of developing countries where the public sector is inefficient and manufacturers provide their own electricity to compensate for that inefficiency. The use of private generators by Nigerian manufacturers is virtually ubiquitous, even though the government, to protect its monopoly, did not encourage that use in the 1980 s. About 89 percent of a sample of Nigerian firms produced some of their power needs internally. But many large firms underused their power plants because of the substantial quantity discounts public power offered to large manufacturers. By contrast, in Indonesia, manufacturers were offered only slight quantity discounts for public power. Indonesia has encouraged manufacturers to produce their own power. About 61 percent of Indonesian manufacturers produced some power internally. Generally, in both countries firms purchase some power from the public sector at a quantitydiscount (slight in Indonesia, considerable in Nigeria) and also produce power internally at a declining marginal cost. The reliability of public power declines as the total quantity purchased increases, because transmission gets congested. Simulations confirm that an increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> is optimal in each country and produces savings in the cost of producing public power and in firms'operating costs (including the firm's cost of producing power internally). Under increasing block tariffs, firms that purchase more public power would be charged higher marginal prices than firms that purchase less. Large firms respond to the increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> by expanding their generating capacity and reducing their reliance on public power, while smaller firms contract their capacities and buy more from the public sector. When congestion in transmission persists, cost savings are higher as the increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> reduces total use of public power which in turn improves reliability. In Nigeria, where strong quantity discounts are offered, total costs savings (for NEPA and manufacturers) under 1989 conditions are about 4 percent without congestion and increase to 9 percent when there is some congestion. In Indonesia, where quantity discounts are mild, increasing the <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> produces only slight cost savings.

Thus, uninterrupted power supply remains a critical challenge facing households in low-income developing countries. In this paper, we use data on household defensive expenditures and willingness to pay (WTP) to analyze households’ preference for improved electricity supply. We provide an estimate of average monthly defensive expenditures at different monthly hours of power outages using the generalized propensity score method – a continuous treatment matching. Furthermore, we elicit households’ willingness to pay for improved electricity supply using the contingent valuation method. To this end, we use a field survey data from 1, 152 sample households in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Our {{results show that the}} estimated average monthly defensive expenditures is substantial and vary by the monthly hours of power outages. Also, results from the stated preference study show that households are willing to pay 19 %– 25 % of the existing average monthly bill for improved electricity supply.

However, {{it is not clear whether}} consumers actually respond to marginal prices under IBT. We empirically analyze whether marginal price in an IBT influences residential electricity demand, by combining administrative monthly electricity bill records with a detailed survey of sample households. Results from a bunching analysis and Arellano-Bond estimator show that prices of electricity do not significantly affect monthly electricity consumption. The finding highlights that consumers do not respond to marginal prices under IBT if electricity price is low or if they are unaware of the pricing schedules and have difficulty in understanding how their bills are computed in such tariff structures. This, in turn, has severe implications for the efficacy of the policy objectives of IBT.

However, in a complex pricing structure, such as increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> (IBT), consumers may not know the marginal price they face and might not fully understand how their bill is computed. Thus, in this study, we investigate whether educating consumers about how their monthly electricity bill is calculated in an IBT structure affects electricity consumption. To evaluate the effect of the treatment, we conduct a field experiment with residential electricity consumers in Ethiopia where electricity price is heavily subsidized and shared connections are common. Using monthly consumption data from the electric meters, we find no statistically significant effect after six months in response to the treatment. Our finding suggests that it is not the lack of billing information that makes residential electricity consumers insensitive to the IBT. Alternative reasons, such as the low electricity price are provided.

40|$|Sustainable and {{responsive}} water management policies {{are essential to}} provide high-quality, reasonably priced drinking water to consumers at any time, while simultaneously ensuring a profit for the water utility. Such goal can be typically achieved through {{two different types of}} policy, namely increasing water supply, or managing water demand; the latter can be performed, among others, through water pricing. Pricing, especially when demand-based, can lead to a behavioural change in customer water use, but it is arduous to introduce for a number of political and social reasons; it is essential to engage with relevant stakeholders to clearly recognize pros and cons of implementing a new water tariff. As a consequence, in this paper, economic and social implications of demand-based tariff structures, and their potential for greater water conservation, are assessed through a participatory approach. The variation of residential water demand and revenue outcomes were simulated through an integrated participatory systems approach by assuming that an inclining <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> was introduced on the Gold Coast region, Australia. Such connection between price, demand, and revenue is highly complex and the choice of System Dynamics for this modelling exercise is considered ideal as it can explicitly handle the non-linearity, feedbacks and interconnections of such system. The simulation model was developed by collaborating with relevant stakeholders, thus ensuring the logical inclusion of all the relevant inputs and connections. Such model integrates three components, namely revenue forecasting; water billing; and demand feedback sub-model. The results show that: a) the inclining <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> can effectively lead to behavioural change and water consumption reduction, especially within the high water users group, although the predicted water savings would be lower than when adopting water restrictions; b) customers’ feedback to an increased cost can be used to achieve revenue neutrality; c) based on customer feedback and modelling simulations, the ideal proportion of customers to be charged with the second <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> is 20 %, however this can be recalculated and varied during wet seasons or dry seasons to optimise water availability. The developed model allows water planners to explore a wide range of policy alternatives (e. g. alternative pricing scenarios to influence demand) over medium to long-term periods and to optimise best-practice decision making for urban water conservation and management.

These tariffs have been criticized in the welfare economic literature due to their perceived inefficiency: many of the prices charged under IBTs do not correspond to marginal costs and thus violate the principle of allocative efficiency. In this paper we explore an alternative interpretation of the widespread use of IBTs, in terms of social preferences and fairness considerations. For this, we rely on an extension of the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) utility function, including inequality aversion, to which we add another parameter representing a preference for redistribution, which reflects a societal preference to correct for income difference perceived as unfair. In addition, the paper also includes household size in the analysis, finding that as poor households are on average larger (in per capita terms), a simple IBT tariff disregarding household size may not be "fair" at all.

The price elasticity value obtained fall within the range of those found in other case studies. Thus, although presenting weak elasticity, price seems {{to play a role in}} water demand management.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2003. A {{water supply}} tariff is a {{powerful}} water management tool {{that can be used}} to promote a number of economic, environmental and social-political objectives. In South Africa, increasing block tariffs are deemed to satisfy the domestic tariff regulations of the Water Services Act of 1997. The regulations require that the tariff supports the viability and sustainability of water supply services to the poor and discourages wasteful or inefficient water use. The application of increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> structures presents a number of problems. The main issue being the size and price of each block. Ramsey pricing proposes that consumer welfare is maximised when the mark-up in price above cost of a good is proportional to the price elasticity of demand of the good. This principle was applied in setting the block prices of an increasing block water tariff. The sizes of the blocks were based on the average water consumption of low, middle and high income consumers. The water demand characteristic of low, middle and high income households from a sample of domestic consumers in Durban were investigated. The water demand functions and price elasticity of demand for the three groups were estimated using econometric models. Two tariff structures based on Ramsey pricing principles were proposed and compared with the current increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariff</b> applied in Durban. The frequency distribution of demand of each of the three consumer groups were applied in a model to ensure the proposed tariffs met a certain revenue target. The water demand functions of each of the consumer groups were used to model how the proposed tariff structures impacted consumer surplus and water demand. The investigation found that increasing block tariffs designed with Ramsey pricing principles have a positive impact on social welfare, provide sufficient revenue for water service providers and support the conservation of water resources...|$|E

For this purpose, we employ a unique data set for Lima, Peru. Our analysis reveals that from a pro-poor perspective, the performance of means-tested tariffs is mixed. On the one hand, they distribute more income to poor households than the IBTs, given {{the assumption that the}} overall revenue to the water supplier remains constant. On the other hand, the share of poor customers who actually benefit from water subsidies declines with means-testing. Nevertheless, means-tested tariffs clearly outperform IBTs in terms of excluding non-poor customers from being subsidized. These findings should be generalized with care as the performance of the tariff crucially depends on the cut-off value for cross-subsidies and the block prices chosen under volumetric targeting and on the design of the means-test. Our analysis further suggests that a proper assessment of individual welfare effects should take household size into account and rest on a broad set of affordability and distributional indicators. Interestingly, our results are relatively insensitive to the price elasticity of water demand...|$|R
50|$|Social {{protection}} measures {{to ensure that}} piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer’s ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and discounts, bill re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing <b>block</b> <b>tariffs</b> with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used {{at the national level}} in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.|$|R
