5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen, in {{particular}} the communes of Sotteville (a large railway town) and Grand-Quevilly, but these towns did not have good enough public transport. Although the CTR had constructed some lines, they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city centre. Line 4 of the CTR, with its central terminus at Place Beauvoisine, ran only as far as the Trianon roundabout {{at the edge of the}} Jardin des Plantes. A southern extension was planned to the Bruyères roundabout, a meeting-point of several roads to the new districts, and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> delayed.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E

In his examination of British screen stars, Geoffrey Macnab agrees, and identifies that although Formby's jokes were about himself, [...] "there was grit in the routines, a resolute denial of self-pity". The Times examined the performer's style of humour, and considered it [...] "often crude, and always simple, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> true humour, and, what is more, it was invariably clean." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{material}} on Bleed American was more accessible and aggressive than its predecessor, {{which had a}} more [...] "layered, sprawling sound." [...] In regard to the stylistic approach of the album, frontman Jim Adkins said, “Things still got pretty gnarly in the studio as far as experimentation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> to an end that was complimentary to the song. We wanted to really {{make sure that we}} weren’t doing things, like, just to put a wacky keyboard sound in. It had to be doing something constructive for the song.” Critics have described the genres of the album as alternative rock, emo, emo pop, pop punk, and power pop.|$|E

500|$|Kajol {{began dating}} fellow actor, Ajay Devgan, in 1994, while filming for Gundaraj. Members of the media, however, {{labelled}} {{them as an}} [...] "unlikely pair" [...] due to their contrasting personalities. Devgan explained their relationship by saying, [...] "We never resorted to the usual 'I Love you' routine. A proposal never happened. We grew with each other. Marriage was never discussed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> imminent". They subsequently got married on 24 February 1999 in a traditional Maharashtrian style ceremony at the Devgan house. The wedding was subject to wide media scrutiny, as certain {{members of the media}} criticised Kajol's decision to settle down at the [...] "peak of her career". Kajol, however, maintained that she would not quit films, but would cut down on the amount of work that she did.|$|E

500|$|... "Letters of Transit" [...] was co-written by {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman {{and executive}} producers/co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. Although it was previously reported Goldsman would be directing, executive producer Joe Chappelle ultimately directed the installment. The Observers are prominently {{featured in the}} episode, a mythos that has been visible since the pilot. Previously a mysterious background presence, according to Noble, they have now become [...] "incredibly centrally important" [...] to the series' storyline. [...] "Letters of Transit" [...] was written and shot before the series renewal for a fifth season, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> envisioned as a genesis of the season. During this time, Wyman confirmed {{that a majority of}} the fifth season would be set in 2036, following the events of this episode, a time period depicting the Observers as oppressors rather than as passive witnesses.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> my idea to stay here. I {{have been here for}} three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E

Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch rated the main event and the Clockwork Orange House of Fun match 3 and a fourth stars out of 5. Regarding the main event, Keller {{felt it was a}} [...] "PPV main event worthy match, the best of the night, but when a 20 minute Styles main event PPV match isn't four stars, it's not Styles's fault." [...] As for the Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, Keller felt it was a [...] "good garbage match" [...] and that Waltman was a [...] "suitable substitution for the Hardy no-show." [...] Keller rated the Gauntlet for the Gold and the X Division Championship match each 2 and three-quarter stars out of 5. He stated that the Gauntlet for the Gold was [...] "above-average", but that it felt [...] "clogged with undersized wrestlers who didn't look like legit contenders, exposing TNA's roster depth limitations in the heavyweight division." [...] While reporting on the X Division Championship bout, that it [...] "never felt special, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> good."

500|$|In 2001, Michael Emerson won a Primetime Emmy Award for {{his guest}} {{appearance}} as serial killer William Hinks on The Practice. The Lost producers liked {{his work on}} The Practice, so they were keen to cast Emerson {{in the role of}} Ben, then known as [...] "Henry Gale", as they thought he would fit the character well. He was originally contracted to appear in just three episodes of Lost, making his first appearance midway through the second season, in episode [...] "One of Them". The producers were so impressed by him that they contracted him for a further five episodes, citing the scene at the end of [...] "The Whole Truth" [...] where Ben asks for milk as the moment they knew he was a [...] "keeper". He was then made a part of the regular cast from the third season. Had Emerson not worked out during his initial appearances a different actor would have been cast for the leader of the Others, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> intended the survivors would have the leader right under their noses and not realize it. During one episode of the Official Lost Podcast, the producers state they always knew Ben would be the [...] "Big Bad". Emerson had no idea of his character's importance during his second season recurring role. He was told nothing about Ben's backstory and would only receive scripts at the last minute. He enjoyed how the ambiguity of Ben's motives allowed him to [...] "paint it the way [...] please". Sterling Beaumon was cast to play Ben in the flashbacks of episode [...] "The Man Behind the Curtain". Emerson's wife Carrie Preston was cast as Ben's mother following Emerson telling people at parties she was desperate for a part on the show.|$|E
