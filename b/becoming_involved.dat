5|$|In November 1949 {{he joined}} Second Division club Hull City for a {{transfer}} fee of £19,000. He chose {{to join the}} Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him {{due to the fact}} that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949–50 and 1950–51, before <b>becoming</b> <b>involved</b> in a relegation battle in 1951–52. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed.|$|E
