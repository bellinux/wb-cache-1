40|$|Exercise {{and breath}} holding {{in the water}} such as that {{performed}} in the sport of synchronized swimming may evoke the physiological consequences of the diving response. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the physiological responses of breath holding during underwater arm cranking in synchronized swimmers who are trained in breath holding and compare these responses to untrained women. Each participant performed 6 breath holding periods in the water (2 × 10 s, 2 × 20 s and 2 × 25 s) with 2 minutes of normal breathing in between, in either an ascending or descending order while performing arm crank exercise. The intensity of arm crank exercise was set below the individual ventilatory threshold. Both synchronized swimmers and controls were matched on sitting height and then randomly divided into 2 groups: one group started breath holding with the longest (25 <b>s)</b> <b>breath</b> holding periods while the other group began breath holding with the shortest (10 <b>s)</b> <b>breath</b> holding periods. The synchronized swimmers experienced a significant decrease in heart rate while breath holding for 20 and 25 s but the changes in heart rate for the control group was not consistent between subgroups. Full recovery from breath holding was identified for minute ventilation after 25 s of recovery from breath holding for all groups. Results suggest synchronized swimmers exhibited a better adaptation to breath holding while exercising underwater. Key words: water immersion, heart rate, oxygen consumption, ventilation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe periaqueductal grey (PAG) is {{a nucleus}} within the midbrain, and {{evidence}} from animal models has identified {{its role in}} many homeostatic systems including respiration. Animal models have also demonstrated a columnar structure that subdivides the PAG into four columns on each side, and these subdivisions have different functions with regard to respiration.

40|$|Exhaled breath {{contains}} particles {{originating from}} the respiratory tract lining fluid. The particles {{are thought to}} be generated during inhalation, by reopening of airways closed in the preceding expiration. The aim here was to explore processes that control exhaled particle concentrations. The results show that 5 and 10 <b>s</b> <b>breath</b> holding at residual volume increased the median concentration of particles in exhaled air by 63 % and 110 %, respectively, averaged over 10 subjects. An increasing number of closed airways, developing on a timescale of seconds explains this behaviour. Breath holds of 5, 10 and 20 s at total lung capacity decreased the concentration to 63 %, 45 % and 28 % respectively, of the directly exhaled concentration. The decrease in particle concentration after breath holding at total lung capacity is caused by gravitational settling in the alveoli and associated bronchioles. The geometry employed here when modelling the deposition is however not satisfactory and ways of improving the description are discussed...|$|R
