5|$|Interstate 605 (I-605) is {{the common}} {{designation}} given by local media outlets to several proposals for a new auxiliary Interstate Highway bypassing I-5 and I-405 in the U.S. state of Washington. Proposals have <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> since the 1960s, including highways connecting from I-5 {{all the way to}} the Canada–US border, and some just between I-5 and I-90. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has no projects designated I-605 at this time. However, a project to convert State Route 18 (SR18) to a limited-access freeway is under construction currently.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's party should have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E

500|$|After Aurora's {{arrival in}} New Zealand in April 1916, Stenhouse began {{the task of}} raising funds for the ship's repair and refit, prior to its return to Antarctica to rescue the marooned men. This proved difficult: nothing had <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Shackleton since Endurance had left South Georgia in December 1914, and it seemed likely that relief expeditions were {{necessary}} for both strands of the expedition. However, the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was completely out of funds, {{and there was no}} obvious alternative source of finance. Given the chaotic financial circumstances in which Aurora had departed from Australia, private subscribers were hard to find. Finally, the governments of Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain [...] agreed jointly to fund the refit of Aurora, but insisted on their joint committee having full control of the relief expedition.|$|E

500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster is a {{teenager}} living in Indianapolis, [...] who has terminal thyroid cancer that {{has spread to}} her lungs. Believing she is depressed, her mother Frannie urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends with individuals who are {{going through the same}} thing. There Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a charming teenager who lost a leg from bone cancer but has since apparently been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends {{in the middle of a}} sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> since.|$|E

[...] 13 Nov. 1854: n.p. 19th Century U.S. Newspapers. Web. 3 Nov. 2015. By early December, the steamer USS Princeton had returned from searching for the missing sloop, which had not been seen or heard from on any of the channels frequented by ship traffic of the British West Indies. (New York, New York), Saturday, December 09, 1854; Issue 49. [...] In late December, a report surfaced that the vessel had arrived at Cartagena safely, (Boston, Massachusetts), Wednesday, December 20, 1854; Issue 34. but this report was apparently in error, possibly generated by the arrival of the report that Gerry had mailed before leaving Aspinwall at the end of September. By this time, the Navy's steam ships were searching the area for Albany. (Boston, Massachusetts), Saturday, March 03, 1855; Issue 208. [...] Daily National Intelligencer (Washington, District Of Columbia), Monday, March 05, 1855; Issue 13,109. The steamer USS Fulton searched from January to May from Cartegena to Aspinwall, the Bay of Darien, into the Bay of Guatemala, and along the Mosquito Coast. By January 1856, after an exhaustive search of 15 months, the ship was given up as lost. (Cleveland, Ohio), Tuesday, January 08, 1856; Issue 6.|$|E
500|$|As {{the drift}} {{proceeded}} the ocean became deeper; soundings gave successive depths of , [...] and , a progression which indicated that no undiscovered land mass was nearby. On 15 November 1895 Fram reached 85°55′N, only [...] below Nansen's Farthest North mark. From this point on, the drift was generally {{to the south}} and west, although progress was for long periods almost imperceptible. Inactivity and boredom led to increased drinking; Scott Hansen recorded that Christmas and New Year passed [...] "with the usual hot punch and consequent hangover", and wrote that he was [...] "getting more and more disgusted with drunkenness". By mid-March 1896, the position was 84°25′N, 12°50′E, placing the ship north of Spitsbergen. On 13 June a lead opened and, {{for the first time in}} nearly three years, Fram became a living ship. It was a further two months, on 13 August 1896, before she found open water and, with a blast from her cannon, left the ice behind. She had emerged from the ice just north and west of Spitsbergen, close to Nansen's original prediction, proving him right and his detractors wrong. Later that same day a ship was sighted—Søstrone, a seal hunter from Tromsø. Sverdrup rowed across for news, and learned that nothing had <b>been</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Nansen. Fram called briefly at Spitsbergen, where the Swedish explorer-engineer Salomon Andrée was preparing for the balloon flight that he hoped would take him to the pole. After a short time ashore, Sverdrup and his crew began the trip south to Norway.|$|E
