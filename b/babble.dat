5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including laughter, surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a <b>babble</b> of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused <b>babble</b> of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E
5|$|When The Tower of <b>Babble</b> was {{released}} in April 2012, a little over {{one and a half}} years had elapsed since its author Richard Stursberg left the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in August 2010. Stursberg had been recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch, as his vice-president in charge of English services. Stursberg had previously worked in the media business, most recently as the director of Telefilm Canada (2001–2004). He entered CBC in October 2004, to replace the retiring Harold Redekopp, with the idea of changing the network's direction, away from its focus on high arts and towards popular content. Though Rabinovitch supported him, Stursberg understood how difficult that transition would be and that he would face resistance and criticism. Stursberg's vision was not supported by Rabinovitch's successor, Hubert Lacroix, who eventually replaced Stursberg with Kirstine Stewart. The 63-year-old Stursberg left CBC in August 2010 and by October 2011 publisher Douglas & McIntyre acquired the world rights to his memoir. Douglas & McIntyre's parent company, D Publishers, filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, still owing Stursberg $13,000.|$|E
50|$|The white-browed <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus superciliosus) is a small, {{gregarious species}} of {{bird in the}} family Pomatostomidae.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{other species of}} Australian <b>babbler</b> which are similar in appearance; The white-browed <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus superciliosus), the chestnut-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus ruficeps) and the grey-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus temporalis). The white-browed <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus superciliosus) is {{considered}} most similar because of its size; however it can be distinguished by its thinner eyebrows {{and the lack of}} a sharp demarcation between the white breast and brown belly (which is diagnostic of Hall's <b>Babbler).</b> The chestnut-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus ruficeps) has a distinctive chestnut crown, thinner eyebrows, and white tips to the wing coverts; it also lacks a sharp demarcation between the breast and belly. The considerably larger grey-crowned <b>babbler</b> (Pomatostomus temporalis) also has thick white eyebrows, but has a distinctive grey crown and a large rufous patch in the spread wing.|$|R
50|$|The white-headed <b>babbler</b> or Cretzschmar's <b>babbler</b> (Turdoides leucocephala) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Leiothrichidae.It is found in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Sudan.Its natural {{habitats}} are dry savanna and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. Its name is sometimes confused with the yellow-billed <b>babbler,</b> which is alternatively called the white-headed <b>babbler.</b>|$|R
25|$|Typically by 6 {{months of}} age, all {{normally}} developing children will <b>babble.</b> However, infants with certain medical conditions or developmental delays may exhibit a delay or {{an absence of}} babbling. For example, infants {{who have had a}} tracheotomy typically do not <b>babble</b> because they are unable to phonate. Following decannulation, it has been found that these infants do produce more vocalizations, but the sounds or syllables are not as diverse as those found in typically developing infant's canonical babbling behaviour. Infants with severe apraxia may not <b>babble,</b> and may fail to produce first words. Communication by infants with apraxia may instead be in the form of grunting and pointing. Infants with autism may show a delay in babbling, and in some cases it may be completely absent. Babbling in children with autism tends to occur less frequently than in typically developing children, and with a smaller range of syllables produced during the canonical babbling stage. Babbling may also be delayed in individuals who are born with Down syndrome. The canonical stage may emerge 2 months later for individuals with Down syndrome compared to other infants, although, when produced, it is similar to babbling in typically developing infants.|$|E

25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could <b>babble</b> {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go {{through a number of}} stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This <b>babble</b> {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will begin to make in manual communication.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{research}} done, it is {{concluded that}} children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them. With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, {{whether it be a}} <b>babble</b> the child made or a short sentence. While doing this, the adult prompts the child to continue communicating, which may help a child develop language sooner than children raised in environments where communication is not fostered.|$|E
25|$|Babbling {{is assumed}} to occur in all {{children}} acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish. Infants across the world follow general trends in babbling tendencies. Differences that do appear {{are the result of}} the infants' sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) they are exposed to. Infants mimick the prosody of the language(s) they are exposed to. They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also <b>babble</b> using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most babbling consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which it is exposed.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{total of}} 16 call types in pygmy {{marmoset}} <b>babbling</b> language. Different calls serve different survival functions such as when desiring food, social interaction or during times of alarm. As human infants have, marmoset babies have higher rates of social interaction when producing <b>babbling</b> sounds. During the juvenile age, marmosets often regress back to <b>babbling</b> stages if a new infant is born. It is suggested that their production of <b>babbling</b> calls increases because they are seeking attention and social interaction. Another <b>babbling</b> occurrence during the juvenile age is the addition of territorial calls and mild threat vocalizations. Although <b>babbling</b> is important for practising adult calls during the juvenile age, <b>babbling</b> decreases with age in pygmy marmosets. [...] Overall, <b>babbling</b> progresses {{through a series of}} stages from infancy to adulthood and slowly leads to the construction of adult calls.|$|R

25|$|Starting around 6 months babies {{also show}} an {{influence}} of the ambient language in their <b>babbling,</b> i.e., babies’ <b>babbling</b> sounds different depending on which languages they hear. For example, French learning 9-10 month-olds {{have been found to}} produce a bigger proportion of prevoiced stops (which exist in French but not English) in their <b>babbling</b> than English learning infants of the same age. This phenomenon of <b>babbling</b> being influenced by the language being acquired has been called <b>babbling</b> drift.|$|R
25|$|Doctors and {{scientists}} {{who worked with}} Genie were uncertain about {{most of her life}} from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. In conversations with members of the research team that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not <b>babble</b> very much. At times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation {{than the rest of the}} family.|$|E
25|$|Babbling is a {{stage in}} child {{development}} and a state in language acquisition during which an infant appears to be experimenting with uttering articulate sounds, but does not yet produce any recognizable words. Babbling begins shortly after birth and progresses through several stages as the infant's repertoire of sounds expands and vocalizations become more speech-like. Infants typically begin to produce recognizable words when they are around 12 months of age, though babbling may continue for some time afterward. Babbling {{can be seen as}} a precursor to language development or simply as vocal experimentation. The physical structures involved in babbling are still being developed in the first year of a child's life. This continued physical development is responsible for some of the changes in abilities and variations of sound babies can produce. Abnormal developments such as certain medical conditions, developmental delays, and hearing impairments may interfere with a child's ability to <b>babble</b> normally. Though there is still disagreement about the uniqueness of language to humans, babbling is not unique to the human species.|$|E
