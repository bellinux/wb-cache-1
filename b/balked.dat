5|$|Chance {{began his}} career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season.

The plan to commission scientists fell through when Robert Bacher and Isidor Rabi <b>balked</b> at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department.

2500|$|In baseball, {{a pitcher}} can commit {{a number of}} illegal motions or actions that {{constitute}} a <b>balk.</b> Most of these violations involve a pitcher pretending to pitch when {{he has no intention}} of doing so.

[...] Under other rule sets, notably in the United States under the National Federation of High Schools (Fed or Federation) Baseball Rules, a <b>balk</b> results in an immediate dead ball. [...] In the event a <b>balk</b> is enforced, the pitch is generally (but not always) nullified, each runner is awarded one base, and the batter (generally) remains at bat, and with the previous count.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of Old Romance geographical names in early South Slavic {{confirms that the}} majority of late Proto-Slavic sound changes were still operative in the period of the earliest Old Romance-Slavic language contacts in the Balkan Peninsula and eastern Alps from {{the second half of the}} 6 th century and the beginning of the 7 th century onwards. Phonetic substitutions of the type Rom. *kE, *gE → Sl. *c, *ʒ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Kersu → Sl. *Cersъ, <b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Gīla → Sl. *Ʒiĺa) and Rom. *auC → Sl. *ovC (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Laurentiu > *Laurenču → Sl. *Lovręčь) point to the fact that the first palatalization of velars as well as the monophthongization of the inherited diphthongs were no longer among the ongoing processes. All other late Proto-Slavic sound changes were either still operative or only took place after the borrowing. This is confirmed by the relative chronology of the following set of Romance-Slavic correspondences: simplification of consonant clusters: Rom. *ps → Sl. *s (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Apsaru → Sl. *Osorъ), development of prothetic consonants: Rom. *ū- → Sl. *uū- > *vy- (Alp. Rom. *Ūdẹnu → Sl. *(V) ydьnъ), simplification of j-clusters: Rom. *Ci → Sl. *Cʹ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Arsia → Sl. *Orša), delabialization of *o after *r: Rom. *ro → Sl. *ry > *ri (Rom. *Roma → Sl. *Rymъ > *Rimъ), second regressive palatalization of velars (see above Sl. *Cersъ, *Ʒiĺa), rise of nasal vowels: Rom. *ENC, *ONC → Sl. *ęC, *ǫC (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Parentiu > *Parenču → Sl. *Poręčь, <b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Karantānu → Sl. *Korǫtanъ), progressive palatalization of velars: Rom. *Ek, *Eg → Sl. *c, *ʒ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Longātẹku → Sl. *Lǫgatьcь), delabialization of *ū 1 > *y: Rom. *ū/*o → Sl. *y (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Allūviu → Sl. *Olybъ), labialization of *a > *o: Rom. *a → Sl. *o (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Kapra → Sl. *Koprъ), vowel reduction of *i, *u > *ь, *ъ: Rom. *ẹ, *ọ → Sl. *ь, *ъ (<b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Kọrẹku → Sl. *Kъrьkъ, <b>Balk.</b> Rom. *Tọrre → Sl. *Tъrъ) ...|$|R

Undeterred, the Navy continued studying cruiser designs and planned a ten-year construction program for the period 1946–1955. This was based on defensive operations along the periphery of the Soviet Union against Anglo-American carrier groups while submarines would attack their lines of communication. Ten of these large cruisers were envisioned as part of this construction program. When the program was discussed by the Politburo on 29 September 1945 there was no great disagreement on the large cruisers, although Stalin favored increasing the size of their main guns to , but did not push the issue when Admiral Kuznetsov resisted.|$|E

5|$|Congress <b>balked</b> at the plan, {{seeing in}} it {{an end to}} the United States policy of {{isolationism}} and the beginning of imperialism. Even some supporters of naval expansion were wary; Senator Eugene Hale feared that because the proposal was so large, the entire bill would be shot down and no money appropriated for any ships. However, in April 1890, the United States House of Representatives approved funding for three 8,000-long ton battleships. Tracy, trying to soothe tensions within Congress, remarked that these ships were so powerful that only twelve would be necessary instead of the 35 called for in the original plan. He also slashed the operating costs of the Navy by giving the remaining Civil War-era monitors—which were utterly obsolete by this time—to navy militias operated by the states. The appropriation was also approved by the Senate, and in total three coast-defense battleships (the Indiana class), a cruiser, and a torpedo boat were given official approval and funding on 30 June 1890.|$|E
