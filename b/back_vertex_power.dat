Measurements were made in vivo on six human corneas showing with-the-rule (0. 25 to 0. 87 D) toricity. Lens overall diameter was 8. 8 mm, optic zone diameter was 7. 4 mm, and base curve radius was fitted "on K.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} a {{scanning}} laser technique to measure in vitro changes in <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance of chick and pigeon lenses. Enucleated eyes were dissected, leaving the lens naturally suspended by the ciliary body and intraocular muscles. Ray tracing techniques were {{used to measure the}} resting <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance of the lenses by passing a laser beam through the lens and scanning it across the pupillary aperture. The pupil diameter was measured videographically. The measurements were repeated while the intraocular muscles were pharmacologically stimulated with increasing concentrations of either nicotine or carbachol. Drug stimulation caused changes in pupil diameter and changes in the <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance of the lenses. These experiments were conducted on the eyes of young chicks, young pigeons, and on the eyes of three pigeons older than 10 yr. The lenses from the eyes of the old pigeons had the greatest resting <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance, followed by those of the young pigeons and finally those of the young chicks. Lenses from the eyes of young chicks and young pigeons underwent similar drug-induced changes in <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance, but the lenses from old pigeon eyes showed an almost complete absence of such changes. Further, we demonstrated that, just as in the chick eye, lenticular changes in pigeon eyes are due to a contraction of the iris muscle. This is evident because after the iris has been removed the lens undergoes no change in <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance during stimulation. We conclude with a discussion of the lenticular accommodative ability of the pigeon eye with reference to the recently reported accommodative mechanism of the chick eye and a comparison of chick and pigeon iris morphology...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{conventional}} vertometer (lensometer) {{is difficult}} to use for accurate measurement of contact lenses whose <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> (BVP) varies across the optic zone. BVPs of multifocal rigid and soft contact lenses have previously been measured using a conventional vertometer incorporating the Scheiner principle, which makes use of two light paths equidistant {{from the center of}} the lens. METHODS: We have developed a computer-based vertometer system based on the Scheiner principle which can be used to produce a profile of BVPs across rigid and soft contact lenses. A computer interface to the vertometer allows rapid acquisition of readings and software-based ray tracing derives in-air dioptric power readings across the optic zone at specific ray heights. RESULTS: Results are presented for soft and rigid, and spherical and aspheric surface contact lenses. CONCLUSIONS: The system improves the measurement resolution of a standard vertometer and shows an acceptable level of precision and accuracy for most applications...|$|E

A self-controlled trial was carried out {{on a series of}} disposable soft contact lenses of different material to evaluate parameter changes after cleaning with Lens 2 ¨ (Automated Lens Cleaner Machine). This will be compared to the lens cleaned conventionally (digital rubbing). Fifty four pieces of soft contact lenses were divided into 2 groups; cleaned conventionally and with Lens 2 ¨. Three types of soft contact lenses of different materials were used; Soflens® 38, Focus® Monthly and O 2 Optix. Each contact lens was cleaned for 30 times to mimic the period of 30 days wear. After the thorough cleaning process, the back optic zone radius (BOZR), <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> (BVP), central thickness(ct) and total diameter (TD) were measured. The parameters were statistically analysed to evaluate the changes. There were significant changes in the TD and BVP of Soflens® 38 and O 2 Optix with both methods. The Focus® Monthly contact lens only showed significant BOZR changes with both methods. However, these parameter changes were not clinically significant because the changes were still in the tolerance range set by ISO (International Organization of Standardization).

40|$|Progressive {{addition}} lenses (PALs) are {{an increasingly}} preferred mode for the correction of presbyopia, gaining an increased {{share of the}} prescription lens market. Sales volumes are likely to increase {{over the next few}} years, given the increasing cohort of presbyopic patients in the population. This research investigated adaptation to PAL wear, investigating head movement parameters with and without progressive lenses in everyday visual tasks, and examined symptoms of spatial distortions and illusory movement in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs. Minimum displacement thresholds in the presence and absence of head movement were also investigated across the lens designs. Experiment 1 investigated head movements in two common visual tasks, a wordprocessing copy task, and a visual search task designed to replicate a natural environment task such as looking for products on supermarket shelving. Head movement parameters derived from this experiment were used to set head movement amplitude and velocity in the third experiment investigating minimum displacement thresholds across three PAL designs. Head movements were recorded with a Polhemus Inside Track head movement monitoring system which allows real time six degrees of freedom measurement of head position. Head position in azimuth, elevation and roll was extracted from the head movement recorder output, and data for head movement angular extent, average velocity (amplitude/duration) and peak velocity were calculated for horizontal head movements Results of the first experiment indicate a task dependent effect on head movement peak and average velocity, with both median head movement average and peak velocity being faster in the copy task. Visual task and visual processing demands were also shown to affect the slope of the main sequence of head movement velocity on head movement amplitude, with steeper slope in the copy task. A steeper slope, indicating a faster head movement velocity for a given head movement amplitude, was found for head movements during the copy task than in the search task. Processing demands within the copy task were also shown to affect the main sequence slopes of velocity on amplitude, with flatter slopes associated with the need for head movement to bring gaze to a specific point. These findings indicate selective control over head movement velocity in response to differing visual processing demands. In Experiment 2, parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity were assessed in a group of first time PAL wearers. Head movement amplitude, average and peak velocity were calculated from head movement recordings using the search task, as in Experiment 1. Head movements were recorded without PALs, on first wearing a PAL, and after one month of PAL wear to assess adaptation effects. In contrast to existing literature, PAL wear did not alter parameters of head movement amplitude and velocity in a group of first time wearers either on first wearing the lenses or after one month of wear: this is due to task related effects in this experiment compared to previous work. Task demand in this experiment may not have required wearers to use the progressive power corridor to accomplish identification of visual search targets, in contrast to previous studies where experimental conditions were designed to force subjects to use the progressive corridor. In Experiment 3, minimum displacement thresholds for random dot stimuli were measured in a repeated measures experimental design for a single vision lens as control, and three PAL designs. Thresholds were measured in central vision, and for two locations in the temporal peripheral field, 30 ° temporal fixation and 10 ° above and below the horizontal midline. Thresholds were determined with and without the subjects' head moving horizontally in an approximate sinusoidal movement at a frequency of about 0. 7 Hz. Minimum displacement thresholds were not significantly affected by PAL design, although thresholds with PALs were higher than with a single vision lens control. Head movement significantly increased minimum displacement threshold across lens designs, by a factor of approximately 1. 5 times. Results indicate that the local measures of minimum displacement threshold determined in this experiment are not sensitive to lens design differences. Sensitivity to motion with PAL lenses may be more a global than a localized response. For Experiment 4, symptoms of spatial distortion and illusory movement were investigated in a crossover wearing trial of three PAL designs, and related to optical characteristics of the lenses. Peripheral <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>powers</b> of the PALs were measured at two locations in the right temporal zone of the lenses, 15. 6 mm temporal to the fitting cross, and 2. 7 m above and below the horizontal to the fitting cross. These locations corresponded to the zones of the lenses through which minimum displacement thresholds were measured in the previous experiment. The effect of subjects' self movement on symptoms is able to discriminate between PAL designs, although subjective symptoms alone were not related to the lens design parameters studied. Subjects' preference for one PAL design over the other designs studied in this experiment is inversely related to the effect on subject movement on their symptoms of distortion. An optical parameter, blur strength, derived from the power vector components of the peripheral powers, may indicate preference for particular PAL designs, as higher blur strength values are associated with lower lens preference scores. Head movement amplitude and velocity are task specific, and are also influenced by visual processing demands within tasks. PALs do not affect head movement amplitude and velocity unless tasks are made demanding or performed in less natural situations designed to influence head movement behaviour. Both head movement and PALs have large effects on minimum displacement thresholds; these effects may be due in part to complexity of the subjects' task within the experiment. Minimum displacement thresholds however were not influenced by PAL design. The most sensitive indicator for subject's preference of PALs was the effect of subjects' self movement on their perception of symptoms, rather than the presence of actual symptoms. Blur strength should be further investigated for its role in PAL acceptance...|$|R
40|$|In {{production}} of ophthalmic freeform optics like progressive eyeglasses, the specimens are tested {{according to a}} standardized method {{which is based on}} the measurement of the <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> on usually less than 10 points. For a better quality management and thus to ensure more reliable and valid tests, a more comprehensive measurement approach is required. For Shack Hartmann Sensors (SHS) the dynamic range is defined by the number of micro-lenses and the resolution of the imaging sensor. Here, we present an approach for measuring wavefronts with increased dynamic range and lateral resolution by the use of a scanning procedure. Therefore, the proposed innovative setup is based on galvo mirrors that are capable of measuring the <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> with a lateral resolution below one millimeter since this is sufficient for a functional test of progressive eyeglasses. Expressed in a more abstract way, the concept is based on a selection and thereby encoding of single sub-apertures of the wave front under test. This allows measuring the wave fronts slope consecutively in a scanning procedure. The use of high precision galvo systems allows a lateral resolution below one millimeter as well as a significant fast scanning ability. The measurement concept and performance of this method will be demonstrated for different spherical and freeformed specimens like progressive eye glasses. Furthermore, approaches for calibration of the measurement system will be characterized and the optical design of the detector will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|A 2. 5 × Selsi {{achromatic}} Galilean focusable {{telescope was}} calibrated for refraction at 6 m. In its calibration, minus power trial lens was {{placed at the}} objective of the telescope to simulate vergence of a target at a finite distance, before the <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> (BVP) of the telescope at each setting (telescope length) was measured by a focimeter. By using a graphical presentation of the results, the BVP of the telescope at each setting could be determined at different selected target distances. For a target vergence of − 0. 167 D or a distance of 6 m, the common testing distance in clinical practice, this calibrated telescope had a BVP or refraction measuring range of − 7. 27 –+ 7. 52 D. When this telescope was used to measure simulated manifest refractive errors at 6 m, it yielded a mean error of + 0. 13 D with a 95 % confidence limit of agreement of − 0. 38 –+ 0. 64 D. These results indicated that the accuracy and precision of telescopic refraction were comparable to that of retinoscopy. Therefore, the calibrated telescope could be considered as a reliable and inexpensive instrument for determining spherical refractive errors. Telescopic refraction is applicable in refracting economically disadvantaged population in under-served areas where modern equipment and electricity are not available. In addition, it provides an alternative subjective refraction method for low vision population because the magnification of this calibrated telescope has the advantage of allowing low vision patients to be refracted at the common 6 m testing distance in clinical practice.

Two lenses from each of the eight soft contact lens groups were used in experiments concerning their parameter stability. Six subjects were fitted with lenses for 1 day. Verification of back optic zone radius, total diameter, <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power,</b> centre thickness and water content was undertaken at 20 degrees C. In vitro measurements of total diameter were taken at 35 degrees C before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. In vivo measurements of lens centration, up-gaze lag, post-blink movement, total diameter and subjective assessment of comfort were taken (a) immediately after lens insertion (1 min), (b) 20 min later and (c) 6 h later (same day). The majority of differences of the in vivo parameters between lens types (with respect to lens centration, lag, movement on blink, lens total diameter and comfort) were not found to be statistically significant throughout the 6 h wearing period. It was also found that lenses increase in diameter when first placed on the eye and decrease in diameter when they were removed from the eye.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} number of ordered lenses {{required}} to achieve an optimal lens fit between three-point-touch and apical touch fittings in keratoconus subjects with nipple and oval cones using the first definite apical clearance lens (FDACL) as a starting point. Methods: First trial lens was selected following manufacturer’s guidelines and the back optic zone radius (BOZR) was flattened or steepened in 0. 10 mm steps until a FDACL was found. Subsequently, subjects were randomly allocated to three-point-touch (BOZR 0. 10 mm flatter than FDACL) and apical touch fittings (BOZR 0. 40 mm flatter than FDACL). Changes were made solely in total lens diameter, edge lift, and/or <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> until an optimal lens fit was achieved. Differences between fitting approaches were compared in terms of optimal lens fit rates defined {{as the percentage of}} subjects successfully fitted with the first lens ordered from the manufacturer. Results: Sixty-one subjects (109 eyes) were randomly allocated to threepoint- touch and apical touch fitting approaches. An average of 2. 3 trial lenses were necessary to achieve the FDACL. An optimal lens fit rate was achieved with the first lens in 84 of 109 eyes (77 %). No statistically significant differences in optimal lens fit rates were found between three-point-touch and apical touch fitting approaches (83 % and 71 %, respectively; P = 0. 12) and between nipple and oval cones (81 % and 68 %, respectively; P = 0. 12). Conclusions: The use of the FDACL provides a systematic, reliable, and repeatable starting point for Rose K 2 contact lens fitting in keratoconus.

40|$|Purpose: Refractive {{changes in}} {{diabetic}} eyes {{have long been}} reported but with equivocal results. The lens has been a more recent focus {{as the source of}} any change but it is possible that multiple sources of variation have made it difficult to demonstrate a systematic change clinically. The aim of this study was therefore to use a bovine lens model to investigate the optical changes in hyperglycaemia and when lenses are returned to normal glucose levels as would occur following commencement of treatment. Method: Bovine eyes were obtained and their lenses excised under sterile conditions before placing them in culture medium within an incubator using standard tissue culture techniques. In the first experiment, lenses were transferred into culture medium containing 5 mm (n = 12), 15 mm (n = 12) and 30 mm (n = 12) glucose. Measurements were made of the change in <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> focusing distance with equatorial lens diameter using the ScanTox™ measurement system. From these measurements, the <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> focal length and primary longitudinal spherical aberration were derived. In a second experiment, lenses maintained at 30 mm glucose (n = 7) were stepped down to 5 mm glucose to simulate starting diabetic therapy and measured in the same way. Changes over time were assessed with a linear regression model. Results: A trend towards myopia was observed with increasing hyperglycaemia, this was not statistically significant. When lenses were stepped-down from hyperglycaemia to normal physiological levels of glucose, a hyperopic shift was observed in line with published clinical studies that again failed to reach statistical significance. High variability in the measurement on longitudinal spherical aberration prevented any significant trends being measured. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there are no consistent crystalline lens-induced refractive changes following exposure to hyperglycaemia for time-periods up to 5 days used in the current study. It is possible that bovine lenses are able to offset the raised osmotic pressure from high glucose levels in the short-term by a process of osmoregulation and that repeated osmotic stress or longer term exposure may be required to induce the changes in refraction that are seen clinically...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of lens centre thickness on the in-vitro and in-vivo (lens on eye) flexure of miniscleral contact lenses. Methods Nine subjects with normal corneae participated (mean age 25 ± 4 years, including 7 females and 2 males, 6 Caucasians and 3 Asians). Three spherical miniscleral lenses (Irregular Corneal Design, Capricornia, Australia) of different centre thickness (150 µm, 250 µm and 350 µm) were used. The lenses were made from hexafocon B with the same back optic zone radius, total diameter, <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power</b> and sagittal depth. In-vitro lens flexure was measured using a videokeratoscope (Medmont E 300, Australia) with the contact lens mounted in a customised lens holder. In-vivo lens flexure was measured using the videokeratoscope after a 15 minute settling period following lens insertion. The order of lens wear was randomised between subjects. Mean axial power maps were calculated from the over-topography data for each miniscleral lens. The anterior lens surface astigmatism derived from the best-fit spherocylinder was used to quantify the magnitude of lens flexure. Results In-vitro lens flexure was significantly greater for the 150 µm lens (0. 20 ± 0. 04 D) compared to the 250 µm (0. 06 ± 0. 03 D) and 350 µm lenses (0. 07 ± 0. 02 D) (p < 0. 001). However, in-vivo lens flexure did not vary significantly with lens centre thickness; 150 µm lens (0. 45 ± 0. 39 D), 250 µm lens (0. 36 ± 0. 31 D), 350 µm lens (0. 40 ± 0. 27 D) (p = 0. 58). Conclusions Decreasing the centre thickness of the ICD miniscleral lens to 150 µm, while controlling for other lens parameters, did not significantly alter in-vivo lens flexure. Minimising the centre thickness of ICD miniscleral lenses may be a possible method to improve the oxygen transmissibility of lenses made from lower Dk materials without inducing clinically significant lens flexure...|$|E
40|$|The {{parameters}} of soft contact lenses may alter during wear. A series of clinical and laboratory experiments {{were conducted in}} order to examine the parameter stability of eight soft contact lenses manufactured from different materials. The following materials (and nominal water contents) were used: HEMA/VP 40 %, HEMA/VP 55 %, HEMA/VP 70 %, VP/MMA 55 %, VP/MMA 70 %, HEMA 40 %, HEMA/MAA 55 % and HEMA/MAA 70 % (HEMA: 2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate, VP: vinyl pyrrolidone, MMA: methyl methacrylate, MAA: methacrylic acid). Two lenses from each of the eight soft contact lens groups were used in experiments concerning the parameter stability. Six subjects were fitted with lenses for 1 day. Verification of back optic zone radius, total diameter, <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power,</b> centre thickness and water content was undertaken at 20 degrees C. In vitro measurements of water content, oxygen transmissibility, total diameter and back optic zone radius were taken at 35 degrees C before lens fitting and after 6 h of lens wear. Distortion, discolouration and lens quality were assessed before and after lens wear. When the temperature was raised from 20 to 35 degrees C, a significant reduction in lens water content for all the lens types was observed, as well as a significant reduction in total lens diameter {{for the majority of the}} lens types. Water content, oxygen transmissibility, total diameter and back optic zone radius of all the lens types reduced, following a 6 h open eye wearing period. For the majority of the lens types, these changes were found to be statistically significant. Distortion, discolouration and quality of the lenses remained unchanged throughout the study with the exception of the HEMA/MAA 70 % lens. Correlating a number of parameters generated in this study, gave the following conclusions. High water content materials exhibit a low relative change in oxygen transmissibility following a 6 h wear period. Soft contact lens dehydration leads to a decrease in oxygen transmissibility and total diameter, following a 6 h wear period. These results will assist practitioners in predicting the alterations that occur in soft contact lens parameters and oxygen performance as a result of lens wear...|$|E
40|$|Since Smesler and Ozanics 1 {{demonstrated}} the affinity of the cornea for atmospheric oxygen, contact lens investigators {{have become increasingly}} concerned with maximising oxygen availability to the contact lens wearing cornea. As a result, many methods have been adopted to evaluate the oxygen delivery characteristics of different contact lens materials and designs. Fatt and St Helen 2 described a modified electrode chamber technique that facilitated the measurement of oxygen transmissibility of hydrogel lenses. The results are expressed as DK/L values, where D is the co-efficient of diffusion for oxygen movement in the lens material, K is the solubility of oxygen in that material and L is the lens centre thickness. This method has been used extensively. For example, Morrison and Edelhauser 3, and later Morris and Fatt 4 determined the oxygen permeability {{of a number of}} commercially available contact lenses, while Wilson et al 5 in a more clinical approach, compared a range of standard lenses of fixed <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>power.</b> Wilson 6 has also used this technique to examine the effect of lens power on the relationship between centre thickness and oxygen transmissibility. Mathematical models, based on these oxygen transmissibility measurements and oxygen consumption rate studies of rabbit cornea, were developed by Fatt et al 7 - 9 to predict ranges of oxygen tensions at the cornea-contact lens interface for various contact lens materials. Hill 10 has described an equivalent oxygen technique that provides, on the other hand an invivo estimation of contact lens oxygen performance in the rabbit cornea. 11 The technique involves comparing corneal oxygen uptake after contact lens wear with that after exposure to known oxygen environments, and the results are expressed as an equivalent oxygen percentage (EOP). This method has been used extensively to assess various aspects of physiology of contact lens wear. 12 - 15 A third approach to the assessment of oxygen availability during contact lens wear is that of Polse and Decker. 16 They compared human corneal swelling responses after contact lens wear to that after corneal exposure to known oxygen environments. How well then, do these three approaches predict the level of oxygen beneath contact lenses during normal wear? In this study, a recently described technique 17 is used to determine the EOPs beneath a variety of contact lens types in the in vivo human eye during normal wearing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background: Geographically, Queensland {{presents}} an extreme ultraviolet exposure climate {{to members of}} the public engaged in outdoor recreational activity.

Mean summertime exposures were measured in the 2008 study period to be 1. 4, 2. 2 and 3. 2 SED at forearm, upper <b>back</b> and <b>vertex</b> sites respectively compared to respective wintertime forearm, upper <b>back</b> and <b>vertex</b> exposures of 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 5 SED, where summertime exposures were recorded in the mean solar zenith angle ranges of 56 o to 59 o and wintertime exposures were recorded in the mean solar zenith angle range 74 o to 83 o. Vitamin D 3 effective exposures were determined to vary from between 225 Jm- 2, 325 Jm 2 and 475 Jm- 2 during summer and 48 Jm- 2, 59 Jm- 2 and 88 Jm- 2 during winter for the respective forearm, upper <b>back</b> and <b>vertex</b> body sites measured in the above mean solar zenith angle ranges. Conclusion. Exposures to ambient UV during winter on the golf course between 3 : 00 pm and 5 : 30 pm could be beneficial for office workers for the production of vitamin D. Optimising exposure periods to late afternoon in the winter months and taking adequate sun protection measures in the summer months are important strategies that golfers can utilise for long term preventative health. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the chick}} eye, {{accommodation}} for near objects is {{brought about by}} changes in the focal length of the lens and by changes in the corneal radius of curvature. Several different mechanisms of lenticular accommodation have been proposed for the avian eye. These include a role for the ciliary muscle, a role for the iris muscle, and a role for changes in intraocular pressure. We have studied accommodation in the chick eye using electrical stimulation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, electric-field stimulation of enucleated eyes, in vitro measurement of changes in <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance of the lens, and histology. We prcsent evidence showing that, in the chick eye, lenticular accommodation is induced primarily by a contraction of the muscle fibers at the peripheral edge of the iris. During accommodation, the peripheral muscle fibers of the iris contract to apply a force through the ciliary processes to the anterior equatorial surface of the lens. This increases the focal power of the lens. When accommodation is relaxed, the lens is returned to its unaccommodated state by the elasticity of the pectinate ligament and the ciliary body. Contractions of the posterior ciliary muscle and changes in intraocular pressure, forces that have previously been proposed to play major roles in lenticular accommodation, are shown to be of secondary importance only...|$|R

Developed variant of the stand has a number of advantages with respect to the same, previously created. First of all it is a simple circuit which can be used not only to measure the characteristics of intraocular lenses, but conventional diffractive lenses. If necessary, the stand can be transformed into a compact device that is not inferior to the famous counterparts. As a result of successfully implemented testing optical systems and implemented work on the creation of teaching materials for use with a stand. Innovation is the use of USB - microscope and the location of all elements of the stand on the same axis, which greatly simplifies the adjustment of the instrument. Further work is aimed at studying specific intraocular lenses created using the stand. ? ????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????, ? ????? ??????? ???????????? ? ???????? ?? ????????????, ?????????? ????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ??? ???????????? ????? ????. ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???????? ? ????? ???????????? ????????????. ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ????????? ????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????? ? ??????????? ??????. ?????????? ????? ??? ????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????, ????? ??? ?????? ????????? ?????????, ??????????? ???????? ??????????, ? ??????????? ??????????? ?????. ????????????? ??????? ?????? ????? ??? ??????????? ?? ????????? ? ???????????, ????????? ?????. ?????? ????? ??? ??????? ?????, ? ??????? ??????? ????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ????, ?? ? ??????? ????????????? ????. ??? ????????????? ????? ????? ???????????????? ? ?????????? ??????, ??????? ?? ?? ??????? ????????? ????????. ? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ? ???????????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???????????? ?????????? ??? ?????? ?? ???????. ?????????? ???????? ?????????????

Mitochondria {{play a vital role}} in providing the cell with the energy necessary for these metabolic processes and have recently been shown to be more metabolically active than previously thought. To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial function directly influences the optical function of the lens, bovine lenses were treated with 50 μM, 200 μM, 600 μM and 1000 μM menadione, a mitochondrial specific toxin that renders the mitochondria inactive, and the <b>Back</b> <b>Vertex</b> Distance (BVD) variability was observed over 216 hours. Confocal micrographs of secondary fibre cells’ mitochondria were also analyzed for 50 μM, 200 μM, and 600 μM menadione treatment over 48 hours. Increase in BVD variability (± s. e. m.) was observed within 24 hours from 0. 28 ± 0. 021 to 1. 83 ± 0. 75 for the 600 μM treated lenses. Confocal micrograph analysis showed a trend toward a decrease in the average length of mitochondria from 7. 9 ± 0. 8 to 3. 7 ± 0. 9 over for 200 μM treated lenses and from 5. 9 ± 1. 0 to 3. 6 ± 0. 6 for the 600 μM treated lenses over 48 hours. These data show that indeed menadione has a detrimental effect on mitochondria as a function of both time and concentration and this change in mitochondria precedes changes in BVD variability directly linking mitochondrial function to optical function...|$|R

40|$|A new {{instrument}} {{system for the}} non-invasive assessment of biological systems has been designed, built and validated. This system utilizes the optical characteristics of a biological system to assess both its static and dynamic response over time. The changes in the optical properties can then be used to quantify {{the response of the}} biological system to external or internal stimuli. This new system incorporates an efficient light delivery system, as well as a novel light collection system to provide high repeatability, reproducibility, sensitivity, and detection thresholds. The system incorporates simultaneous measurement of transmitted light, forward scattered light, specularly reflected light, and non-specularly reflected light in across the visible spectrum, to provide flexibility in the biological systems that can be measured. It is shown that typical values are 0. 02 % for repeatability and 0. 15 % for reproducibility. Sensitivity in transmission and backscatter measurements was improved by a factor of 20 compared to a previously built instrument, which was the basis for the new design. The system is capable of detecting light attenuated down to 0. 0063 % of the maximum intensity, resulting in a superior threshold. The system was then validated by measuring the optical properties of various biological samples, both natural and engineered. These samples include bovine, porcine, and human corneas and lenses, as well as synthetic materials. Biological sample testing were consistent with published results on the <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance (BVD) test (bovine lenses), the bovine corneal opacity test (BCOP, bovine corneas), and published results obtained with the precursor to the new device...|$|R
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} beta (TGF-β) has {{been implicated in}} {{anterior}} subcapsular cataract (ASC) development. In {{the first section of}} this thesis, an in-vitro rat lens model was used to determine the role of matrix metalloproteinases during TGF-β-induced ASC. In the second part, an in-vivo TGF-β transgenic and Smad 3 knockout model was used to examine the role of Smad 3 signaling pathway in TGF-β-induced ASC development. Lastly, an in-vitro rat lens epithelial explant culture model was used to investigate the potential role of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Optical, morphological and molecular changes were analyzed in theses studies. Results from cultured rat lenses show a significant increase of <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance variability (decrease of sharpness and focus) during ASC development. Inhibition of MMPs eliminated the TGF-β-induced plaque formation. Similarly, the overexpression of TGF-β 1 in transgenic mouse lenses leads to ASC formation and a decrease in lens optical quality in comparison to wild-type lenses, while TGF-β 1 /Smad 3 -/- (null) lenses show diminished TGF-β-induced effects. The plaques formed in the TGF-β 1 /Smad 3 -/- lenses are substantially smaller than in the TGF-β 1 /Smad 3 +/+ lenses. The morphological and molecular changes of TGF-β 2 /FGF- 2 treated rat lens epithelial explants are similar to those found in the TGF-β 2 treated rat lenses and transgenic TGF-β 1 mouse lenses. Heat shock treatment prior to TGF-β treatment significantly reduced the effects of EMT in rat LECs. In conclusion, MMP inhibition prevented TGF-β-induced ASC formation whereas heat shock treatment and the absence of Smad 3 protein expression only reduced the severity of TGF-β-induced effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} {{shows that}} in everyday life we encounter ever-growing demand for better visual acuity at all viewing distances. The presbyopic population needs correction to far, near and intermediate distance with different dioptric powers. PAL lenses {{seem to be a}} comfortable solution. The object of the present study is the analysis of the factors determining adaptation to progressive addition lenses (PAL) of the fi rst-time users. Only novice test persons were chosen {{in order to avoid the}} bias of previously worn particular lens design. For optimal results with this type of lens, several individual parameters must be considered: correct refraction, precise ocular and facial measures, and proper mounting of lenses into the frame. Nevertheless, fi rst time wearers encounter various diffi culties in the process of adapting to this type of glasses and adaptation time differs greatly between individual users. The question that arises is how much the individual parameters really affect the ease of adaptation and comfort when wearing progressive glasses. To clarify this, in the present study, the individual PAL lenses- Rodenstock’s Impression FreeSign (with inclusion of all parameters related to the user’s eye and spectacle frame: prescription, pupillary distance, fi tting height, <b>back</b> <b>vertex</b> distance, pantoscopic angle and curvature of the frame) were compared to power optimized PAL – Rodenstock’s Multigressiv MyView (respecting only prescription power and pupillary distance). Adaptation process was monitored over a period of four weeks. The collected results represent scores of user’s subjective impressions, where the users themselves rated their adaptation to new progressive glasses and the degree of subjective visual impression. The results show that adaptation time to fully individually fi t PAL is easier and quickly. The information obtained from users is valuable in everyday optometry practice because along with the manufacturer’s specifi cations, the user’s experience can give us a better insight in design and characteristics of progressive lenses...|$|R
