5000|$|Only {{a company}} that has been {{formally}} incorporated according to the laws of a particular state is called ‘corporation’. A corporation was defined in the Dartmouth College case of 1819, in which Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme Court stated that [...] " [...] A corporation is an artificial <b>being,</b> invisible, <b>intangible,</b> <b>and</b> existing only in contemplation of the law". A corporation is a legal entity, distinct and separate from the individuals who create and operate it. As a legal entity the corporation can acquire, own, and dispose of property in its own name like buildings, land and equipment. It can also incur liabilities and enter into contracts like franchising and leasing. American corporations can be either profit-making companies or non-profit entities. Tax-exempt non-profit corporations are often called “501(c)3 corporation”, after the section of the Internal Revenue Code that addresses the tax exemption for many of them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{theme of}} the 2008 ICOMOS General Assembly, Spirit of Place, has been widely {{acknowledged}} as <b>being</b> nebulous, <b>intangible,</b> <b>and</b> hard to define. However, resource managers {{must be able to}} demonstrate that Spirit of Place exists as a valid construct in order to justify management strategies, and quite often, to secure financial support for research and conservation. In order to do so, practical measurement tools must therefore be available. This paper presents a multi-faceted methodology for measuring spirit of place in order to offer ways of quantifying and justifying management strategies. This paper is based on empirical research conducted at Colorado State University and observations from two years of reconstruction and heritage conservation practice in Iraq (January 2007 – present). It provides a unique perspective of the importance of promoting spirit of place in the case of post-conflict reconstruction. In such instances, it is especially important to be able to reclaim spirit of place as besieged nations rebuild national identity that has been severely stressed by war...|$|R

With magical realism and the following quotation from the narrator, [...] "It was believed, even in educated circles, that anyone who plotted against Trujillo would incur a fukú most powerful, down to the seventh generation and beyond", the novel equates the two main antagonists of the story, fukú and Trujillo, by describing Trujillo as supernaturally powerful as fukú. Thanks to this juxtaposition, when Trujillo becomes assassinated, the novel successfully conveys {{that even the most}} powerful supernatural being can be defeated, ultimately implying the theme [...] "Nothing is impossible".|$|R
40|$|How {{prevalent}} is long-run {{corporate tax}} avoidance? Surprisingly, {{there appears to}} be no published academic work addressing this basic question. We define tax avoidance based on the ability to sustain a cash effective tax rate (the ratio of cash taxes paid to pretax income) below the statutory tax rate. It is important to note that avoiding taxes does not imply that a firm has done anything improper. There are numerous provisions in the tax code that allow or encourage firms to reduce their taxes. We investigate the extent to which firms are able to engage in corporate tax avoidance over periods as long as ten years. We find that 437 firms, comprising 22 percent of our sample, were able to sustain a cash effective tax rate of less than 20 percent over a ten year period. An initial examination of the characteristics of successful long-run tax avoiders shows that they are spread across industries but cluster somewhat in certain industries such as oil and gas extraction, insurance, and real estate. Other characteristics associated with long-run tax avoidance include having large firm size, being incorporated in a tax haven, having high ratios of property, plant and equipment to assets, <b>being</b> <b>intangible</b> intensive, <b>and</b> <b>being</b> highly levered...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{media is}} often criticised for <b>being</b> <b>intangible,</b> {{transient}} <b>and</b> ephemeral. These characteristics limit {{the provision of}} long-lasting social experiences, as {{it is through the}} use of all our senses that we attach meaning to space, creating a sense of place. This paper presents a comparative study of the affordances of two design interventions, one tangible paper-based, called Print + Talk = Love (PTL), the other digital screen-based, called Discussions in Space (DIS). The emphasis is on a) how tangible media, such as paper, provides different and meaningful collective experiences, and b) how it can stand on its own as an interactive design intervention and as a comprehensive data-gathering tool in urban public places. By positioning PTL and DIS within the context of urban public places and testing their abilities to engage participants, we examine their particular situated engagement abilities through a mixed method approach. As a result, the digital aspects of DIS, e. g., using Twitter, extend the situated experience beyond the actual location of the intervention. Moreover, informing a hybrid approach, we also found that the physical aspects of PTL and its tangible presence, kept the user experience focused on the actual place and event surrounding the intervention...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Information Systems (IS) {{are widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the major enablers of business change. However, despite enormous capital IS investments, organizations have not always been able to enjoy commensurate financial returns. Much of {{the reason for this is}} that there are considerable costs associated with the adoption of IT/IS, with many of these cost factors <b>being</b> indirect <b>and</b> <b>intangible,</b> <b>and</b> difficult to identify at the project description and justification stage. This paper describes the first phase of a UK-government funded research project that will extend the myopia of traditional direct financial cost analysis through identifying indirect cost factors, together with their respective natures. The need to identify the true level of such costs during the evaluation process is presented, which in doing so, will support an improvement in decision-making and hence, organisational learning will be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The orally {{transmitted}} {{tradition of}} Lobolo {{is a common}} and widely practiced cultural tradition and an established marriage institution within African societies in Southern Africa, differing only in terms and minor variations of practice. Lobolo therefore has the status of <b>being</b> an <b>intangible</b> heritage <b>and</b> is acknowledged as such by South Africa’s National Heritage Resource Act of 1999. Its role in society today {{on the one hand}} and its oral way of transmission on the other has placed it in the center of an ongoing post-colonial discourse, particularly around the standing of the African intangible heritage in post- 1994 South Africa. The Heritage Transformation Charter, following its mandate by the National Heritage Council, intended to attend to and correct existing imbalances in the Heritage sector and its institutions. It also aimed to identify and establish ways for the preservation and continuation of African heritage. The study reviews the literature on Lobolo, highlighting the ways in which it has been described as a multifaceted cultural and social institution. In consideration of these findings it critically engages in a discussion of the Draft Heritage Transformation Charter, to assess its acknowledgement of the characteristics of living heritage. In doing so the study probes the ability of a policy guiding document such as the Heritage Transformation Charter, to accommodate and guide the survival of oral traditions such as Lobolo, as part of the intangible heritage of South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of social constructs {{on the moral}} fibre {{and the nature of}} interactions within a community can never be over emphasized. Social constructs <b>being</b> tangible <b>and</b> <b>intangible</b> elements which form spaces within which communities interact with one another. Where social constructs are chaotic, conflicts within those communities are bound to follow. This has been observed in countries like Rwanda where inequalities among the different communities within the country led to genocide. This dissertation aims to investigate possibilities of using architecture as a tool to create opportunities for cultural and social integration thus encouraging a people to foster values of ‘otherness’ ‘selflessness’ and community. This will be achieved by constructing strong social networks (tangible <b>and</b> <b>intangible)</b> throughout an ethnically, and culturally diverse landscape, with an aim to contribute towards the upliftment of the immediate community. It is hoped that lessons learnt from this study could be of benefit to the South African society at large since the phenomenon observed within the communities being studied presents itself in other communities within the country as well.

40|$|This paper reviews {{theoretical}} and empirical academic economic studies that discuss what is <b>intangible</b> <b>and</b> intellectual capital {{and why is it}} important for society. It begins by discussing issues such as the nature of this capital and how has it changed over time. Subsequently it reviews measures of the importance of <b>intangible</b> <b>and</b> intellectual capital, whether optimal levels of investment in <b>intangible</b> <b>and</b> intellectual capital can be said to exist and, accordingly, whether governments should intervene in the market. On balance, theory favours the view that for reasons associated with uncertainty, non-mortgageability and economies of scale, there is an under-investment in these types of investment. However the extent to which this holds will differ according to the prevalence of uncertainty, non-mortgageability and scale economies for each type of capital item. The most common policies to stimulate the production of intangible capital, especially intellectual capital, are government grants, especially for basic research, patents and other forms of intellectual property, subsidies and research consortia. Optimal policies adjust the incentive to produce so that the marginal costs to society are equal to the marginal benefits. ...|$|R

In the present work we test {{the existence of a}} positive relationship between offshoring <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> firm performance. To reap the full benefit of offshoring, firms are required to integrate and coordinate activities and knowledge; integration and coordination become difficult when activities are knowledge intensive {{as in the case of}} intangibles. We argue that the positive relation between offshoring <b>intangibles</b> <b>and</b> performance is strengthened if firms retain part of the knowledge related to the offshore outsourced activity, which reduces the risk of knowledge fragmentation and eases coordination and control. Our analysis suggests that some coherence between what a firm outsources abroad and what it offers positively moderates the relationship between offshoring <b>intangible</b> activities <b>and</b> firm performance.
