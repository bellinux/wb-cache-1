40|$|By {{looking at}} <b>blighted</b> <b>areas</b> {{it becomes clear}} that the {{development}} of blight is part of the growth-change-decay cycle of the city. This is sometimes effected by the form of the city structure. The location and activities of <b>blighted</b> <b>areas</b> can be seen to have positive as well as the more evident negative values. An analysis of areas which have maintained continuous redevelopment reveals that diverse activities and foci have developed. Life as opposed to dullness is evident. Society, the political structure, economics and physical form are the major contributors to the development of blight in American cities. This thesis is con-cerned primarily with the physical form of the city as this form is related to the development of blight, and as this form can be changed to encourage the redevelopment of <b>blighted</b> <b>areas.</b> Objectives for inducing redevelopment can be formulated. There must be a desire for redevelopment by the people of the area. The public policy must encourage this desire and provide a framework for redevelopment. Foci and activities existing in the area must be reinforced and expanded to provide the life necessary to stimulate redevelopment. A mechanical transportation structure and a pedestrian communication structure must be a fundamental part of this redevelopment. This thesis suggests that a continuous system of community facilities can provide the focus of a physical framework which will stimulate redevelopment of <b>blighted</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, major cities began {{revitalization}} projects of slums and <b>blighted</b> <b>areas</b> in their communities.

In January 1952, the Department of Development for the city of Columbus began commissioning task forces in an effort for urban renewal in the <b>blighted</b> <b>areas.</b> The efforts of these task forces are evident in numerous older communities and districts, including Market Mohawk and German Village.
