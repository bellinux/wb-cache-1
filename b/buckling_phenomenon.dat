The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the relation between the deformation speed and the <b>buckling</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of the catheters, which is made of soft nylon resin and is reinforced with thin stainless wires called braid. In general, the <b>buckling</b> <b>phenomenon</b> of the catheter is complicated because the different types of several loads such as torsion and bending are applied simultaneously to the catheter. In this study, as the initial step to reveal the buckling behavior under combined loading state, the buckling behaviors under combined loading of compression and torsion are examined. Especially, in this study, the buckling tests under various initial torsion are conducted by changing the axial displacement speed. And then, the effect of the stress relaxation on the occurrence region of buckling under combined loading state is revealed in this paper...|$|E

Existing models, on the other hand, failed to predict observed drill pipe buckling behavior. This is the first time in the drilling industry that a buckling model was successfully validated in the field, and this model can predict realistically the onset and severity of buckling for any 3 D trajectory. Many articles discuss buckling inside a wellbore but an increasing number of field observations suggest that existing buckling theories fail to predict <b>buckling</b> <b>phenomenon</b> such as lockup. Indeed, existing buckling theories generally assume that the wellbore is idealistically perfect without any doglegs.

So, it is expedient to analyze particular cases of the DS movement inside curvilinear channels of simple trajectories and to study their stability. Of particular interest in this avenue of inquiry is incipient buckling of a DS in different segments of a plane circular channel because it adequately depicts the most general regularities of friction forces impact on the <b>buckling</b> <b>phenomena.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{reinforced}} {{sandwich structures}} are generally designed {{in order to}} provide optimal out-of-plane mechanical properties, beside traditional sandwiches which generally display satisfactory specific flexural properties but fatally insubstantial stiffnesses in the through-thickness direction. This paper deals with sandwich structures manufactured with polymeric foam core reinforced thanks to the Napco (R) technology (which is based on transverse needling) and specially investigates the compression behavior through the thickness direction. The compressive longitudinal moduli of such sandwiches are shown to be significantly improved in the presence of fibrous orthogonal reinforcements but the experimental estimations rather differ from analytical predictions that can be easily obtained using classical mixture laws. These discrepancies are mainly due to the <b>buckling</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> inherent in the geometry of the reinforcements, and the associated imperfection sensitivity. This work is thus devoted to the prediction of the critical loading of such a sandwich structure under through-thickness compression. A closed-form analytical expression is first derived from a general 3 D elastic bifurcation analysis, then compared to finite element numerical solutions (obtained by both linearized buckling and incremental post-buckling analyses) for validation purposes, and finally confronted to experimental results. The <b>buckling</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is actually proved to be mainly responsible for the final collapse of the through-thickness reinforced sandwich...|$|E
