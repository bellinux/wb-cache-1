The volumetric shape is an aggregate of blobbies, computed using a genetic algorithm. The choice of this model is motivated by the simplicity and the popularity of this primitive.

5000|$|See Ya Later Gladiator is a 1968 Looney Tunes {{animated}} {{short film}} starring Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales, {{who had been}} paired together {{in a series of}} cartoons from 1965 to 1968. This was their final theatrical pairing, and this was also the final cartoon to star [...] "classic" [...] Warner Bros. characters. After this short, until the cartoon division closed in 1969, new characters like Cool <b>Cat,</b> <b>Bunny</b> and Claude, Merlin the Magic Mouse, and a few one-shot cartoons made up all of WB's output.|$|R
50|$|Warner Bros. {{shut down}} its {{animation}} studio completely in 1963, and {{the directors of}} Termite Terrace went their separate ways. Friz Freleng co-founded DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which produced Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies from 1964 to 1967. Warner Bros.-Seven Arts reopened the studio from 1967 to 1969, but the low-budget cartoons produced were not popular with critics or audiences then or now. The new characters introduced during the Seven Arts period, such as Cool <b>Cat,</b> <b>Bunny</b> and Claude, Quick Brown Fox and Rapid Rabbit, and Merlin the Magic Mouse, never caught on, while the Termite Terrace cartoons remained perennial television favorites through syndication and Saturday morning airings throughout {{the remainder of the}} 20th century.|$|R
500|$|Summering at Fawe Park in Keswick, Cumbria {{with her}} parents, Potter filled her sketchbook with {{pictures}} of the estate's several gardens including the kitchen garden and its greenhouses, cold frames, potting shed, and espaliered fruit trees. [...] Her father photographed Fawe Park and Potter probably used his photographs (or her own) as an aid in her work. The picture of Old Mr. <b>Bunny</b> attacking the <b>cat</b> did not satisfy her publisher, and she redrew it as she did the picture of Benjamin and Peter standing on the garden wall. In Peter Rabbit, Mr. McGregor's garden was in Perthshire, but in Benjamin Bunny, the rabbit clan and the garden setting were moved to the Lake District, where they remained for The Tale of Mr. Tod, the final book of the Peter Rabbit saga.|$|R

5000|$|Jenny (Carol) {{comes to}} the school after {{becoming}} mixed up in a shoot out. When she and another group of girls arrive, {{they are forced to}} strip in front of the prison nurse and then take a shower, while being informed that they will be [...] "inspected inside and out." [...] Afterwards, they are forced to stand naked along a wall while the nurse sprays them with DDT delousing fluid. At one point while being deloused, the nurse tells the girls to [...] "bend overâ€¦spread them wide", suggesting that the girls will be given their cavity checks. Jenny tries to break out after befriending a male driver with whom she has a romantic encounter {{in the back of his}} truck. She makes arrangements that he will drive her off the premises but is discovered by a guard and after a scuffle she is apprehended and immediately cast into isolation, where Edna forces her to strip naked before using a firehose to spray her with cold water. Lisa (Stoner) is a runaway who is captured and placed in the reform school. She suffers several losses while at the school including her stuffed <b>bunny</b> and a <b>cat</b> she tends to which was originally found while the girls were out performing hard labor. The cat is discovered by Edna in the dorms and she chases it until finally stomping it to death. Lisa is punished with isolation. After the death of her cat, Lisa attempts to climb to the top of the tower, followed closely by Edna. When she reaches the top she stumbles backward as Edna confronts her, breaks through the barriers and falls to her death. This causes Jenny to smash through a window, which starts a riot which is only quelled when Warden Sutter (Danning) shoots a shotgun into the ceiling.|$|R
