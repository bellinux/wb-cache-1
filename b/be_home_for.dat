500|$|Freedom from Want is {{considered}} one of Rockwell's finest works. Of the four paintings in the Four Freedoms, it is the one most often seen in art books with critical review and commentary. Although all were intended to promote patriotism in a time of war, Freedom from Want became a symbol of [...] "family togetherness, peace, and plenty", according to Linda Rosenkrantz, who compares it to [...] "a 'Hallmark' Christmas". Embodying nostalgia for an enduring American theme of holiday celebration, the painting is not exclusively associated with Thanksgiving, and is sometimes known as I'll <b>Be</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas. [...] The abundance and unity it shows were the idyllic hope of a post-war world, and the image has been reproduced in various formats.|$|E

[...] "Joy to the World", [...] "We Three Kings", [...] "The First Noel", [...] "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen", and [...] "Silent Night" [...] are religious traditional carols.

500|$|Clarkson had {{expressed}} interest in recording a Christmas album for years, having recorded various Christmas songs such as [...] "Oh Holy Night" [...] and [...] "My Grown Up Christmas List" [...] on the [...] (2003), [...] "I'll <b>Be</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas" [...] on iTunes Session (2011), and being featured on Blake Shelton's Christmas album Cheers, It's Christmas (2012). Weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre, she felt that recording a Christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres. She remarked, [...] "I always get asked what genre I'm in: 'Is this country or pop or rock? What are you?' And what's cool about making the Christmas album was, 'Oh, there are no limitations! We can do whatever we want!'". She further added, [...] "The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn't matter what mood you're in or {{what kind of a}} year you've had—it's a fresh start. I'm going to clear the air and take stock of the good that's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Dude Ranch, {{which became}} the trio's first gold record in January 1998, yielded three more singles, which did not attract the same {{commercial}} success as [...] "Dammit". [...] "Apple Shampoo" [...] was the second single release from Dude Ranch, released in October 1997. [...] "Although it didn't have the impact of [...] "Dammit", it hardly mattered as the former was still receiving heavy play on radio and TV stations across the nation", wrote journalist Joe Shooman. [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was released in February 1998 but failed to register on charts. [...] "Josie" [...] became the record's fourth and final single in November 1998. Its music video also received MTV airplay and the single charted at number31 in Australia. For the single release of both [...] "Dammit" [...] and [...] "Josie", the songs were remixed and remastered by Tom Lord-Alge. The unreleased Dude Ranch cut [...] "I Won't <b>Be</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas" [...] was released as an international single in 2001, only successful in Canada, but charting for six non-consecutive weeks at number one. Dude Ranch was certified platinum {{for the first time}} in 1999.|$|E

500|$|Blink-182 entered Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996 {{to record}} Dude Ranch. Big Fish was a {{converted}} guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before. However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, {{and what was}} a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group; bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time such as having Mark run around naked as Tom explained to the camera {{what happened in the}} fire and that it's [...] "Mating Season". Thanks to improved economics, the band had more time in the studio to record the album they wanted to make. The trio were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, setting the backdrop for the recordings under guidance of Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch. The trio picked Trombino based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World's Static Prevails (1996). The group spent much time trying to get Trombino to laugh at their antics, to no avail. Hoppus' sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet and [...] "very much his own person." [...] In addition to the record, Trombino produced [...] "I Won't <b>Be</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas", a holiday song recorded during the Dude Ranch sessions.|$|E
500|$|The tenth track, [...] "White Christmas", was {{the first}} song to be {{recorded}} for Wrapped in Red. A cover of Rodgers and Hammerstein's [...] "My Favorite Things" [...] follows up as the eleventh track. Clarkson opted for the Broadway performance of the song to stray away from Julie Andrews' version, citing: [...] "I think you shouldn't go near anywhere of what she's doing because she's so good." [...] Clarkson and Kurstin co-wrote [...] "4 Carats" [...] with Cathy Dennis and Livvi Franc. Originally written as a pop song, they converted it into a Christmas song to fit the album's theme, describing it as a crossover between Eartha Kitt's [...] "Santa Baby" [...] (1953) and Madonna's [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1984). A rendition of Imogen Heap's [...] "Just for Now" [...] was described by Clarkson as her highly dysfunctional environment, saying: [...] "Can we just stop for like five minutes and have like a normal Christmas setting?" [...] The song begins by sampling the melody of the Christmas tune [...] "Carol of the Bells". The closing track, a rendition of the traditional carol [...] "Silent Night", features McEntire and Trisha Yearwood and ends in an a cappella setting between the trio. In addition, two tracks were {{also included in the}} deluxe edition of the album: the first, Clarkson's cover of [...] "I'll <b>Be</b> <b>Home</b> <b>for</b> Christmas" [...] from her iTunes Session extended play, and the second, her rendition of the first stanza of the ecclesiastical hymn [...] "Oh Come, Oh Come Emmanuel".|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 2006, The Killers {{released}} annual Christmas themed {{singles and}} videos in {{aid of the}} charity Product Red, supporting The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
