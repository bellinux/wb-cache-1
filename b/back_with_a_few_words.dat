He then scaled two or three more cards in quick {{succession}} into the audience. His assistant came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more cards. He told Herrmann that he had sent someone to look for the manager. Herrmann took the cards and scaled those. He told his assistant to bring on more cards.|$|R

5000|$|The Serbian {{gymnasium}} {{was founded}} in 1791, though its origins go further <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> reincarnations in between and different locations in town. According to Jovan Skerlić's Istorija Nove Srpske Književnosti (Belgrade, 1921, pages 19-20), the school was first established by Maksim Suvorov, a Russian scholar and educator, sent by Empress Catherine I of Russia in 1725 to open the Latin Gymnasium (Latinska Škola) a year later in Karlovci.

He beamed all over and touched his hat when Morell gave him two shillings. I was on the point of offering him ten. (Candida laughs heartily.

A powerful vision hits Cordelia which {{allows her to}} push Darla away from her neck long enough for Angel {{to show up and}} intervene. Darla biting Cordelia has motivated him enough to kill his sire, but she's already gone. Cordy is taken to a safe place to rest where she blames herself for trusting Darla and tells Angel about her vision. She reveals how hungry Darla is and that she might be at <b>an</b> arcade <b>with</b> lots of children to feed from.|$|R

The group leaves after trash-talking Stan and the boys, who are left confused by the confrontation. The kids talk to Chef, unaware of what being [...] "served" [...] entails. Chef immediately shows great concern, and calls their parents to inform them about the ordeal and assure them that their children are safe. Later, over dinner, Randy Marsh gets upset about his son being served and [...] "teaches" [...] him to dance <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> very basic line dancing steps to the tune of Billy Ray Cyrus' [...] "Achy Breaky Heart".|$|R
50|$|Hasdrubal and Syphax {{had both}} succeeded in {{escaping}} from their camps which the Roman general Scipio Africanus, and his Numidian allies Masinissa had destroyed. Hasdrubal and Syphax fell <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> followers {{who had also}} escaped the massacre at the Carthaginian camps. The arrival of four thousand mercenaries from Southern Iberia made the Carthaginians determined to make one more effort to stop the armies of Scipio Africanus from advancing across North Africa. New levies were raised in Carthage and in Numidia, and soon Hasdrubal and Syphax found themselves {{at the head of}} an army of 30,000 men. In 203 BC Scipio, whose command had been extended {{until the end of the}} war, marched from his camp at Utica to meet Hasdrubal and Syphax at a place called the Great Plains.|$|R

50|$|After {{the fall}} of Bijapur and Golkonda, Aurangzeb turned his {{attention}} again to the Marathas but his first few attempts had little impact. In January 1688, Sambhaji called together his commanders for a strategic meeting at Sangameshwar in Konkan {{to decide on the}} final blow to oust Aurangzeb from the Deccan. To execute the decision of the meeting quickly, Sambhaji sent ahead most of his comrades and stayed <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of his trustworthy men, including Kavi Kalash. Ganoji Shirke, one of Sambhaji's brothers-in-law, turned traitor and helped Aurangzeb's commander Muqarrab Khan to locate, reach and attack Sangameshwar while Sambhaji was still there. The relatively small Maratha force fought back although they were surrounded from all sides. Sambhaji was captured on 1 February 1689 and a subsequent rescue attempt by the Marathas was repelled on 11 March. He refused to bow down to Aurangzeb and to convert to Islam, so he was beheaded and his body cut into pieces.|$|R
60|$|The good {{opinion of}} Bartley's smartness which Squire Gaylord had formed was {{confirmed}} some months {{later by the}} development {{of the fact that the}} young man did not regard his management of the Equity Free Press as a final vocation. The story went that he lounged into the lawyer's office one Saturday afternoon in October, and asked him to let him take his Blackstone into the woods with him. He came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> it <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours later.|$|R

5000|$|The theatre's {{auditorium}} {{was designed}} with 2,723 seats, later reduced to 2,703; it is organised in <b>an</b> arena format <b>with</b> two huge balconies at the <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> narrow balconies on the sides. In a somewhat militant {{departure from the}} Palais Garnier, which has several dozen types of seats and does not offer stage visibility from all of them, every seat at the Opéra Bastille offers an unrestricted view of the stage, {{it is the very}} same type of seat with the same level of comfort, and there are no boxes. Subtitles are visible from every seat except for those at the very back of the arena and of the first balcony. In 2005, two small standing room areas were created {{at the back of the}} arena; tickets are sold for €5, only on the evening of the performance. There is no [...] "royal" [...] or “presidential box”; instead, one of the regular seats in the arena, on the “VIP” row (row 15) just after the central aisle, is considered the presidential seat, although not all Presidents since 1989 have been avid opera-goers.|$|R

50|$|Ciaráns {{continued}} {{insistence that}} he was fit enough to join them on the forthcoming German tour caused them considerable disquiet. They preferred he ease himself <b>back</b> to work, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> small shows in Ireland. The tour gradually began to take its toll on Ciarán, and {{it was decided that}} {{for the sake of his}} health he should return home. He flew from Brussels to Dublin.|$|R
60|$|They paddled away, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fishing-rod {{and a gun}} in the canoe, and it was toward {{six o'clock}} in the evening when they came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> trout. Vane made a fire of {{resinous}} wood, and Carroll and Kitty prepared a bountiful supper. When it was finished, Carroll carried the plates away to the stream; Mrs. Marvin and the little girl followed him; and Vane and Kitty were left beside the fire. She sat on a log of driftwood, and he lay on the warm shingle with his pipe in his hand. The clear green water splashed and tinkled upon the pebbles close at his feet, and a faint, elfin sighing fell from the firs above them. It was very old music: the song of the primeval wilderness; and though he had heard it often, it had a strange, unsettling effect on him as he languidly watched his companion. There was no doubt that she was pleasant to look upon; but, although he did not clearly recognize this, it was to a large extent an impersonal interest that he took in her. She was not so much an attractive young woman with qualities that pleased him as a type of something that had so far not come into his life; something which he vaguely felt that he had missed. One could have fancied that by some deep-sunk intuition she recognized this fact, and felt the security of it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{economic}} component {{was that}} the switch to the C-body was less expensive than maintaining a separate platform for Imperial, which was increasingly difficult to justify given Imperial's relatively low sales volume. The new platform resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} weight as well as in exterior and interior dimensions. With the partnership gone between Ghia and Chrysler, limousines based on the Imperial were produced by Ambruster-Stageway of Fort Smith Arkansas. The limousines were [...] "sectioned", with 36 inches added, most of that between the front and <b>back</b> doors <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> inches added between the rear door and the rear wheel, allowing room for two rear-facing seats <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small console/bar in between. The limousine conversions were longer than the earlier Ghia cars, and longer than the Cadillac Series 75 limousines.|$|R
50|$|He {{spent the}} year 410 {{defending}} himself against Constans, and in 411 Gerontius succeeded in besieging the young Augustus in Vienne, defeating, capturing and killing him. He {{then moved on}} Arelate, where he besieged Constantine. Before Constantine surrendered, however, Honorius' general Constantius arrived from Italy <b>with</b> <b>an</b> army. Being {{at the same time}} besiegers and besieged, the greater part of Gerontius' soldiers deserted him and went over to Constantius, who was obliged to flee <b>back</b> to Spain <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> loyal supporters.|$|R
50|$|Early {{during the}} 21st century, {{original}} members Frank Jeckell and Floyd Marcus put the act <b>back</b> together, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> musicians, and started touring again.

50|$|The Basilica Julia (Basilica Giulia) was a {{structure}} that once stood in the Roman Forum. It was a large, ornate, public building used for meetings and other official business during the early Roman Empire. Its ruins have been excavated.

They must be bad people there when such a man as Robert cannot get on among them. He now talks calmly and resignedly of trying for any one of the lowest employments by which a man can earn his bread {{honestly}} in this great city--he who knows French, who can write so beautifully!

5000|$|He played {{twice more}} {{in the league in}} December, before joining Northern Premier League club Harrogate Town on loan in March 2004. The manager thought he [...] "maybe {{struggled}} with the pace of the game" [...] in his first appearance, in a defeat at Alfreton Town, and he was <b>back</b> <b>with</b> Darlington <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later. He played regularly for the reserves in 2004-05 - according to his 2004 profile on the club's website, he had [...] "shown he is a good passer of the ball with plenty to offer in midfield" [...] - but in November was one of seven players with contracts due to expire {{at the end of the}} season whom manager David Hodgson listed for transfer or loan and told to prove their worth to the club. After spending time with Bishop Auckland, another Northern Premier League club, on loan, Coghlan finished the season with Darlington's reserves, and was released when his contract expired.|$|R

He wrestled in a Cruiserweight Open for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship at No Way Out, won by Chavo Guerrero. He began wrestling in the Cruiserweight division. He {{was involved in}} a feud between Kane and The Great Khali, once again promoting Khali in March 2007.

50|$|In 2008 the station's {{audience}} {{went into}} decline due to several factors {{and the business}} {{was put on the}} market. The station's format was changed by its then owner, who physically changed the music policy during one afternoon in late August of that year. The output became a repeat of mainly repetitive mainstream hits. This radical change lead to a walk-out by most of the DJ's, resulting in the station playing back to <b>back</b> music <b>with</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> mainly pre-recorded links in between.A fortnight after the walk-out, it was announced that The Revolution had been purchased by broadcaster Steve Penk, formerly of Key 103 and Capital FM.Penk changed the station format back to an Adult Contemporary sound.|$|R

50|$|Right {{from the}} start, several riders {{tried to be}} part of the {{traditional}} early breakaway, however the peloton looked to be letting no one go. It was only after 31 kilometers that a group of 34 riders got away. The lead of the group never grew very big but in the chasing peloton a lot of the favorites were looking at each other. In the end only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the favorites got away from the group: Tom Boonen, Leif Hoste, Marcus Burghardt and Staf Scheirlinckx. However they also did not cooperate very well and in the end <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the survivors of the lead group were never to be seen again. Of those, Stuart O'Grady in the end proved to be the strongest. O'Grady had actually dropped from the lead group because of a puncture but had managed to get <b>back</b> together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> others, namely Juan Antonio Flecha, Steffen Wesemann and Björn Leukemans. Still, of the original breakaway group, five riders managed to get into the top ten, which does not happen often in Paris-Roubaix.It should be mentioned, however, that Leif Hoste was knocked down by a motorbike on Carrefour de l'Arbre. Had he reached Tom Boonen, the race could've ended otherwise.|$|R
50|$|The 疑 initial of Middle Chinese has {{not been}} {{preserved}} by many modern varieties of Chinese. In standard Mandarin, the initial ŋ has been completely lost, with some having merged into the initial n (e.g. 牛、虐、擬 etc.). In Wu, Yue and Hakka, the ŋ initial with front vowels /i/ and /y/ will either be lost (hence merging into the 影 initial) or become another initial. But in the Fuqing dialect, the 疑 initial is preserved as ŋ in front of front and <b>back</b> vowels alike, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> exceptions having merged into / m/. In some Mandarin varieties as well as Yue, a ŋ sound {{is added to the}} beginning of back vowels of the null initial class 影 (e.g. pronouncing 安 as ŋan), but in the Fuqing dialect the 影 initial always remains null.|$|R
5000|$|Emanuel was {{introduced}} to production music when {{he was hired by}} Bruton Music, a production music library. Although he worked in the mailroom, he and a friend, Warren Bennett, were asked to record an album for the library. Bennett's father, Brian Bennett who had played with The Shadows and Cliff Richard, served as the album's producer. Commenting on the aesthetic of production music of the time, Emanuel said: [...] "Bruton {{was one of the first}} production music libraries, and it was all on vinyl <b>back</b> then, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> exceptions tended to be full of people knocking out soundalikes of current hits. They'd change the chord structure round a bit and that would be it." [...] Over the next fifteen years, Emanuel and Bennett received royalty payments for the Bruton soundalike album.|$|R

Though officially an enterprise of Condor Syndikat, in reality it was heavily subsidized by the German Government via Deutsche Luft Hansa. This {{commercial mission}} flew first from Buenos Aires to Porto Alegre via Montevideo and then on to Rio de Janeiro, where it arrived on November 27, 1926. On January 1, 1927 the aircraft flew <b>back</b> to Florianópolis <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> illustrious guests aboard. Among them were journalists, a minister, and a cinematographer.
