40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that cereal crops tend to perform better when grown after a legume or brassica <b>break</b> <b>crop.</b> Indeed, crop rotation, where different crops and/or phases of pastures are rotated to break disease and pest cycles, alter the water balance and nutrient dynamics, or help manage weed seed banks, {{is one of}} the oldest agronomic practices used in agriculture. In thisCrop & Pasture Science Special Issue, Angus et al. (2015) discuss how crop rotation was utilised by ancient civilisations to sustain cereal grain production. Consequently, it may be argued that the benefits of break crops and crop rotation should be well understood. However, recent reviews of the biological mechanisms of break crops (e. g. Kirkegaard et al. 2008; Peoples et al. 2009; Kirkegaard and Ryan 2014) suggest that while biological concepts are known, the impact of including a <b>break</b> <b>crop</b> on the yield of the following crop is often variable. Angus et al. (2015) uses a meta-analysis approach to build upon earlier reviews to argue that the size of the <b>break</b> <b>crop</b> effect on cereals is primarily influenced by the type of break, where oats < oilseeds < legume crops.

50|$|Cereals are at {{risk from}} {{numerous}} diseases due {{to the level of}} intensification necessary for profitable production since the 1970s. More recently varietal diversification, good plant breeding and the availability of effective fungicides have played a prominent part in cereal disease control.

40|$|After the Second World War, the United Kingdom has {{realized}} a {{great progress}} in cereal production. Two factors {{are related to}} this progress: one is high prices of cereals {{and the other is}} technical advances in cereal production such as the breeding of new varieties of crops, the development of new fertilizers and chemicals, and the improvement of various kinds of farm machinery. High prices of cereals gave farmers much incentive to introduce improved methods of cereal production. An attention should be given to herbicides because they made it easy to adopt continuous cereal cropping by reducing greatly labour input for weeding. Continuous cropping of cereals, however, was suffered from various plant diseases. Pesticides got rid of some, but not all. Another means of disease control was to plant one of the crops other than cereals like oilseed rape on the field after harvesting cereal. Those <b>crops</b> are called <b>break</b> <b>crops.</b> With them, the diseases of cereal crops have been controlled fairly well. The {{purpose of this study is}} to trace the changes in cropping systems on cereal farms and to make clear the features of intensification of cereal farming in England. The date analysed are based on the annual “Report of Farming in the Eastern Counties of England” published by the University of Cambridge and the duration observed ranges for 26 years, 1967 - 92. The study shows that the basic cropping system on cereal farms in the Eastern counties changed twice: first, in the middle of 1970 s and secondly, the middle of 1980 s. From 1960 s to the middle of 1970 s, the area planted to cereals, especially to barley, increased rapidly, but the area planted to non-cereal crops decreased. As for barely, the improved varieties of winter barley increased in acreage. A continuous cereal cropping was tried first on barley. Field peas and beans were main <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> at that time. From the end of 1970 s to the middle of 1980 s, a sharp increase was observed in the area planted to winter wheat and oilseed rape. The continuous cereal cropping was tried on wheat with improved herbicides and pesticides. Incidentally, the prices of oilseeds and beans and peas, protein contained feed for livestock, were supported by the CAP after the embargo on soybeans by the United States in 1973. This price support increased the cultivation of those <b>break</b> <b>crops,</b> especially oilseed rape. Since the middle of 1980 s, the acreage of <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> has increased, but that of cereals has decreased. This decrease is due mainly to the measures against the overproduction of cereals and other products. The agricultural stabilizers and set-asides, new instruments of the CAP, are included in the measures. Since agreement in the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations in 1993, the prices of cereals and <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> are expected to be reduced closer to world market levels. The cereal farmers will face in the future a considerable decline in net farm incomes. The ways to meet it will be to enlarge the size of their farms and/or to intensify their farming. Those ways are, however, likely to accelerate ill effects on the environment. Taking the environment into consideration, the reorganisation of cereal farming by making use of <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> with less application of herbicides and pesticides is desirable. イギリス東部の穀作経営をとりあげ, 中断作物を利用した穀物連作を含む穀作の集約化を伺った. 穀物と中断作物との交代のパターン(作付方式) は経済的な状況に対応して変化している. 1960 年代から 1970 年代中頃にかけては小麦の作付が大きく伸びていったが, 穀作では大麦の連作が行われ, 中断作物としては飼料用のマメ類が中心であった. たまたま, 1973 年にアメリカの大豆禁輸がおこり, これに対処するために油糧種子や蛋自作物に対して価格支持政策が取られるようになってからは, これらの作物が中断作物として作付が増加していった. 特にナタネは, 収益性の高い作物として 70 年代以降作付が急増し, 80 年代には中断作物の中心となった. しかし, 価格が抑さえられるようになった 1980 年代後半以降, 収益面での有利性は低くなりつつある. 作付方式は, 1970 年代中頃と 1980 年代中頃に転換点が見られる. 1970 年代後半に入ると小麦を中心とする穀物連作が拡大し始め, 1980 年代中頃になると収益性の低下を反映して穀物の作付率は低下し始め, それを補うようにナタネを中心とする中断作物の作付が増加している. 80 年代に入ると, どの作物でも実質粗利益は低下しているが, 穀物よりも主な中断作物であるエンドウやナタネの方が低下の度合いが大きい. 従来, 中断作物は穀作の減収分を補うという意味を持っていたが, その収益性の低下は穀作経営の収益性を一層, 低下せしめている. また, GATTのウルグアイ・ラウンド合意によって, 穀物と中断作物の価格は, 国際的な価格水準にまで引き下げられることになった. そのため, 穀物と中断作物の収益性は低下せざるを得なくなっている. こうして, 穀作経営の単位面積あたりの収益性は低下しつつある. 80 年代までは耕地面積を拡大することで経営を維持してきたが, 集約的な大規模経営に対しては環境保全の面から批判が加えられがちであり(景観や伝統的な生垣の保全など), また薬剤を多用する栽培方法も批判を受けている. 他方, 農産物の価格が低く抑さえられている現在では薬剤購入費の増加は経済的にも経営を苦しくするものとなっている. このような状況のもと, 穀作経営は, 今後, 穀物連作を継続する場合, 中断作物を活用した雑草防除や病害の抑制が諜題となる...|$|R

Choice of break crops to grow in {{addition}} to cereals and the fertility building phase {{is crucial to the}} agronomic and economic success of organic arable rotations. There are four specific functions that a <b>break</b> <b>crop</b> may perform, namely: addition, conservation and cycling of nutrients; pest and/or disease control; weed control and improvement in soil physical characteristics. Individual break crops may perform one or several of these functions. A good <b>break</b> <b>crop</b> must also produce satisfactory yields, be of marketable quality and produce an economic return for the farmer. This project analysed the overall suitability of new break crops by simultaneous assessment of key agronomic, economic and environmental factors. The objectives of the project (in brief) were as follows: 1. 	To review the scientific literature in order to evaluate known agronomic advantages and disadvantages of 15 potential break crops for organic grass/arable rotations. 2. 	To evaluate the economic potential of these 15 crops. 3. 	To assess the suitability of nine different break crops (and oat control) grown between winter wheat and spring barley in small scale experimental plots in seven replicated field trials throughout the UK. 4. 	To evaluate a further diversified arable/grass rotation which includes three break crops (potato, carrot and swede) with and without grazing livestock. 5. 	To assess consumer acceptability, organoleptic characteristics and market potential of crops produced in the large scale field trials described under Objective 4.

30|$|Crop {{rotation}} significantly affects weed {{communities and}} suppresses weed seed densities {{in comparison to}} monocultures (see references in [90]). Traditionally, in many European countries maize, sugar beet and oilseed rape are used as <b>break</b> <b>crop</b> for summer or winter cereals [91]. Break crops are important for sustaining certain weed populations, in particular dicotyledonous weed species, if the crop rotation is dominated by cereals ([92, 93] and references therein). If GMHT crops are used as break crops, dicotyledonous weed species are particularly adversely affected. The British Farm Scale Evaluations have shown that effects of GM maize and GM spring oilseed rape as break crops on the weed seed bank were traceable {{for at least two}} seasons after their cultivation [94].

40|$|Many {{guidelines}} and recommendations for sugarcane farming are aimed at achieving {{a large number of}} ratoon crops. One of the reasons for this is that the replanting costs can be considerable when a field is conventionally tilled and replanted. Thus, delaying reestablishment makes financial sense provided the cost savings are greater than any yield and revenue penalties. An alternative is to introduce a controlled traffic and zero-till farming system (CTF), thereby lowering re-establishment costs and potentially allowing for fewer ratoon crops and more frequent green manure or <b>break</b> <b>crops.</b> A rigorous yield, sucrose content, costing and cash-flow analysis, based on published research findings and detailed costing of representative machinery, showed that a CTF system with only three ratoon crops was far more profitable than a conventional farming system involving eight ratoon crops and more intensive tillage operations. A doubling in profitability was shown when the yield benefits reported with <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> and the yield decline rates reported under conventional farming systems were included in the analysis. Substantial gains in water use productivity were also shown, up to nearly 80 % improvement over a conventional farming system. Adoption of a CTF system with only three ratoon crops is therefore highly recommended and should be taken very seriously by decision-makers in the sugarcane industry...|$|R

Using two of the largest, currently available landscape-scale biodiversity data sets from arable and biomass bioenergy crops, we take a taxonomic and functional trait approach to quantify and contrast the consequences for biodiversity indicators of adopting dedicated biomass crops on land previously cultivated under annual, rotational arable cropping. The abundance and community compositions of biodiversity indica- tors in fields of <b>break</b> and cereal <b>crops</b> changed when planted with the dedicated biomass crops, miscanthus and short rotation coppiced (SRC) willow.

40|$|AbstractIn farming systems {{research}} {{the link between}} farm resources, management and performances is often described, but rarely confirmed or quantified. Problems arise in formalising such linkages because substantial spatial and longitudinal whole-farm data are difficult to acquire. This study used the integrative discipline of comparative agriculture to collect such information and address {{a wide range of}} related farming system questions. The mixed method procedure included a landscape analysis, a historical investigation, and the collection of current farm information from 36 farms, representing half the farming businesses of a 4 000 km 2 area in a region of the Western Australian wheatbelt (≈ 300 mm/year) with highly variable soils. Land types influenced management, including cropping specialisation, and explained some of the regional variability in grain yield and enterprise mix. Rotations varied by soil type and farm type. On average their duration was 3 – 4 years, typically starting with a 2 – 3 years of wheat, resulting in overall composition of 64 % cereals, 20 % <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> and 16 % pastures/fallows. <b>Break</b> <b>crops</b> were grown more on light sandy soils than on heavier fine-textured soils. Lights soils were managed similarly by all farmers but distinctions occurred on heavier soils between mixed crop-livestock farmers and cropping specialists. This divergence in farming production was explained by farm soil composition: whilst cropping appears more profitable in the region, mixed farmers retained animals and pastures as a strategy to cope with having greater proportions of land less suited to crop production. Typical farm grain yields were indeed found to vary in relation to farm soil composition. The location of the original family farm in the landscape is likely to explain these differences in farm land resources, and subsequently current farm performance, production strategies and trajectories. This study highlighted the potential of a method that deserves wider application: comparative agriculture helped identify and establish complex relationships within the farming system, some of which challenge common assumptions. Further applications to define typical farms, monitor practices, and contribute meaningful divisions of agricultural landscapes are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{productivity}} {{and quality of}} malting barley were evaluated using factorial combinations of four preceding crops: faba bean, field pea, rapeseed and barley as main plots, and four nitrogen fertilizer rates (0, 18, 36 and 54 kg N ha- 1) as sub-plots with three replications, at two sites on Nitisols of the Ethiopian highlands in 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. Preceding crops other than barley, and N fertilizer significantly improved yield and quality of malting barley. The highest grain yield, kernel plumpness, protein content and sieve test were obtained for malting barley grown after faba bean, followed by rapeseed and field pea. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased yield, protein content and sieve test of malting barley. All protein contents were within the acceptable range for malting quality. Inclusion of legumes in the rotation also improved soil fertility through increases in soil carbon and nitrogen content. We conclude that to maximize yield and quality of malting barley {{it is critical to}} consider the preceding crop and soil nitrogen status. Use of appropriate <b>break</b> <b>crops</b> may substitute or reduce the amount of mineral N fertilizer required for the production of malting barley at least for one season without affecting its quality...|$|R
40|$|Nitrifying {{microorganisms}} play {{an important}} role in nitrogen (N) cycling in agricultural soils as nitrification leads to accumulation of nitrate (NO 3 -) that is readily lost through leaching and denitrification, particularly in high rainfall regions. Legume crop rotation in sugarcane farming systems can suppress soil pathogens and improve soil health, but its effects on soil nitrifying microorganisms are not well understood. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the impact of two legume <b>break</b> <b>crops,</b> peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max), on the nitrifying communities in a sugarcane cropping soil. Cropping with either legume substantially increased abundances of soil bacteria and archaea and altered the microbial community composition, but did not significantly alter species richness and evenness relative to a bare fallow treatment. The ammonia oxidisers were mostly archaeal rather than bacterial, and were 24 - 44 % less abundant in the legume cropping soils compared to the bare fallow. Furthermore, abundances of the archaeal amoA gene encoding ammonia monooxygenase in the soybean and peanut cropping soils were only 30 - 35 % of that in the bare fallow. These results warrant further investigation into the mechanisms driving responses of ammonia oxidising communities and their nitrification capacity in soil during legume cropping...|$|R
