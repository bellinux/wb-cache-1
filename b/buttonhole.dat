5|$|The {{idea of an}} Anschluss (union between Austria and Germany to form a Greater Germany), {{was one of the}} {{principle}} ideas of the Austrian branch of the National Socialist (Nazi) Party. Nazism can be seen as descended from the radical branches of the pan-Germanist movement. In 1933, the Nazis and the Greater German People's Party formed a joint working-group, and eventually merged. During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their <b>buttonhole.</b>|$|E

25|$|Buttons and Buttonholes: the three-roll-two {{construction}} {{features a}} lapel that hides the third button, {{in order to}} provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The <b>buttonhole</b> on the lapel is called “occhiello” in Italian, and it means “little eye” for its elongated almond shape. There isn’t really a tradition for a specific type of <b>buttonhole</b> in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while “regular” buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a little teardrop shape {{at the end of the}} <b>buttonhole,</b> but that’s an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For what concerns the buttons on the sleeves, they are always working buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.|$|E

25|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} and Henry was {{rejected}} {{as a volunteer}} {{on account of his}} slightly cripped right hand, he turned his attention to making a button hole machine. He and his brother James entered into partnership with Mr. Seaman and in 1862 they perfected an automatic <b>buttonhole</b> sewing machine. It was then tested in a clothing shop in New York on army overcoats and capes, where its average was from 1,000 to 1,200 buttonholes per day. This caused hard feelings among the hand <b>buttonhole</b> workers, and one day during the noon hour they smashed the machine. However, the next morning another machine was working in its place. All together there were over one hundred thousand button holes made there. The patents were taken over by the Wheeler and Wilson Manufacturing Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. While House was in Washington D.C. looking after the patent application, he met Abraham Lincoln, for whom he cast his first vote.|$|E
25|$|Waistcoats (called vests in American English) {{were almost}} always worn with suits {{prior to the}} 1940s. Due to {{rationing}} during World War II, their prevalence declined, but their popularity has gone {{in and out of}} fashion from the 1970s onwards. A pocket watch on a chain, one end of which is inserted through a middle <b>buttonhole,</b> is often worn with a waistcoat; otherwise, since World War I when they came to prominence of military necessity, men have worn wristwatches, which may be worn with any suit except the full evening dress (white tie). Although many examples of waistcoats worn with a double-breasted jacket can be found from the 1920s to the 1940s, that would be unusual today (one point of a double-breasted jacket being, it may be supposed, to eliminate the waistcoat). Traditionally, the bottom button of a waistcoat is left undone; like the vents in the rear of a jacket, this helps the body bend when sitting. Some waistcoats can have lapels, others do not.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} to mid-1650s, a rather small falling collar was in fashion. This {{increased}} in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. Cravats and jabots around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the cravat remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red {{was the most common}} color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of cravat made its appearance in the 1690s, the Steinkerk (named after the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692). Before, the cravat was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk cravat looped through a <b>buttonhole</b> of the coat.|$|E

25|$|Ribbon: It {{is made of}} satin {{or another}} similar {{material}} cloth of any colour and may be multi-coloured as well as have designs on it. The ribbon itself {{must be at least}} 35g (1oz), 4–6cm (1.6–2.4") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with <b>buttonhole</b> stitch or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7cm (2.8"), not counting the strap or metal ring {{at the end of the}} stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for.|$|E

500|$|The first {{pattern book}} for {{embroidery}} published in England was Moryssche & Damaschin renewed & encreased very popular for Goldsmiths & Embroiderers by Thomas Geminus (1545). [...] Moryssche or Moresque refers to Moorish or arabesque designs of spirals, scrolls, and zigzags, {{an important part}} of the reportoire of Renaissance ornament in many media. [...] Scrolling patterns of flowers and leaves filled with geometric filling stitches are characteristic of blackwork from the 1540s through 1590s, and similar patterns worked in coloured silks appear from the 1560s, outlined in backstitch and filled with detached <b>buttonhole</b> stitch.|$|E

500|$|These {{stories were}} {{executed}} in canvaswork or in coloured silks in a uniquely English style called raised work, usually {{known by its}} modern name stumpwork. Raised work arose from the detached <b>buttonhole</b> stitch fillings and braided scrolls of late Elizabethan embroidery. [...] Areas of the embroidery were worked on white or ivory silk grounds {{in a variety of}} stitches and prominent features were padded with horsehair or lambswool, or worked around wooden shapes or wire frames. [...] Ribbons, spangles, beads, small pieces of lace, canvaswork slips, and other objects were added to increase the dimensionality of the finished work.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} purported {{explanations}} have been advanced for Sargent's nickname, [...] "Flash Harry". Reid opines that it [...] "was first in circulation among orchestral players {{before the war}} and that they used it in no spirit of adulation." [...] It may have arisen from his impeccable and stylish appearance – he always wore a red or white carnation in his <b>buttonhole</b> (the carnation is now {{the symbol of the}} school named for him). This was perhaps reinforced by his brisk tempi early in his career, and by a story about his racing from one recording session to another. Another explanation, that he was named after cartoonist Ronald Searle's St Trinian's character [...] "Flash Harry", is certainly wrong: Sargent's nickname was current long before the first appearance of the St Trinian's character in 1954. Sargent's devoted fans, the Promenaders, used the nickname in an approving sense, and shortened it to [...] "Flash", though Sargent was not especially keen on the sobriquet, even thus modified.|$|E
