25|$|Occasionally a new {{preposition}} is coined. Because a <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> {{may indicate}} a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from {{another part of}} speech {{can be used to}} derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from fari (to do, to make) we get the preposition far (done by).|$|E
25|$|For {{purposes}} of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> plants or plugs. Cultivation follows {{one of two}} general models—annual plasticulture, or a perennial system of matted rows or mounds. Greenhouses produce {{a small amount of}} strawberries during the off season.|$|E
25|$|Sverdlov {{approaches}} the question from a morphological standpoint. Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound words {{can take the}} form of a genitive or a <b>bare</b> <b>root,</b> he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective. According to this view, all kennings are formally compounds, notwithstanding widespread tmesis.|$|E

25|$|The bearded irises {{are easy}} to {{cultivate}} and propagate and have become very popular in gardens. A small selection is usually held by garden centres at appropriate times during the season, but {{there are thousands of}} cultivars available from specialist suppliers (more than 30 000 cultivars only for the tall bearded irises !). They are best planted as <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> plants in late summer, in a sunny open position with the rhizome visible {{on the surface of the}} soil and facing the sun.

For the very few sod farms that export turf internationally, this soilless sod may travel both lighter and better than traditional sod. Additionally, since the sod is not grown in soil, it {{does not need to}} be washed clean of soil down to the <b>bare</b> <b>roots</b> (or sprigs), so time to export is shortened.|$|R
50|$|Erasure in blazonry, the {{language}} of heraldry, is the tearing off of part of a charge, leaving a jagged edge of it remaining. Due to the usual construction of blazons, this is most often found in its adjectival form (i.e., erased), usually applied to animate charges, most often used of heads but sometimes other body parts. When a tree or other plant is shown uprooted (with the <b>bare</b> <b>roots</b> showing), it is eradicated.|$|R

50|$|Seeds used to {{germinate}} {{new plants}} are harvested from January until April {{only after they}} have turned dark purple. After harvest, they are submerged in water in order to eliminate floating non-viable seeds and detritus like twigs, leaves, etc. New plants are started between March and May. For plants established in pots, transplanting takes place April through September. Plants with <b>bare</b> <b>roots</b> are transplanted only during the months of June and July.|$|R

50|$|The {{place of}} the injunctive mood, of obscure function, is debated. It {{takes the form of}} the <b>bare</b> <b>root</b> in e-grade with {{secondary}} endings, without the prefixed augment that was common to forms with secondary endings in these languages. The injunctive was thus entirely without tense marking. This causes Fortson (among others) to suggest that the use of the injunctive was for gnomic expressions (as in Homer) or in otherwise timeless statements (as in Vedic).|$|E

50|$|These plants prefer {{consistent}} conditions day-to-day in cultivation {{to avoid}} dropping their bottom leaves. The epiphytic species are best accommodated in large wooden baskets, <b>bare</b> <b>rooted,</b> {{which allows for}} the large aerial root systems. Disturbing or damaging the roots of large, mature vandaceous orchid plants, and in particular, Vanda and Aerides species, can result in the plants failing to flower and going into decline for a season or more. These plants do not tolerate disturbance or damage of their root systems in cultivation when they become mature. The terete-leaved terrestrial species are very easy to cultivate.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} word-internal mixing in American Norwegian. The {{data show}} that the functional vocabulary is Norwegian whereas many of the lexical content items come from English. We argue that language mixing provides important evidence for grammatical theory: Specifically, the data support a late-insertion exoskeletal model of grammar like Distributed Morphology, in which the primitives of syntax are abstract feature bundles (morphemes) and <b>bare</b> <b>roots.</b> In such a theory, the structure is a separate entity, a sort of skeleton or frame, built of abstract morphemes. The phonological exponents of the roots and abstract morphemes are inserted late into designated slots. We show how such a model can explain the observed pattern for mixing within verb phrases and noun phrases in American Norwegian...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{acquisition}} of verb morphology in five Mayan languages, using a comparative method based on historical linguistics to establish precise equivalences between linguistic categories in the five languages. Earlier work on {{the acquisition of}} these languages, based on examination of longitudinal samples of naturally-occuring child language, established that {{in some of the}} languages (Tzeltal, Tzotzil) <b>bare</b> <b>roots</b> were the predominant forms for children’s early verbs, but in three other languages (Yukatek, K’iche’, Q’anjobal) unanalyzed portions of the final part of the verb were more likely. That is, children acquiring different Mayan languages initially produce different parts of the adult verb forms. In this paper we analyse the structures of verbs in caregiver speech to these same children, using samples from two-year-old children and their caregivers, and assess the degree to which features of the input might account for the children’s early verb forms in these five Mayan languages. We found that the frequency with which adults produce verbal roots at the extreme right of words and sentences influences the frequency with which children produce <b>bare</b> verb <b>roots</b> in their early verb expressions, while production of verb roots at the extreme left does not, suggesting that the children ignore the extreme left of verbs and sentences when extracting verb roots...|$|R
50|$|In 2000-2001 Snider {{published}} {{in rapid succession}} three novels he had written in the 1980s: Loud Whisper, <b>Bare</b> <b>Roots,</b> and Wrestling with Angels: A Tale of Two Brothers. All were well received by the critics in journals such as the International Gay and Lesbian Review, Sexuality and Culture: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly, and Chiron Review. The latter two novels are autobiographical stories about the coming of age and coming out of sensitive young men with deep Christian fundamentalist roots. Loud Whisper chronicles the frontman for an 80's rock band who, drunk and drugged out, falls from stage during a concert and becomes paralyzed. As always, Snider is concerned with spiritual decline and revitalization. Through {{the eyes of the}} frontman, Adam, his band members, his male and female lovers, and a journalist doing a story on him, Adam's spiritual and physical struggles unfold.|$|R
