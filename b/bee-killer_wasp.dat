50|$|Philanthus triangulum, {{commonly}} known as the European beewolf, <b>bee-killer</b> <b>wasp</b> or the bee-eating philanthus (from the now obsolete synonym Philanthus apivorus), is a solitary wasp that lives in the Western Palearctic and Afrotropics. Although the adults of the species are herbivores (feeding on nectar and pollen), the species derives its name from the behavior of the inseminated females, who hunt Western honey bees. The female places several of its paralyzed prey together with an egg in a small underground chamber, to serve as food for the wasp larvae. All members of the genus Philanthus hunt various species of bees, but P. triangulum is apparently the only one that specializes in Western honey bees.|$|E

The adult females dig tunnels in the ground for nesting, while the {{territorial}} males mark twigs and other objects with pheromones to claim the territory from competing males.|$|R
