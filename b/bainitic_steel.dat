In the present study, <b>bainitic</b> <b>steels</b> with varying content of boron were fabricated, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the fracture toughness and changes in the fatigue life. The results show that a relatively small change in the boron content can cause a notable variation in the fracture toughness of <b>bainitic</b> <b>steels.</b> The maximum value obtained in fracture toughness was for the steel with the highest boron content. It was observed that the amount of interlath martensite constituents decreases in steels with the addition of boron, leading to the promotion of the presence of void coalescence and a remarkable rise in the toughness of <b>bainitic</b> <b>steels.</b> An increase on the fatigue life of the <b>bainitic</b> <b>steels</b> with an increase in the boron content was also observed, through analysis by means of Paris’ law.

Compared with Mo-free steel, bainite in the Mo-containing steel tends to have a lath-like morphology due to a decrease in the bainitic transformation temperature.

Specimens are {{cut from the}} middle of each railhead along the longitudinal direction of the rail using electrical discharge machining. Fatigue crack propagation tests are conducted under load control conditions using a servo hydraulic material testing system. A simple form of the fatigue power law is used to rank the fatigue crack growth kinetics of the two materials.

It has been found that these models fail in the calculus of the maximum volume fraction of bainite of lean silicon steels, but lead to a reasonable accuracy in high silicon steels. This is not surprising since cementite formation reduces the carbon content in the residual austenite, stimulating the formation of a further quantity of ferrite. Likewise, an imprecise estimation of the nucleation rate of bainite must be the reason for the poor correlation in the predictions of the bainite transformation kinetics in high silicon steels.
