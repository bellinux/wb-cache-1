5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left <b>Behind</b> <b>Him</b> <b>as</b> a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left <b>Behind</b> <b>Him</b> <b>as</b> being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, {{which could have been}} about 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
5|$|Iron Man 3 was {{distributed}} worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures {{with the exception}} of China, where it was released by DMG Entertainment, and Germany and Austria, where it was released by Tele München Group. The Chinese version of the film offers specially prepared bonus footage made exclusively for the Chinese audience. This version features a four-minute longer cut of the film, with a scene showing Dr. Wu on the phone with Iron Man visible on a television screen <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> well as a longer scene of Dr. Wu operating on Stark. The extra material also features product placement for various Chinese products.|$|E

5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|Lap 18 {{saw more}} drivers making {{the change to}} slick tyres, {{including}} Räikkönen and Palmer, but the latter was let go from his pitbox before one of the tyres was properly fitted, costing him time and handing him a ten-second stop-and-go penalty. Both Mercedes drivers and Verstappen made their second pitstops by lap 20, with the order remaining the same. On lap 21, Ricciardo moved ahead of Pérez into fourth position. A mistake by Räikkönen two laps later saw him lose sixth place to Sainz. Fernando Alonso spun on lap 25, but was able to continue, unlike Rio Haryanto, who retired following a spin one lap later. Hamilton retained the lead, but not without problems, as {{he also had a}} short excursion off the track, which was mirrored by Verstappen <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the top three moved closer together. Vettel was still running at the back end of the point-scoring positions, overtaking Kvyat for ninth on lap 29.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the most}} zealous and untiring fieldsman I ever saw, {{the sort of man}} who, if {{standing}} or fretting at deep square-leg, might be relied upon to back up cover-point on an emergency. Who that has experienced it will ever forget the sound, as of a mighty rushing steam-engine <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> he went to fetch a fourer when Inglis was on the war-path! His activity in very sooth covered not only much ground, but a multitude of other people's sins.|$|E

25|$|The race {{got off to}} a clean start, with Sebastian Vettel {{taking the}} early lead from pole. There were no big changes <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso, Mark Webber, Nico Rosberg and Felipe Massa all staying in their {{respective}} places. Pastor Maldonado made up a few places after starting 22nd. Massa passed Rosberg for fifth soon after, with the latter soon losing another spot to Paul di Resta. Di Resta was unable to keep the pace of the top 5, and a gap formed up between the first 5 {{and the rest of the}} pack.|$|E
25|$|The SS France, {{as one of}} {{the last}} transatlantic ocean liners before the jet era, was also treated as the {{connection}} between, for example, New York and France. This was shown well in Le Gendarme à New York where the main characters sail on the France. The film also shows some of the 60s' interior of the ship. At the conclusion of the 1973 film Serpico, the title character can be seen sitting on the dock with the vessel <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> he prepares to sail on her into exile after testifying against the New York Police Department. During the opening of Dog Day Afternoon, also directed by Sidney Lumet, there is a shot of the France docked in New York during the opening montage.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Götz was {{the only}} person to run a B31. He started his season by taking seventh overall in the fourth round of the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM) series, held at Mainz-Finthen; he was the fastest of the three Group 6 entrants. Götz then took fourth overall, and third in Division II, at the opening round of the Interserie, held at the Österreichring. He would take seventh overall at Most, and fourth in his division, before {{following}} this with ninth and seventh overall in the two Siegerland races (second and third in his division.) Seventh at Hockenheim, and second in Division II, meant that Götz finished the 1983 Interserie season classified in third place, with 64 points; he was level with Binder on points, but had no class wins to Binder's three, and was classified <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a result.|$|E

500|$|Voss {{and the six}} {{remaining}} British aces swirled down to 600meters (2,000feet). At times, Voss had {{the altitude}} advantage over his foes, but {{did not try to}} escape the fight. Using the triplane's superior rate of climb and its ability to slip turn, Voss managed to evade his opponents and return to battle. He continued to flick turn at high speeds and attack those <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> Bowman later noted concerning his only shot at Voss: [...] "'To my amazement he kicked on full rudder, without bank, pulled his nose up slightly, gave me a burst while he was skidding sideways and then kicked on opposite rudder before the results of this amazing stunt appeared to have any effect on the controllability of his machine." [...] Bowman's machine was left slowed and ineffectively trailing dark smoke and steam, though he stayed in the fight.|$|E
500|$|The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Oates as an {{assistant}} coach in the 2009–10 season where he worked with the team's offense. Under his guidance, the team's power play finished ninth in the league and he was credited with playing a significant role in Steven Stamkos's offensive development. Oates then joined the New Jersey Devils in 2010 where he served an additional two years as {{an assistant}} coach, helping the team reach the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. New Jersey's General Manager, Lou Lamoriello, praised Oates' work with the team: [...] "He did an outstanding job for us. I wish him well. He's very communicative, very intelligent, he explains things very well. He has the resume <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a player and having the success he had – all the credentials are there for having the kind of respect players have for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{was also}} the subject of {{literary}} and stage works; a hagiographic biographical account, Lody – Ein Weg um Ehre (Lody – One Way to Honour), was published by Hans Fuchs in 1936 and a play called Lody: vom Leben und Sterben eines deutschen Offiziers (Lody: {{the life and death}} of a German officer), by Walter Heuer, premiered on Germany's National Heroes' Day in 1937. It depicts Lody as brave and patriotic but clumsy, leaving a trail of clues <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he travels in the UK: wearing clothes marked [...] "Made in Germany", writing naval secrets on the back of a bus ticket which he loses and a Scotland Yard detective finds, coming to attention when an orchestra in London plays the German naval anthem, arousing suspicion when he calls for German wine while writing secret reports to Berlin, and leaving incriminating letters in the pockets of suits which he sends to be pressed. Lody is arrested in London and sentenced to death. Offered a chance to escape, he refuses and drinks a glass of wine with the firing squad, toasting Anglo-German friendship. He is led out to his execution, saying his final words: [...] "I shall see Germany once more –from the stars." [...] The Dundee Evening Telegraph described the storyline as [...] "quaint".|$|E

500|$|Heffron became Premier, being {{sworn in}} with his cabinet on 23 October 1959 at Government House, Sydney by Governor Sir Eric Woodward. However, his time as Premier was marked by {{significant}} tensions within the Labor Party in NSW and nationally, where although a split involving the Democratic Labor Party had been avoided during Cahill's term, the sectarian and factional undercurrent in the party was very much present in what was increasingly perceived as a tired and divided government. Indeed, the 68-year-old Heffron's government consisted mostly of MPs and Ministers who had come in with McKell after the 1941 election. In parliament, Heffron tended to reflect this by leaving most of the speaking roles to his deputy Jack Renshaw and local government and highways minister Pat Hills. It was clear to many that the aged Heffron's best days as a politician were <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> future Labor political advisor Richard Hall noted in The Bulletin: [...] "In the House he tends to ramble on, recalling past glories as Minister for Education or Minister for Emergency Services in answer to questions. In an age where clichés cloak most politicians, Heffron throws them out {{as though they were}} devastating retorts, although occasionally the old radical has shown his teeth, flashed into anger, and for a few minutes reminded us that this was the great mob-orator who led many bitter strikes." [...] His old nemesis Jack Lang also took the opportunity to take a last swipe at him, ridiculing Heffron in his newspaper, Century, as [...] "Mr Magoo". On 14 October 1960, Heffron presided over the official opening of Warragamba Dam, the completion of which meant that it became the primary reservoir and the first reliable water supply for the whole Sydney catchment. At the opening, Heffron declared: [...] "We have come along way from the Tank Stream, Sydney's first water supply".|$|E

2500|$|John Gregory Bourke's {{memoir of}} his {{service in the}} Indian wars, On the Border with Crook, {{describes}} a different account of Crazy Horse's death. He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse's rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse's arrest and wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse's death. [...] Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, standing behind him, seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on one elbow, and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back. The chief fell and surrendered to the guards.|$|E

2500|$|On December 20, 1861, General Sibley, {{in command}} of the Army of New Mexico, issued a {{proclamation}} taking possession of New Mexico {{in the name of the}} Confederate States. He called on the citizens to abandon their allegiance to the Union and to join the Confederacy, warning that those [...] "who co-operate with the enemy will be treated accordingly, and must be prepared to share their fate." [...] In February 1862, Sibley advanced northward from Fort Thorn up the valley of the Rio Grande, toward the territorial capital of Santa Fe and the Union storehouses at Fort Union. Along the way, Sibley detached 54 men to occupy Tucson. The Confederate advance followed the west bank of the river via Fort Craig, which was garrisoned by a 3,800-man Union force under Canby. Knowing he could not leave such a large Union force <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he advanced, Sibley attempted to lure the Union forces out into battle on favorable terms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main event}} of the show was the final match of the 2012 Campeon Universal Del CMLL {{following}} qualifying rounds on the two previous Super Viernes shows. El Terrible [...] was accompanied by fellow La Fuerza TRT member Rey Bucanero while Hiroshi Tanahashi had CMLL's resident Rudo Japanese wrestler Okumura in his corner for this match. The IWGP World Heavyweight Champion and the CMLL World Heavyweight Champion faced off in a best of three falls match, the only match of the tournament contested under those rules. Despite being a rudo, the Mexican crowd was <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he worked with the Japanese Tanahashi, cheering with El Terrible tied the match up, one fall a piece and then pinned NJPW's top guy to become the 2012 Universal Champion. Following the decision El Terrible's rival Rush came to the ring and wanted to attack El Terrible but CMLL officials prevented this from happening. Once Rush {{was removed from the}} arena El Terrible was allowed to celebrate his victory and to show off the championship belt that came with the tournament victory.|$|E
2500|$|Just as the feud {{was about}} to reach its heated highlight, the Junkyard Dog left Mid-South and signed with the World Wrestling Federation without informing booker Bill Watts of his decision. This meant that the {{federation}} was without their biggest face and the shows had to be hastily rebooked. Watts brought in [...] "Master G" [...] (journeyman wrestler George Wells) to take JYD’s place but the feud between Reed and “Master G" [...] never took off forcing Watts to rethink his options. When [...] "General" [...] Skandor Akbar entered the Mid-South and started to build a stable of heels, he presented Buddy Landel with a golden Rolex watch {{with the understanding that}} it wasn’t actually for Landel but for someone else Akbar was trying to recruit. When Landel tried to give the watch to Reed, he became incensed, in the storyline, stomped on the watch, and started to brawl with his former partner. Akbar and his cronies came to ringside, which prompted Reed to rant on them getting the crowd <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he told them he didn’t need back-up. When “Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan came to his rescue from a 3 on 1 attack, Reed’s face status was cemented. The two Hacksaws feuded with Akbar’s army of Landel, Ted Dibiase, Steve Williams, and Hercules. The two Hacksaws were successful at first, until Reed came up against Kamala. He proved to be too much for Reed, beating him all over the Mid-South territory before Reed quietly left.|$|E
