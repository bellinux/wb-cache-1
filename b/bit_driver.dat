From a consideration of the mathematical operations describing the digital to analogue conversion process in a digital loudspeaker, it is concluded that n identical analogue filters (where n is the number of bits) separately filtering each <b>bit</b> <b>driver</b> offers a practical alternative to digital signal processing. The implementation of a multiple driver multiple voice coil digital loudspeaker is described. The effect of component tolerances in the crossover and compatibility with the requirements of current drive are evaluated. The interactions between the motion emf, driving current and mutual coupling emfs are considered. It is concluded that this method of crossover implementation is both viable and achievable...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into four subsections: 1) LED Source Components, 2) Source Modulation Electronics, 3) Photodetector Components, and 4) Receiver Electronics. The {{important}} characteristics of LED source components are discussed, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Edge, dome, flat, Burrus, and miniature-lensed Burrus LED types are identified, and performance parameters available from each are comparatively tabularized. The source modulation electronics discussion {{is divided into}} analog and digital cate-gories. Two practical linear IM driver configurations are presented (low and high frequency), and practical, digital low and high <b>bit</b> rate <b>driver</b> configurations are presented. The design considerations underlying each circuit are discussed. Solid-state optoelectronic detectors of interest in fiber optics communications fall into the two general categories of avalanching and nonavalanching (PN /PIN). Available performance in several key parameter areas is quantified for both types. The receiver electronic con-figuration discussion begins with examination of a general block diagram and brief description of each function. Focus is then concentrated on the transresistance pre-amplifier function, with the presentation and parameter comparison of four practical preamplifier configurations (including two hybrid preamplifiers). A graph showing the available system NEP performance versus avalanche gain {{with one of the}} best available avalanche detectors is presented...|$|R
2500|$|Digital {{speakers}} {{have been}} the subject of experiments performed by Bell Labs as far back as the 1920s. The design is simple; each <b>bit</b> controls a <b>driver,</b> which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate sound reproduction quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent analog digital conversion problems, the effect of aliasing is unavoidable, so that the audio output is [...] "reflected" [...] at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the sampling frequency, causing an unacceptably high level of ultrasonics to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.|$|R

40|$|Modern mobile {{devices such}} as smart phones and laptops need large and fast {{memories}} for their multimedia-intensive applications. To obtain a long standalone time, the power used by these memories need to be minimized. This power consists of two parts: a constant leakage power and an active power which is only consumed when the memory is in use. The cost of the systems-on-a-chip used in these devices needs to be as limited as possible. For these reasons, and to obtain sufficient speed, highly scaled technologies are used. These systems-on-a-chip already consists for a large part out of memories. Every increase in memory area should be avoided. The {{same is true for}} adding power supplies. In addition, a few difficulties that impede the design of these memories arise when deep submicron technologies are used. The most important are leakage and variability. The goal of this work is to design high speed memories for use close to the CPU that use as little energy as possible. Different techniques to achieve this goal are discussed and some new methods are proposed. Leakage is reduced without compromising speed by increasing both threshold and supply voltage. To reduce unnecessary activity, word lines are divided and a distributed decoder is used. As the largest part of the active energy is used in the bit lines, different energy reduction techniques are applied. These include the use of divided bit lines with read buffers and local sense amplifiers, a dual swing data link method and a low swing write scheme. It is almost impossible to design low power memories without using at least one extra power supply. To avoid the cost of such a supply, an integrated charge pump topology is proposed. Dynamic stability is employed to guarantee robustness. A hybrid static/dynamic decoder is used to speed up the design. To prove the functionality of these techniques, two prototype memories were designed, fabricated and measured. State-of-the-art results were obtained.
