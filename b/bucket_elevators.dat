5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators.</b> He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1780s Oliver Evans {{invented a}} fully {{automatic}} mill that could process grain with practically no human labor or operator attention. This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> and conveyor belts, which would eventually revolutionize materials handling, and 2) it used governors, a forerunner of modern automation, for control.|$|E
25|$|Classical mill {{designs were}} {{generally}} powered by water or air. In water-powered mills, a sluice gate opens a channel, starts the water flowing, and a water wheel turning. In 1787, American inventor Oliver Evans revolutionized this labor-intensive process by building the first fully automatic mill using <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators,</b> screw conveyors, and the hopper boy to spread, cool, and dry the meal between grinding and bolting. This {{was the first}} time that anyone had conceived and executed a system of continuous, fully automatic production.|$|E
40|$|The need {{of energy}} {{consumption}} increases {{year by year}} for every country. But, volume or quantity of popular energy resources (oil and gas) are decreased. So, many industry makes a decision to change from those popular energy resources to other alternative energy resources like coal. <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> is one of material handling equipment which used to lift bulk material from bottom upward. But, lack in designing a <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> can cause failure in operation of <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator.</b> So, to develope a <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> calculation is neccesary in designing (choosing a right components) of <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> and in process of calculating its capacity. <b>Bucket</b> <b>Elevator</b> Calculation {{can be used to}} calculate capacity of a <b>bucket</b> <b>elevator</b> and to select the right components.

25|$|Early grain {{elevators}} and bins {{were often}} built of framed or cribbed wood, and were prone to fire. Grain-elevator bins, tanks, and silos are now usually {{made of steel}} or reinforced concrete. <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> are used to lift grain to a distributor or consignor, from which it falls through s and/or conveyors and into one or more bins, silos, or tanks in a facility. When desired, silos, bins, and tanks are emptied by gravity flow, sweep augers, and conveyors. As grain is emptied from bins, tanks, and silos it is conveyed, blended, and weighted into trucks, railroad cars, or barges, and shipped to grain wholesalers, exporters, and/or local end-users, such as flour mills, breweries, and ethanol and alcohol distilleries.|$|E
500|$|Although {{several key}} {{elements}} of Evans's designs—such as <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> and Archimedean screws—were merely modified rather than invented by him, the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution {{and the development of}} mass production. Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line. His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time, and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept would take more than a century to be fully realized. However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans's milling designs, first to related industries such as brewing and baking, then eventually {{to a wide variety of}} products, as technology and prevailing opinion caught up. Evans contributions were later deemed to be so important that eminent industrial historian Sigfried Giedion would conclude that in this respect, Evans [...] "opens a new chapter in the history of mankind".|$|E
500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. Evans had seen diagrams of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|E

50|$|The grain {{elevator}} may contain {{several types of}} these conveyors, such as belt or drag conveyors. In addition, they utilize <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> to lift the grain from the drop off point to the storage bins. <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> {{can be used in}} many places of final storage or use, after grain is dropped off by whatever form of transportation was used to get it there. Bucket conveyors often impart little mechanical damage because the grains are not continually moving with respect to each other. Grain damage is only imparted when the kernels are loaded into the buckets {{at the bottom of the}} elevator and when they are discharged at the top.|$|E

5000|$|To prevent dust {{explosions and}} fires, {{employers}} must (among other things):Develop {{and implement a}} written housekeeping program with instructions to reduce dust accumulations on ledges, floors, equipment and other exposed surfaces.Identify [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas in grain elevators. The [...] "priority" [...] housekeeping areas include floor areas within 35 feet of inside <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators,</b> floors of enclosed areas containing grinding equipment and floors of enclosed areas containing grain dryers located inside the facility. Dust accumulations in these priority housekeeping areas shall not exceed 1/8th inch. Employers should {{make every effort to}} minimize dust accumulations on exposed surfaces since dust is the fuel for a fire or explosion, and it is recognized that a 1/8 inch dust accumulation is more than enough to fuel such occurrences.Inside <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> can undergo primary explosions. OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. <b>Bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing. These <b>bucket</b> <b>elevators</b> must be equipped with a motion detection device which will shut-down the elevator when the belt speed is reduced by no more than 20% of the normal operating speed.Implement a preventative maintenance program with regularly scheduled inspections for mechanical and safety control equipment, which may include heat producing equipment such as motors, bearings, belts etc. Preventive maintenance is critical to controlling ignition sources. The use of vibration detection methods, heat sensitive tape or other heat detection methods can help in the implementation of the program.Minimize ignition sources through controlling hot work (electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar flame producing operations).Install wiring and electrical equipment suitable for hazardous locations.Design and properly locate dust collection systems to minimize explosion hazards. All filter collectors installed after March 1988 shall be located outside the facility or located in an area inside the facility protected by an explosion suppression system or located in an area that is separated from other areas by construction having at least a one-hour fire resistance rating and which is located next to an exterior wall vented to the outside.Install an effective means of removing ferrous material from grain streams so that such material does not enter equipment such as hammer mills, grinders and pulverizers.|$|E
