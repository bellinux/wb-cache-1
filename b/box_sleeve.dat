50|$|On February 4, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil {{charges against}} 2 former {{employees}} of Anchor Bay Entertainment, a former subsidiary of Handleman Company.

Each LP was set into a plastic carrier that touched only the center spindle hole and the rim. There were two rereleases of this set. The second used ordinary paper sleeves inside a foldout compartment to house the LPs. The third used a side-open <b>box</b> and paper <b>sleeves.</b> In all three sets the vinyl quality was the same.|$|R
5000|$|The first CD edition was {{released}} in Japan in the early 1990s. It came in both jewel <b>box</b> and paper <b>sleeve</b> versions. This version {{was the same as}} the original vinyl but was mastered from a tape copy several generations removed from the original master. In 2002 the group members authorised a revised version of the CD with improved sound. The revised version can be recognised by the use of green lettering on the cover instead of pink. A phrase near the beginning of [...] "Suite in C" [...] has slightly different lyrics. Some of the tracks of the 2002 edition have very minor editing. There are a few slightly different segues in the song [...] "Birdman" [...] and the sections of this song are marked as separate tracks on the CD.|$|R

The standalone CD has {{a close-up of}} Koda looking down to the camera, holding a cigarette holder. The CD and DVD format has a long shot of Koda sitting at on a chair with different flowers sitting on the head piece. The three limited edition <b>box</b> set cover <b>sleeves</b> are similar images with different poses; the first box set has Koda {{standing in front of}} a wall with Japanese design; Koda is holding a traditional Oil-paper umbrella and is dressed in a pink kimono. The second box set artwork has Koda facing towards the camera, similar to the previous box set. The only change in the third box set artwork is that Koda is seen without holding the umbrella. The digital release uses the first limited edition box set artwork. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Japanese designer Jun Hirota, and the design was based on traditional Japanese culture and the emphasizing of geisha art. The photo album that came with the second limited edition box set features a 28-page spread, featuring different images from the Japonesque photo shoot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{factory in}} Cowcliffe near Huddersfield was opened in early 1970. Mathias would drive from Huddersfield {{with a small}} number of {{completed}} amplifier chassis which would be fitted into <b>sleeves,</b> <b>boxed</b> and despatched from the Orange Shop in London. At this time business in London was moving very rapidly however the situation in Huddersfield was much slower. Whilst visiting the factory for a production meeting, Cooper was struck by the slow pace of production. Large numbers of back orders meant that production at Cowcliffe was failing to keep up with demand and the low number of units being produced caused the operation to be non cost effective and not covering its overheads. The decision was taken to end Orange's relationship with Matamp. Cooper and Mathias remained on friendly terms despite the split with Cooper describing Mathias as, [...] "A real gentleman for whom I have always had nothing but the greatest admiration." [...] After the decision to cease production in Huddersfield, Cooper located premises in a derelict shop on the corner of Neil's Yard and Short's Gardens in the Covent Garden area of London. This move was to increase productivity and to provide more room for cabinet making, amp testing and storage, with cabinets being produced on the ground floor and amplifiers in the basement. In 1971 whilst driving in London, Cooper noticed the new road signs being introduced into the UK used graphic symbols rather than words and asked the design team {{to come up with a}} set of custom symbols that would clearly show what the control was for and would make sense to users who may not be familiar with English.|$|R
