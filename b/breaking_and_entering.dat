40|$|Summary. The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to provide specific knowledge of residential <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>enters</b> in Ottawa <b>and</b> Vanier from which various policies and strategies could be developed by the Ottawa Police Force to combat this crime. This thesis acted as a test pilot project. An areal study of residential <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>enter</b> was conducted {{to focus on the}} patterns of distribution of this crime throughout the cities of Ottawa and Vanier. The areal analysis identified clusters of offences within the city and an ecological analysis of these clusters, involving such objective measures as demographic, socio-economic, and living conditions were used to demonstrate their evironmental correlates. Proximity to an offender and affluence of the area were identified as factors associated with the <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>enter</b> rates during this test period. The third and final {{objective of this}} thesis involved recommendations for changes to and introduction of new strategies for combating residential <b>break</b> <b>and</b> <b>enter.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
