A powerful implementation of such operations must rely on the inherent typographic attributes of the typeface. However, even today's most advanced typeface representations support only geometric outline representations and basic font variations. In this paper we discuss high-level typeface representations which we term Parametric Typographic Representations (PTRs). We present an algorithm for automatically extracting typographic elements of typefaces from their outline representation, which is an essential initial step in converting typefaces from outline representations to PTRs. The extracted typographic elements include serifs, <b>bars,</b> <b>stems,</b> slants, bows, arcs, curve <b>stems</b> and curve <b>bars.</b> Most notable is the treatment of serifs, which are represented by finite-automata.

In addition, movement in a diagonal plane uses modified double-stemmed arrows: A cross <b>bar</b> on the <b>stem</b> indicates that the motion is away as well up or down, and a solid dot indicates approaching motion. To & fro movement that also goes over or under something uses modified single-stemmed arrows, with the part of the arrow representing near motion thicker than the rest.

Previous ancient DNA analyses of mitochondrial control region sequences indicated the New Zealand dog population included two lineages. We sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes of fourteen dogs from the colonisation era archaeological site of Wairau Bar and found five closely-related haplotypes. The limited number of mitochondrial lineages present at Wairau Bar suggests that the founding population may have comprised only a few dogs; or that the arriving dogs were closely related. For populations such as that at Wairau <b>Bar,</b> which <b>stemmed</b> from relatively recent migration events, control region sequences have insufficient power to address questions about population structure and founding events. Sequencing mitogenomes provided the opportunity to observe sufficient diversity to discriminate between individuals that would otherwise be assigned the same haplotype and to clarify their relationships with each other. Our results also support the proposition that at least one dispersal of dogs into the Pacific was via a south-western route through Indonesia...|$|R

As he was fitting his handle <b>bars</b> onto the <b>stem</b> of the bicycle he noticed that it was to high for his liking and presumably it couldn't be lowered far enough down to get the feel and leverage he desired. he then removed the clamp the part that actually held fast to the handlebars, from the stem, that was inserted into the head tube and into the fork's neck. He flipped it over and reattached it. He was able then to drop the bottom of the bars another few millimeters to his liking. He later won his Cruiser class at this national using that configuration. He would then persuade [...] "Tuff Neck", a leading manufacturer of BMX bicycle parts at the time, to mass-produce the new component.|$|R

No metal nails of any kind could have held in the keen frost; they would have snapped like glass at the first jolt; but the seal-skin fastenings yielded to the rude shocks and twistings, to which the sledge was subjected, and seldom gave way, or, if they did, were easily and speedily renewed without the aid of any other implement than a knife.|$|R
5000|$|Since the cyclist in a {{time trial}} is not {{permitted}} to draft (ride in the slipstream) behind other cyclists, reducing aerodynamic drag of the bicycle and rider is critical. One difference between a time trial bicycle and a road bicycle {{is the use of}} triathlon handlebars or aerobars. The main part of the bullhorns curves forward (like a road handlebar), but where the road handle bar curves down, the time trial bar ends. This provides a low tucked position that is aerodynamic while providing good stability. The time trial bar also uses a [...] "clip on" [...] bar or aerobar which attaches to the main <b>bar</b> near the <b>stem</b> and provides a position where the hands and fore-arms are close together, low and forward, providing a very aerodynamic (though less stable) position. The aerobar became popular when in 1989 Greg LeMond made up 50 seconds to defeatLaurent Fignon (the race leader) in the final stage (and final time trial) of the Tour de France. Time trial races tend to be much shorter than road races, so comfort is less of an issue. Also, control of the bike is less important, since there is little chance of bumping another rider and the courses tend to be less technical with little hill climbing, turns or descents.|$|R

This process is typically referred to as in situ solidification/stabilization (S/S).

40|$|The space {{environment}} contains many harsh characteristics that are harmful to spacecraft and threaten {{the success of}} space missions. Atomic oxygen (AO) and outgassing are among the chief concerns that spacecraft engineers must design for {{in order to ensure}} the safety of a spacecraft. AO is monatomic oxygen (O 1) that is created when Ultraviolet (UV) radiation photochemically disassociates diatomic oxygen (O 2) in space. AO is the dominant atmospheric constituent between 175 and 600 km, and is a great concern in low earth orbits. Orbital AO has an average impact energy of 4. 5 ± 1 eV with orbiting spacecraft and is also very reactive; this makes AO very corrosive to spacecraft materials. Outgassing is the process by which trapped and adsorbed gases are expelled from materials. The high temperatures and low pressure of the spacecraft environment exacerbate the process of outgassing. Outgassing is problematic for spacecraft because outgassed material can condense on sensitive surfaces such as optical and thermal surfaces, or the material can create clouds that impede sensors ability to observe their target. While it has been shown that many aspects of the spacecraft environment act synergistically together to further degrade spacecraft performance, there is very little information and data available on the interactions between AO and outgassing. Cal Poly’s Space Environments Lab is equipped with an AO simulation vacuum chamber (MAX) and an outgas testing chamber (Micro-VCM) which is capable of testing materials for total mass loss (TML) and collected volatile condensable mass (CVCM) outgassing values. MAX and Micro-VCM were used in tandem to test different spacecraft materials in order to determine if AO exposure had any effect on the respective materials TML and CVCM values. Prior to conducting testing, Micro-VCM was refurbished and validated since it was recently donated to Cal Poly and was not in working order upon arrival. Three Sheldahl materials were tested: aluminum coated 1. 0 mil Kapton tape, 2. 0 mil Kapton film coated with ITO on one side and aluminum on the other, and 2. 0 Kapton film coated with aluminum. The materials were exposed to an average AO fluence of 1. 33 ± 0. 130 × 1021 atoms/cm 2 for AO testing. The TML and CVCM results from four of the six tests did not show any significant changes between AO samples and control samples, partially due to large error <b>bars</b> that <b>stem</b> from using a semi-microbalance instead of a full microbalance. However, the AO exposed ITO-Kapton-Al did show an increase in TML from - 0. 03 ± 0. 09 % to 0. 19 ± 0. 08 % for one procedure, while the aluminum Kapton tape CVCM decreased from 0. 81 ± 0. 12 % to 0. 63 ± 0. 12 % for another procedure. These results show that two materials exhibited a change in their outgassing properties after AO exposure. More testing on the subject is warranted and should be conducted in order to collect more data points and begin defining trend lines that can further describe the effects of AO on outgassing...|$|R
