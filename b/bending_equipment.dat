The parts of the system allow easy plug and play operation and can be installed for any bending length. The diode laser, {{which is based on}} 200 [*]W laser bars on microchannel cooler, allows the heating of sheet metals in the forming zone shortly before and during the bending process. There is no unnecessary heating of other parts of the <b>bending</b> <b>equipment,</b> no wear of the tool, and, if properly done, no damage of the surface of the metal. The power per bending length is 16 [*]kW/m...|$|E

This paper {{investigated}} the thermo-mechanical bending failure characteristic of air plasma-sprayed (APS) {{thermal barrier coating}} (TBC) system at 1000 o C by three-point bending test. A through-width surface pre-crack on the centre surface of the top ceramic coating (TC) in TBC sample was firstly designed and made by air plasma spraying technology. The fracture characteristic and spallation phenomena of the TBC were investigated under bending test in air at 1000 o C. The effects of constant displacement rate, span width of <b>bending</b> <b>equipment</b> and thermal aging time on the thermo-mechanical bending failure of the APS TBC system were slight at 1000 o C. Using SEM observations and EDX analysis, the interface cracks initiation, propagation and coalescence were discussed in detail. Furthermore, the fracture surface located within the TBC close to the TBC/TGO interface for all APS TBC samples under bending at 1000 o C...|$|E

The finishing experiments using austenitic stainless steel tubes bent by both cold–drawing and high frequency induction bending demonstrate the finishing characteristics and reveal {{the differences in the}} finishing mechanism between the two types of elbows. The elbow made by cold–drawing required only one finishing process to achieve a 0. 03 µm Ra surface. In contrast, high frequency bent elbow, which is covered with an oxide film, required two–stage finishing using two different sizes of ferrous particles for a smoothly finished surface, 0. 05 ~ 0. 13 µm Ra...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Improving the {{straightness}} {{accuracy of}} bending workpieces becomes an urgent {{problem for the}} development of <b>bending</b> <b>equipment</b> with large size and high precision. In order to obtain the characteristics of slider deformation, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed according to the mechanic characteristics of large-scale press brake and obtained the small deformation using FEM (finite element method). The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimentation. Then based on the simulation results we design a large-scale mechanical crowning system through which the press brake could be automatically compensated in the bend direction by means of a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) -powered motor and could also be compensated for local parts by adjusting the side screw nuts manually. The system has been successfully applied in production and its accuracy was increased 33 % compared with the traditional ones. It is proved that the present investigation can provide a technical support and reliable system for the improvement of accuracy of the press brakes...|$|E
40|$|Environmental stress cracking(ESC) {{behavior}} of silicone coated polycarbonate (PC) in ethanol was studied. Stress relaxation of PC and PC/silicone coating under a combined action of ethanol and stress {{was measured by}} self-made three point <b>bending</b> <b>equipment.</b> After stress relaxation testing, crack morphology was observed by polarizing microscope. The results indicate that silicone coating is able to improve the stress cracking resistance of PC parts in ethanol. The coated PC shows slower stress relaxation rate and less number of cracks than pristine PC. It is mainly attributed to that the silicone coating can provide barrier effect to the absorption and diffusion of ethanol in PC substrate. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of flexible silicone coating matched fairly well with that of PC, so that the coating is uneasy to peel off from PC substrate during the ESC testing. The silicone coating has a favorable effect to protect PC substrate from ESC under the combined action of solvent and stress...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Different acrylic bone cements {{based upon}} PMMA-MMA system are {{applicable}} for implant fixation in bone tissue. The aim of {{present study is}} the optimisation {{of the structure of}} some new bone acrylic cements {{made on the basis of}} PMMA-ethylmethacrylate-triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate and bone cements having additives (HA and radio pacifier), and the finding of the effect of these modifications on the flexural strength and stiffness. Design/methodology/approach: Different new bone cements on the basis of PMMA-EMA-TEGDMA system (ABC) were developed experimentally. The stiffness and strength of the samples of these modified cements were determined in the special three point <b>bending</b> <b>equipment.</b> Findings: A comparison of the flexural properties of new PMMA-EMA-TEGDMA cements and commercial available PMMA-MMA cement showed that commercial bone cement had larger values of ultimate strength and modulus of elasticity, but the difference is not very important. As concerns the polymerisation peak temperature, then there is a significant difference between commercial PMMA-MMA cement (~ 800 C) and PMMA-EMA-TEGDMA modified cements (50 – 600 C). The introduction of 10 % and 18 % of HA into solid phase does not influence essentially strength and modulus of elasticity of the PMMA-EMA-TEGDMA bone cements. The introduction of radio pacifier BaSO 4 into bone cement leads to flexural strength diminishing. Low polymerisation peak temperature and appropriate mechanical properties of bone cements developed allows regarding new 3 -D structure acrylic bone cements as promising biomaterials. Research limitations/implications: It is supposed to carry out animal testing to learn more about reaction of modified implanted material on the biological environment. Practical implications: The new materials could be efficiently used as bone cements because they will not damage surrounding biological tissue during curing. Originality/value: Paper is providing the new information about possibilities to realize the safe fixation of implants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHigh {{intensity}} {{shot peening}} treatments have been {{combined with other}} different second treatments, such as low intensity shot peening, vibratory finishing and grit blasting with fine alumina powders, in order to optimize the fatigue life of a medium-alloyed, quenched and tempered, structural steel with a very high strength (2000 MPa). Single low intensity shot peening treatments using ceramic balls were also used with the same objective. Roughness and residual stress profiles were measured, while the fatigue behavior was analyzed using a rotating <b>bending</b> fatigue <b>equipment.</b> Fracture surfaces were also analyzed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) {{and the location of}} the fatigue crack initiation was detected. Although the maximum stress in our fatigue tests is always applied {{on the surface of the}} specimen, the appropriate surface treatment combinations were able to optimize the fatigue response of the steel until the point where the fatigue crack initiated in the specimen interior (subsurface nucleation), due to the microstructural stress concentration provided by small alumina inclusions present in the microstructure of the steel. The amplitude of the stress intensity factor necessary to propagate fatigue cracks in the studied steel and the intrinsic stress intensity factor threshold, ΔKth, were finally obtained...|$|R

Buckling may be demonstrated by pressing the opposite edge of a plate toward one another.

Zero G was simulated by harness suspension and 3 G by centrifugation. Bone strength (S) was determined by bending (using modified quasi-static cantilever <b>bending</b> methods and <b>equipment</b> described by Wunder et al., 1977 and 1979) and Ca content (C, by mass pct) determined by atomic absorption spectrometry; results were compared with data obtained on both normal and harnessed control animals at 1 G. Multiple regression showed significant {{dependence of}} S upon earth's gravity, independent from C, for {{which there was no}} significant coefficient of partial regression.

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of {{research}} aimed at creating theoretical grounds for a new method of mandrelless small-radius tube bending (1. 5 Dr<Rg< 2. 5 Dr, where Dr - tube diameter, Rg - bending radius). As the result of applying such a methodology {{it is possible to}} carry out the bending process (with an angle of up to 180 °) and obtain an ovalization and wall thinning in the bending area, which are much smaller than those in currently manufactured products. The currently used bending methods and <b>bending</b> <b>equipment</b> are able to achieve a minimum bending radius not less than three times the tube outer diameter. The research hypothesis has assumed the existence of tube bending methods that are more efficient that those known so far. Than methods do not rely on circular bending contours, but instead they may use other shaping die contours which has not been explored yet. Circular benders used in practice fail in that they do not yield the expected results on small radii and do not control the material flow (do not ensure its correct behaviour) in the bending zone. The literature review has shown that there are currently no theoretical studies, numerical analyses and experimental verifications related to the processes of mandrelless tube bending on small radii, i. e. for 1. 5 D≤R≥ 2. 5 D, where: (R - bending radius, D - tube outer diameter) up to an angle of 180 °. Due to the lack of studies on this subject, in their approach to the numerical modelling of the problem, the authors of the paper were guided by their own experience in this field and made every effort to make the numerical model reflect the actual process as accurately as possible. They were only aided by the general knowledge accumulated in the literature on numerical modelling. To sum up, the purpose of the publication is to demonstrate that the change in the die recess towards a shape resembling an ellipse results in a change in the characteristics of metal flow (movement) along the tube perimeter and in a change in the stress characteristics and, as a consequence, a change in the tube cross-section in the bending zone. The research discussed in this paper seeks to establish the correct flow of material in the tube cross-section in the bending zone by determining the most efficient bender recess shape and friction surface forming, which will eliminate the excessive ovalization and upper wall thinning. The expected effect of implementing this bending technology will be increasing the flow capacity in energy systems, which will directly translate into a reduction of atmospheric CO emissions due to the lower energy consumption. In addition, the paper has presented the concepts of tools intended for the experimental verification of tube bending process...|$|E
40|$|PurposeThe aims of {{this thesis}} were: 1. To study {{the effect of}} water and pH on {{composite}} resin materials in vitro by assessing sorption, solubility, monomers eluted and flexural properties. 2. To study adverse effects on the skin in dentists possibly caused by acrylic resin-based materials. Materials and MethodsProprietary composite resin materials {{were used for the}} in vitro experiments. The tests were performed according to the ISO 4049 (1988) with exception of McIlvaine´s solution used in Study II and the storage times. The analysis of eluted monomers was performed using HPLC. The flexural properties were tested in a three-point <b>bending</b> <b>equipment.</b> The secant modulus and deflection at break were calculated for description of the viscoelastic behaviour of the material tested. To study the adverse effects on skin in dentists, a questionnaire was sent to 3500 randomly selected Swedish dentists. A response rate of 88 % was achieved and the data were statistically analysed and compared to the results of two studies on skin symptoms among the general Swedish population. Dentists living in the three main cities in Sweden who had experienced hand eczema during the last 12 months were invited to a clinical examination in which a patch test was included. ResultsA wide range in sorption and solubility over the test period was found, with low sorption values observed for materials containing hydrophobic matrix monomers. A maximum concentration of monomers eluted was found after 7 days of storage, and TEGDMA was the main monomer released. pH affected the sorption and solubility behaviour for two of the three materials tested. The flexural strength and modulus of the composite resin material were lowered after water storage and the secant modulus and deflection at break could describe the viscoelastic behaviour. The prevalence of dry skin and hand eczema was high in dentists compared to two age-matched general population samples investigated using identical questions. The most important predictor for adult hand eczema was found to be childhood eczema. At the clinical examination, irritant contact dermatitis was the predominant diagnosis. Seven per cent reported skin symptoms when working with acrylic resin-based material but the true prevalence of hand eczema caused by acrylates was below 1 %. Contact allergy was diagnosed, however, in 50 % of the dentists, mainly due to other allergens such as nickel, perfumes or rubber chemicals. ConclusionsThe matrix composition was shown to be important for the sorption and solubility behaviour of the composite resin materials tested and a maximum release of monomers occurred after 7 days of storage. pH affected the water sorption and solubility behaviour. Calculation of the secant modulus and the deflection at break allowed the plasticising effect of water on composite resin material to be observed. The prevalence of hand eczema was high among dentists, with irritant contact dermatits as the predominant diagnose. Childhood eczema was the most important predictor for adult hand eczema. The prevalence of hand eczema owing to acrylates was below 1 %...|$|E

Experimental tests are practically only option to assess the behavior of glass and to certificate it.
