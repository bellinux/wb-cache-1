Homer tries {{not to think about}} beer while he rides a <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> work. After a series of severe temptations, Homer crashes his bike as hundreds of bottles of Duff parachuted down on him from a blimp.|$|E
5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which non-oscillatory leaning increases, where the capsize mode {{eigenvalues}} switch from negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8m/s (18mph) in this example, is called the capsize speed. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> fall over.|$|E
5|$|Any rider {{may take}} {{unlimited}} trips {{of up to}} 30 minutes, measured from when the bike is withdrawn from a dock to when it is returned. (If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips from place to place instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E

5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E

His father played basketball {{at the high school}} level and first introduced his son to the sport when he was five years old. The younger Hilliard also played football growing up, but preferred basketball. His favorite NBA player was Allen Iverson. He used to <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> Philadelphia Eagles practices as a kid.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the steering axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the MotoGP class in 2002, Roberts' team developed a five-cylinder bike called the KR5. The team was originally well-funded by Proton of Malaysia, but {{by the middle of the}} 2004 season, it became apparent that the Roberts team was not able to field an engine capable of competing with the dominant Japanese factories. Roberts turned to the KTM factory to provide engines for the 2005 season, however after ten races KTM abruptly withdrew their support on the eve of the Czech Republic Grand Prix, forcing the team to miss several races. Honda stepped in to help Roberts' team for the 2006 season by providing five-cylinder engines, as Robert's son, Kenny Roberts Jr., rode the Team Roberts KR211V <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> a sixth place in the championship including two podium results. The 2007 season saw {{the introduction}} of a new MotoGP engine formula using 800cc four-stroke engines. Roberts would once again secure engines from Honda for the Team Roberts KR212V race bike, but the results were not as hoped, and funding for the team faded. After the 2007 season, Roberts pulled out of MotoGP competition due to the lack of sponsorship.|$|E

25|$|To {{straighten}} {{back out}} of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel contact patches farther to the left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn.|$|E
25|$|According to the Hurt Report, most {{motorcycle}} {{riders in}} the United States would over-brake and skid {{the rear wheel}} and under-brake the front when trying hard to avoid a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially absent with many motorcycle operators. The often small amount of initial countersteering input required to get the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> lean, which may {{be as little as}} 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.|$|E
50|$|The {{new rules}} also changed the {{minimum number of}} <b>bikes</b> {{required}} <b>to</b> acquire homologation.

From 2010 onwards, the minimum production number was increased <b>to</b> 3,000 <b>bikes.</b> In the past, smaller manufacturers were allowed to build as few as 150 <b>bikes</b> <b>to</b> meet the homologation requirements. Manufacturers took advantage of this by producing 'homologation specials'--highly tuned versions of their road bikes with performance parts designed especially for racing.|$|R

25|$|A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration {{study showed}} that rider lean has a larger {{influence}} on a lighter motorcycle than a heavier one, which helps explain why no-hands steering is less effective on heavy motorcycles. Leaning the torso {{with respect to the}} bike does not cause the <b>bike</b> <b>to</b> lean far enough to generate anything but the shallowest turns. No-hands riders may be able to keep a heavy bike centered in a lane and negotiate shallow highway turns, but not much else.|$|E
