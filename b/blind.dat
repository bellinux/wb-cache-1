A group of <b>blind</b> veterans, organised by the National League of the <b>Blind</b> and Disabled, was also on the march, demanding better allowances for the country's 67,000 <b>blind</b> persons.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for <b>blind</b> children in the world, the Royal Institute for <b>Blind</b> Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for <b>Blind</b> Youth in Paris. Braille, the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for <b>blind</b> children to learn and associate together.|$|E
5|$|Howard Hille Johnson (February 19, 1846– February 8, 1913) was a <b>blind</b> American {{educator}} and {{writer in the}} states of Virginia and West Virginia.

50|$|These <b>blinds</b> can be {{classified}} broadly into six different categories: roller <b>blinds</b> (which do not have slats but consist of {{a single piece of}} material), Roman <b>blinds,</b> pleated <b>blinds,</b> Venetian <b>blinds,</b> Shoji Japanese <b>blinds</b> and vertical <b>blinds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Other {{varieties}} of window <b>blinds</b> include mini <b>blinds</b> (Venetian <b>blinds</b> with very narrow slats, usually 1 inch (25 mm) wide), micro <b>blinds</b> (usually [...] inch (12 mm) wide), louvers, jalousies, brise soleil, Holland <b>blinds,</b> pleated <b>blinds,</b> and roller shades.|$|R
50|$|The term window <b>blinds</b> {{can also}} be used to {{describe}} window coverings generically—in this context window <b>blinds</b> include almost every type of window covering, i.e. shutters, roller <b>blinds,</b> cellular shades (also called honeycomb shades), wood <b>blinds,</b> roman <b>blinds</b> and of course, standard vertical and horizontal <b>blinds.</b> In the United Kingdom, awnings are sometimes called <b>blinds</b> or shades.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Hill won the Athlete of the Year {{award in}} the athletes with a {{disability}} category. He won again in the next year. In 2003, Hill was awarded the <b>Blind</b> Sports award from the British Columbia <b>Blind</b> Sports and Recreation Association (BCBSRA).|$|E
5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the <b>blind</b> in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and <b>blind</b> West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and <b>blind</b> in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the <b>blind.</b> Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the <b>blind.</b> He and other educated <b>blind</b> people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E
5|$|Joan Allen, {{who played}} Dollarhyde's <b>blind</b> love {{interest}} Reba McClane, recalls meeting {{with representatives of}} the New York Institute for the <b>Blind</b> in preparation for her role.

50|$|The term window <b>blinds</b> is also {{sometimes}} used, somewhat inaccurately, to describe window coverings generically—in this context window <b>blinds</b> include almost {{every type of}} window covering, including both curtains and <b>blinds</b> for homes and commercial premises, such as bars/pubs, offices, and shops, e.g., Plantation Shutters/Jigsaw Shutters, Roman <b>blinds,</b> roller <b>blinds,</b> and of course, vertical and horizontal <b>blinds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Window <b>blinds</b> {{reduce the}} heat from sunlight. Ancient Egyptian pharaohs had <b>blinds</b> made of reeds. The most {{inexpensive}} <b>blinds</b> in the 19th century were home-made roller <b>blinds,</b> made of cloth.|$|R
50|$|In poker {{games with}} <b>blinds,</b> {{chopping}} the <b>blinds</b> is a custom {{that may occur}} when all other players fold to the <b>blinds</b> before the flop. The <b>blinds</b> then remove their bets, ending the hand.|$|R
5|$|On September 29, 1870, the institute, {{which was}} later {{known as the}} West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and <b>Blind,</b> opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute {{building}} with 25 deaf and five <b>blind</b> students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into {{the campus of the}} Schools for the Deaf and <b>Blind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{has been}} <b>blind</b> from birth due to {{retinopathy}} of prematurity, {{but has been}} gifted with absolute pitch memory and a clear vocal tone. In 1996, she was a guest performer on Sesame Street, where she was interviewed by Elmo and described to him how a <b>blind</b> person can learn to use other senses to adapt in the world. In 2000 she was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the <b>Blind.</b>|$|E
5|$|A newly {{designed}} braille template {{was used for}} the first time in a National election, allowing <b>blind</b> voters to vote independently for the first time. In previous elections, <b>blind</b> voters had to communicate their choice of party to a voting official, who then filled in a ballot sheet on their behalf.|$|E
5000|$|Temporary <b>blinds</b> {{are common}} in {{protected}} and public areas where permanent fixture <b>blinds</b> are forbidden. Many are tent-like [...] "pop-up" [...] <b>blinds</b> which are quick and easy to erect. Boat <b>blinds</b> are used to conceal a hunter while hunting from a boat. Boat <b>blinds</b> can be handmade or are available from manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1971 by Tony Hillary. He originally made <b>blinds</b> in a converted garage {{at his home in}} Nottingham. As well as selling and fitting the <b>blinds,</b> Tony Hillary looked after advertising and manufacturing. Initially only two products Venetian <b>blinds</b> and vertical <b>blinds</b> were available. In 1974, roller <b>blinds</b> were introduced to the range.|$|R
50|$|The two overall {{types of}} window <b>blinds</b> are {{ready-made}} <b>blinds</b> {{and made to}} measure. Made-to-measure <b>blinds</b> are made to fit a given or measured window size. Ready-made <b>blinds</b> are manufactured in set sizes that can be cut down to fit any window.|$|R
5|$|<b>Blind</b> cricket, {{which is}} played {{basically}} the same as conventional cricket but using larger stumps and wickets and a white ball so that players may see it much more easily, is also played at the college, and RNC has its own cricket team, which competes in the British <b>Blind</b> Sport (BBS) National Cricket League. The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses air rifles fitted with photoelectric cells which convert light reflected from targets into sound.|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for <b>Blind</b> Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow <b>blind</b> people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the <b>blind.</b> He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{produced}} several written works about {{braille and}} as general {{education for the}} <b>blind.</b> Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs... (1829) was revised and republished in 1837; his mathematics guide, Little Synopsis of Arithmetic for Beginners, entered use in 1838; and his monograph New Method for Representing by Dots the Form of Letters, Maps, Geometric Figures, Musical Symbols, etc., for Use by the <b>Blind</b> {{was first published in}} 1839. Many of Braille's original printed works remain available at the Braille birthplace museum in Coupvray.|$|E
30|$|CBCT is {{the most}} {{accurate}} technique, both <b>blinded</b> and not <b>blinded,</b> when measuring root length and detecting root resorptions using a modified Malmgren score. PA images were comparable with CBCT for <b>blinded</b> and not <b>blinded</b> root length measurements but were not accurate when assessing root resorptions using the modified Malmgren score. PAN {{is not a good}} diagnostic tool for measuring <b>blinded</b> and not <b>blinded</b> root length and root resorptions. A better kappa agreement was seen for the least accurate technique, i.e., PAN.|$|R
30|$|<b>Blinding</b> of {{participants}} and personnel: None {{of the studies}} mentioned whether the surgeon or participants were <b>blinded,</b> so <b>blinding</b> was also considered to be unknown.|$|R

50|$|The ambush method, {{including}} hunting from <b>blinds,</b> {{consists of}} setting up or finding means of cover or concealment to assist in reducing {{the likelihood of the}} game detecting the hunter as he waits in ambush or approaches his prey. Ground <b>blinds,</b> tree stands, cocking-cloths, dugout <b>blinds,</b> and stand-alone structures are all used as <b>blinds</b> in hunting today. All of these <b>blinds</b> are used in the ambush method. Cocking-cloths, or stalking <b>blinds,</b> are used in stalking prey but may still be considered as an ambush. Generally, baiting big-game includes the use of blinds; all the methods described herein may be used in combination.|$|R

5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as <b>blind.</b> It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as <b>blind.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Honeycomb pleated <b>blinds,</b> or {{cellular}} <b>blinds</b> (actually cellular shades) {{are similar}} to pleated <b>blinds</b> except that they {{are made up of}} two or more layers joined at the pleats to form 'cellular' compartments that trap air, providing insulation. Due to their cellular construction, cellular <b>blinds</b> (aka energy saver) are known to the energy conscious as one of the highest energy-efficient and sound-absorbent <b>blinds</b> of any window treatment. For greater insulation, cellular <b>blinds</b> are available in a variety of cell sizes, including 3/8" [...] single cell, 3/4" [...] single cell, 3/8" [...] double cell and even triple cell. The more cells, the greater energy efficiency.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Blinding</b> is a {{cornerstone}} of therapeutic evaluation because lack of <b>blinding</b> can bias treatment effect estimates. An inventory of the <b>blinding</b> methods would help trialists conduct high-quality clinical trials and readers appraise the quality of results of published trials. We aimed to systematically classify and describe methods {{to establish and maintain}} <b>blinding</b> of patients and health care providers and methods to obtain <b>blinding</b> of outcome assessors in randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a systematic review of all reports of randomized controlled trials assessing pharmacologic treatments with <b>blinding</b> published in 2004 in high impact-factor journals from Medline and the Cochrane Methodology Register. We used a standardized data collection form to extract data. The <b>blinding</b> methods were classified according to whether they primarily (1) established <b>blinding</b> of patients or health care providers, (2) maintained the <b>blinding</b> of patients or health care providers, and (3) obtained <b>blinding</b> of assessors of the main outcomes. We identified 819 articles, with 472 (58 %) describing the method of <b>blinding.</b> Methods to establish <b>blinding</b> of patients and/or health care providers concerned mainly treatments provided in identical form, specific methods to mask some characteristics of the treatments (e. g., added flavor or opaque coverage), or use of double dummy procedures or simulation of an injection. Methods to avoid unblinding of patients and/or health care providers involved use of active placebo, centralized assessment of side effects, patients informed only in part about the potential side effects of each treatment, centralized adapted dosage, or provision of sham results of complementary investigations. The methods reported for <b>blinding</b> outcome assessors mainly relied on a centralized assessment of complementary investigations, clinical examination (i. e., use of video, audiotape, or photography), or adjudication of clinical events. CONCLUSIONS: This review classifies <b>blinding</b> methods and provides a detailed description of methods that could help trialists overcome some barriers to <b>blinding</b> in clinical trials and readers interpret the quality of pharmacologic trials...|$|R
