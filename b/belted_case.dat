5000|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>belted</b> <b>case</b> of this cartridge was patented in Britain on 31 March 1891 by G. Roth of Austria. The {{first commercial}} {{use of the}} patent was in 1907 for the [...]375 Holland-Schoenauer cartridge for a Mannlicher-Schoenauer bolt-action rifle marketed by Holland & Holland. The [...]375 H&H used an improved <b>belted</b> <b>case</b> shared with the [...]275 H&H Magnum when they were introduced together in August, 1912. [...] This second <b>belted</b> <b>case</b> design was later used with the [...]300 H&H Magnum, and has been modified {{as the basis for}} [...] "Magnum" [...] cartridges developed by other arms manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|The term belted magnum (some times also: <b>belted</b> <b>case)</b> {{refers to}} any caliber cartridge, {{generally}} rifles, using a shell casing with a pronounced [...] "belt" [...] around its base that continues 2 - 4 mm past the extractor groove.|$|E
5000|$|... 7 mm-08. A [...]308 Winchester necked down to 7 mm (.284 caliber), the 7 mm-08 {{provides}} a flatter trajectory with lighter, more aerodynamic 7 mm bullets. It provides nearly {{the performance of}} a 7 mm Magnum, but can use a shorter rifle action and does not need a <b>belted</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>belt</b> <b>case,</b> the {{inclination}} of blade, the size of casing and the preventive plate of a tubular centrifugal fan on both fan noise and the aerodynamic characteristics are experimentally investigated by using three impellers. The results are summarized as follows : A considerable amount of a rise of pressure and fan efficiency can be expected by using the inclined blade and taking off <b>belt</b> <b>case.</b> Therefore, the specific noise level of the tubular centrifugal fan decrease considerably. In the ratio of casing diameter to impeller diameter is 1. 32,the more {{the distance between the}} preventive plate against reverse flow and impeller becomes short, the more the fan efficiency and total pressure become high...|$|R

5000|$|The [...]400/375 Belted Nitro Express {{almost died}} at birth, as in 1905 a Berlin gunmaker, Ottoman Bock, {{designed}} the 9.3×62mm {{to fit into}} the Model 1898 Mauser bolt-action rifle, this cartridge easily eclipsed both the 9.5×57mm and the [...]400/375 Belted NE. In 1912 Holland & Holland created the [...]375 Holland & Holland Magnum utilising the same caliber in a much larger <b>belted</b> <b>case,</b> and the [...]400/375 Belted NE faded from production.|$|E
5000|$|Cases for the {{cartridge}} {{can be purchased}} from Norma or made in three ways:Necking up a 7 mm Remington Magnum case, necking down a [...]338 Winchester Magnum case, or running [...]300 Winchester Magnum cases through a full-length sizing die. Since the first two options leave the brass a bit short, the third is {{generally considered to be}} the best option. Ammunition for this caliber is not cheap (typically US$50-60 for 20 cartridges) and as such it is mainly of interest only to handloaders who own a rifle chambered in this caliber. The cartridge makes use of a <b>belted</b> <b>case</b> for headspacing.|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} <b>belted</b> <b>case,</b> the [...]275 H&H {{was very similar}} to the [...]276 Enfield {{cartridge}} of the Pattern 1913 Enfield rifle then under development by the British military to replace the Lee-Enfield. Cordite loadings gave both cartridges a reputation for unpleasant muzzle flash and short barrel life. [...] Western Cartridge Company offered United States loadings of the [...]275 H&H Magnum in 1925 with the [...]300 H&H and the [...]375 H&H. The [...]275 H&H was omitted when Winchester Repeating Arms Company started chambering their Winchester Model 70 rifle for the other two in 1937. The [...]275 H&H offered little ballistic advantage over the [...]270 Winchester with contemporary smokeless powders. [...] U.S. ammunition production ceased during 1939.|$|E
40|$|The steady {{theory of}} V-belt {{mechanics}} {{is well established}} [1, 2, 3]. Owing to the side compression of the pulley walls, the belt penetrates into the groove a depth variable along the arc of contact and is subject to radial components of the friction forces. Nevertheless, the operative conditions of mechanical variators are seldom steady (see cars and motorcycles), because alternating phases of shift up and down of the speed ratio are continuously requested by the driver. Very few theoretical approaches to this topic are reported in the literature. They generally assume an ideal inextensible-incompressible belt and find out the path of each belt element by simple geometrical analyses. The "rigid belt " hypothesis is certainly acceptable for metal V-belts (e. g. Van Doorne) and rapid ratio changes, but become inappropriate for rubber V-belt or slow shifts. In the rubber <b>belt</b> <b>case,</b> the longitudinal elongation and the radial penetration influence the sliding direction of the single belt elements {{in conjunction with the}} overall inside/outside motion due to the opening/closing of the pulley. In the metal <b>belt</b> <b>case,</b> the plate bending is generally more significant than the belt deformation and may affect the mechanical behaviour of the drive during the ratio change for moderate shift rate [4]...|$|R
2500|$|The [...]284 Winchester has 4.29 ml (66 grains H2O) {{cartridge}} case capacity. The case has a rebated rim {{and a body}} almost as large in diameter as that of typical <b>belted</b> magnum <b>cases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...]300 Ruger Compact Magnum uses {{a unique}} case {{designed}} by Hornady and Ruger {{based on the}} powerful [...]375 Ruger cartridge. The case is of a rimless design having the base and rim diameter of [...]532 in {{which is the same}} diameter of the belt on <b>belted</b> magnum <b>cases</b> based on the [...]300 H&H Magnum and [...]375 H&H Magnum. This allows the cartridge to have a greater case capacity than a <b>belted</b> magnum <b>case</b> given cases of equal length. As Ruger intended the cartridge to be chambered in short length bolt-action rifles the case length was shortened to 2.10 in which is similar to the [...]308 Winchester case. Unlike Winchester Short Magnum cartridges, the Ruger Compact Magnums share the same diameter from case head to body. This allowed Ruger to chamber the cartridge without extensively redesigning their M77 rifle to adopt them to the new Ruger cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]460 Weatherby Magnum has a case head {{diameter}} (0.580") {{unique to the}} large Weatherby <b>belted</b> magnum <b>cases.</b> Few other cartridges use this case head size (or something close, like the [...]416 Rigby).

5000|$|The [...]375 H&H Magnum long {{tapering}} {{body and}} shallow shoulders are generally believed not to promote long case life due to case head separation above the <b>belt.</b> The <b>case</b> design does not promote the optimal {{use of the}} cartridge size to gain performance.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} [...] "belt" [...] on <b>belted</b> <b>cases</b> (often referred to as belted magnums) was to provide headspacing; the extractor groove is cut into the belt {{just as it is}} cut into the case head on a rimless <b>case.</b> The <b>belt</b> acts as a rim on what is essentially a rimless case. The design originated in England around 1910 with the [...]400/375 Belted Nitro Express (also known as the [...]375/.400 Holland & Holland, and [...]375 Velopex). The addition of the belt allowed the cartridge to properly headspace, despite the relative lack of a definite shoulder. The reason for the lack of a definitive shoulder was that these old British cartridge cases were intended for firing cordite charges instead of modern smokeless powder. Cordite was extruded as spaghetti-like rods, so the cartridge cases had to be fairly cylindrical shaped to accommodate the cordite propellant rods. The belt was carried through on other cartridges derived from the [...]375 Velopex, like the [...]375 Holland & Holland Magnum of 1912, in some cases to prevent the higher-pressure magnum cartridge from accidentally being chambered in a gun with a chamber of similar size.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of drift exploration methods for lode Au deposits in areas of thin and thick cover of glacial sediments within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt of central Canada. It summarizes a large volume of data produced by government regional surveys and case studies {{as well as that}} from industry-led gold exploration programs. Regional till surveys can be used as targeting mechanisms for further Au exploration. Anomalies are defined by a series of samples with elevated Au concentrations that lie along significant bedrock structures, occurring in clusters or as isolated samples in areas of low sample density. Thresholds between background and anomalous Au grain abundances or Au concentrations are variable and depend on location within the Abitibi Greenstone <b>Belt.</b> <b>Case</b> studies around known deposits provide examples of geochemical and mineralogical signatures of Au deposits that can be expected in till down-ice. These serve as sources of information on appropriate sampling methods and size fractions to analyse, and on ice flow patterns, local glacial stratigraphy and suitable till units for sampling. Two methods for measuring the Au content of till are commonly used: (1) a count of visible Au grains and (2) geochemical e emental analysis.
