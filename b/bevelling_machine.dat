40|$|Estimating the {{manufacturing}} cost {{is a critical}} task with high importance to industrial firms. The cost estimating can drive bidding strategies, management of resources, production policies and other issues crucial to the economic success of the company. Essentially, cost estimation should be quick and accurate. There are three main approaches towards cost estimation: estimation based on past experience (variant cost estimation), estimation based on explicit cost computations (analytical method) and parametric cost estimation. However, the most accurate cost estimates are made using the analytical approach. Among the many methods for cost estimating are those based on knowledge bases, features, operations, physical relationships and similarity laws. The {{aim of this study}} is to estimate different cost for the specific field of arc welding. It deals with assembly modeling welding. To do this, we have proposed a new application of feature: welding feature and preparation feature. This concept is based on the decomposition of the product in features. The proposed model presents a combination of two variants approach cost estimation based on characteristics of product and on manufacturing activity of process: • First, we developed an analytical method in order to estimate the welding time by determining the weight of the weld and this for each feature. Besides, we estimate others consumptions: gas, electrode and electrical power. • Second, we used parametric cost estimation for cost formulation due to deferent “feature cost” which compose the process of welding: Edge preparation (chamfering, <b>bevel</b> <b>machining,</b> grinding etc.), welding. This concept inquires the appropriate choice of the indicator. We have developed a database with Microsoft Access in order to estimate cost welding which use our model. This application, named SOUDABASE, helps in estimating welding time and cost. It will allow a relative novice to understand the effects of welding variables on production costs. Finally, we tested SOUDABASE application with industrial examples and we released a comparative study with DEVISOUD application proposed by CETIM, Senlis France in order to validate our model.

Pressure angle and tooth root {{radius of the}} gearset are among the influencing factors. As the tools in bevel gear cutting are specially designed for each gearset, the tool profile geometry {{is defined by the}} gear geometry.

40|$|The {{effects are}} {{assessed}} of TiB 2 reinforcement and parent alloy Li content on the weldability of Weldalite (tm) 049 type alloys. Welding trials were performed using either AC or DC polarity gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding according to described procedures. The welding was performed {{under conditions of}} high restraint on 5 cm (2 in) wide x 25. 4 cm (10 in) long plates machined from the 0. 952 cm (0. 375 in) extruded bar parallel to the extrusion direction. A 37. 5 deg <b>bevel</b> was <b>machined</b> on the center edge of the extruded bar. Cut rod filler wire was machined from three alloys, and one commercially available 2319 filler wire was also used. The preliminary assessment of the weldability revealed no propensity for hot cracking under conditions of high restraint. This result is significant, because hot cracking has been reported for all other leading aluminum lithium alloys welded with certain conventional filler alloys. The strengths for Weldalite parent welded with parent filler obtained were higher than those for alloys used in launch systems, such as 2219 and 2014 welded with 2319 and 4043 fillers, respectively. Even higher values were obtained by variable polarity plasma arc welding (e. g., 54 ksi (372 MPa) mean tensile strength) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of carbide tools and hard coatings {{has led to}} a quantum leap in material removal rates and tool life in manufacturing automotive-sized bevel and hypoid gears, as the tools and coatings have in other areas of machining technology (Refs. 1 - 6). Further benefits of the new techology are the ability to abandon the use of coolant and the improvement of quality, which partly goes back also to advancements in the machine tool technology and the implementation of quality loops in manufacturing (Ref. 3 - 4 and 7 - 13). However, the number of influential factors on manufacturing cost per piece is high, and an in-depth process analysis and understanding has not yet been established in many areas. Yet this fundamental knowledge is required to show the right direction for further enhancements of economic efficiency and productivity, since thorough process development is difficult to conduct during and after the start of production in an industrial environment (Ref. 13). Therefore, thorough machining investigations are conducted at WZL within the scope of an AiF research project (13713 N/ 1) on high speed <b>bevel</b> gear <b>machining.</b> This article presents some of the findings of cutting investigations at WZL in which the correlation of cutting parameters, cutting materials, tool geometry and tool life have been determined.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of {{spiral bevel gear}} cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of gear tooth surfaces, which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established. The contacting points of gear tooth surfaces can be used for tooth contact analysis. The parametric curve interpolator is combined with spiral <b>bevel</b> gear NC <b>machining,</b> and is applied to the self-developed spiral bevel gear NC milling machine to control the gear cutting. Experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the control of NC machining for the spiral bevel gear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Gear {{machine tool}} {{main drive shaft}} to avoid {{resonance}} problem is studied. The force of the drive shaft is analyzed, and the vibration form of the drive shaft is confirmed. Using the lumped parameter method to simplify the main drive shaft, the lumped mass model and the force model were been obtained. When bending vibrating, the natural frequency of the main drive shaft is calculated using the transfer matrix method. The calculated critical speed is 43755 r/min, which far outweighs the motor rated speed. It means that the drive shaft under normal work won't be resonance, which accords with the request of production.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proportional}} modification {{parameters are}} useful for compensating the tooth form errors of spiral bevel gears. Based on the mathematical model for calculating the machine setting parameters {{and according to the}} relative position relationship between cutter and workpiece, the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters for gears manufactured by spread blade method was deduced by the curvature and normal vector at calculation point. The proportional modification parameters can make the lengthwise curvature or profile curvature or lengthwise twist curvature of the concave and convex flank produce uniform change or difference change. The formulae is verified by experiment on CNC spiral <b>bevel</b> gear grinding <b>machine</b> and M&M sigma 7 gear measuring center. Preface In order to ensure the transmission quality and realize interchangeability of spiral bevel gears, the practical tooth form should be equal to the theoretical tooth form approximately. The method listed in literature [1 - 8] for modifying tooth form errors is not effectual for gears manufactured by spread blade method. Literature [9] puts forward a new modification method based on proportional modification parameters and it can realize the modification of tooth form errors of the pinion generated by single side method. This method is also available for gears generated by spread blade method. However, the current machine settings summary only provides the proportional modification parameters for pinion. Consequently, in order to apply this modification method to modify the tooth form errors of gears generated by spread blade method, this paper will deduce the formulae for calculating the second-order proportional modification parameters based on mathematical model for calculating machine setting parameters and verify these formulae by experiment...|$|R
