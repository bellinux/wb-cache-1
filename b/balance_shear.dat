40|$|This {{dissertation}} mainly {{addresses the}} generic types of ageostrophic instability in general continuously differentiable, interior, {{horizontal and vertical}} shear flows without special "edges" (vertical, side or equatorial boundaries or frontal outcropping). In contrast to the classic barotropic and baroclinic instabilities, whose nonlinear dynamics (geostrophic turbulence) have an ''inverse cascade" characteristic, the ageostrophic instabilities serve as a local route for the breakdown of balance in the interior ocean or atmosphere, leading to an efficient energy cascade towards small scales. For {{the first part of}} this dissertation, the linear instabilities, both momentum-balanced and unbalanced, in several different U(y) shear profiles are investigated in the rotating shallow water equations. The unbalanced instabilities are strongly ageostrophic and involve inertia-gravity wave motions, occurring only for finite Rossby (Ro) and Froude (Fr) numbers. Aside from the classic <b>shear</b> instability among <b>balanced</b> <b>shear</b> wave modes (i. e., B-B type), two types of ageostrophic instability (B-G and G-G) are found. Here B represents <b>balanced</b> <b>shear</b> wave mode, and G represents inertia-gravity wave mode. The B-G instability has attributes of both a <b>balanced</b> <b>shear</b> wave mode and an inertia-gravity wave mode. The G-G instability occurs as a sharp resonance between two inertia-gravity wave modes. The criterion for the occurrence of the ageostrophic instability is associated with the second stability condition of Ripa 1983, which requires a sufficiently large local Froude number. When Ro and especially Fr increase, the balanced instability is suppressed, while the ageostrophic instabilities are enhanced. The profile of the mean flow also affects the strength of the balanced and ageostrophic instabilities. For the second part of this dissertation, the linear instabilities of several rotating, stably stratified, interior vertical shear flows U(z) are solved in Boussinesq equations. Two types of baroclinic, ageostrophic instability, AI 1 and AI 2, are found in antisymmetric U(z) for intermediate Rossby number (Ro). AI 1 is a stationary (zero frequency) instability, which appears in a continuous transformation of the unstable mode properties between classic baroclinic instability (BCI) and centrifugal instability (CI). It begins to occur at intermediate Ro values and horizontal wave numbers (k, l) that are far from l = 0 or k = 0. AI 1 grows by drawing energy from the kinetic energy of the mean flow. The instability AI 2 always has inertial critical layers at certain heights; and hence it is associated with an inertia-gravity wave. For an unstable AI 2 mode, the coupling is either between an interior <b>balanced</b> <b>shear</b> wave and an inertia-gravity wave (B-G), or between two inertia-gravity waves (G-G). The main energy source for an unstable B-G mode is the mean kinetic energy, while the main energy source for an unstable G-G mode is the mean available potential energy. AI 1 and AI 2 of the B-G type occur in the neighborhood of A-S = 0 (McWilliams et al. 1998), while AI 2 of the G-G type arises beyond this condition (A-S denotes absolute vertical vorticity minus strain rate in isentropic coordinates). Both AI 1 and AI 2 are unbalanced instabilities, which lead to a loss of balance in 3 D interior flows...|$|R

Linear pertur-bation analysis is applied to hourly averaged profiles of velocity and density over a 54 -day interval, yield-ing a total of 337 unstable modes. Composite pro-files of mean states and eigenfunctions surrounding the critical levels suggest that the standard hyper-bolic tangent model of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) insta-bility is a reasonable approximation, but the symme-try of the composite perturbation is broken by the stratification and vorticity gradient of the underlying equatorial undercurrent. Unstable modes are found to occupy a range of frequencies with a peak near 1 / 700 s, consistent with the frequency content of the observed oscillations. A probabilistic theory of random instabilities pre-dicts this peak frequency very closely. An order of magnitude estimate suggests that the peak fre-quency is of order N, in accord with the observations.

With the objective to simultaneously improve the stiffness, strength, and impact strength of PP, in this work a ternary nanocomposite, PP/CaCO 3 /nanoclay (NCPP), was prepared and its morphology, crystallization, and mechanical behaviors were investigated with a comparison to the binary nanocomposites, PP/CaCO 3 (CPP) and PP/nanoclay (NPP). The results showed that in NCPP the nanoclay was extremely exfoliated with a much higher degree than that in NPP, which was possibly because the incorporation of CaCO 3 nanoparticles adjusted the matrix viscosity and thus provided a <b>balance</b> between <b>shear</b> stress and molecule diffusion. As {{a result of this}} highly exfoliated structure, a substantial increase in modulus and yield stress was attained in NCPP. However, its impact strength was less enhanced. The toughening effects of the CaCO 3 particles observed in CPP became ineffective.

At ice stream margins, the rapid {{transition from the}} vertical shearing flow in the ice ridges surrounding the stream to a rapidly sliding plug flow in the stream itself leads to high stress concentrations and a velocity field whose form is non-trivial to determine.

As examples, L_ EGS {{obtained by the}} model W 1 E and model D 1 E with an initial temperature field is shown in Fig.  5. Small grains are located in highly sheared region because both L_ EGS and shear strain rate depend on temperature and shear stress (Eq. 5 and Fig.  4). In our models, the minimum grain sizes are located at the depth of BDT under the fault where shear stress becomes the largest, nearly equal to the frictional strength of the fault. In models W 1 E and D 1 E, the minimum grain sizes are ∼ 215 and ∼ 17 m at temperatures of ∼ 475 and ∼ 700 ^∘C, respectively. The results of grain size measurements show that the plagioclase grains in ultramylonites have a mean diameter of 16 (Okudaira et al. 2015) and 85 m (Okudaira et al. 2017) under the condition of ∼ 700 and ∼ 600 ^∘C, respectively. Although our results of EGS are in agreement with these observations, comparison of the calculated results with the field observations is not straightforward. For example, the shear stress on the fault could be smaller than that estimated from Byerlee’s law (Iio 1997). Also, even with the same temperature and stress conditions, dynamically recrystallized grain size may be still larger than L_ EGS (Bresser et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|A set of first-order model (FOM) equations, {{describing}} the sheared convective boundary layer (CBL) evolution, is derived. The model output is compared with {{predictions of the}} zero-order bulk model (ZOM) for the same CBL type. Large eddy simulation (LES) data are employed to test both models. The results show an advantage of the FOM over the ZOM in the prediction of entrainment, but in many CBL cases, the predictions by the two models are fairly close. Despite its relative simplicity, the ZOM is able to quantify the effects of shear production and dissipation in an integral sense—as long as the constants {{describing the}} integral dissipation of shear- and buoyancy-produced turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) are prescribed appropriately and the shear is weak enough that the denominator of the ZOM entrainment equation does not approach zero, causing a numerical instability in the solutions. Overall, the FOM better predicts the entrainment rate due to its ability to avoid this instability. Also, the FOM in a more physically consistent manner reproduces the sheared CBL entrainment zone, whose depth is controlled by a <b>balance</b> among <b>shear</b> generation, buoyancy consumption, and dissipation of TKE. Such balance is manifested by nearly constant values of Richardson numbers observed in the entrainment zone of simulated sheared CBLs. Conducted model tests support {{the conclusion that the}} surface shear generation of TKE and its corresponding dissi-pation, as well as the nonstationary terms, can be omitted from the integral TKE balance equation...|$|R
