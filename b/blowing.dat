5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is <b>blowing</b> harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind <b>blowing</b> over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of compaction effort on marshall properties of two types of mix design which is from asphaltic concrete (AC) and bituminous Macadam (BM). The types of mix design are AC 14 and BMW 20 which is for Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). This study also determined the time available for compaction for AC 14 and BMW 20. Compaction is one of the important factor in constructing a pavement. According to JKR specification, the number of <b>blow</b> is 75 per face. For this study, the number of <b>blow</b> used were 35, 50 and 75. Bitumen content that has to be used for asphaltic concrete is between 4 to 6 percent. Compaction, flow and stability test for AC 14 were carried out to determine the optimum bitumen content for each <b>blow.</b> The result of OBC for 35 <b>blow</b> was 5. 54 %, 5. 32 % for 50 <b>blow</b> and 5. 23 % for 75 <b>blow.</b> The results show that the increase of the number of <b>blow</b> would decrease the optimum bitumen content. After comparing the parameter, the result for AC 14 show that 35 <b>blow</b> and 50 <b>blow</b> of compaction do not meet the specification except for 75 <b>blow.</b> For BMW 20, the bitumen content used was 4. 9 % for each <b>blow.</b> The results for BMW 20 show that for each <b>blow</b> which is 35 <b>blow,</b> 50 <b>blow</b> and 75 <b>blow</b> comply to the specification. On the other hand, the time available for compaction of AC 14 is 108 minutes and the time available for compaction of BMW 20 is 100 minutes...|$|R
