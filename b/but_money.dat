Subsequent plans that focused on reconstructing her as a modernized equivalent to her sisters or even as a battlecruiser, with one turret deleted to save weight, were considered, but finally abandoned on 23 January 1935 when all work was stopped.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1896, Sorabji's {{father was}} back in Bombay, where he played a {{significant}} role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries, among other things. Although he provided his family with financial support, he spent much of his time abroad and on 17 June 1929 bigamously married Nobubai Visvonata Catcar, causing Sorabji and his mother a substantial loss of fortune. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 July 1932. In the same year, Sorabji travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate, but obtained nothing <b>but</b> <b>money</b> from a trust fund that his father had established in 1914. Nevertheless, it saved him from having to earn a living, although his lifestyle was ascetic.|$|E
5|$|Not {{wanting to}} carry two {{championship}} belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive {{that he would}} no longer appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over the next few months, the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, <b>but</b> <b>Money</b> Inc. managed to retain the title.|$|E

This title change occurred after Hawk failed {{a drug test}} and was suspended. Once Hawk's suspension ended, a rematch was scheduled to take place at SummerSlam. The match was first scheduled as a title match <b>but</b> <b>Money</b> Inc. lost the championship to The Natural Disasters.|$|E
5|$|By 1300 only Harlech and Conwy {{had been}} {{properly}} completed: Caernarfon's town walls were finished, {{but much of}} the castle was still incomplete and at Beaumaris Castle the inner walls was only half their intended height, with gaps in the outer walls. By 1304 the total building programme in Wales had come to at least £80,000, almost six times Edward's annual income. Edward had meanwhile become embroiled in a long-running sequence of wars in Scotland which began to consume his attention and financial resources, and as a result further work on the Welsh castles slowed to a crawl. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, spurring fresh construction work, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> remained much more limited than before. By 1330 all new work had finally ceased, and Caernarfon and Beaumaris were never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of running}} a rail line down Hiawatha Avenue had already been around {{for at least a}} decade by the time the {{decision}} was made to go forward. In 1985, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had produced an Environmental Impact Statement that concluded that light rail was the best alternative for the corridor. In 1996, the document was examined again as Mn/DOT looked at the possibility of adding bus rapid transit along the road, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> for light rail became available soon after, leading to the current layout.|$|E

A Joint Committee of Management was set up, consisting of four Cornwall Railway directors, three from the South Devon company, three from the Bristol & Exeter and two from the Great Western.|$|E

25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, {{in the absence}} of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything <b>but</b> <b>money</b> of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, digging was resumed by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, {{financed by}} John D. Rockefeller, Jr., {{continuing}} until {{the outbreak of}} the Second World War. The work was led initially by Clarence S. Fisher, and later by P. L. O. Guy, Robert Lamon, and Gordon Loud. The Oriental Institute intended to completely excavate the whole tel, layer by layer, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> ran out before they could do so. Today excavators limit themselves to a square or a trench on the basis that they must leave something for future archaeologists with better techniques and methods. During these excavations it was discovered that there were around 8 levels of habitation, and many of the uncovered remains are preserved at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem and the Oriental Institute of Chicago.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the {{disastrous}} Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Imperial Russian Navy needed several years to absorb the lessons of that war, particularly from the Battle of Tsushima. Design work continued during this period, but designs for dreadnought battleships evolved constantly as new requirements were made. By late 1907, a consensus had been reached by the Russian Naval General Staff and an international design competition was ordered after domestic protests arose after the selection of a design by the British firm of Vickers. A Russian design was ultimately selected, albeit with extensive support from foreign companies, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> was tight and the ships took over five years to complete. All four ships survived World War I, but one was badly damaged in a fire while in reserve a few years later and was hulked. The three intact ships were modernized before World War II and they all participated in the war, primarily by providing naval gunfire support. All four ships were scrapped after the war.|$|E
25|$|The most {{dramatic}} and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948. Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, <b>but</b> <b>money</b> had been plentiful. That meant {{that people had}} accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy {{and more than half}} of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.|$|E
