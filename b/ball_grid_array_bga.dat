40|$|Soldering {{provides}} a cost-effective means for attaching electronic packages to circuit boards using both small scale and large scale manufacturing processes. Soldering processes accommodate through-hole leaded components {{as well as}} surface mount packages, including the newer area array packages such as the <b>Ball</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>Arrays</b> (<b>BGA),</b> Chip Scale Packages (CSP), and Flip Chip Technology. The versatility of soldering is attributed to the variety of available solder alloy compositions, substrate material methodologies, and different manufacturing processes. For example, low melting temperature solders are used with temperature sensitive materials and components. On the other hand, higher melting temperature solders provide reliable interconnects for electronics used in high temperature service.

40|$|A failure {{precursor}} is {{a measurable}} parameter which provides {{an indication of}} impending failure.

5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat Packages (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as <b>Ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> (<b>BGA)</b> which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|R
5000|$|Discrete {{transistors}} are individually packaged transistors. Transistors come in {{many different}} semiconductor packages (see image). The two main categories are through-hole (or leaded), and surface-mount, also known as surface-mount device (SMD). The <b>ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>BGA)</b> is the latest surface-mount package (currently only for large integrated circuits). It has solder [...] "balls" [...] on the underside in place of leads. Because they are smaller and have shorter interconnections, SMDs have better high-frequency characteristics but lower power rating.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>BGA)</b> {{is a type}} of surface-mount {{packaging}} (a chip carrier) {{used for}} integrated circuits. BGA packages are used to permanently mount devices such as microprocessors. A BGA can provide more interconnection pins than can be put on a dual in-line or flat package. The whole bottom surface of the device can be used, instead of just the perimeter. The leads are also on average shorter than with a perimeter-only type, leading to better performance at high speeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (<b>BGA)</b> {{packages}} {{have existed}} since the 1970s. Flip-chip Ball Grid Array packages, which allow for much higher pin count than other package types, {{were developed in}} the 1990s. In an FCBGA package the die is mounted upside-down (flipped) and connects to the package balls via a package substrate {{that is similar to}} a printed-circuit board rather than by wires. FCBGA packages allow an array of input-output signals (called Area-I/O) to be distributed over the entire die rather than being confined to the die periphery.|$|E

Lead-free and lead based assemblies with conventional package, BGA, and CGA (ceramic column grid) were built for inspection by optical and X-ray before and at intervals during thermal cycling with different levels of damagelcracking. Two different 2 D real time x-rays were used. The optical images for leaded and leadless assemblies as well those taken for outer rows of area arrays were compared for several solder compositions.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of lead-free (LF) solder joints in surface-mounted device components (SMD) {{has been investigated}} after thermo-cycle testing. Kirkendall voids have been observed at the interface component/solder together {{with the formation of}} fractures. The evolution, the morphology and the elemental analysis of the intermetallic layer have been evaluated before and after the thermal treatment. Voids produced by the release of volatile species during the soldering process due to the application of flux were present. If compared with SnPb soldered systems, lead-free joints are characterized by larger and a higher amount of voids. In several electronic joints (<b>ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> (<b>BGA),</b> surface-mounted device components (SMD), etc.) fractures developed after the thermal stresses generated during the accelerated thermal aging. Warpage of the PCB has also been observed. Backward and forward compatibility of SnPb and lead-free BGA connections has been performed on pads with an ENIG finish. The effect of the reflow peak temperature on the structure of the intermetallic layer has been assessed. ...|$|R
40|$|Self-alignment of {{soldered}} {{electronic components}} such as flip-chips (FC), <b>ball</b> <b>grid</b> <b>arrays</b> (<b>BGA)</b> and optoelectronic devices during solder reflow is important as it ensures good alignment between components and substrates. Two uncoupled analytical models are presented which provide {{estimates of the}} dynamic time scales of both the chip and the solder in the self-alignment process. These predicted time scales {{can be used to}} decide whether a coupled dynamic analysis is required for the analysis of the chip motion. In this paper, we will show that for flip-chips, the alignment dynamics can be described accurately only when the chip motion is coupled with the solder motion because the two have similar time-scale values. To study this coupled phenomenon, a dynamic modeling method has been developed. The modeling results show that the uncoupled and coupled calculations result in significantly different predictions. The calculations based on the coupled model predict much faster rates of alignment than those predicted using the uncoupled approach...|$|R
