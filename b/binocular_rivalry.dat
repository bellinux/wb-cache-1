25|$|<b>Binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> is a {{phenomenon}} of visual perception in which perception alternates between different images presented to each eye.|$|E
25|$|Very small {{differences}} between images, however, might yield singleness {{of vision and}} stereopsis. <b>Binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> has been extensively studied in the last century. In recent years neuroscientists have used neuroimaging techniques and single-cell recording techniques to identify neural events responsible for the perceptual dominance of a given image and for the perceptual alternations.|$|E
25|$|Breese {{first found}} that {{although}} observers {{could increase the}} time one rival stimulus was seen by attending to it, they could not increase the rate of that stimulus. Moreover, when he asked his observers to refrain from moving their eyes over the attended stimulus, control was abolished. When he asked observers specifically to move their eyes over one stimulus, that stimulus predominated in rivalry. He could also increase predominance of a stimulus by {{increasing the number of}} its contours, by moving it, by reducing its size, by making it brighter, and by contracting the muscles {{on the same side of}} the body as the eye viewing that stimulus. Breese also showed that rivalry occurs between afterimages. Breese also discovered the phenomenon of monocular rivalry: if the two rival stimuli are optically superimposed to the same eye and one fixates on the stimuli, then alternations in the clarity of the two stimuli are seen. Occasionally, one image disappears altogether, as in <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry,</b> although this is much rarer than in <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a subjective test to assess current technology used for 3 DTV broadcasting. As a first aspect, the performance of the currently deployed coding schemes was compared to state of the art algorithms. Our results show that downsampling and packing 3 D stereoscopic videos according to the so called Side-By-Side format gives the highest perceived quality for a given bitrate. The second aspect {{of the study was to}} investigate how common 2 D error concealment algorithms perform in case of 3 D, and how their 3 D-related performance compares with the 2 D case. The results provide information on whether binocular suppression or <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalries</b> play the most important role for 3 D video quality under transmission error. The results indicate that <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalries</b> and related visual discomfort are the dominant factors. Another aspect of the paper is a comparison of the test results with results from different labs to evaluate the repeatability of a subjective experiment in the 3 D case, and to compare the employed test methodologies. Here, the study shows the variation between observers when they are rating visual discomfort and illustrates the difficulty to evaluate this new dimension...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{predominance}} of rivalrous targets {{is affected by}} surrounding context when stimuli rival in orientation, motion or color. This study investigated the influence of chromatic context on <b>binocular</b> color <b>rivalry.</b> The {{predominance of}} rivalrous chromatic targets was measured in various surrounding contexts. The first experiment showed that a chromatic surround’s influence was stronger when the surround was uniform or a grating with luminance contrast (chromatic/black grating) compared to an equiluminant grating (chromatic/white). The second experiment revealed virtually no effect of {{the orientation of the}} surrounding chromatic context, using chromatically rivalrous vertical gratings. These results are consistent with a chromatic representation of the context by a non-oriented, chromatically selective and spatially antagonistic receptive field. Neither a double-opponent receptive field nor a receptive field without spatial antagonism accounts for the influence of context on <b>binocular</b> color <b>rivalry...</b>|$|R
25|$|At transitions, brief, {{unstable}} composites of the {{two images}} may be seen. For example, the vertical lines may appear {{one at a time}} to obscure the horizontal lines from the left or from the right, like a traveling wave, switching slowly one image for the other. <b>Binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> occurs between any stimuli that differ sufficiently, including simple stimuli like lines of different orientation and complex stimuli like different alphabetic letters or different pictures such as of a face and of a house.|$|E
25|$|Other {{theories}} of <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> dealt more with how it occurs than why it occurs. Dutour {{speculated that the}} alternations could be controlled by attention, a theory promoted {{in the nineteenth century}} by Hermann von Helmholtz. But Dutour also speculated that the alternations could be controlled by structural properties of the images (such as by temporary fluctuations in the blur of one image, or temporary fluctuations in the luminance of one image). This theory was promoted in the nineteenth century by Helmholtz's traditional rival, Ewald Hering.|$|E
25|$|The most {{comprehensive}} early study of <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> {{was conducted by}} B. B. Breese (1899, 1909). Breese quantified the amount of rivalry by requiring his observers to press keys while observing rivalry for 100-second trials. An observer pressed one key whenever and {{for as long as}} he or she saw one rival stimulus with no trace of the other, and another key whenever and {{for as long as he}} or she saw the other rival stimulus with no trace of the first. This has come to be known as recording periods of exclusive visibility. From the key-press records (Breese's were made on a kymograph drum), Breese was able to quantify rivalry in three ways: the number of periods of exclusive visibility of each stimulus (the rate of rivalry), the total duration of exclusive visibility of each stimulus, and the average duration of each period of rivalry.|$|E
25|$|When {{the images}} {{presented}} to the eyes differ only in their contours, rivalry {{is referred to as}} <b>binocular</b> contour <b>rivalry.</b> When the images {{presented to the}} eyes differ only in their colours, rivalry is referred to as <b>binocular</b> colour <b>rivalry.</b> When the images presented to the eyes differ only in their lightnesses, a form of <b>rivalry</b> called <b>binocular</b> lustre may be seen. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, the image is usually seen continuously. This is referred to as contour dominance. Occasionally however, the blank field, or even the dark field of a closed eye, can become visible, making the image invisible for about as long as it would be invisible were it in rivalry with another image of equal stimulus strength. When an image is presented to one eye and a blank field to the other, introducing a different image onto the blank field usually results in that image being seen immediately. This is referred to as flash suppression.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which motion repulsion and <b>binocular</b> motion <b>rivalry</b> depend on the distance between moving elements. The stimuli consisted of two sets of spatially intermingled, finite-life random dots that moved across each other. The distance between the dots moving in different directions was manipulated by spatially pairing the dot trajectories with various precisions. Data from experiment 1 indicated that motion repulsion occurred reliably only when the average distance between orthogonally moving elements was at least 21. 0 arc min. When the dots were precisely paired, a single global direction intermediate to the two actual directions was perceived. This result suggests that, at a relatively small spatial scale, interaction between different directions favors motion attraction or coherence, while interaction at a somewhat larger scale generates motion repulsion. Similarly, data from experiment 2 indicated that <b>binocular</b> motion <b>rivalry</b> was significantly diminished by spatially pairing the dots, which moved in opposite directions in the two eyes. This supports the recent proposal that rivalry occurs at or after the stage of binocular convergence, since monocular cells could not have directly responded to our interocular pairing manipulation. Together, these findings suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception are highly sensitive to the fine spatial relationship between moving elements...|$|R
50|$|The articles, in two parts, {{provide a}} {{fascinating}} {{insight into the}} mind of Joseph Towne. For example, he argues that if one eye sees yellow and the other sees blue, the mind should see green. This is wrong. The yellow and blue that he speaks of are pigments. It is now known that when yellow and blue light are mixed, the outcome is white. But what if yellow enters the mind via one eye, and blue via the other? Such <b>binocular</b> colour <b>rivalry</b> remained uncharted territory for long. Similarly, Towne argues that one can see in three dimensions with only one eye. This is because one can sense the tension in the eye-muscles as one focuses close. However, it is not true shape-perception as defined by Wheatstone.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{activity}} in primary sensory areas of the brain is not sufficient to produce consciousness: [...] it is possible for subjects to report a lack of awareness even when areas such as the primary visual cortex show clear electrical responses to a stimulus. [...] Higher brain areas are seen as more promising, especially the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of higher cognitive functions collectively known as executive functions. [...] There is substantial evidence that a [...] "top-down" [...] flow of neural activity (i.e., activity propagating from the frontal cortex to sensory areas) is more predictive of conscious awareness than a [...] "bottom-up" [...] flow of activity. [...] The prefrontal cortex is not the only candidate area, however: [...] studies by Nikos Logothetis and his colleagues have shown, for example, that visually responsive neurons in parts of the temporal lobe reflect the visual perception in the situation when conflicting visual images are presented to different eyes (i.e., bistable percepts during <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Various {{theories}} were {{proposed to}} account for <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b> Porta and Dutour took it as evidence for an ancient theory of visual perception {{that has come to}} be known as suppression theory. Its essential idea is that, despite having two eyes, we see only one of everything (known as singleness of vision) because we see with one eye at a time. According to this theory, we do not normally notice the alternations between the two eyes because their images are too similar. By making the images very different, Porta and Dutour argued, this natural alternation can be seen. Wheatstone, on the other hand, supported the alternative theory of singleness of vision, fusion theory, proposed by Aristotle. Its essential idea is that we see only one of everything because the information from the two eyes is combined or fused. Wheatsone also discovered binocular stereopsis, the perception of depth arising from the lateral placement of the eyes. Wheatstone was able to prove that stereopsis depended on the different horizontal positions (the horizontal disparity) of points in the images viewed by each eye by creating the illusion of depth from flat depictions of such images displayed in his stereoscope. Such stereopsis is impossible unless information is being combined from each eye. Although Wheatstone's discovery of stereopsis supported fusion theory, he still had {{to account for}} <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b> He regarded <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> as a special case in which fusion is impossible, saying [...] "the mind is inattentive to impressions made on one retina when it cannot combine the impressions on the two retinae together so as to occasion a perception resembling that of some external object" [...] (p.264).|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{test whether}} the <b>binocular</b> contour <b>rivalry</b> {{mechanism}} is tritanopic, we presented isoluminant, rival stimuli visible only via the short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones. We stimulated only the S cones with violet gratings superimposed {{on a bright}} yellow field that adapted {{the responses of the}} middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive (M and L) cones. We found that an S-cone grating presented to one eye rivalled with an orthogonal grating presented to the other. Rivalry persisted over a range of luminances and contrasts of the S-cone stimuli, and was greater than could be accounted for by nonrival fading. The spatial spread of rivalry from S-cone stimuli is similar to that for the same stimuli when visible also to the M and L cones (luminance stimuli). We found that an S-cone stimulus would rival with a luminance stimulus, and exploited this to determine the equivalent luminance contrast of S-cone stimuli by putting them in a rivalry competition with luminance stimuli. For rivalry, the equivalent luminance contrast of isoluminant, S-cone stimuli is much less than their S-cone contrast. The existence of rivalry with isoluminant stimuli, along with earlier evidence that such stimuli can support stereopsis, challenges the view that an achromatic channel alone drives certain higher level functions such as depth perception...|$|R
40|$|Human {{observers}} are extremely adept at correctly interpreting the visual input {{that they receive}} despite its inherent ambiguity. There are, however, situations in which no single, valid interpretation exists and perception oscillates. Such situations offer insight into the processes underlying perception, as they reveal {{the conditions under which}} our percept can alter in the presence of an unchanging physical stimulus. Many studies have focused on perceptual switching during <b>binocular</b> and monocular <b>rivalry,</b> or when viewing ambiguous figures. The majority of these studies have focused on bistable phenomena. In this paper we report the study of a range of ambiguous stimuli that provoke tristable perception, thereby providing a more exacting test bed for current models. We find that subjects spontaneously move from periods of bistable to tristable perception and that this results in a characteristic change in the rate of perceptual switching. In contrast to reports for bistable stimuli, we find only weak evidence for consistency in the relative switch rates of individuals across our test stimuli and explain why our results are inconsistent with the theory of interhemispheric switching. We go on to describe how the results are, instead, largely consistent with models of rivalry based on mutual inhibition and adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Psychophysical {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} it is possible to perceive both <b>binocular</b> depth and <b>rivalry</b> in plaids (Buckthought and Wilson 2007, Vision Research 47 2543 – 2556). In a recent study, we investigated the neural substrates for depth and rivalry processing with these plaid patterns, when either a depth or rivalry task was performed (Buckthought and Mendola 2011, Journal of Vision 11 1 – 15). However, the extent to which perception of the two stimulus aspects was truly simultaneous remained somewhat unclear. In the present study, we introduced a new task in which subjects were instructed to perform both depth and rivalry tasks concurrently. Subjects were clearly able to perform both tasks at the same time, but with a modest, symmetric drop in performance when compared to either task carried out alone. Subjects were also able to raise performance levels for either task by performing it with a higher priority, with a decline in performance for the other task. The symmetric declines in performance are consistent with the interpretation that the two tasks are equally demanding of attention (Braun and Julesz 1998, Perception & Psychophysics 60 1 – 23). The results demonstrate the impressive combination of binocular features that supports coincident depth and rivalry in surface perception, within the constraints of presumed orientation and spatial frequency channels...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{complementary}} {{theories of}} color vision are the trichromatic {{theory and the}} opponent process theory. The trichromatic theory, or Young–Helmholtz theory, proposed in the 19th century by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz, as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. Ewald Hering proposed the opponent process theory in 1872. It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white. [...] Both theories are now accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the diagram on the right. Green←→Magenta and Blue←→Yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries.

2500|$|<b>Binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> was {{discovered}} by Porta (1593, as cited in Wade, 1996). Porta put one book {{in front of one}} eye, and another in front of the other. He reported that he could read from one book at a time and that changing {{from one to the other}} required withdrawing the [...] "visual virtue" [...] from one eye and moving it to the other. According to Wade (1998), binocular colour rivalry was first reported by Le Clerk (1712). Desaguiliers (1716) also recorded it when looking at different colours from spectra in the bevel of a mirror. The clearest early description of both colour and contour rivalry was made by Dutour (1760, 1763; see translations by O'Shea, 1999a, b). To experience colour rivalry Dutour either crossed his eyes or overdiverged his eyes (a form of free fusion commonly used also at the end of the 20th century to view Magic Eye stereograms) to look at differently coloured pieces of cloth (Dutour, 1760) or differently coloured pieces of glass (Dutour, 1763). To experience contour rivalry Dutour again used free fusion of different objects or used a prism or a mirror in front of one eye to project different images into it. The first clear description of rivalry in English was by Charles Wheatstone (e.g., 1838). Wheatstone invented the stereoscope, an optical device (in Wheatstone's case using mirrors) to present different images to the two eyes.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{two eyes}} of an {{individual}} routinely differ in their optical and neural properties, yet percepts through either eye remain more similar than predicted by these differences. Little is known {{as to how the}} brain resolves this conflicting information. Differences in visual inputs from the two eyes have been studied extensively in the context of <b>binocular</b> vision and <b>rivalry</b> [1], but it remains unknown how the visual system calibrates and corrects for normal variability in image quality between the eyes, and whether this correction is applied to each eye separately or after their signals have converged. To test this, we used adaptive optics to control and manipulate the blur projected on each retina, and then compared judgments of image focus through either eye and how these judgments were biased by adapting to different levels of blur. Despite significant interocular differences in the magnitude of optical blur, the blur level that appeared best focused was the same through both eyes, and corresponded to the ocular blur of the less aberrated eye. Moreover, for both eyes, blur aftereffects depended on whether the adapting blur was stronger or weaker than the native blur of the better eye, with no aftereffect when the blur equaled the aberrations of the better eye. Our results indicate that the neural calibration for the perception of image focus reflects a single ‘cyclopean’ site that is set monocularly by the eye with better optical quality. Consequently, what people regard as ‘best-focused’ matches the blur encountered through the eye with better optics, even when judging the world through the eye with poorer optics...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{the images}} {{seen by the}} two eyes into a single percept {{is one of the}} most {{challenging}} computational tasks that the visual cortex has to solve. The first stage at which information from the two retinae converges on individual neurons is the primary visual cortex, VI or area 17. Here, I describe anatomical segregation and interocular suppression as two mechanisms for obviating potential interocular conflict. I have studied VI of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, with both neurophysiological and anatomical methods. Although similar in most respects to VI of the Old World macaque, layer 4 of the normal adult marmoset has a predominance of binocular cells which corresponds to a lack of segregation of geniculo-cortical afferents into ocular dominance (OD) columns. Brief early monocular deprivation (MD) causes a physiological shift in OD towards the open eye, even when followed by long-term binocular recovery. Two marmosets subjected to 3 weeks of MD from 3 weeks of age exhibited clear afferent segregation in at least parts of VI. Brief disruption of correlated binocular inputs may have served to preserve, and probably enhance the normally transient columnar OD pattern of juvenile marmosets. I have analysed responses of single neurons in cat area 17 to binocular stimuli under conditions that result in perceptual suppression of vision in one eye in humans. In normal animals, a paradigm of <b>binocular</b> contour <b>rivalry</b> was tested. The response of a binocular cell in VI to an optimally oriented grating in one eye is powerfully depressed when gratings of very different orientation are suddenly presented to the other eye, while contours of matching orientation cause the well-known disparity-selective facilitation. However, neuronal responses to persistent rivalrous stimuli do not often exhibit spontaneous alternations between states of dominance and suppression, which might be expected in view of alternations of perceptual dominance in humans under such conditions. Whether or not suppression is triggered by rivalrous contours depends on the immediate history of visual stimulation. Binocular responses are consistently depressed below monocular control levels only when stimulation through one eye with contours of inappropriate orientation is preceded by stimulation of the other eye with a grating of optimum orientation, while there is no suppression with simultaneous stimulus onset: thus neurons display interocular control of responsiveness. In most squinting humans, single vision is maintained through unilateral or alternating suppression. In cats and monkeys that have been rendered strabismic early in life, dominant-eye responses of striate cortical neurons to optimum gratings are dramatically reduced when gratings of any orientation, whether matching or orthogonal, are presented to the non-dominant eye. Like rivalrous suppression in normal animals, this phenomenon is characterized by independence of disparity, broad spatial frequency tuning and dependence on the sequence of stimulation. I propose that reciprocal inhibition between neighbouring ocular dominance columns in VI, over a number of orientation domains, mediates interocular suppression in both normal and strabismic subjects, vetoing signals from one eye in situations that would otherwise cause double vision and confusion. </p...|$|R
50|$|Flash {{suppression}} {{has certain}} methodological advantages over <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> {{as a tool}} for probing conscious vision. Whereas the percept during <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> alternates stochastically, the percept during flash suppression is precisely controlled in time.|$|E
50|$|Flash {{suppression}} occurs due to {{the conflict}} between the inputs to the two eyes. When this conflict is sustained without any abrupt events, <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> occurs. In both flash suppression and <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry,</b> perceptual conflict between the two eyes is required for the perceptual effect. If two similar images are used, fusion of the two images is experienced, rather than flash suppression or <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b> Despite some similarities in perceptual consequences, the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the two illusions can be different. For example, the strength (depth) of flash suppression seems much stronger than that of <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b> Comparative studies of the two methods are needed.|$|E
50|$|Breese {{attributed}} monocular rivalry to {{the same}} mechanism as responsible for <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b> Leopold, and Logothetis (1999) argued that it, and <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry,</b> are examples of multistable perception phenomena, including the Necker cube and Rubin vase figure.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, flash {{suppression}} and Continuous Flash Suppression were {{suggested as}} superior methods that {{can enhance the}} benefits and minimise the limitations of <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry.</b> One of the limitations {{that is associated with}} <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> in exploring neural mechanisms of awareness is that perceptual dominance and suppression is only sustained for an unpredictably short period of time.

50|$|In <b>binocular</b> <b>rivalry</b> {{experiments}} {{in which the}} stimulus is periodically removed, a distribution delineating the perceptual alterations {{as a function of}} time can be predicted using the present model.
