50|$|The {{dissipation}} {{of energy}} and relative calm water created {{in the lee of}} the breakwaters often encourage accretion of sediment (as per the design of the breakwater scheme). However, this can lead to excessive salient build up, resulting in tombolo formation, which reduces longshore drift shoreward of the breakwaters. This trapping of sediment can cause adverse effects down-drift of the breakwaters, leading to <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> starvation and increased erosion. This may then lead to further engineering protection being needed down-drift of the breakwater development.|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} effect is longshore drift (LSD)(Also known as Littoral Drift), {{the process by which}} sediment is continuously moved along beaches by wave action. LSD occurs because waves hit the shore at an angle, pick up sediment (sand) on the shore and carry it down the beach at an angle (this is called swash). Due to gravity, the water then falls back perpendicular to the beach, dropping its sediment as it loses energy (this is called backwash). The sediment is then picked up by the next wave and pushed slightly further down the beach, resulting in a continual movement of sediment in one direction. This is the reason why long strips of coast are covered in sediment, not just the areas around river mouths, which are the main sources of <b>beach</b> <b>sediment.</b> LSD is reliant on a constant supply of sediment from rivers and if sediment supply is stopped or sediment falls into a submarine canals at any point along a beach, this can lead to bare beaches further along the shore.|$|E

5000|$|Coastal {{sediment}} transport (a subset of {{sediment transport}}) is {{the interaction of}} coastal land forms to various complex interactions of physical processes. The primary agent in coastal sediment transport is wave activity (see Wind wave), followed by tides and storm surge (see Tide and Storm surge), and near shore currents (see Sea#Currents) [...] Wind-generated waves {{play a key role}} in the transfer of energy from the open ocean to the coastlines. In addition to the physical processes acting upon the shore, the size distribution of the sediment is a critical determination for how the beach will change (see Grain size determination). These various interactions generate a wide variety of beaches. (see Beach). Other than the interactions between coastal land forms and physical processes there is also the addition of modification of these landforms through anthropogenic sources (see human modifications). Some of the anthropogenic sources of modification have been put in place to halt erosion or prevent harbors from filling up with sediment. In order to assist community planners, local governments, and national governments a variety of models have been developed to predict the changes of <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> transport at coastal locations. Typically, during large wave events, the sediment gets transported off the beach face a deposited offshore generating a sandbar. Once the significant wave event has diminished, the sediment then gets slowly transported back onshore.|$|E

The Park {{is located on}} Lake Huron’s southeastern shore where, due to rapid changes in Lake Huron water levels, a study could be completed examining the changes to blowout morphology based on the change in <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> supply. The study took place during relative low Lake Huron levels (1999 - 2000) and was compared to data collected {{during a period of}} relative high Lake Huron levels (1994 - 1995). Field research included erosion pin measurement to monitor and verify morphological change through the throat of the blowout, aeolian sediment trap volume measurements and grain size analysis, and three-dimensional mapping to calculate areas of erosion and deposition by volumetric analysis. Erosion occurred through the blowout throat during both study periods but less so during the low lake level study period. The increased <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> supply provided a catalyst for increased deposition landward and lakeward of the foredune ridge during the low lake level period.

40|$|One kind of {{the waste}} from mining is Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) which can be handled biology methodes by using a {{sediment}} as the inoculums resource of microbe in order to reducing sulphate. This research aimed to knowing the effect of mangrove and <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> in increasing pH, reducing the sulphate level {{and the amount of}} microbe in the Acid Mine Drainage (AMD). The changing of pH was measured with pH meter, the level of sulphate was measured with titration method and the total of microbe was counted by using SPC (Standard Plate Count) method. The result indicated that giving sediment to AMD can increase the pH of AMD from 3 to 6, 2 on the sediment from the beach and 7, 176 of pH at the mangrove sediment after 30 days.

40|$|Calcareous oolites {{occur in}} beach and {{continental}} shelf sediments from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to {{as far south}} as Palm Beach. The abundance of oolites in both shelf and <b>beach</b> <b>sediments</b> is highly irregular. In <b>beach</b> <b>sediments</b> the oolites tend to be significantly more abundant in backshore deposits than in foreshore deposits. This abundance is believed to be due to selective sorting with the oolites responding to flow as heavier particles because of their shape and surface smoothness. The source of the oolites in the beach deposits appears to be the inner continental shelf. Because of their highly irregular distribution and sensitivity to selective sorting processes, it is concluded that quantitative estimates of the total amount of sediment transported ashore with the oolites cannot be made.

40|$|We {{investigate}} rocky coastline evolution over millennial {{time scales}} using exploratory analytical and numerical models based on interactions between beaches and sea cliffs. In the models, wave-driven sea-cliff retreat is a nonlinear function of beach width, where cliff retreat is maximized by sediment abrasion and minimized by either {{a lack of}} <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> or too much sediment (which prevents waves from reaching the sea cliff). As sea cliffs retreat, <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> is produced and distributed alongshore by wave-driven sediment transport, and local beach widths determine future cliff retreat rates. Numerical experiments indicate that through such interactions, rocky coastlines can reach an equilibrium configuration where headlands and embayments remain stable through time, {{even in the absence}} of alongshore variations in sea-cliff lithology. Furthermore, the equilibrium coastline configuration, or the alongshore proportion of rocky headland to cliff-backed pocket beach, can be predicted analytically.

40|$|Mixed {{sand and}} gravel beaches form a wedge of {{protective}} sediment {{at the base of}} eroding cliffs. In profile these beaches are typically steep with a prominent storm berm. If the volume of <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> is insufficient, storms strip beach sediments seaward, exposing the cliff toe to wave attack. The beach volume is thus crucial to the protection of sea cliffs. In this article we describe a method of calculating alongshore variation in the volume of mixed {{sand and gravel}} beaches using ground penetrating radar (GPR). Eighteen sites were studied along 50 km of the east coast of South Island, New Zealand. The method was underpinned by an ability to map the boundary between beach sediments and underlying Pleistocene alluvial-fan sediments. This was achieved by studying the radar facies, particularly landward-dipping overwash deposits and seaward-dipping beach erosion surfaces. The method was ground-truthed in three ways: (1) a stream provided a clean section through one site that was imaged by radar; (2) a storm stripped <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> from three sites exposing the substrate, which was then surveyed and compared with radar profiles; (3) excavations in a previous study at nine sites were used to combine the stratigraphy with the radar images. GPR proved highly effective in this environment, revealing thin beaches in the south of the study area that thicken northward in the direction of alongshore sediment transport. Cliff height decreases northward such that there is a transition from beaches in front of cliffs, to beaches that overtop low cliffs, to barriers in front of a coastal lagoon...|$|E
40|$|The great physiographic {{diversity}} of the Dendê Coast favors the production of different <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> types, including bioclastic components. In this study 74 beach samples collected at 2 km intervals were used to evaluate <b>beach</b> <b>sediment</b> composition. For each sample, 300 grains were identified for each grain size class coarser than 0. 125 mm, using a binocular microscope. The beach sediments of the Dendê Coast are essentially siliciclastic (80 - 100 %). Quartz is the major component (70 - 100 %). Only at the Tinharé and Boipeba islands bioclasts are major components of beach sands reaching up to 80 - 100 %. These sediments are made up essentially of fragments of Halimeda, reaching percentages up to 70 %. Coralline algae and mollusks also contribute significantly to these sediments (up to 30 %). The results obtained show that the spatial distribution of the bioclastic components provide important information on the environmental conditions present at the shoreline (energy levels, availability of hard substrates and protected areas, pattern of sediment dispersion) and on the sediment sources as well. The composition of the beach sediments on the Dendê Coast reflects the present day environmental conditions and show that these sediments do not experience significant lateral transport. This situation is favored by an impeded longshore transport that characterizes most of the region. Although, in general, the rivers that discharge on the Dendê Coast appear to transport few sediments to the coastal zone, the presence of heavy minerals, micas and feldspars suggests river contributions to the beach sediments. On the other hand, the coral and coralline algae reefs, besides offering a natural protection to the shoreline, also represent {{an important source of}} beach sands...|$|E

By contrast, the seawater is strongly depleted in dissolved silica with concentrations of 3 µM, and consequently characterised by high d 30 Si of + 3. 0 per mil. The beach groundwaters are variably enriched in dissolved silica compared to seawater (23 - 192 µM), and concentrations increase with depth at all sampling sites. The corresponding d 30 Si values are highly variable (+ 0. 3 per mil to + 2. 2 per mil) and decrease with depth at each site.
