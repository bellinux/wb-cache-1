5|$|Of {{the actors}} {{cast in the}} four leading roles, only Gina McKee {{was a native of}} North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related {{strongly}} to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether {{it would be possible to}} age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Libby, played by Cynthia Watros, {{was introduced in}} this episode. Originally, Libby had been written to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> late 40's or early 50's. Jennifer Jason Leigh was approached to play the part, but it went to Watros instead. When Watros auditioned for the part of Libby, {{she did not think}} that she would end up being cast. Once she was, Watros and her twin daughters immediately moved from Los Angeles to Hawaii. Bernard is also introduced in this episode. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and made Bernard white to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unaware of their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{there is}} the {{question}} of the last three poems that were found among her papers. They seem to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> handwriting, which is why Killigrew’s father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if they are in fact by Killigrew. Some of her other poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.|$|E

Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense {{as some of the}} other characters.

500|$|... "You Belong with Me"'s {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Roman White. In the video, Swift portrays both the protagonist and antagonist, which she respectively described as [...] "the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have" [...] and [...] "the popular girl." [...] Swift described the popular girl's persona as [...] "horrible and scary and intimidating and perfect". Her love interest is portrayed by American actor Lucas Till; Swift met Till while acting {{on the set of}} [...] in April 2008. She later asked him to act in the video, as she was intrigued by his [...] "cool look", embodying a [...] "dreamy guy". In regards to his acting on the video, Swift said, [...] "He's absolutely perfect for the part and really fun to be around, too." [...] According to her, the video's plot is [...] "charming"; she also said that, [...] "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, wishing I could <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> position." [...] In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift [...] "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending. Swift commented, [...] "One of my favorite things about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters.

He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{straightforward}} {{compassion for}} the poor, {{there are two other}} possible motivations for Mrs Thwaytes's philanthropy. Firstly there was the 19th-century progress of Evangelicalism, which encouraged good works from those with religious sensibility and social pity. [...] Secondly, following the expansion of the middle classes in the 18th and 19th centuries, beneficence was [...] "an avenue for entry into elite society for women and gave them a sense of place and direction outside the home." [...] In other words, for a woman of known humble origins {{and at the same time}} a wealthy widow looking for a place in society, philanthropy would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> best interests. However 19th-century British elite society was based in the popular imagination upon elegant culture, not money or good deeds, and Herne Bay Clock Tower's opening ceremony drew mockery from the Figaro in London of 6 October 1836, in which she was called a Cockney and her clock, celebration and philanthropy laughed at.|$|E
