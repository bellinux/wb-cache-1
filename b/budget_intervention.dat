The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the oral sensorimotor function for feeding in patients with tetanus. Thirteen patients clinically diagnosed with tetanus and admitted to an intensive care unit between December of 2005 and May of 2007 underwent a screening too) for dysphagia, involving the assessment of clinical features and 2 swallowing tests. Results indicate that the oral sensorimotor function for feeding in these patients is severely compromised, with the exception for the clinical feature of palate elevation and performance in the saliva swallowing test. The factor analysis indicated that the evaluation of tongue movement change in the oromotor examination is important in predicting alterations of cough/voice in the water swallowing test, thus suggesting that oral feeding might be unsafe. When looking at developing countries, the prolonged intensive medical and nursing care required by many patients with tetanus places extra demands on an already stretched healthcare <b>budget.</b> <b>Intervention</b> by a speech pathologist could mean that time in the ICU would be reduced as well as the number of re-admissions due to complications.

40|$|Heart {{failure is}} one of the most {{important}} medical problems facing societies in developed economies and its prevalence is predicted to rise inexorably in the next few decades as longevity increases. Worsening heart failure leading to hospitalization is associated with a poor prognosis and imposes a substantial burden on health care resources and <b>budgets.</b> <b>Interventions</b> that can stabilize patients should reduce the need for hospitalization and improve prognosis. This might be facilitated by frequent self-monitoring of clinical and physiological variables by patients themselves at home. Rising pulmonary artery pressure is an early sign of cardiac decompensation that may be more sensitive than conventional methods of patient assessment and thus allow early adjustment of medical therapy to avoid hospitalizations and improve patient outcomes.

Budgets were determined for different decision makers based on their willingness to pay. Reducing the prevalence of heifers with a high milk somatic cell count (SCC) early in the first lactation could be achieved through herd level management interventions for pre- and peri-partum heifers, however the cost effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. A synthesis of multiple sources of evidence, accounting for variability and uncertainty in the available data is invaluable to inform decision makers around likely economic outcomes of investing in disease control measures. One analytical approach to this is Bayesian micro-simulation, where the trajectory of different individuals undergoing specific interventions is simulated. The classic micro-simulation framework was extended to encompass synthesis of evidence from 2 separate statistical models and previous research, with the outcome for an individual cow or herd assessed in terms of changes in lifetime milk yield, disposal risk, and likely financial returns conditional on the interventions being simultaneously applied.

40|$|Over {{the past}} forty years {{the topic of}} {{bullying}} has generated considerable research interest. Schools spend {{a large amount of}} their <b>budgets</b> on <b>interventions</b> designed to reduce the incidence of bullying and to promote prosocial behaviours (Viding, McCrory, Blakemore and Frederickson, 2011). Nationwide initiatives such as the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum (DfE, 2005) have been widely implemented across schools in the United Kingdom with a view to increasing social and emotional competence and reducing bullying. Despite this, bullying remains a prominent concern and anti-bullying interventions do not always seem to lead to a significant decrease in bullying behaviour (Salmivalli, Kaukiainen & Voeten, 2005). Although much of the bullying research has focused primarily on bullies and victims it seems more widely accepted now that bullying is a group process which happens within a social context. More recent studies have looked at the other roles that children can adopt in a bullying situation such as defender, reinforcer, assistant and outsider (Salmivalli, 1996), however research in this areas is relatively limited to date. Existing research is largely quantitative in design and is considerably reliant on fixed response questionnaires. The current study looks at defending in particular and explores the factors associated with children’s expressed intentions to defend. Due to complexities involved in operationalising bullying as a construct, the focus of this study is on unkind behaviour rather than bullying. A mixed methods approach is used incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. 113 upper Key Stage 2 children (66 boys and 47 girls) from two schools in the south east of England completed questionnaires designed to assess behavioural tendencies in relation to unkindness, friendship quality, social group structure and attitudes towards unkind behaviour. Paired interviews were conducted with 32 children (17 girls and 15 boys). Correlation, regression and thematic analyses were used to explore factors seemingly associated with defending.

We use this to obtain an optimal intervention plan based on an integer programming formulation, and compare the optimal plan against several ecologically-motivated heuristic strategies used in practice. We present an empirical study of two variants of the invasive control problem: minimizing the final rate of invasions, and minimizing the number of invasions {{at the end of}} a given time horizon. Our results show that the optimized intervention achieves nearly the same level of control that would be attained by completely eradicating the species, with a 20 % cost saving. Additionally, we design a heuristic intervention strategy based on a combination of the density and life stage of the invasive individuals, and find that it comes surprisingly close to the optimized strategy, suggesting that this could serve as a good rule of thumb in invasive species management...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supporting {{the value of}} screening women for cervical cancer once in their lifetime, coupled with mounting interest in scaling up successful screening demonstration projects, present challenges to public health decision makers seeking {{to take full advantage}} of the single-visit opportunity to provide additional services. We present an analytic framework for packaging multiple interventions during a single point of contact, explicitly taking into account a budget and scarce human resources, constraints acknowledged as significant obstacles for provision of health services in poor countries. We developed a binary integer programming (IP) model capable of identifying an optimal package of health services to be provided during a single visit for a particular target population. Inputs to the IP model are derived using state-transition models, which compute lifetime costs and health benefits associated with each intervention. In a simplified example of a single lifetime cervical cancer screening visit, we identified packages of interventions among six diseases that maximized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted subject to budget and human resource constraints in four resource-poor regions. Data were obtained from regional reports and surveys from the World Health Organization, international databases, the published literature, and expert opinion. With only a <b>budget</b> constraint, <b>interventions</b> for depression and iron deficiency anemia were packaged with cervical cancer screening, while the more costly breast cancer and cardiovascular disease interventions were not. Including personnel constraints resulted in shifting of interventions included in the package, not only across diseases but also between low- and high-intensity intervention options within diseases. The results of our example suggest several key themes: Packaging other interventions during a one-time visit has the potential to increase health gains; the shortage of personnel represents a real-world constraint that can impact the optimal package of services; and the shortage of different types of personnel may influence the contents of the package of services. Our methods provide a general framework to enhance a decision maker's ability to simultaneously consider costs, benefits, and important nonmonetary constraints. We encourage analysts working on real-world problems to shift from considering costs and benefits of interventions for a single disease to exploring what synergies might be achievable by thinking across disease burdens...|$|R

While the initial aim of this article was to review the arguments for abandoning the $US 50 [*] 000 threshold, it quickly turned to questioning whether we should maintain a fixed threshold at all. Our consideration of the relevance of thresholds was framed by two important historical considerations. First, cost-effectiveness analysis was developed for a resource allocation exercise where a threshold would be determined endogenously by maximizing a fixed budget across all possible interventions and not for piecemeal evaluation where a threshold needs to be set exogenously. Second, the foundations of the $US 50 [*] 000 threshold are highly dubious, so it would be unacceptable merely to adjust for inflation or current clinical practice. Upon consideration of both sides of the argument, we conclude that the arguments for abandoning the concept for maintaining a fixed threshold outweigh those for keeping one. Furthermore, we document a variety of reasons why a threshold needs to vary in the US, including variations across payer, over time, in the true <b>budget</b> impact of <b>interventions</b> and in the measurement of the effectiveness of interventions.

Results Community respondents selected school programs most often (88. 0 %) and allocated it the largest proportion of funds, followed by promotion of safer drinking (71. 3 %), community programs (61. 4 %) and police enforcement of alcohol laws (60. 4 %). Professionals selected GP training most often (61. 0 %) and allocated it the largest proportion of funds, followed by school programs (36. 6 %), community programs (33. 8 %) and promotion of safer drinking (31. 7 %). Community views were susceptible to response bias. There were no significant predictors of professionals' preferences. Conclusions In the absence of sufficient research evidence for effective community-based alcohol interventions, rural communities and professionals both strongly support school programs, promotion of safer drinking and community programs. Rural communities also supported police enforcement of alcohol laws and professionals supported GP training. The impact of a combination of these strategies needs to be rigorously evaluated. </p...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The U. S. obesity {{epidemic}} is escalating, particularly among communities of color. Obesity control efforts have {{shifted away from}} individual-level approaches toward population-based approaches that address socio-cultural, political, economic, and physical environmental factors. Few data exist for ethnic minority groups. This article reviews studies of population-based interventions targeting communities of color or including sufficient samples to permit ethnic-specific analyses. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were established, an electronic database search conducted, and non-electronically catalogued studies retrieved. Findings were aggregated for earlier (early 1970 s to early 1990 s) and later (mid- 1990 s to present) interventions. RESULTS: The search yielded 23 ethnically inclusive intervention studies published between January 1970 and May 2003. Several characteristics of inclusive interventions were consistent with characteristics of community-level interventions among predominantly white European-American samples: use of non-interpersonal channels for information dissemination directed at broad spheres of influence (e. g., mass media), promotion of physical activity, and incorporation of social marketing principles. Ethnically inclusive studies, however, also placed greater emphasis on involving communities and building coalitions from study inception; targeting captive audiences; mobilizing social networks; and tailoring culturally specific messages and messengers. Inclusive studies also focused more on community than individual norms. Later studies used "upstream" approaches more than earlier studies. Fewer {{than half of the}} inclusive studies presented outcome evaluation data. Statistically significant effects were few and modest, but several studies demonstrated better outcomes among ethnic minority than white participants sampled. CONCLUSION: The best data available speak more about how to engage and retain people of color in these interventions than about how to create and sustain weight loss, regular engagement in physical activity, or improved diet. Advocacy should be directed at increasing the visibility and <b>budget</b> priority of <b>interventions,</b> particularly {{at the state and local}} levels...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{historic}} buildings, {{remnants of}} a past long gone are often still highly operational in our time, most likely {{at the expense of}} the environment. Without interventions, their energy performance is outdated – provided they are used in a contemporary way - and they contribute to the over-consumption of energy and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Intervention possibilities for historic buildings are numerous and highly dependent on a case by case approach. This project examines the case of the Soda Fabriek in Schiedam, an 18 th century industrial building. Technical solutions for the energy performance upgrade of the Soda Fabriek’s envelope in respect to its historical significance will be discussed. Yet even for this aspect of a redesign, it is imperative to keep in mind the original elements or characteristics of the building in question. Interventions are always appropriate to the goals of each project. Lowest energy consumption, energy neutrality, over-all sustainability, conservation are different approaches to the issue of upgrading or redeveloping architectural heritage and can lead to different degrees of intervention on such a building. The approach taken to achieve those goals also plays a big role. Simplicity of <b>interventions,</b> <b>budget,</b> extravagance, appearance can have significant impact on how an existing peace of architectural heritage is being redeveloped for a new purpose. This project shows clearly that partial intervention, although it can achieve some improvement on the energy consumed for conditioning a building, it simply is not sufficient. More holistic approaches on all aspects and elements of an existing building are necessary already from the initial stages of re-design, if a historic building is to answer to the issue of energy and sustainability of architectural heritage.

40|$|Background Exercise {{therapy in}} {{patients}} with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis is effective in reducing pain, increasing physical activity and physical functioning, but costly and a burden for the health care <b>budget.</b> A web-based <b>intervention</b> is cheap in comparison to face-to-face exercise therapy and {{has the advantage of}} supporting in home exercises because of the 24 / 7 accessibility. However, the lack of face-to-face contact with a professional is a disadvantage of web-based interventions and {{is probably one of the}} reasons for low adherence rates. In order to combine the best of two worlds, we have developed the intervention e-Exercise. In this blended intervention face-to-face contacts with a physical therapist are partially replaced by a web-based exercise intervention. The aim of this study is to investigate the short- (3 months) and long-term (12 months) (cost) -effectiveness of e-Exercise compared to usual care physical therapy. Our hypothesis is that e-Exercise is more effective and cost-effective in increasing physical functioning and physical activity compared to usual care. Methods/Design This paper presents the protocol of a prospective, single-blinded, multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial. In total, 200 patients with OA of the hip and/or knee will be randomly allocated into either e-Exercise or usual care (physical therapy). E-Exercise is a 12 -week intervention, consisting of maximum five face-to-face physical therapy contacts supplemented with a web-based program. The web-based program contains assignments to gradually increase patients’ physical activity, strength and stability exercises and information about OA related topics. Primary outcomes are physical activity and physical functioning. Secondary outcomes are health related quality of life, self-perceived effect, pain, tiredness and self-efficacy. All measurements will be performed at baseline, 3 and 12 months after inclusion. Retrospective cost questionnaires will be sent at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and used for the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Discussion This study is the first randomized controlled trial in the (cost) -effectiveness of a blended exercise intervention for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee. The findings will help to improve the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for optimal medium-term scheduling (e. g. over a time window of 5 years) of rehabilitation and leakage detection interventions {{in a water}} distribution system given predetermined budget constraints. The decisional variables are the interventions to be scheduled, that is, which pipes to replace and when (in which year), and where and when (in which zone and year) to carry out leakage detection surveys, while the objectives are to minimize the volumes of water lost and break repair costs. The optimiser used is the NSGA II multiobjective genetic algorithm. It is assumed that the budget allocated for leakage detection and pipe rehabilitation (proactive interventions) re{{presents a}} separate expenditure item from that for the repair of breaks (reactive interventions). In particular, whereas repair costs are subject to minimization, the <b>budget</b> for proactive <b>interventions</b> is allocated on a yearly basis during the scheduling period and a constraint {{is determined by the}} fact that the amounts budgeted must be completely spent, year after year: this reflects the customary practice of Water Utilities, which strive to spend the entire budget available to them, since any residual amount may not be reallocated to the same expenditure item in the year or years to come. The multiobjective optimisation procedure does not produce one optimal solution, but rather the Pareto front of nondominated solutions. Some considerations for identifying a range of solutions within this front, from which to choose the one to apply, are thus discussed. The procedure is applied to a real water distribution system using advanced models to represent the various processes that characterise the problem, namely, leakages as a function of pipe age and pressure, actual nodal discharges released as a function of head, time series of pipe breaks, etc. and the results obtained show that the proposed procedure may be a useful decision support tool for scheduling leakage detection campaigns and rehabilitation interventions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. There {{have been}} few studies {{conducted}} in hospitalized patients in Viet nam on the epidemiology of surgical site infections (SSIs) {{and the impact of}} hand hygiene practices. This study aimed {{to assess the impact of}} a bedside hand sanitizer program on SSIs in orthopaedic and neurosurgical patients. DESIGN. A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted with an untreated control group design in neurosurgical patients and before-after design in orthopaedic patients. A cost analysis based on data derived from the results of this study was also performed. SETTING. Cho Ray Hospital, a tertiary university hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet nam. PATIENTS. All patients admitted for operation between 11 July and 15 August 2000 (Before), and 14 July and 18 August 2001 (After) were included, except those who had undergone another operation within one month prior to admission or were admitted because of SSIs. INTERVENTION. Bedside hand sanitizers were introduced into the Orthopaedic ward and one Neurosurgical ward (Ward A) from September 2000. Training on proper use was also provided to ward staff. Another Neurosurgical ward (Ward B) was used as a control group with no intervention conducted. RESULTS. A total of 1368 patients were recruited into the study. After intervention, in Ward A of the neurosurgical department, the SSI rate between the two periods was reduced by 54 % (8. 3 % to 3. 8 %; p= 0. 09). Superficial SSIs were eliminated after the intervention (p= 0. 007). Comparison between Ward A (intervention) and Ward B (control) showed that, before the intervention, there was no difference in incidence of SSI between the two wards (Ward A: 8. 3 %, Ward B: 7. 2 %, p= 0. 7); however, after intervention, the incidence of SSI in Ward A was significantly lower than Ward B (3. 8 % and 9. 2 %, p= 0. 04). For orthopaedic patients, the SSI rate between the two periods was reduced by 34 % (14. 8 % to 9. 8 %; p= 0. 07). SSI patients had a median post-operative length of stay of 19 days longer than patients without SSI (p< 0. 001). Costs were 2. 5 times higher in patients with in-hospital SSI compared to uninfected patients (p< 0. 001). Mean SSI-attributable costs were conservatively estimated at US$ 368 in neurosurgical patients and US$ 207 in the orthopaedic patients in the before period. SSIs were responsible for at least 14 percent of the annual <b>budget</b> before <b>intervention.</b> The savings per SSI prevented were estimated at US$ 332 in neurosurgical patients and US$ 157 in orthopaedic patients. Annual cost savings arising from the intervention were estimated at US$ 11, 112 in orthopaedic patients and US$ 19, 320 in neurosurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of SSI in the hospital was high. The use of hand sanitizers reduced SSI rates, particularly impacting on the incidence of superficial SSIs. The hand sanitization program was found to be a dominant intervention being both more effective and cost saving as compared with no intervention in both study departments. The use of bedside hand sanitizers should be encouraged in the hospitals in Viet nam, where there often is a lack of other hand-washing facilities. PhD Doctorat...|$|R
40|$|M. Phil. (Human Resources Development) The {{transfer}} of learning after training courses {{is relevant to}} Human Resource Development (HRD) professionals, human resources divisions and managers within organisations. HRD managers in particular must secure a suitable training <b>budget,</b> present learning <b>interventions,</b> and employ qualified HRD practitioners who add value to a company’s turnover and profitability. When the HRD unit assists employees in improving their performance with training, this enables the Human Resources (HR) division to be a strategic business partner to the organisation. HRD practitioners should ensure that the learning provided to employees improves their performance in delivering strategic results without any obstacles or barriers. The aim {{of the study was}} to conduct an investigation into the potential learning transfer barriers that could have an impact on the successful {{transfer of}} learning within the financial services sector. This study sought to identify the predominant barriers to transfer of learning when employees return to the workplace after attending training. The literature review on the transfer of learning and the barriers to the transfer of learning highlighted an international survey instrument designed to measure the workplace barriers to effective learning transfer. This instrument was used in conducting the research for this study. The unit of analysis of this study included financial services managers from one bank operating within three provinces of South Africa: Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal and Western Cape. The mixed method approach used in this study favours a dominant quantitative approach with a secondary qualitative component. Data was obtained using the adapted, international survey instrument, the Learning Transfer Systems Inventory (LTSI) questionnaire. The LTSI is a validated instrument that is used to diagnose factors affecting successful transfer of learning. HRD professionals are able to use the LTSI to identify potential transfer barriers after administering a learning intervention. The findings reveal that line managers are key role players in the learning transfer challenge. Line managers who fail to support and encourage the application of learning after training represent a barrier to employee transfer of learning. This report recommends that managers play the role of performance coaches, and become enablers of rather than barriers to employee transfer of learning...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{most of the}} {{emergency}} departments (ED) in developed countries, a subset of patients visits the ED frequently. Despite their small numbers, these patients {{are the source of}} a disproportionally high number of all ED visits, and use a significant proportion of healthcare resources. They place a heavy economic burden on hospital and healthcare systems <b>budgets</b> overall. Several <b>interventions</b> have been carried out to improve the management of these ED frequent users. Case management has been shown in some North American studies to reduce ED utilization and costs. In these studies, cost analyses have been carried out from the hospital perspective without examining the costs induced by healthcare consumed in the community. However, case management might reduce ED visits and costs from the hospital's perspective, but induce substitution effects, and increase health service utilization outside the hospital. This study examined if an interdisciplinary case-management intervention-compared to standard ED care -reduced costs generated by frequent ED users not only from the hospital perspective, but also from the healthcare system perspective-that is, from a broader perspective taking into account the costs of healthcare services used outside the hospital. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 250 adult frequent emergency department users (5 or more visits during the previous 12 months) who visited the ED of the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, between May 2012 and July 2013 were allocated to one of two groups: case management intervention (CM) or standard ED care (SC), and followed up for 12 months. Depending on the perspective of the analysis, costs were evaluated differently. For the analysis from the hospital's perspective, the true value of resources used to provide services was used as a cost estimate. These data were obtained from the hospital's analytical accounting system. For the analysis from the health-care system perspective, all health-care services consumed by users and charged were used as an estimate of costs. These data were obtained from health insurance providers for a subsample of participants. To allow comparisons in a same time period, individual monthly average costs were calculated. Multivariate linear models including a fixed effect "group" were run using socio-demographic characteristics and health-related variables as controlling variables (age, gender, educational level, citizenship, marital status, somatic and mental health problems, and risk behaviors) ...|$|R
