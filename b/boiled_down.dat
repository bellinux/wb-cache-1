He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E

The competition quickly <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to the Beaver and the Cessna 195; however, the Beaver proved itself to outperform the 195 and, {{as a consequence of the}} outbreak of the Korean War, this led to orders for hundreds of aircraft being placed.

25|$|The {{first attempt}} by the Metropolitan Board of Guardians to remove the pigs {{prompted}} a petition that revealed 188 families with 582 children relied on fattening pigs for their existence.

The edible was fed to {{the children and the}} rest <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> for the fat or fed to the pigs, chickens and ducks. Dogs abounded, being used to protect the pigs. In 1850, after cholera had taken victims on Latimer Road, Charles Dickens in his publication Household Words described this as a 'Plague Spot'.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Israelites built {{terraces}} of leveled {{areas in}} the hill country for planting a variety of crops, including grains, vegetables and fruit trees. All the trees, {{with the exception of}} the olive, produced fruit that could be eaten fresh or be made into fresh juice while in season. Fruit was also processed for later use in a variety of ways: Fruit with high sugar content was fermented to make alcoholic beverages; grapes were most commonly used for this. Fruit was also <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> into thick, sweet syrup, referred to in the Bible as dvash (honey). Grapes, figs, dates and apricots were also dried and preserved individually or put on a string or pressed into cakes. Since dried fruit are an efficient source of energy, they were prepared as provisions for journeys and long marches.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the major}} {{communities}} of the municipalities have their annual festival, set {{on the day of}} their patron saint. These include Pinal de Amoles (March 16–19), San Pedro Escanela, (May 1–5 and June 27–29), Ahuacatlán de Guadalupe (December 12), Santa Águeda (February 5), Bucareli (October 4 and December 8) and Escaelilla (June 13). Municipality wide there is the annual “La Molienda” from the beginning of February to the middle of March. This is related to the harvest of sugar cane although nowadays, there are fewer fields that grow this crop. The tradition includes cutting a cane to extract its juice in a press or mill. With the juice <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> and the remaining dry cane used as fuel or animal feed. The boiled sugar cane juice is made into a syrup, which is then molded into small pillars called piloncillos.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critical}} psychiatrists {{criticize the}} practice of defining {{one and the same}} belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1860s, {{drought and}} {{recession}} {{had led to}} a collapse in the pastoral industry in north Queensland. In order to salvage some profit, squatters turned to the <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> of sheep and cattle for tallow (for candles and soap). Hoofs and horns were utilised for oil, and hides for leather. In 1864 a number of small-scale <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works were established on pastoral properties in the Kennedy and gulf districts, but the <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> industry became more professional in 1866, when Towns & Co. opened a <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> plant at Cleveland Bay, and Morehead & Young, partners in the Scottish Australian Pastoral Company, opened a similar operation on the Albert River where the settlement of Burketown had been established in 1865. Neither of these establishments survived {{for any length of}} time. At Cleveland Bay, the Queensland Meat Export Company established a meatworks south of Townsville on Alligator Creek in 1879, using some of the equipment from Towns' factory.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Boiling</b> <b>down</b> {{works have}} been an {{important}} industry throughout Queensland during a number of periods. The establishment of such works usually coincided with drought and low prices for wool and beef. Boiling-down factories were started in Brisbane in 1843 by John [...] "Tinker" [...] Campbell and in Ipswich in 1847. By 1851, two works were located in Ipswich. Other <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works being established on the Darling Downs during the 1860s, included Campbell's operation on Westbrook Homestead, the depression of the time being the predominant reason behind the establishment of such industries. Consequently, reasons behind {{the establishment of the}} <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works at St Lawrence may also have been due to the effects of the depression.|$|R

[...] Dahlia Lithwick of Slate wrote that if Thorne-Begland's previous advocacy for gay rights disqualified him from the bench, Thurgood Marshall's advocacy with the NAACP and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's advocacy for women's rights would have disqualified them from the U.S. Supreme Court.

500|$|Open pan {{evaporation}} {{methods have}} been streamlined since colonial days, but remain basically unchanged. Sap must first be collected and <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature [...] over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined {{at the place where}} the syrup is being produced, each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day. Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature.|$|E
500|$|Absence as a lyrical {{theme is}} common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also {{explored}} unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt {{with the loss of}} youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: [...] "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." [...] Waters commented: [...] "it's about none of us really being there... should have been called Wish We Were Here".|$|E

Spears revealed she was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)"(1990) to select Ritts as the video's director. According to Ritts, the singer [...] "wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, and that meant that it <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to her. She really had to act the song, and she was very impressive." [...] He also revealed that the video was set at [...] "a funky beach shack" [...] similar to the videos for Madonna's [...] "Cherish" [...] (1989) and Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1989). [...] "The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him to tell her the words", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, [...] "was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model," [...] according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public.|$|E
500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong", which was <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to [...] "did the defendant know what he was doing, and if so, that what he was doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E
500|$|After Wimp Sanderson {{was forced}} out as coach of Alabama in 1992, Amaker was under {{consideration}} to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at Northwestern when Bill Foster stepped aside to serve as interim athletic director, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying [...] "It <b>boiled</b> <b>down</b> to us looking at {{a situation where we}} were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn't right for us now." [...] That summer Amaker was one of two college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace Kevin O'Neill, who left Marquette for a job at Tennessee. In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George Raveling following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience.|$|E
