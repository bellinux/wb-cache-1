50|$|This is a {{variation}} of the online sales scam where high-value, scarce pets are <b>advertised</b> as <b>bait</b> on online <b>advertising</b> websites using little real seller verification like Craigslist, Gumtree, and JunkMail. The pet may either be advertised as being for-sale or up for adoption. Typically the pet is advertised on online advertising pages complete with photographs taken from various sources such as real advertisements, blogs or where ever an image can be stolen. Upon the potential victim contacting the scammer, the scammer responds by asking for details pertaining to the potential victim's circumstances and location under the pretense of ensuring that the pet would have a suitable home. By determining the location of the victim, the scammer ensures he is far enough from the victim so as to not allow the buyer to physically view the pet. Should the scammer be questioned, as the advertisement claimed a location initially, the scammer will claim work circumstances having forced him to relocate. This forces a situation whereby all communication is either via email, telephone (normally untraceable numbers) and SMS. Upon the victim deciding to adopt or purchase the pet, a courier has to be used which is in reality part of the scam. If this is for an adopted pet, typically the victim is expected to pay some fee such as insurance, food or shipping. Payment is via MoneyGram, Western Union or money mules' bank accounts where other victims have been duped into work from home scams.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{because of the}} investigator’s concern {{about the lack of}} information in the area of consumer fraud and the recent development individualized learning systems. The study examined the knowledge of 59 college home economics women students attending the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and 76 home extension club women from Dawson County, Nebraska. The study had the following purposes: (1) To examine current knowledge levels of learning in the following areas of consumer fraud of college home economics women students and home extension club women: a. false advertising and false labeling b. misrepresentation of prices c. <b>bait</b> <b>advertising</b> and switch d. something for nothing e. selling under false pretenses, (2) To examine knowledge, comprehension and application levels of learning about fraud after respondents are exposed to the individualized learning packet materials, (3) To determine if individualized learning packet produces a significant change in the knowledge, comprehension and application levels of learning concerning consumer fraud. Designing the study involved developing an examination, individualized learning packet, and background questionnaire; selecting the sample; and collecting the data. A one hundred question examination was written with fifty true-false questions and fifty multiple-choice questions. An individualized learning packet, consisting of learning objectives, media including two Changing Times magazine articles, and a self-test was developed. The background questionnaire was constructed primarily of closed-end questions to gain factual information and to serve as a guide to studying the influence affecting the respondents’ knowledge of consumer fraud.

40|$|Why {{are some}} sale items subject to limited {{availability}} while other substitute items {{are available in}} large quantities and are priced relatively high {{at the same point}} in time? Can such a retail strategy lure consumers into purchasing the more expensive item? This paper characterizes the profit-maximizing pricing and product-availability strategies for a retailer selling two substitute goods to loss-averse consumers and shows that limited-availability sales can manipulate consumers into an ex-ante unfavorable purchase. Consumers have unit demand, are interested in buying only one good, and their reference point is given by their recent rational expectations about what consumption value they would receive and what price they would pay. The seller maximizes profits by raising the consumers' reference point through a tempting discount on a good available only in limited supply (the bargain) and cashing in with a high price on the other good (the rip-off), which the consumers buy if the bargain is not available to minimize their disappointment. The seller might prefer to offer a deal on the more valuable product, using it as a bait, because consumers feel a larger loss, in terms of forgone consumption, if this item is not available. I also show that the bargain item can be a loss leader, that the seller's product line is not welfare-maximizing and that she might supply a socially wasteful product. The model suggests that the current FTC Guides Against <b>Bait</b> <b>Advertising,</b> by allowing retailers to employ limited-availability sales, could reduce consumer and social welfare. ...|$|E
