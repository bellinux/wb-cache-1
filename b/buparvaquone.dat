40|$|AbstractThe {{naphthoquinone}} <b>buparvaquone</b> {{is currently}} the only drug used against theileriosis. Here, the effects of <b>buparvaquone</b> were investigated in vitro and in an experimental mouse model for Neospora caninum infection. In 4 -day proliferation assays, <b>buparvaquone</b> efficiently inhibited N. [*]caninum tachyzoite replication (IC 50 [*]=[*] 4. 9 [*]nM; IC 100 [*]=[*] 100 [*]nM). However, {{in the long term}} tachyzoites adapted and resumed proliferation in the presence of 100 [*]nM <b>buparvaquone</b> after 20 days of cultivation. Parasiticidal activity was noted after 9 days of culture in 0. 5 [*]µM or 6 days in 1 [*]µM <b>buparvaquone.</b> TEM of N. [*]caninum infected fibroblasts treated with 1 [*]µM <b>buparvaquone</b> showed that the drug acted rather slowly, and ultrastructural changes were evident only after 3 – 5 days of treatment, including severe alterations in the parasite cytoplasm, changes in the composition of the parasitophorous vacuole matrix and a diminished integrity of the vacuole membrane. Treatment of N. [*]caninum infected mice with <b>buparvaquone</b> (100 [*]mg/kg) either by intraperitoneal injection or gavage prevented neosporosis symptoms in 4 out of 6 mice in the intraperitoneally treated group, and in 6 out of 7 mice in the group receiving oral treatment. In the corresponding controls, all 6 mice injected intraperitoneally with corn oil alone died of acute neosporosis, and 4 out of 6 mice died in the orally treated control group. Assessment of infection intensities in the treatment groups showed that, compared to the drug treated groups, the controls showed a significantly higher parasite load in the lungs while cerebral parasite load was higher in the buparvaquone-treated groups. Thus, although <b>buparvaquone</b> did not eliminate the parasites infecting the CNS, the drug represents an interesting lead with the potential to eliminate, or at least diminish, fetal infection during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{describes}} {{an outbreak of}} tropical theileriosis cases refractory to <b>buparvaquone</b> treatment, which occurred in a small-size dairy farm in Tunisia.

Ticks were fed on a calf experimentally infected with one isolate established in culture from one of the cases and the resultant infected ticks ground up to generate a supernatant infected with the potentially resistant stock. This was used to experimentally infect three calves, and the clinical observations, post-buparvaquone treatment, showed an absence of the usual effect of <b>buparvaquone</b> treatment on the parasite Theileria annulata, such as the rapid decline of schizont index and parasitaemia and a rapid recovery from the disease.

40|$|International audienceAbstractThe three anti-malarial drugs artemiside, artemisone, and mefloquine, and the {{naphthoquinone}} <b>buparvaquone</b> {{known to}} be active against theileriosis in cattle and Leishmania infections in rodents, were assessed for activity against Neospora caninum infection. All four compounds inhibited the proliferation of N. caninum tachyzoites in vitro with IC 50 in the sub-micromolar range, but artemisone and <b>buparvaquone</b> were most effective (IC 50  =  3 and 4. 9  nM, respectively). However, in a neosporosis mouse model for cerebral infection comprising Balb/c mice experimentally infected with the virulent isolate Nc-Spain 7, the three anti-malarial compounds failed to exhibit any activity, since treatment did not reduce the parasite burden in brains and lungs compared to untreated controls. Thus, these compounds were not further evaluated in pregnant mice. On the other hand, <b>buparvaquone,</b> shown earlier {{to be effective in}} reducing the parasite load in the lungs in an acute neosporosis disease model, was further assessed in the pregnant mouse model. <b>Buparvaquone</b> efficiently inhibited vertical transmission in Balb/c mice experimentally infected at day 7 of pregnancy, reduced clinical signs in the pups, but had no effect on cerebral infection in the dams.

Based on the clinical examinations and laboratory results, 20 calves included for hemato-biochemical studies (before and after treatment) and {{divided into two groups}} (having 10 calves each). Results: The clinical examination of these calves revealed weakness, ticks infestations, high fever above 104 °F, pronounced swelling of prescapular, prefemoral, parotid lymph nodes, loss of elasticity of skin, anemia, lacrimal discharges, pulpy cornea, tachycardia, and dyspnea. There was highly significant decrease (p< 0. 01) in hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, packed cell volume and total leukocyte count, serum glucose, total protein, globulin and albumin level and highly significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase level as compared to healthy control animals in Group I and II.

40|$|Theileria species (sable) causes {{significant}} mortalities in roan (Hippotragus equinus), and to {{a lesser}} extent, sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) yearly. Treatment of the condition and an ‘infect and treat’ vaccination method using a tick-derived stabilate both rely on the availability of <b>buparvaquone,</b> a naphthoquinone with anti-theilerial activity. As <b>buparvaquone</b> is a controlled drug which is not commercially available in South Africa, a viable commercial alternative prevention or treatment method is necessary to control this disease. This study explores the effectiveness of an alternative vaccination method using Theileria sp. (sable) infected in vitro cultured leukoblasts. A Theileria sp. (sable) containing cell line was initiated from lymph node biopsy material of an infected roan antelope and the parasite was successfully propagated in vitro. Attenuation {{is believed to have been}} achieved by 16 cycles of passage. Real time PCR suggests that the parasite was successfully transmitted via subcutaneous inoculation with this cell line to two naïve roan antelope. These two inoculated animals remained clinically unaffected by challenge with a tick stabilate used in the ‘infect and treat’ vaccination method. In contrast, the two unvaccinated control animals became clinically ill and required <b>buparvaquone</b> treatment after challenge.

40|$|Intracellular schizonts of the apicomplexans Theileria annulata and Theileria parva immortalize bovine leucocytes thereby causing fatal immunoproliferative diseases. <b>Buparvaquone,</b> a hydroxynaphthoquinone {{related to}} parvaquone, {{is the only}} drug {{available}} against Theileria. The drug is only effective {{at the onset of}} infection and emerging resistance underlines the need for identifying alternative compounds. Current drug assays employ monitoring of proliferation of infected cells, with apoptosis of the infected host cell as a read-out, but it is often unclear whether active compounds directly impair the viability of the parasite or primarily induce host cell death. We here report on the development of a quantitative reverse transcriptase real time PCR method based on two Theileria genes, tasp and tap 104, which are both expressed in schizonts. Upon in vitro treatment of T. annulata infected bovine monocytes with <b>buparvaquone,</b> TaSP and Tap 104 mRNA expression levels significantly decreased in relation to host cell actin already within 4  h of drug exposure, while significant differences in host cell proliferation were detectable only after 48 - 72  h.

Expression of TaSP and Tap 104 proteins showed a marked decrease only after 24  h. Therefore, the analysis of expression levels of mRNA coding for TaSP and Tap 104 allows to directly measuring impairment of parasite viability.

With the exception of the animals in group IV, that served as a control group all the others were infected with Theileria parva sporozoites. On {{the second day of the}} febrile reaction, the steers in groups I and II were treated with dexamethasone (0. 1 mg/kg) and promethazine (1 mg/kg), respectively. Group III steers served as the infected untreated controls. On the fifth day of the febrile reaction the animals in groups I, II and III were infused intravenously with tattoo ink suspension and 1 h later sacrificed for post-mortem examination and tissue sampling. The clinical picture indicated that both drugs significantly mitigated dyspnoea and the post mortem examination revealed a significant reduction in morphological changes. Tattoo ink particle count reflected a significant (P < 0. 01) reduction in vascular leakage in the treated animals, with promethazine being significantly (P < 0. 05) more effective than dexamethasone in this respect. In the second experiment, 18 steers were infected with T. parva sporozoites, and then were randomly allotted into three groups each of which contained six animals.

Therefor the drug was composed with additives generally used for inhalation and the feature when nebulising the nanosuspension. To determine the increase of the dissolution velocity and increase of saturation solubility of nanosuspensions versus microsuspensions in general budesonid nano- and micorsuspensions were investigated on these features. They have been investigated after different time points of storage. Budesonid was also taken to investigate the impact of different homogenisation pressure applied to the suspension and the achieved particle size due to different pressures. Not only different homogenization pressures had been applied but also various models of high pressure homogenisers have been applied. <b>Buparvaquone</b> is a naphtoquinone, that is an effective treatment against the pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum. It is applied orally, and for this application created as nanosuspension. <b>Buparvaquone</b> was created as nanosuspension incorporated into hydrogels to further increase the mucoadhesive properties of the drug. The particle size and physical long-term stability of nanosuspensions and the nanosuspension-hydrogel systems were investigated. Also the surface charge was determined by zeta potential analysis. The increase of the efficacy by creating buparvaquon as nanosuspension and further improvement by incorporation of the nanosuspenions into hydrogel systems was shown in this study...|$|E
40|$|Naphthoquinones {{are common}} {{compounds}} found in {{several species of}} Bignoniaceae and exhibit anti plasmodial activity hence providing leads for discovery and development of anti theilerial drugs. This study has established the presence of naphthoquinones in the leaf, stem bark and root bark of S. kunthianum for both the hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts and established the anti theilerial activity of the lipophilic root bark extract. Sixteen unknown naphthoquinones in both the lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts of the leaf; stem bark and root bark of S. kunthianum were screened by Thin layer chromatographic technique. The lipophilic root bark extract of S. kunthianum caused death of macroschizonts of T. parva with 18 % mean percentage activity at a start experimental dose of 1 µg/L. The mean percentage activity against macroschizonts of T. parva increased with increase in the concentration of the lipophilic root bark extract of S. kunthianum.

40|$|A {{method for}} the rapid {{screening}} of drugs targeting the bioenergetic metabolism of Leishmania spp. was developed. The system {{is based on}} the monitoring of changes in the intracellular ATP levels of Leishmania donovani promastigotes that occur in vivo, as assessed by the luminescence produced by parasites transfected with a cytoplasmic form of Phothinus pyralis luciferase and incubated with free-membrane permeable D-luciferin analogue D-luciferin-[1 -(4, 5 -dimethoxy- 2 -nitrophenyl) ethyl ester]. A significant correlation was obtained between the rapid inhibition of luminescence with parasite proliferation and the dissipation of changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) produced by <b>buparvaquone</b> or plumbagin, two leishmanicidal inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. To further validate this test, a screen of 14 standard leishmanicidal drugs, using a 50 μM cutoff, was carried out. Despite its semiquantitative properties and restriction to the promastigote stage, this test compares favorably with other bioenergetic parameters with respect to time and cell number requirements for the screening of drugs that affect mitochondrial activity.

40|$|As {{the part}} of a study to develop <b>buparvaquone</b> (BPQ) {{formulations}} for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, the topical delivery of BPQ and one of its prodrugs from a range of formulations was evaluated. In previous studies, BPQ and its prodrugs were shown to be potent antileishmanials in-vitro, with ED 50 values in the nanomolar range. 3 -Phosphono-oxymethyl-buparvaquone (3 -POM-BPQ) was the most potent antileishmanial and was chosen, together with the parent drug, for further investigation. The ability of the parent and prodrug formulations to cross human and murine skin was tested in-vitro using the Franz diffusion cells. Formulations intended for topical application containing either BPQ or 3 -POM-BPQ were developed using excipients that were either acceptable for topical use (GRAS or FDA inactive ingredients) or currently going through the regulatory process. BPQ was shown to penetrate both human epidermal membranes and full thickness BALB/c skin from a range of formulations (gels, emulsions). Similarly, 3 -POM-BPQ penetrated full-thickness BALB/c skin from several gel formulations. In-vitro binding studies showed that BPQ bound melanin in a dose-dependent manner and preferably bound to delipidized skin over untreated BALB/c skin (on a weight to weight basis). The results confirm that BPQ and its prodrug 3 -POM-BPQ can penetrate the skin from several formulations, making them potentially interesting candidates for further investigation of topical formulations using in-vivo models of cutaneous leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Buparvaquone</b> (BPQ), a {{veterinary}} drug, was formulated as nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for leishmaniases treatment. The formulation design addressed poor {{water solubility}} of BPQ {{and lack of}} human drug delivery system. The DSC/TG and microscopy methods were used for solid lipids screening. Softisan® 154 showed highest BPQ solubility in both methods. The BPQ solubility in liquid lipids using HPLC revealed Miglyol® 812 as the best option. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to identify the optimal Softisan 154 [*]:[*]Miglyol 812 ratios (7 [*]:[*] 10 to 2 [*]:[*] 1) and Kolliphor® P 188 and Tween® 80 concentration (> 3. 0 % w/w) aiming for z-average {{in the range of}} 100 – 300 [*]nm for macrophage delivery. The NLC obtained by high-pressure homogenization showed low z-averages (< 350 [*]nm), polydispersity (< 0. 3), and encapsulation efficiency close to 100 %. DSC/TG and microscopy in combination proved to be a powerful tool to select the solid lipid. The relationship among the variables, demonstrated by a linear mathematical model using RSM, allowed generating a design space. This design space showed the limits in which changes in the variables influenced the z-average. Therefore, these drug delivery systems have the potential to improve the availability of affordable medicines due to the low cost of raw materials, using well established, reliable, and feasible scale-up technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunistic}} pathogen Pneumocystis {{causes a}} type of pneumonia in individuals with defective immune systems such as AIDS patients. Atovaquone, an analog of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q [CoQ]), is effective in clearing mild to moderate cases of the infection. Rat-derived Pneumocystis carinii was the first organism in which CoQ synthesis was clearly demonstrated to occur in both mitochondrial and microsomal subcellular fractions. Atovaquone inhibits microsomal CoQ synthesis with no effect on mitochondrial CoQ synthesis. We here report on additional studies evaluating CoQ synthesis and its regulation in the organism. <b>Buparvaquone</b> also inhibited CoQ synthesis and it reduced the synthesis of all four CoQ homologs in the microsomal but not the mitochondrial fraction. Glyphosate, which inhibits a reaction in the de novo synthesis of the benzoquinone moiety of CoQ reduced cellular ATP levels. Bacterial and plant quinones, and several chemically synthesized phenolics, flavanoids, and naphthoquinones that inhibit electron transport in other organisms were shown to reduce CoQ synthesis in P. carinii. The inhibitory action of naphthoquinone compounds appeared to depend on their molecular size and structural flexibility rather than redox potential. Results of experiments examining the synthesis of the polyprenyl chain of CoQ were consistent with negative feedback control of CoQ synthesis. These studies on P. carinii suggest that cellular sites and the control of CoQ synthesis in different organisms and cell types might be more diverse than previously thought...|$|E
