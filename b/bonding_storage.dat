Kirkham@inl. gov Abstract. The Radioisotope Power Systems Program of the Idaho National Laboratory {{makes an}} {{empirical}} {{case for a}} highly integrated Quality Assurance function pertaining to the preparation, assembly, testing, storage and transportation of 238 Pu fueled radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Case data represents multiple campaigns including the Pluto/New Horizons mission, the Mars Science Laboratory mission in progress, and other related projects. Traditional Quality Assurance models would attempt to reduce cost by minimizing the role of dedicated Quality Assurance personnel in favor of either functional tasking or peer-based implementations. Highly integrated Quality Assurance adds value by placing trained quality inspectors on the production floor side-by-side with nuclear facility operators to enhance team dynamics, reduce inspection wait time, and provide for immediate, independent feedback. Value is also added by maintaining dedicated Quality Engineers to provide for rapid identification and resolution of corrective action, enhanced and expedited supply chain interfaces, improved <b>bonded</b> <b>storage</b> capabilities, and technical resources for requirements management including data package development and Certificates of Inspection. A broad examination of cost-benefit indicates highly integrated Quality Assurance can reduce cost through the mitigation of risk and reducing administrative burden thereby allowing engineers to be engineers, nuclear operators to be nuclear operators, and the cross-functional team to operate more efficiently. Applicability of this case extends to any high-value, long-term project where traceability and accountability are determining factors...|$|R

40|$|Bond graphs are a {{powerful}} formalism for modeling the continuous dynamics of physical systems. To model fast continuous changes as discontinuities, hybrid bond graphs introduce an ideal switching element, the controlled junction, that may inhibit power transfer by enforcing its common variable to be zero. When <b>bond</b> graph <b>storage</b> components become dependent upon one another {{because of a}} discrete state change, their stored value may change discontinuously. Consistent values are computed by conserving the physical state variable (e. g., momentum, mass). One discrete state change may cause a number of further discrete state changes without a ecting the state vector. When no further changes occur, the state vector is updated and this again may cause a new sequence of discrete state changes. These consecutive discrete state changes can be classi ed based on parameter abstraction and time scale abstraction.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} whether {{eliminating the}} stock of government debt outstanding would reduce welfare. It models an economy with three assets—currency, government <b>bonds,</b> and <b>storage,</b> a transactions role for money, and a demand for liquidity and thus a role for banks. The Friedman rule is not optimal in this economy, so there is potentially a role for interest-bearing, risk-free government bonds. Because the government must raise enough revenue to meet its interest obligations on any bonds outstanding, the social value of government debt hinges on whether the benefits from greater portfolio diversification outweigh {{the costs associated with}} the necessary revenue-raising efforts. The paper shows that a positive stock of government debt is optimal only if interest payments on the debt are financed via money creation, agents are not too risk averse, there is a primary government budget deficit, and the economy is operating on the bad side of the Laffer curve. But under these conditions, welfare would be even higher if monetary policy were conducted to put the economy on the good side of the Laffer curve and there were no government bonds outstanding. Thus, there is little support for keeping a stock of interest-bearing, risk-free government debt outstanding. Fiscal policy; Monetary policy; Debts, Public...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{durability}} of four adhesive systems by assessing their microtensile bond strength (MTBS) and microleakage during six months of water storage. Materials and Methods: A total of 128 human third molars were used. The adhesives tested were Scotch Bond Multipurpose (SBMP), Single Bond (SB), Clearfil-SE bond (CSEB), and All-Bond SE (ABSE). After sample preparation for MTBS testing, the microspecimens were subjected to microtensile tester after one day and six months of water storage. For microleakage evaluation, facial and lingual class V cavities were prepared and restored with composite. After thermocycling, microleakage was evaluated. Bond strength values were subjected to one-way ANOVA and Tamhane’s test, and the microleakage data were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn, Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon tests (P< 0. 05). Results: Single Bond yielded the highest and ABSE yielded the lowest bond strength at one day and six months. Short-term bond strength of SBMP and CSEB was similar. After six months, {{a significant decrease in}} bond strength was observed in ABSE and SBMP groups. At one day, ABSE showed the highest microleakage at the occlusal margin; however, at the gingival margin, {{there was no significant difference}} among groups.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the hydration condition of the tooth during <b>bonding</b> or <b>storage</b> may affect the bond strength of a single-step, self-etching adhesive to dentin. Materials and Methods: Twelve extracted human third molars were transversally sectioned to expose flat, mid-dentin surfaces. Six teeth were dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations for several days while 6 teeth were kept hydrated in distilled water. The teeth were bonded with the single-step, self-etching adhesive One-Up Bond F (Tokuyama, Japan) according to directions. Resin composite buildups were constructed incrementally with Z 250 (3 M ESPE). The bonded hydrated and dehydrated teeth were then divided into 2 subgroups and stored either in distilled water or in a dry condition for 24 h before being prepared for the microtensile bond strength test. Bonded beams of approximately 0. 8 mm(2) were tested in tension at 0. 5 mm/min in a testing machine. Separate dentin disks were bonded with the adhesive and prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Bond strengths of specimens stored in water were: 25. 0 +/- 10. 6 and 18. 9 +/- 9. 1 MPa for hydrated and dehydrated teeth, respectively. Bond strengths of specimens stored dry were significantly higher (p 0. 05). However, <b>storage</b> of the <b>bonded</b> teeth in water caused significant reductions in the bond strength, regardless of the previous hydration condition of the teeth.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of resin cement thickness on the bond strength of prefabricated and customized glass fiber posts after storage in distilled water. Thirty human uniradicular roots were treated endodontically. The roots were divided into 3 groups: THIN (thin cement layer) - post space preparation with # 0. 5 drill and cementation of # 0. 5 post; THICK (thick cement layer) - post space preparation with # 1 drill and cementation of # 0. 5 post; and CUSTOM (customized cement layer) - post space preparation with # 1 drill and cementation of a customized post (# 0. 5 glass fiber posts customized with resin composite). All posts were luted with self-adhesive resin cement. The push-out test was carried out after storage for 24 h and 90 days in distilled water at 37 °C. The data were analyzed with three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (a= 0. 05). Bond strengths were significantly higher for CUSTOM (9. 37 MPa), than for THIN (7. 85 MPa) and THICK (7. 07 MPa), which were statistically similar. Considering the thirds, the bond strength varied in the sequence: apical (7. 13 MPa) < middle (8. 22 MPa) = coronal (8. 94 MPa). Bond strength for 24 h storage was significantly higher (8. 80 MPa) than for 90 -day storage (7. 40 MPa). It may be concluded that the thickness of resin cement influenced the bond strength of glass fiber posts. The customized posts presented higher <b>bond</b> strength. <b>Storage</b> in water for 90 days affected negatively the values of bond strength, especially for thick cement layers in the apical third...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of various heated air and microwave oven treatments on seed extraction efficiency and subsequent seed quality in Pinus radiata. Radiata pine cones were collected from Fox ton from a commercial plantation and used in preliminary studies considering a range of both heated air and microwave oven treatments. Cones of different genetic families were collected from an open pollinated seed orchard owned by Carter Holt Harvey Forests at Matakana Island. In the air oven extraction method temperature and duration combinations of 50 °C and 24 hours or 60 °C and 1 2 hours {{were found to be}} most suitable for seed extraction while giving good seed quality in preliminary experiments. A temperature of 40 °C was found to be too low for efficient seed extraction while 70 °C was found to be lethal to seeds. Various temperature and duration combinations gave similar results since a decrease in extraction temperature could, in some cases, be compensated by an increase in the extraction period. Exposure of cones in a microwave oven affected germination, particularly when only 1 or 2 cones were heated at each exposure time. However when 3 - 5 cone samples were used heating for 30 or 40 seconds was sufficient to break scale resin <b>bonding.</b> Ambient <b>storage</b> of treated cones for up to 7 days following microwave oven treatment allowed full scale reflexing and high seed extraction efficiency. Cones from 1 0 diff erent families showed variable germination responses to different seed extraction conditions.

Whether this reflects genetic differences in cone serotiny, seed thermosensitivity differences, cone wood density, resin bond strength, or is related to seed size and/or moisture content is not known.

Three adhesive systems were used in the study: a two-step self-etch adhesive for use with a silorane-based resin composite (Filtek P 90 adhesive system - P 90), a two-step self-etch adhesive (Clearfil SE Bond - CSE) and a one-step self-etch adhesive (Adper Easy One - AEO). The bond strength of these products was evaluated by bonding resin composite (Filtek Z 350 for CSE and AEO; and Filtek P 90 for P 90) to 90 bovine dentin tooth fragments, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

40|$|A surface heater was {{developed}} using a graphite fiber-epoxy composite as the heating element. This heater can be thin, highly electrically and thermally conductive, and can conform to an irregular surface. Therefore {{it may be}} used in an aircraft's thermal deicing system to quickly and uniformly heat the aircraft surface. One-ply of unidirectional graphite fiber-epoxy composite was laminated between two plies of fiber glass-epoxy composite, with nickel foil contacting the end portions of the composite and partly exposed beyond the composites for electrical contact. The model heater used brominated P- 100 fibers from Amoco. The fiber's electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and density were 50 micro ohms per centimenter, 270 W/m-K and 2. 30 gm/cubic cm, respectively. The electricity was found to penetrate through the composite in the transverse direction to make an acceptably low foil-composite contact resistance. When conducting current, the heater temperature increase reached 50 percent of the steady state value within 20 sec. There was no overheating at the ends of the heater provided there was no water corrosion. If the foil-composite <b>bonding</b> failed during <b>storage,</b> liquid water exposure was found to oxidize the foil.

40|$|Whey {{protein is}} a {{particularly}} well-studied and promising raw material to enhance functionality of packaging materials. However, in recent studies {{it was observed that}} several properties of whey protein isolate-based film change within the first weeks after film production. This indicates that certain intrinsic material changes take place during storage time. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} explore a time-dependent structure–property relationship of WPI-based coatings. In order to answer this question, time-dependent oxygen permeability measurements, and in addition solubility studies with different defined buffer systems combined with a Bradford assay were performed to determine intermolecular interactions in the film. The measurements clearly showed that oxygen permeability decreased by up to 85 % within 2 – 3 weeks after film production. The solubility tests confirmed that this decrease in oxygen permeability was accompanied and thus caused by different changes in covalent and non-covalent bonds between the polypeptide chains during storage. Based on the results of the solubility measurements it can be assumed that the cross-linking by disulphide bonds as well as hydrogen bonds is the predominant interaction formed during the first days of storage leading to a fast decrease in oxygen permeability while the importance of hydrogen bonds in relation to disulphide <b>bonds</b> increases during <b>storage</b> time leading to a further—but slower—decrease in oxygen permeability...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mutations of {{cysteine}} residues in von Willebrand factor {{are known}} to reduce the storage and secretion of this factor, thus leading to reduced antigen levels. However, one cysteine mutation, p. Cys 2773 Ser, {{has been found in}} patients with type 2 A(IID) von Willebrand's disease who have normal plasma levels of von Willebrand factor. We hypothesize that disruption of either intra- or interchain disulfide bonds by cysteine mutations in von Willebrand factor has different effects on the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of specific cysteine mutations that either disrupt intrachain (p. Cys 1130 Phe and p. Cys 2671 Tyr) or interchain (p. Cys 2773 Ser) disulfide <b>bonds</b> on <b>storage</b> and secretion of von Willebrand factor was studied by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney cell line 293. Upon expression of von Willebrand factor these cells formed endothelial Weibel-Palade body-like organelles called pseudo-Weibel-Palade bodies. Storage of von Willebrand factor was analyzed with both confocal immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Regulated secretion of von Willebrand factor was induced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. RESULTS: p. Cys 1130 Phe and p. Cys 2671 Tyr reduced the storage of von Willebrand factor into pseudo-Weibel-Palade bodies with notable retention of von Willebrand factor in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas p. Cys 2773 Ser-von Willebrand factor was stored normally. As expected, wild-type von Willebrand factor formed proteinaceous tubules that were seen under electron microscopy as longitudinal striations in pseudo-Weibel-Palade bodies. p. Cys 2773 Ser caused severe defects in von Willebrand factor multimerization but the factor formed normal tubules. Furthermore, the basal and regulated secretion of von Willebrand factor was drastically impaired by p. Cys 1130 Phe and p. Cys 2671 Tyr, but not by p. Cys 2773 Ser. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that natural mutations of cysteines involved in the formation of interchain disulfide bonds do not affect either the storage in Weibel-Palade bodies or secretion of von Willebrand factor, whereas mutations of cysteines forming intrachain disulfide bonds lead to reduced von Willebrand factor storage and secretion because the von Willebrand factor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} bonding {{effectiveness of}} a new experimental composite cement to dentin in terms of microtensile bond strength (μTBS) after 1 week (‘immediate’) and 6 month (‘aged’) artificial aging. Flat ground dentin of 32 human molars was prepared using 600 -grit SiC paper. Selfmade composite blocks (Clearfil AP-X,Kuraray Noritake) were bonded to flat dentin surfaces using 4 composite cements: Exp. HPC 100 (Kuraray Noritake), Multilink (Ivoclar Vivadent), RelyX Unicem 2 and RelyX Ultimate (both 3 M). The composite cements were not lightcured but solely allowed to selfcure. The μTBS was measured using a LRX testing device (LRX, Lloyd) after 1 week and 6 month water <b>storage.</b> <b>Bond</b> strength data were analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a posthoc Nemenyi multiple comparisons analysis (p< 0. 05). The failure mode of representative fractured specimens was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The significantly highest μTBS was measured for the exp. HPC 100 composite cement, both after 1 week and 6 -month water storage. No difference in μTBS was found between RelyX Unicem and RelyX Ultimate for both storage periods. The ‘immediate’ and ‘aged’ μTBS was lowest for Multilink. As compared to the commercially available composite cements tested, the bonding effectiveness to dentin of the new exp. HPC 100 composite cement, being the experimental precursor of Panavia V 5 that was recently launched by Kuraray Noritake, was significantly higher and appeared resistant against 6 -month water storage aging, this when all composite cements were solely selfcured. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} bond {{strength}} and the morphology of enamel after application of self-etching adhesive systems with different acidities. The tested hypothesis was that {{the performance of the}} self-etching adhesive systems does not vary for the studied parameters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Composite resin (Filtek Z 250) buildups were bonded to untreated (prophylaxis) and treated (bur-cut or SiC-paper) enamel surfaces of third molars after application of four self-etching and two etch-and-rinse adhesive systems (n= 6 /condition) : Clearfil SE Bond (CSE); OptiBond Solo Plus Self-Etch (OP); AdheSe (AD); Tyrian Self Priming Etching (TY), Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus (SBMP) and Adper Single <b>Bond</b> (SB). After <b>storage</b> in water (24 h/ 37 °C), the bonded specimens were sectioned into sticks with 0. 8 mm² cross-sectional area and the microtensile bond strength was tested at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The mean bond strength values (MPa) were subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). The etching patterns of the adhesive systems were also observed with a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: The main factor adhesive system was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). The mean bond strength values (MPa) and standard deviations were: CSE (20. 5 ± 3. 5), OP (11. 3 ± 2. 3), AD (11. 2 ± 2. 8), TY (11. 1 ± 3. 0), SBMP (21. 9 ± 4. 0) and SB (24. 9 ± 3. 0). Different etching patterns were observed for the self-etching primers depending on the enamel treatment and the pH of the adhesive system. CONCLUSION: Although there is a tendency towards using adhesive systems with simplified application procedures, this may compromise the bonding performance of some systems to enamel, even when the prismless enamel is removed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} (1) the dentin {{bond strength}} of fluoridated restorative systems following aging and (2) the enamel/dentin microhardness around restorations after a pH-cycling regimen. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four human third molars and four restorative systems were used. A resin-modified glass ionomer (GC Fuji II LC) {{was used as}} a fluoride-containing material in the positive control group, while Adper Easy Bond adhesive and Filtek Z 350 XT composite resin, which are not fluoridated, were used together in the negative control group. Beautifil II composite resin and FL-Bond II adhesive, both fluoride-containing materials, were compared to Bond Force and Estelite Sigma Quick restorative system, which only contain fluoride in the adhesive. For dentin bond strengths, specimens of each material were fabricated for two test groups (n = 8) : group 1 : tested after 24 h; group 2 : tested after 1 year of storage in artificial saliva. Both groups were tested using a microtensile method. For the cross-sectional microhardness test, standardized Class V cavities were prepared and filled with the different restorative systems. After experiencing repeated thermocycling and being subjected to pH-cycling, the teeth were sectioned. The microhardness was measured in enamel and dentin at 50 mu m from the cavity wall and at six depths in relation to the surface subjected to pH cycling. Results: None of the restorative systems showed decreased <b>bond</b> strength after <b>storage</b> for one year in artificial saliva. No significant differences in microhardness were observed among the restorative materials on enamel and dentin. Conclusion: All the restorative systems evaluated presented stable bond strength after one year of storage. The pH cycling caused a reduction in the superficial enamel microhardness close to the cavity wall. In dentin, the demineralization affected the superficial and sub-surface areas...|$|R
40|$|Background]The major wheat seed {{proteins}} are storage {{proteins that}} are synthesized {{in the rough}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of starchy endosperm cells. Many of these proteins have intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. In eukaryotes, the formation of most intramolecular disulfide bonds in the ER {{is thought to be}} catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family proteins. The cDNAs that encode eight groups of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) PDI family proteins have been cloned, and their expression levels in developing wheat grains have been determined. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to characterize the enzymatic properties of the wheat PDI family proteins and clarify their expression patterns in wheat caryopses. [Results]PDI family cDNAs, which are categorized into group I (TaPDIL 1 Aα, TaPDIL 1 Aβ, TaPDIL 1 Aγ, TaPDIL 1 Aδ, and TaPDIL 1 B), group II (TaPDIL 2), group III (TaPDIL 3 A), group IV (TaPDIL 4 D), and group V (TaPDIL 5 A), were cloned. The expression levels of recombinant TaPDIL 1 Aα, TaPDIL 1 B, TaPDIL 2, TaPDIL 3 A, TaPDIL 4 D, and TaPDIL 5 A in Escherichia coli were established from the cloned cDNAs. All recombinant proteins were expressed in soluble forms and purified. Aside from TaPDIL 3 A, the recombinant proteins exhibited oxidative refolding activity on reduced and denatured ribonuclease A. Five groups of PDI family proteins were distributed throughout wheat caryopses, and expression levels of these proteins were higher during grain filling than in the late stage of maturing. Localization of these proteins in the ER was confirmed by fluorescent immunostaining of the immature caryopses. In mature grains, the five groups of PDI family proteins remained in the aleurone cells and the protein matrix of the starchy endosperm. [Conclusions]High expression of PDI family proteins during grain filling in the starchy endosperm suggest that these proteins play an important role in forming intramolecular disulfide <b>bonds</b> in seed <b>storage</b> proteins. In addition, these PDI family proteins that remain in the aleurone layers of mature grains likely assist in folding newly synthesized hydrolytic enzymes during germination...|$|R
