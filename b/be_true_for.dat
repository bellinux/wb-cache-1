5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that it would also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the weak interaction, but {{it had not been}} tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
5|$|One {{study found}} that people with or without {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} form a commutative ring whose {{elements are}} the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers {{can be added}} or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements a and b in the ring, a+b = b+a. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> other rings, meaning that a combined with b might be different from b combined with a. Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer a such that 3×a=1.|$|E

5000|$|Sophists are {{considered}} the founding fathers of relativism in the Western World. Elements of relativism emerged among the Sophists in the 5th century BC. Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, [...] "Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not." [...] The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponents, Plato and Socrates. In a well known paraphrased dialogue with Socrates, Protagoras said: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> you <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> you, and what <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> me <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R

5|$|The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River {{is another}} species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, {{it does not}} {{perfectly}} fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species {{may be found in}} both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers {{may not be able to}} survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E
25|$|Mathematical {{induction}} {{is a form}} {{of direct}} proof, usually done in two steps. When trying to prove a given statement for a set of natural numbers, the first step, known as the base case, is to prove the given statement for the first natural number. The second step, known as the inductive step, is to prove that, if the statement is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> any one natural number, then it must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the next natural number as well. Having proved these two steps, the rule of inference establishes the statement to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all natural numbers. In common terminology, using the stated approach is referred to as using the Principle of mathematical induction.|$|E
50|$|In model theory, a {{transfer}} principle states that all statements of some language that <b>are</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> some structure <b>are</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> another structure. One {{of the first}} examples was the Lefschetz principle, which states that any sentence in the first-order language of fields <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the complex numbers <b>is</b> also <b>true</b> <b>for</b> any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.|$|R

25|$|The {{method of}} {{infinite}} descent {{was one of}} Pierre de Fermat's favorites. This method of proof can assume several slightly different forms. For example, it might begin by showing that if a statement is true for a natural number n it must also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> some smaller natural number m (m < n). Using mathematical induction (implicitly) with the inductive hypothesis being that the statement is false for all natural numbers {{less than or equal}} to m, one may conclude that the statement cannot <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> any natural number n.|$|E

25|$|In {{the process}} of {{describing}} this discrepancy, Bose {{for the first time}} took the position that the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution would not <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> microscopic particles, where fluctuations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle will be significant.

25|$|In {{practice}} the smallest relevant division {{may be quite}} large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut.

25|$|But {{the same}} was not {{supposed}} to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> light, since Maxwell's mathematics demanded a single universal speed for the propagation of light, based, not on local conditions, but on two measured properties, the permittivity and permeability of free space, that were assumed to be the same throughout the universe. If these numbers did change, there should be noticeable effects in the sky; stars in different directions would have different colours, for instance.|$|E

40|$|Hadwiger's {{conjecture}} {{asserts that}} any graph contains a clique minor with order {{no less than}} the chromatic number of the graph. We prove that this well-known conjecture <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all graphs if and only if it <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> squares of split graphs. Since all split graphs are chordal, this implies that Hadwiger's conjecture <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all graphs if and only if it <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> squares of chordal graphs. It is known that 2 -trees are a class of chordal graphs. We further prove that Hadwiger's conjecture <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> squares of 2 -trees. In fact, we prove the following stronger result: for any 2 -tree T, its square T^ 2 has a clique minor of order χ(T^ 2) for which each branch set is a path, where χ(T^ 2) is the chromatic number of T^ 2. As a corollary, we obtain that the same statement holds for squares of generalized 2 -trees, and so Hadwiger's conjecture <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> such squares, where a generalized 2 -tree is a graph constructed recursively by introducing a new vertex and making it adjacent to a single existing vertex or two adjacent existing vertices in each step, beginning with the complete graph of two vertices.
