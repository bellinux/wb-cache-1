25|$|A {{distinctive}} type of painting, combining {{elements of}} the portrait, history, and genre painting was the tronie. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model {{was not supposed to}} be important, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. Jan Lievens and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.|$|E
25|$|Quite soon, {{conditions}} were attached: land up to certain amount was tax-exempted {{in exchange for}} one soldier. Wealthier magnates took {{it upon themselves to}} maintain several soldiers, in order to have tax exemption for their other manors. The concept of the nature of land, if it was frälsejord, exempt from land taxes or not, evolved and was registered on tax rolls. From the 17th century onwards, non-nobles were not allowed to purchase noble land (<b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> however inherit it).|$|E
25|$|The Christian festivals of Christmas and Easter are {{national}} public holidays in Australia. Christmas, which recalls {{the birth of}} Jesus Christ, is celebrated on 25 December during the Australian summer (although on 7 January by some Eastern Orthodox)and is an important cultural festival even for many non-religious Australians. The European traditions of Christmas trees, roast dinners, carols and gift giving are all continued in Australia, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> be conducted between visits to the beach, and Santa Claus is said in song to be drawn on his sleigh by six white boomer kangaroos.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Lynagh {{and with}} David Campese in vintage form, Australia beat New Zealand 13-12 {{in the final}} of the 1988 Hong Kong Sevens. When Lynagh received the silver symbol of sevens supremacy from Hong Long bank taipan Williams Purves, the Royal Hong Kong Police bank struck up ‘Waltzing Matilda’, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have stopped the drums and trumpets after a few bars.

25|$|Allied codebreakers read much {{enciphered}} German message traffic, {{especially that}} encrypted with the Enigma machine. The Allies' Ultra programme was initially of limited value, {{as it took}} too long {{to get the information}} to the commanders in the field, and at times provided information that was less than helpful. In terms of anticipating the next move the Germans would make, reliance on Ultra sometimes backfired. Part of the reason the initial German attacks in March 1941 were so successful was that Ultra intercepts had informed Wavell that OKW had clearly directed Rommel not to take any offensive action, but to wait until he was further reinforced with the 15th Panzer Division in May. Rommel received this information, but placed more value on his own assessment of the situation. Trusting that the Germans had no intention of taking major action, the British command did not respond until it was too late. Furthermore, Rommel did not generally provide OKW or the Italian Comando Supremo details of his planned operations, for he thought the Italians too prone to leak the information. Thus on 21 January 1942, when Rommel struck out on his second offensive from El Agheila, Commando Supremo was just as surprised to learn of it as the British were. Ultra intercepts provided the British with such information as the name of the new German commander, his time of arrival, and the numbers and condition of the Axis forces, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> not correctly reveal Rommel's intentions.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{consensus}} among scholars regarding the origin of sod construction on the Plains. [...] Some maintain that the inspiration came from the earth lodges of the local native peoples, including the Omahas and the Pawnees. [...] However, these earth lodges were circular in cross-section, and built upon heavy timber frameworks. [...] It has also been suggested {{that the idea of}} building with sod came from European immigrants, either Russian-Germans, who are known to have built rammed earth dwellings in the Plains, or immigrants from the British Isles, particularly from Ireland, where turf houses were built with stone foundations and frames to support the turf. [...] None of these closely resembled the unframed sod-block houses built in the Midwestern United States; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have engendered the idea of building with earth.|$|E

500|$|Various {{elemental}} {{analyses of}} diamond reveal {{a wide range}} of impurities. They mostly originate, however, from inclusions of foreign materials in diamond, which could be nanometer-small and invisible in an optical microscope. Also, virtually any element can be hammered into diamond by ion implantation. More essential are elements which can be introduced into the diamond lattice as isolated atoms (or small atomic clusters) during the diamond growth. By 2008, those elements are nitrogen, boron, hydrogen, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, cobalt and perhaps sulfur. Manganese and tungsten have been unambiguously detected in diamond, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> originate from foreign inclusions. Detection of isolated iron in diamond has later been re-interpreted in terms of micro-particles of ruby produced during the diamond synthesis. Oxygen is believed to be a major impurity in diamond, but it has not been spectroscopically identified in diamond yet. Two electron paramagnetic resonance centers (OK1 and N3) have been assigned to nitrogen–oxygen complexes. However, the assignment is indirect and the corresponding concentrations are rather low (few parts per million).N ENDOR of the OK1 centre in natural type Ib diamond | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume = 1 | issue = 51 | pages = 10549 | year = 1989 | pmc = |bibcode = 1989JPCM....110549N }} ...|$|E
2500|$|Three Pilgrimage Festivals. Sukkot and Passover {{fall on the}} 15th day {{of their}} {{respective}} months. This gave messengers two weeks to inform communities about the proclamation of the new month. Normally, they would reach most communities within the land of Israel within that time, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> fail to reach communities farther away (such as those in Babylonia or overseas). Consequently, the practice developed that these holidays be observed for one day within Israel, but for two days (both possible days as calculated from the previous month's start) outside Israel. This practice is known as yom tov sheni shel galuyot, [...] "second day of festivals in exile communities".|$|E
2500|$|Hill {{suffered}} a setback in Philadelphia, {{where he took}} his second loss of the season giving up five runs and left before getting any outs in the sixth inning. His next start in New York City produced similar results posting his third loss, and Lou Piniella pointed to control problems. The troubles continued in San Diego during his next start, where {{he picked up his}} third consecutive loss 5–1 to the Padres and gave up four home runs. Piniella extended his analysis of Hill's throwing: [...] "Not the same pitcher that left spring training. He was missing his spots. Some of those pitches that were hit out of the park, the catcher was sitting on the outside corner and the balls are inside, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> have been outside. He's got to keep working. He's not throwing as hard, either, for whatever reason." ...|$|E

The Māoris might conceivably have {{eventually}} decided to surrender unconditionally anyway, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>might</b> also have repelled further assaults and escaped across the lake." [...] He said they might have also been gaining time waiting for reinforcements who were almost on the scene. About 35 of the Māori force were killed, along with six women and children. Probably an equal number of injured were evacuated by canoe across Lake Waikare. With the capture of more than 180 warriors, the battle became the most costly Māori defeat in the Waikato wars. The 183 prisoners were held without trial on an old coal hulk in Waitematā Harbour before being moved to Kawau Island, north of Auckland, but in September 1864 they escaped and eventually made their way back to the Waikato.|$|E
