50|$|The common {{guitarfish}} can grow to {{a length of}} about 147 cm, but a more normal length is about 80 cm. The dorsal surface is khaki-brown and the underparts are white. It is very similar in appearance to the <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos cemiculus), which shares its distribution, but is generally smaller, has larger eyes, more widely separated rostral ridges, a longer front nasal lobe and a wider back nasal flap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> {{is found}} in the warm {{temperate}} and tropical waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean between about 42°N and 17°S, 19°W and 36°E. Its northerly limit is the northern coast of Portugal and its southern limit is Angola. Its range in the Mediterranean Sea it mostly concentrated in the southern and eastern parts. It lives on the continental shelf at depths down to about 100 m.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos cemiculus or {{sometimes}} Glaucostegus cemiculus) is {{a species of}} cartilaginous fish in the family Rhinobatidae. It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a bottom-dwelling fish feeding on crustaceans, other invertebrates and fish. The females give birth to live young. Its lifestyle makes it vulnerable to trawling and other fishing methods, populations seem to be declining and it is subject to intensive fishing pressure, with its fins being sold into the Asian market. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> {{is plain}} brown above and white below, {{and has a}} black blotch on its snout, more {{noticeable}} in juveniles than adult fish. It is similar in appearance to the common guitarfish (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) which is sympatric (shares the same range). Characteristic differences include the blackchin's smaller eyes, narrower rostral ridges (nearly united at the front), shorter front nasal lobe and narrower back nasal flap. Both species have short thorns present on the inner margins of the eye, on the shoulders and along the spine and tail, but these are less distinct in the blackchin. This species grows to a length of about 180 cm, although larger fish have been reported from Guinea in West Africa and the Gulf of Gabès in the southern Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> swims {{slowly over}} sandy and muddy {{stretches}} of seabed, foraging for shrimps, crabs, other crustaceans, squid and molluscs. Males reach sexual maturity at {{a length of}} about 150 cm in Senegal, and females at about 163 cm, while in Tunisia the lengths at maturity are 100 cm and 110 cm respectively. This fish is ovoviviparous, the eggs being retained in the uterus of the female and the developing young being nourished first by a yolk sac, and later by uterine secretions. Litter size varies between about four and six in Senegal, but larger litters occur in Tunisia. The gestation period is between about five and eight months, there sometimes being a diapause in the embryo's development in colder-water months in Senegal, but no diapause seems to occur in Tunisia.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> is a low-fecundity {{fish and}} mature {{individuals}} aggregate {{off the coast}} seasonally to deliver their young and mate. At this time, they are particularly vulnerable to fishing activity. This species is particularly valued for its fins which sell at a high price, but the fish are also used for food. They are caught by trawling and gillnets in artisanal fisheries and as bycatch during industrial shrimp fishing. Along with the common guitarfish, {{they used to be}} plentiful in the northern Mediterranean and around the Balearic Islands, but seem to no longer be present in these areas. Catches off the coast of Africa have declined also, but data on landings is in short supply. The International Union for Conservation of Nature is concerned about the future of this fish and has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
5000|$|The common {{guitarfish}} lives {{close to the}} coast and breeds in shallow water. This makes it vulnerable, and it is fished, primarily as bycatch, over much of its range. In the northern Mediterranean, catches used to be landed, along with the <b>blackchin</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos cemiculus), at fishing ports such as Palermo, but both fish are now no longer seen there and have probably been extirpated from the area. It is no longer {{to be seen in}} the Balearic Islands either. Off the coasts of West Africa, it is caught as bycatch by international shrimp trawling vessels, and by cephalopod fisheries trawling the seabed, as well as being caught by local artisanal gill net fishermen. Its meat may be salted and exported and its fins sold to Asia. It may be safest in the southern Mediterranean where the fishing is less intensive and it is still sometimes landed, but even there, most of the fish landed are immature. For the fish to have a long-term future and the fisheries to be sustainable, the adult fish need to be allowed to mature and breed. There is no special conservation plan for this fish and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
