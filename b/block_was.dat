5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's {{could no longer afford}} to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new <b>block</b> <b>was</b> built, opening in 1955. By 1960 the numbers of boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E
50|$|In Amsterdam, <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> {{installed}} before crosswalks, at medians and on tram and subway platforms. Both warning {{blocks and}} directional <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> installed {{according to the}} same rules as in Japan. Netherlands-specific <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> used in addition to blocks configured like those in Japan. Most directional <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> white or grey while warning <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> yellow or grey. Where directional and warning <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> used together {{the color of the}} <b>blocks</b> <b>is</b> often not uniform. Netherlands-specific blocks include some with thin recessed lines. With very little surface irregularity, such <b>blocks</b> <b>are</b> extremely difficult to detect with the feet or a white cane. Grooves carved into the pavement at subway station platforms are also difficult for people with impaired vision to recognize.|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} Chicago Fire, the <b>block</b> <b>was</b> {{home to one}} of Chicago's largest theaters. During the late 19th century, tall office {{buildings}} proliferated on the block. By 1970, the <b>block</b> <b>was</b> densely developed with 11 buildings, housing theaters, offices, a YMCA, and retailers like Stop & Shop, a grocer. On June 14, 1973, Mayor Richard J. Daley announced a broad urban renewal initiative centered on the North Loop theater district. Over the ensuing 16 years, numerous private developers, notably the Rubloff Company and JMB Realty, planned large mixed-use developments on the site, with a mall along State Street and hotels and office towers above. Property assembly was facilitated by Mayor Harold Washington's creation of the North Loop tax increment financing district in 1983, which gave the urban renewal effort a steady revenue stream and eminent domain authority.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, the {{industrialist}} Sir Joseph Bailey leased the castle, {{going on}} to purchase it outright in 1844, and established a walled kitchen garden known as Castle Gardens to the south-west of the main castle. It {{was used as a}} vicarage from 1825 onwards, including by Archdeacon William Bevan. The terraced gardens were maintained during the 19th century, with various trees planted behind the castle in the 1860s and 1870s, and a stable <b>block</b> <b>was</b> built within the grounds.|$|E

In 2012, Iran reblocked access, along with access to Google, after the controversial film Innocence of Muslims trailer was released on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices. The plan was to equip each tank with a keyphone, while a platoon commander's tank would be equipped with a telephone switch for 6 subscribers (four for the tanks in the platoon, one for communication with infantry and one for contacting headquarters). A special terminal <b>block</b> <b>was</b> mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E

5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech <b>block</b> <b>was</b> of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The Princess <b>Block,</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Edmonton architects Wilson and Herrald, who also designed Whyte Avenue’s Douglas Block, the Strathcona Fire Hall, the Strathcona Public Library, and the University of Alberta’s Rutherford House. From the beginning, {{the building was}} designed to combine commercial and residential space, and featured a full basement, small multi-use second floor apartments, and a full third floor {{in addition to the}} theatre space.|$|E

Nick Heidfeld, Nico Prost and Nelson Piquet Jr. were fourth on twelve points, and Bruno Senna, Filipe Albuquerque and Ricardo González rounded out the top five with ten points. Toyota were leading the Manufacturers' Championship with 33 points, eight ahead of their rival Porsche in second; the third-placed {{manufacturer}} Audi had scored one point. Porsche had won the preceding event, the 6 Hours of Silverstone, after the No. 7 Audi car was disqualified when {{it was discovered that}} its front skid <b>block</b> <b>was</b> worn out by more than the amount permitted in the sport's technical regulations.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson <b>Block</b> <b>was</b> put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses opened and closed in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, using it as a warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building was tied up in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by neglect, and first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Second World War, Crewe Hall {{was used}} as a {{military}} training camp, repatriation camp for Dunkirk troops and a US army camp, becoming the gun operations headquarters for the north-west region in 1942. It housed a prisoner-of-war camp for German officers from 1943. The hall was leased as offices in 1946, becoming the headquarters of Calmic Limited, who eventually employed nearly 800 people at Crewe Hall. Calmic produced hygiene and medical products on the site including tablets, creams, analgesics and antibiotic aerosols; they constructed industrial facilities adjacent to the hall including a drying and filtration plant and pharmaceutical packaging unit. After Wellcome's acquisition of Calmic in 1965, the hall served as the UK and Ireland headquarters of the Wellcome Foundation until the merger with Glaxo in 1995. Wellcome produced liquids, tablets, creams and antibiotic aerosols at the site; the hall itself was used for administration, but the stables <b>block</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt internally for use as laboratories and the industrial facilities were expanded.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were carried}} out between 1852 and 1856 {{at a cost of}} over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were {{reinforced}} with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth and linked to the old castle by covered passageways called caponiers; a defensible barrack <b>block</b> <b>was</b> built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 men, with a peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers. Fort Albert was built across the water on the Isle of Wight to provide supporting fire. The old inn was first reused as the garrison canteen and then demolished.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base <b>block</b> <b>was</b> rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
