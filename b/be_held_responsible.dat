5|$|In December 1863, Bramlette {{addressed}} the General Assembly, {{declaring that the}} state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army. January 4 of the following year, he proclaimed that rebel sympathizers would <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for all guerrilla raids in the state, and specified stiff fines and imprisonment for anyone found to be aiding the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} {{provoked a}} response from {{both sides in the}} conflict. U.S. commanders broadcast radio messages and dropped leaflets demanding the senior North Korean commanders <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for the atrocity. The North Korean commanders, concerned about the way their soldiers were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Memorials were later constructed on Hill 303 by troops at nearby Camp Carroll, to honor the victims of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Throughout June {{and into}} July 1944, {{material}} from the Vrba–Wetzler and earlier reports appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in the United States and Europe, particularly in Switzerland, prompting world leaders to appeal to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy to halt the deportations. On 7 July 1944, Horthy ordered an end to them, possibly fearing he would <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> after the war. By then 437,000 Jews had been deported, constituting almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside, but another 200,000 in Budapest were saved.|$|E

5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers {{to meet up with}} the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
50|$|Cast members <b>are</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for {{any damage}} to {{property}} that occurred within the house. For example, Brooklyn's J.D. Ordoñez was required to pay $350 after destroying a coffee table in one episode, and 2011 Las Vegas' Adam Royer <b>was</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for the $3,105 worth of damage that his drunken and disorderly behavior caused to the suite that housed that season's cast.|$|R

5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} Hess's defence was {{presented}} from 22–26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted {{responsibility for the}} many decrees he had signed, he said these matters {{were part of the}} internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When Griffith-Jones presented questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl Strölin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted the allegations that the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy by pointing out that Hitler alone had made all the important decisions. He noted that Hess could not <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.|$|E

25|$|In July, the Government {{came under}} {{mounting}} criticism of its {{handling of the}} crisis, the fact that responsibilities were spread across four departments and no single minister could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible,</b> {{and the fact that}} the Army had not been called in to assist.|$|E
25|$|Broadly, {{three main}} forces can <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> for {{transforming}} two ethnic communities into two national ones: education, British colonial practices, and insular religious teachings accompanying economic development.

25|$|The {{interim report}} of Justice Jain Commission, which oversaw the {{investigation}} into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, indicted Karunanidhi for abetting the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

25|$|Bennis (2004) {{emphasizes}} that corporate leaders must promise their followers {{that they will}} never be devalued or punished because they express dissent.

Anyone who clearly withholds a dissenting view only to obstruct the implementation later should <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>responsible.</b>|$|E
