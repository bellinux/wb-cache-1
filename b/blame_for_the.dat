5|$|A {{significant}} portion of media criticism was directed at the Pistons fans and 46% of the voters in the ESPN SportsNation poll believed that the fans were to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incident. Other commentators said that Artest and the other players involved were to blame.|$|E

5|$|The United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War later exonerated Burnside, {{and placed}} the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Union defeat at the Crater on General Meade for {{requiring}} the specially trained USCT (United States Colored Troops) men to be withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|After {{the formal}} {{surrender}} on September 2 aboard Missouri, investigations into Japanese war crimes began quickly. At {{a meeting with}} General MacArthur later in September, Emperor Hirohito offered to take <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war crimes, but his offer was rejected, and he was never tried. Legal procedures for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East were issued on January 19, 1946.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{refused to}} cast <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defeat, which he {{understood}} {{was likely to}} be final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E

5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conflict on Hitler.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the battle, a state of {{confusion}} spread through the French troops. Governor de Vaudreuil, who later wrote to his government and put the full <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French rout on the deceased Montcalm, decided to abandon Quebec and the Beauport shore, ordering all of his forces to march west and eventually join up with Bougainville, leaving the garrison in Quebec under the command of Jean-Baptiste Nicolas Roch de Ramezay.|$|E
5|$|Just as the furore {{appeared}} to have died down, in April 1952 Sydney's Daily Mirror published {{a letter from a}} reader, Jacob Raith. Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> omission. Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for libel and engaged Sydney's leading barrister, Jack Shand KC, as counsel.|$|E

5|$|Myrtle Wilson– George's wife, and Tom Buchanan's mistress. Myrtle, who {{possesses}} a fierce vitality, is desperate to find refuge from her complacent marriage, but unfortunately {{this leads to}} her tragic ending. She is accidentally killed by Gatsby's car (driven by Daisy, though Gatsby insists {{he would take the}} <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> accident).|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops could work together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most of the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of Blücher was not {{placed on}} Hipper, {{but on his}} {{superior}} Admiral von Ingenohl, who was removed from his post on 4 February. Also on the 4th, Hipper met with the Kaiser on an inspection of the fleet in Wilhelmshaven. That same day, Hipper was awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser; on the 23rd he was presented with the Friedrich August Cross, First and Second Classes, by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Three days later, Hipper was informed that his hometown had named its main street Hipperstrasse (Hipper Street).|$|E

5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt {{that if he did}} not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{believed}} that her daughter's mere presence would help calm the opposition. Accompanied by Garai and a modest following, she and Mary {{set out for}} Đakovo. However, Elizabeth had seriously misjudged the situation. On 25 July 1386, they were ambushed en route and attacked by John Horvat in Gorjani. Their small entourage failed to fight off the attackers. Garai was killed by the rebels and his head was sent to Charles's widow Margaret, while the queens were imprisoned in the bishop of Zagreb's castle of Gomnec. Elizabeth took all <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rebellion and begged the attackers to spare her daughter's life.|$|E
5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did not deserve <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E

5|$|However, {{much of the}} <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{decay and}} ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt {{has been made to}} restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were to <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fact that nothing {{had been done to}} alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the <b>blame</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction, but also said that the disaster was a natural phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|Haussmann {{was also}} <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> social {{disruption}} caused by his gigantic building projects. Thousands {{of families and}} businesses had to relocate when their buildings were demolished <b>for</b> <b>the</b> construction of the new boulevards. Haussmann was also <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dramatic increase in rents, which increased by three hundred percent during the Second Empire, while wages, except for those of construction workers, remained flat, and <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> enormous amount of speculation {{in the real estate}} market. He was also <b>blamed</b> <b>for</b> reducing <b>the</b> amount of housing available for low income families, forcing low-income Parisians to move from the center to the outer neighborhoods of the city, where rents were lower. Statistics showed that the population of the first and sixth arrondissements, where some of the most densely populated neighborhoods were located, dropped, while the population of the new 17th and 20th arrondissements, on the edges of the city, grew rapidly.|$|R
