40|$|The Fauconnier-Ladusaw {{analysis}} of negative polarity licensing (that NPIs are licensed in {{the scope of}} downward entailing operators) {{continues to be the}} benchmark theory of negative polarity. In this paper, I consider some of the moves that are needed to maintain its basic intuition in some recalcitrant arenas: negative polarity licensing by only, adversatives, superlatives, and conditionals. We will see that one has to (i) use a notion of entailment that I call Strawson Entailment, which deals with presuppositions in a particular way, and (ii) prohibit (even natural) context change during an inference. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate how to justify these constraints and to see in detail how the semantics of the problematic constructions has to work in order for these moves to successfully rescue the Fauconnier-Ladusaw analysis. I will first show the two assumptions at work in the {{analysis of}} NPI licensing by only and adversatives (building on proposals by Kadmon & Landman). I then turn to NPI licensing in the antecedent of conditionals. The standard Stalnaker-Lewis semantics for condi-tionals — ifp, q is true iff q is true in the closest p-woild(s) —might make one suspect that once one has an explanation for NPI licensing <b>by</b> <b>superlatives,</b> that would immediately deliver an explanation for NPI licensing in conditionals. But it turns out that the particular analysis that seems appropriate for NPI licensing <b>by</b> <b>superlatives</b> cannot plausibly carry over to conditionals. Instead, one does better by appealing to an alternative analysis of conditionals, one that I have elsewhere argued for on independent grounds. I BASICS Negative polarity items (NPIs) are expressions that can prototypically occur in the semantic scope of negation but not in 'positive ' environments. Two examples are arty and ever. (1) a. I don't think we have any potatoes. # 1 think we have any. potatoes, b. I don't think there will ever be another Aristotle. # 1 think there will ever be another Aristotle. Since NPIs occur not just in the scope of negation but also in a variety of other 'affective ' environments (the term is due to Klima 1964), one needs a theory of NPI licensing.

We examine how different types of rhetorical (de-) emphasis [...] including hedges, superlatives, and contrastive conjunctions [...] correlate with what gets revisited later, controlling for item frequency and speaker. Our data consists of transcripts of recurring meetings of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC), where important aspects of U. S. monetary policy are decided on. Surprisingly, we find that words appearing {{in the context of}} hedging, which is usually considered a way to express uncertainty, {{are more likely to be}} repeated in subsequent meetings, while strong emphasis indicated <b>by</b> <b>superlatives</b> has a slightly negative effect on word recurrence in subsequent meetings. We also observe interesting patterns in how these effects vary depending on social factors such as status and gender of the speaker. For instance, the positive effects of hedging are more pronounced for female speakers than for male speakers.

Greek and Classical Armenian agree in their use of the definite article only in NPs determined by contrastive attributes. In all other categories the systems of both languages differ. Generally, Armenian avoids the definite article with proper nouns and nouns with unique reference, while definite articles with proper names in Greek are common (with the exception of sacred or especially “respected” persons such as prophets). If the definite article is present in Greek, it is often motivated by pragmatic factors (e. g. re-topicalization, etc.).

The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.

The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.

The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.

This paper focuses on whether the BLS can improve upon the headline CPI-U’s current biennial weight update process, thereby reducing the CPI-U’s growth rate and bringing the index closer to the C-CPI-U. We begin <b>by</b> estimating <b>superlative</b> price indexes for 1999 through 2007 along with indexes based on the constant-elasticity-of-substitution demand model. Our analyses confirm that the consumer expenditure data underlying the CPI imply substantial consumer substitution, implying that the CPI-U’s Lowe index formula yields higher inflation estimates than would a true COLI. Simulating feasible weight update processes, we find that a Lowe index with two-year weight reference periods but annual updating rises by about 0. 03 percentage points less per year than the CPI-U. Another 0. 01 percentage point on average is subtracted by imposing annual revision with one-year base periods. Thus, indexes with more timely weights may offer improved representation of current price change, as well as closer approximations to a COLI.
