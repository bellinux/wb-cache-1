Rear car <b>bumper</b> system has three main components. They are the fascia, energy absorber and <b>bumper</b> beam. The fascia is the outer cover in this system. It is attaches to the quarter panels and rear end panel of the system. The energy absorber attaches to the <b>bumper</b> beam. The <b>bumper</b> beam is mounted directly to the vehicle body. These components were reviewed for differences in shape and construction prior to being assembled to the vehicles. For this project, rear <b>bumper</b> of PROTON Persona car was chosen to be benchmarking. Then, the new rear <b>bumper</b> was design by using SOLIDWORK Software in dimensional of PROTON Persona car.

The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is a {{pinball game}} {{developed}} by Jupiter, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, {{and was released}} {{in the same year}} – on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is based on Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and is a sequel to Pokémon Pinball for the Game Boy Color. In some ways, it plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping the ball in play as long as possible and hitting <b>bumpers.</b> In keeping with the theme of Pokémon, it features Pokémon collection, where while the players play pinball, they must also capture the eponymous creatures.|$|E

Real-time arrival signs debuted at Swift stations in 2013, featuring a countdown to the arrival of the next bus that is estimated using GPS units on coaches. In June 2015, the Washington State Department of Transportation removed part of the refuge island at the intersection of State Route 99 and Airport Road to create a through lane exclusively for Swift buses.|$|E

40|$|The <b>bumper</b> beam {{today is}} {{generally}} {{made of steel}} via stamping. The structural and Complexity potential of such parts is very high but investments and variable costs are significant. A process offering an economic and flexible alternative is roll forming. In this paper, a simulation {{has been done in}} order to compare between roll forming and stamping <b>bumper</b> beam. CAD softwares have been used for the simulation and analysis which are Solidwork 2005 and finite element analysis software Algor version 21. The <b>bumper</b> beams have been design in Solidwork and the Algor has been used to make stress analysis to the <b>bumper</b> beams. The static stress with linear material model has been applied to the both <b>bumper</b> beams that are from stamping and roll forming for comparison. The surface loads that have been applied to the <b>bumper</b> beams are calculated from the velocity of Gen- 2 car at 80 km/h to 120 km/h. From the analysis the maximum stress for stamping <b>bumper</b> beam is 282. 82 MPa and 243. 29 MPa for roll forming <b>bumper</b> beam. After that, the analysis about costs to produce each <b>bumper</b> beam has been done. The costs that have been considered for this thesis are costs from man, machines and materials. From the calculation the production of stamping <b>bumper</b> beam need cost about RM 26 032 400 and for the roll forming <b>bumper</b> beam just need RM 3 010 600 for the production cost. As a conclusion, from this thesis roll forming <b>bumper</b> beam has more advantages compare to stamping <b>bumper</b> beam...|$|R

5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} {{silhouette}} of a Pokémon by hitting <b>bumpers.</b> Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three times with the ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to standard Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E

On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial <b>bumpers</b> has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set.

40|$|Lower limb {{injuries}} are common result of car-to-pedestrian impacts. A reversible <b>bumper</b> system {{was developed to}} reduce the risk of such injuries. In order to improve the protective performance of the bumpersystem, it was necessary to investigate the efficiency of the <b>bumper</b> system at different impact conditions and design configurations. In this study, the protective performance of the reversible <b>bumper</b> system was assessed by finite element (FE) modeling of lower limb impacts. The FE model of a production car front was developed and validated. The FE model of the reversible <b>bumper</b> system was then developed and replaced the original <b>bumper</b> in the car front model. A human lower limb FE model was used to evaluate the protective performance of the reversible <b>bumper</b> system. The effects of the <b>bumper</b> design parameters on protective performance were investigated by using the statistical method of factorial experiment design. The injury responses of tibia acceleration, knee bending angle and shearing displacement were measured from the lowerlimbmodel. The injuries of knee ligament avulsions and long bone fractures were also obtained from impact simulations. By comparing the protective performance of the reversible <b>bumper</b> system at different impact conditions and design configurations, it was concluded that the <b>bumper</b> protective performance can be improved by reducing <b>bumper</b> stiffness; however, this performance can be impaired in the <b>bumper</b> deploying process by the speed of 2. 5 m/s or greater...|$|R
