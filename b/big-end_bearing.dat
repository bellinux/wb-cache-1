500|$|The Gresley 3-cylinder drive {{arrangement}} continued {{to bring a}} number of practical problems, the root of which was probably {{the need for the}} inside cylinder to be steeply inclined in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle; at the same time, the inside valve spindle had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion. This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a [...] "twist in the ports" [...] (the passages that carried steam {{in and out of the}} cylinders). A consequence was that the length of these passages was greater than that generally recommended, increasing [...] "dead space", and this was combined with a shorter exhaust passage. The net result would be rather different working conditions in the middle cylinder from those on the outside. A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear. Although this had been anticipated at the design stage, the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased, leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings, especially the big-end which was liable to overheat and fail. Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment, and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing.</b> Other problems persisted, such as a stiff, insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance.|$|E

50|$|In March 1922, one {{of these}} engines, no. 775 with a new Type XM2 tender, worked a special Johannesburg-Cape Town fast {{passenger}} train over the Klerksdorp-Kimberley section. The locomotive covered the 182 mi with the 320 lt t train in 5 hours 55 minutes, including 34 minutes which were lost taking water and attending to a hot-running <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing,</b> attaining an average speed of 33.75 mph. This was a creditable performance for a comparatively small locomotive with only 57 in coupled wheels and which, at the time, was not yet superheated.|$|E
5000|$|When the Zetec-SE {{first arrived}} in 1995 it {{included}} many firsts, such as a plastic inlet manifold, a [...] "ladder" [...] style main bearing and crankcase assembly, and <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> caps which are forged in one piece and subsequently split. It also incorporates powder metal connecting rods, which were quite exotic and notable at the time. The engine {{first appeared in the}} Mk4 Ford Fiesta and the virtually identical Mazda 121 in 1.25L (1242cc) capacity, with 1.4 L (1388cc), 1.6 L (1596cc) and 1.7 L (1679cc) derivatives coming later.|$|E
5000|$|The K4s quickly endeared {{themselves}} to the Scottish crews and, apart from some heavily loaded summer trains, eliminated uneconomic double-heading over the West Highland. However, as with all Gresley 2-6-0s {{it could be a}} rough ride at speed, and a locomotive designed to climb was not suited to the flat straight stretches of the line into Glasgow Queen Street railway station, or the 8.5 miles stretch alongside Loch Eil. Ride induced vibration was a problem on these stretches, and the middle <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> would require regular nut tightening, with the middle connecting rod dropping off on one occasion: this resulted in increased maintenance inspections.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 {{the engine}} was again enlarged, this time to 1779 cc, for the 1750 GTV and 1750 Berlina. Additional changes to this version {{included}} offsetting the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings</b> on the connecting rods, and adding sodium-filled exhaust valves. In 1971 a 1962 cc version was introduced for the 2000 GTV and 2000 Berlina. This largest production Twin Cam also had fewer teeth in the ring-gear and 6 bolts holding the flywheel instead of 8.|$|R
2500|$|These design {{features}} made the 2CV engine highly reliable; test engines were run {{at full speed}} for 1000 hours at a time, equivalent to driving [...] at full throttle. They also meant that the engine was [...] "sealed for life"— for example, replacing the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings</b> required specialised equipment to dismantle and reassemble the built-up crankshaft, and as this was often not available the entire crankshaft had to be replaced.

40|$|An {{existing}} {{model for}} the dynamic analysis of the piston motion in an internal combustion engine has been modified to incorporate a simpler representation of the piston-cylinder interaction, and to represent the main and <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings</b> as lubricated rather than dry journal bearings.

5000|$|Despite {{the fuel}} {{consumption}} concerns, {{in addressing the}} limitations of both the Thompson Pacifics and those of Gresley, Peppercorn had produced engines which could master virtually all the work put to them without the drawbacks of centre <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> overheat, leaking steam pipe connections, frame fractures {{or any of the}} other flaws which blighted the previous LNER Pacifics. The A1s were intended to take over from the A4s on non-stop express duties, but the low fuel consumption of the A4s meant that the A1s failed to dent their monopoly on the non-stop expresses. After post-war frame alignment and fitting of double Kylchap Chimneys, the A4s became once more the standard-bearer of the East Coast Main Line. For the second tier LNER Expresses however, the A1s proved to be an excellent design.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} changes were {{implemented}} {{in order to}} bring the bike up-to-date. This model featured a vertical engine with alloy head and higher compression. The frame was changed to a fully sprung design using a swing-arm with non-adjustable hydraulic shockers at the rear, while the front used a brand-new telescopic fork of Royal Enfield's own design. This enabled the introduction of a bench seat made of simple foam and with no large springs. Power transmission was via the same four-speed Albion gearbox as the previous model, with a unique 'neutral-finder' lever the rider could press from any gear other than first to shift to neutral. The crankshaft continued to have a fully floating <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing.</b> The headlight assembly was enclosed with the speedometer and ammeter into a nacelle, which also served as the attachment of the front suspension as well as the handlebars. An otherwise similar model, but with engine displacement of 499 cc, made its debut in 1953.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this seems}} {{impossible}} at first glance, {{the geometry of}} the engine does permit this overlap. The <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings</b> of connecting rods are wider (along the crank axis) than {{the thickness of the}} rod itself. By making the crank webs with an offset to them, it is possible to place the main bearings closer together, closely sandwiching the rod passing between them, where this is now a narrower gap than the bearing size. The main bearings are similarly confined and each main bearing can be supported by only a thin wall across the crankcase.|$|R
50|$|Launched in 1958 the Norton Jubilee {{was named}} {{in celebration of}} Norton Motorcycles' Diamond Jubilee of 60 years of {{motorcycle}} manufacture. The engine was a new design by Bert Hopwood with main and <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings</b> identical to those used on Hopwood's Norton Dominator engine ten years before. Having the smallest Norton engine, the Jubilee {{was also the first}} Norton with a unit construction engine and gearbox. The engine dimensions of 60mm x 44mm gave it a short stroke and produced only , so it required high revs to reach usable speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Thompson criticised many of Gresleys practices, but {{equivalent}} comment can be {{made about}} many of Thompsons designs. Upon taking up his post, Thompson tried to convince the LNER hierarchy {{of the need to}} rebuild the Gresley Pacific and Mikado classes. The Directors of the LNER, having witnessed a Gresley A4 take the World Speed Record for steam, were sceptical about this, so Thompson researched as many middle <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> failures on the LNER as he could find, attributing them to the design of the conjugated motion, even garnering outside opinion from the LMS. Despite roundly criticizing the Gresley motion, his Pacific rebuilds were not the best designs. They retained three cylinders, but with divided drive and 3 independent sets of Walschaerts valve gear. Thompson attached great importance to having the connecting rods equal in length, which was in fact unnecessary. As a result, the outside cylinders were placed behind the front bogie with the inside cylinder well forward. This gave the engine an unnecessarily long wheelbase, created long exhaust channels, generated vibration and encouraged flexing and fracture of the locomotive frames. All of his Pacifics were particularly prone to wheel slip owing to the high power output of the engine in relation to the adhesion factor. The engines were effective, and the design had materially less maintenance demand on the centre valve gear than the conjugated locomotives, but the positives were outweighed by the problems, which were of such significance that Thompsons engines were withdrawn and scrapped before many of their Gresley-designed forerunners. The Thompson Pacifics were ultimately more maintenance-intensive overall than the Gresley engines. Thompson omitted the [...] "banjo dome" [...] that had featured on the Gresley Pacifics since 1928. However, Thompsons successor, Arthur Peppercorn, revived the feature on the remaining batches of LNER Pacifics.|$|E

In deactivated cylinders, lower contact temperatures yield increased viscous friction. Overall, a 5 % improvement in expended fuel is expected with the application of CDA.

40|$|Although some {{clearance}} {{within the}} connections of machines is often necessary for as-sembly and mobility, excessive clearances are undesirable because they cause impacts {{and the loss}} of some kinematic precision. Impacts within the clearances of machines can lead to serious degradation of system performance. In this thesis, a methodology for detecting the clearance in the connecting rod <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> of a reciprocating machinery is presented. A reciprocating air compressor is used as a testbed. The methodology is based on extracting diagnostic signals from vibration measurements taken at a "convenient " location such as the crankshaft casing, and consists of a dy-namic simulation, source identification, diagnostic signature recovery, and diagnostic system decision-making. A dynamic simulation that accurately predicts the timing and strength of bearing impacts is presented.

40|$|Lubrication oil-flow in {{the crank}} system of an medium size diesel engine running at 750 RPM was modeled and analyzed. The model was built up by {{combining}} models from several studies in both engine lubrication systems and pipe flow modal analysis. The model is first {{used to analyze}} a system where the oil supply lines are fully open during the complete engine cycle. The result showed that these designs need a very high oil supply pressure to maintain a positive pressure in the connecting rod at all times. Having a positive pressure is important to prevent cavitation in the oil channels, and to ensure a continuous flow of cooling oil. Secondly the model was used to analyze a system where the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> tracks runs only half way around the circumference, closing the flow when the piston is in the BDC region. Such a design allowed for a lower oil supply pressure, as the channel closes when the oil is forced back. However pressure transients were amplified by the opening and closing procedure. By trimming design parameters, {{it was possible to}} reduce the severity of these transients. Various suggestions are discussed in controlling the pressure peaks that occurs...|$|E
40|$|Lubrication of the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> is re-examined under elastohydrodynamic assumptions. All current {{models were}} found to be in someway deficient, {{motivating}} {{the development of a new}} consistent schema. Uniform axial film-thickness assumptions and parabolic axial pressure profiles are combined with curved-beam and planar Finite Element housings to produce a single dimensional EHL model. Body-forces due to con-rod motion {{were found to}} be a necessary part of the elasticity implementation. The role of discretisation and surface displacement interpolation errors are investigated under steady load conditions. Under dynamic load, ring, housing and previous experimental works are compared. Increased dynamic journal action from housing distorsion was found to lead to film collapses not present in equivalent rigid bearing analyses; these collapses are likened to vapour cavitation. Correlation of dynamic film-thickness measurements with the elastic solutions are generally improved over rigid predictions. With regard to minimum film thickness, inertial 'ring' solutions gave similar values to housing solutions with and without gas loading; this facilitates non-dimensionalisation. Two separate minimum-film regime were subsequently identified: one in the con-rod neck and a second, at higher load, in the cap. The first condition sees thicker minimum films than the rigid bearing; the second, thinner films with an increased sensitivity to load. Non-dimensionalisation of this transition along with bearing flexibility and load enabled new tribological measures to be developed; the influence of elastic geometry on minimum film thickness is sufficiently well portrayed to make these useful design tools...|$|E
50|$|After {{having been}} in service for two years, however, {{experienced}} drivers of the Compound Karoo reported that, if treated and handled properly, the compound locomotive could outperform the simplex in terms of power as well as fuel and water consumption. In 1909, Beatty could report that the engine showed a coal economy of 8% {{in comparison with the}} simplex, doing the same work. One driver described how the judicious use of semi-compound mode on heavy grades, injecting high-pressure steam in the low-pressure cylinders, enhanced the locomotive’s performance, and how the life of the high-pressure <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings,</b> which initially proved troublesome, could be prolonged by mixing castor oil in with the regular oil which was used on all the bearings and the valve motion.|$|R
50|$|In the {{crankcase}} of {{a vehicle}} engine, motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft journal bearings (main <b>bearings</b> and <b>big-end</b> <b>bearings),</b> and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft. The oil collects in an oil pan, or sump, {{at the bottom of}} the crankcase. In some small engines such as lawn mower engines, dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside. In modern vehicle engines, the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries, from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the main journals and camshaft bearings operating the valves. In typical modern vehicles, oil pressure-fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the main journals of the crankshaft.|$|R

The new crankshaft had an 80 mm stroke, and with the 88 mm bore, gave a 973 cc engine, and a 5% improvement in power. The complete MHR Mille weighed 198 kg dry. The gearbox and final ratios were altered to give a better spread of ratios, so that the performance gain is {{a little better than}} the horsepower and weight figures would suggest.

This paper {{was presented at the}} 8 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress: The European Automotive Noise Conference. [URL] over-riding objective in modern engine development is fuel efficiency. This has led to a host of pursued measures, including down-sizing (a lower number of cylinders), high output power-to-weight ratio, variable valve activation or cylinder de-activation (CDA) as well as a gradual trend towards mild or micro-hybrid technology. Furthermore, The main aim is to combine a suitable combination of the aforementioned methods with various driving conditions in order to reduce thermal and frictional losses as well as meeting the ever stringent emission directives as outlined in the NEDC. Another imperative is to ensure good NVH refinement which can be adversely affected by application of the above trends, such as light weight constructions and exacerbated power torque variations with CDA. The highlighted issues affect all the load bearing conjunctions in an engine. In particular, increased load fluctuations with CDA can also affect the whirl stability of big-end bearings. Therefore, the current paper concentrates on the issues that affect the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> thermo-frictional characteristics and dynamic stability in NEDC cycle. The predictive approach, which is critical in a multi-variate problem of this kind, includes determination of regime of lubrication under fluctuating loads and rictional characteristics contributed by both elastohydrodynamics of the bearing overlay as well as boundary friction as the result of asperity interactions. Predictive results include applied dynamics, contact kinematics, frictional power loss, maximum lubricant temperature and minimum film thickness variations during the NEDC. The difference between the CDA mode and the normal mode (all active cylinders). These show that the general benefits accrued through fuel efficiency do not necessarily conform to improved big end bearing frictional efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an ElastoHydroDynamic (EHD) bearing calculation. The effect of body forces is shown to be important for highly loaded bearings in reciprocating internal combustion engines. Extension of the program to rotating machinery includes an examination of instability in the shaft bearings of a turbocharger. The development of a parameter to predict cavitation damage in a bearing is promising. Several calculation results using the program are shown. These are engine main bearing and connecting rod big-end bearings and full floating bearings for a turbocharger. The calculations on the <b>big-end</b> <b>bearing</b> if a racing engine show why the designers were having difficulty understanding the correct location for the oil feed hole position. Effects of elastic deformation, thermal deformation and manufacturing/assembly deformation all {{have a significant effect on}} the extent of the oil film. A novel calculation for a cavitation damage parameter is demonstrated successfully for a heavily loaded diesel engine bearing. The importance of body forces on the oil film due to high accelerations on certain bearings is shown to be theoretically important but not yet demonstrated. The program was written with the intention to be incorporated into the sponsoring company’s range of engine design software. A part of that development process included carrying out calculations to demonstrate to customers and present papers at conferences. The results of some of these calculations have been included in this thesis. Results of a study on the effect of crankshaft geometry on racing engine viscous friction losses were reported in a paper presented at the IDETC conference in Long Beach, 2005. This study used the first version of the software which only included Rigid Hydro Dynamics (RHD) at the time but was usable. Results of a study on stability of shaft motion in high speed turbocharger bearings were reported in a paper at the 8 th International Turbocharger conference in London, 2006. At this time the program was still only capable of RHD calculations but could now solve for multiple oil films simultaneously and sweep through the speed range. The studies on the effects of body forces and the development of a cavitation parameter will be presented in papers in the near future...|$|E
