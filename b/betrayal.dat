40|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that high self-monitors (compared to low self-monitors) would report more <b>betrayals</b> of their romantic partners. Perceptions of others 2 ̆ 7 <b>betrayals</b> should follow sex-role stereotypes (i. e., males {{are more likely to}} betray than females). Sex-role stereotyping might be attenuated when counter-stereotypical norms are made salient. One-hundred seventy five undergraduates completed the Interpersonal Behavior Survey (Roscoe et aI., 1988) and the Self-Monitoring Scale (Snyder 2 ̆ 6 Gangestad, 1986). Before doing so, participants read one of two instructional sets: females are more likely than males to betray their romantic partners; people in general are likely to betray their romantic partners. Participants responded to statements about romantic <b>betrayals</b> by a) themselves, b) typical males, and c) typical females. Compared to low self-monitors, high self-monitors reported more <b>betrayals.</b> Participants saw typical males as more likely than typical females to betray partners. This effect was attenuated by the counter-stereotypical instructional set. Three findings are noteworthy. First, likelihood to engage in romantic <b>betrayals</b> may be accounted for by individual differences in self-monitoring orientation. Second, sex-role stereotypes involving <b>betrayals</b> can apparently be counteracted to some degree simply through education. Third, self-monitoring and normative effects were largely independent...|$|R

5|$|Sierra's <b>Betrayal</b> at Krondor (1993) {{was based}} upon author Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia setting. It {{featured}} turn-based, semi-tactical combat, a skill-based experience system, and a magic system {{similar to that of}} Dungeon Master, but suffered due to outdated, polygonal graphics. Feist was heavily consulted during development, and later created his own novelization based upon the game. The sequel <b>Betrayal</b> in Antara (1997) re-used the first game's engine but—as Sierra had lost its license for Krondor—was set in a different universe. Return to Krondor (1998) used a new game engine, but returned to Feist's setting.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of <b>betrayal</b> by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the <b>betrayal</b> was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E
