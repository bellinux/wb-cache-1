5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy {{has argued}} that the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should not <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent civil wars, which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened. The East Roman or Byzantine empire on the other hand had fewer civil wars to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{news media}} and {{government}} officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. , deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well {{and that he was}} beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought.

Their relation with the mother country was generally more positive than among migrants of other European countries. It is estimated that 30% of the Polish emigrants from lands occupied by the Russian Empire returned home. The return rate for non-Jews was closer to 50–60%.

25|$|Gwelup is {{bounded by}} Lake Gwelup, the Mitchell Freeway to the east, Old Balcatta Road {{to the north}} (Reid Highway, {{accessible}} via Duffy Road, is located {{just a few hundred}} metres further north) and Karrinyup Road to the south. Due to Gwelup's swampy nature and the Lake Gwelup Reserve, considerable tracts of land remain undeveloped. Peaty soils around the lake region that have been reclaimed, now feature the highest concentrations of dissolved arsenic in the world - some 25000ug/L (some 400 times higher than that identified as safe levels for drinking water). It is well known among scientific communities that disturbance of acid sulphate soils causes the release of As, iron sulfides and other chemicals. In the previous 32 years prior to 2000, the lake was recorded to dry out twice, since that year the lake barely remained wet once over the summer in 2005/2006. The lowered water tables can <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> reduced rainfall and over consumption of regional scheme waters.|$|E

500|$|According to {{analysis}} by the political scientist John Curtice and psephologist Michael Steed, [...] "only {{a handful of the}} Conservatives' losses of seats can <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> the intervention of the Referendum Party". Their estimate was that only four seats would have been Conservative without the Referendum Party standing. For this reason, Butler and Kavanagh stated that the Referendum Party [...] "had only a limited effect on the Conservative' fortunes". On employing aggregate constituency data, Ian McAllister and Donley T. Studlar disagreed, arguing that the Referendum Party had a greater impact on the Conservatives than previous research suggested. They argued that the Referendum Party cost the Conservatives an average of 3.4% of the vote. Their analysis further suggested that there were 16 seats where the involvement of the Referendum Party directly cost the Conservative candidate their victory, and a further three where it was a contributing factor to the Conservatives' failure.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Kevin Maher of The Times {{described}} Departures as a [...] "verklempt comedy" [...] with wearisome [...] "push-button crying", {{though he}} considered it {{saved by the}} quality of the acting, [...] "stately" [...] directing, and [...] "dreamy" [...] soundtrack. Another mixed review was published in The Daily Telegraph, which described the film as a [...] "safe and emotionally generous crowd-pleaser" [...] that was not worthy of its Academy Award. Philip Kennicott wrote in The Washington Post that the film was [...] "as polished as it is heavy-handed", predictable yet ready to break taboos, immersed in death yet incapable of escaping [...] "the maddening Japanese taste for sentimentality". In Variety, Eddie Cockrell wrote that the film offered [...] "fascinating glimpses" [...] of the encoffining ceremony but should have had a much shorter run time. Paatsch gave Departures three stars out of five, describing it as a [...] "quaintly mournful flick" [...] that [...] "unfolds with a delicacy and precision that slowly captivates the viewer" [...] but considering some scenes, such as the montage, [...] "needlessly showy flourishes". Edward Porter of The Sunday Times wrote that the film's success at the Academy Awards could <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> [...] "a case of the Academy favouring bland sentimentality".|$|E
500|$|Freight {{transport}} by motor vehicles, {{commonly called}} [...] "motor transport" [...] by the Soviet authorities, {{due to the}} underdeveloped nature of the nation's road network, was of considerable significance to {{certain areas of the}} economy. In the 1980s, there were 13 million laborers employed in the transport sector. Of those, about 8.5 million were employed in motor transport. Inter-city freight transport remained underdeveloped during the whole Soviet epoch, with it constituting less than 1 percent of the motor-borne freight average. These developments can again <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> cost and administrative inefficiencies. Road transport as a whole lagged far behind that of rail transport; the average distance moved by motor transport in 1982 was , while the average for railway transport was 930km per ton and 435km per ton for water freight. In 1982 there was a threefold increase in investment since 1960 in motor freight transport, and more than a thirtyfold increase since 1940. Inter-city transport and the volume of road freight transport had also increased significantly. Motor transport was much cheaper and flexible over short distances (defined as less than 200km) than rail transport. There were many Soviet economists who argued that transferring some 100 million tons from the railways to road transport would save up to 120 million rubles. But in 1975, road transport was ...|$|E

500|$|More recent views {{present the}} {{question}} of responsibility as more nuanced and complex – suggesting that Creutz cannot be singled out as solely responsible for the disaster. Historians Ingvar Sjöblom and Lars Ericson Wolke {{have pointed out that}} Creutz's position as admiral was comparable to that of a chief minister. He would have primarily been an administrator without the need for intimate knowledge of practical details; turning a ship in rough weather would have been the responsibility of his subordinates. Sjöblom has stressed that the disagreement between Major Ankarfjäll and Lieutenant Admiral Björnram on how much sail was needed wasted precious time in a situation where quick decisions were crucial. Creutz was also unique as a supreme commander of the navy since he had no experience of military matters. The Swedish naval officer corps in the late 17th century lacked the prestige of army commanders, and seasoned officers and even admirals could be outranked by inexperienced civilians or army commanders with little or no naval background. Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has suggested that Creutz's [...] "choleric and willful temperament" [...] probably played a part, but that it could equally <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> an untrained and inexperienced crew and the open discord among the officers. According to Sjöblom it is still unclear to historians whether there was a designated ship commander on Kronan with overall responsibility.|$|E
500|$|The Man-Eating Myth was {{reviewed}} by Ivan Brady for the American Anthropologist journal. He {{noted that the}} framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even {{if it could be}} deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an [...] "unsophisticated" [...] version of positivism and naturalism, an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a critical eye over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only [...] "direct observation" [...] will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept anything short of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes that there are other activities in the world that surely go on [...] such as masturbation in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces [...] but that these would be hidden by a veil of secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a straw man argument by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is [...] "indeterminate", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as [...] "reckless" [...] in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can <b>be</b> <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> poor observation standards.|$|E
