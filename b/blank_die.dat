40|$|Coil design {{influences}} {{the distribution of}} electromagnetic forces applied to both the blank and the coil. The required energy of the process is usually defined by deformation of the blank. However, the discharge also results in {{a significant amount of}} heat being generated and accumulating in the coil. Therefore, EMF process design involves working with three different problems: 1) propagation of an electromagnetic field through the coil-blank system and generation of pulsed electromagnetic pressure in specified areas, 2) high-rate deformation of the blank, and 3) heat accumulation and transfer through the coil with the cooling system. In the current work, propagation of an electromagnetic field in the coil, <b>blank,</b> <b>die</b> and surrounding air was defined using a consistent set of quasi stationary Maxwell equations applying a corresponding set of parameters for each media. Furthermore, a deformation of the blank driven by electromagnetic forces distributed through the volume of the blank was modeled using a solid mechanics equation of motion and the elastic plastic flow theory. During the discharge of capacitors the process was considered to be adiabatic due to the short duration of the pulse, so a heat transfer during the discharge time was neglected. The distribution of electric current density integrated during the discharge process defines the increase of temperature at every element of the coil. The distribution of temperature was calculated as a function of time using the energy conservation law...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we analyze {{the energy and}} {{environmental}} impacts of sheet metal manufacturing, focusing on the aerospace industry. The motivation of this work is {{the introduction of a}} new incremental sheet forming (ISF) technology called RAFFT, which substitutes heavy part specific dies for flexible generic tools but with a slower processing rate. The analysis has two sections. The first section analyzes the current aerospace sheet forming technological and economic landscape in order to determine RAFFT's probable adoption rate and predict which technologies it will displace. The second section includes four energy and lifecycle analysis (LCA) case studies on traditional forming technologies. The first section maps the process capabilities of twenty sheet forming technologies. It also describes the business needs and typical practices of the aerospace industry, including a classification of the different business needs for parts. We find that stretch forming and flexforming (also known as a bladder press or hydroforming) dominate current aerospace production, and superplastic forming SPF is used when high formability is required. Machining is used extensively for very low volume production, such as prototyping. We find that the new RAFFT technology is best suited for very low volume production such as the production of replacement parts. The second section includes energy and LCA case studies for titanium SPF, aluminum SPF, flexforming, and stretch forming. Moreover, case studies on kirksite and cast iron die manufacturing are completed because these materials are used in forming dies. We find that SPF uses more energy and has higher impacts than stretch and flexforming. We also find that each technology has high "baseload" (no forming) electricity use due to heat losses in SPF and circulation of hydraulic fluid in stretch and flexforming, meaning that cycle time is a critical factor in electricity use. Lastly, we find that the material for the blank, the die, and the electricity can each dominate impacts depending on the particular characteristics of each case because a) the aerospace industry is willing to invest significant resources, be it time, energy, or material, to produce the desired part and b) the required amount of <b>blank,</b> <b>die,</b> and electricity are dependent on uncorrelated factors. by Kathleen Eaton Rossie.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an expert system developed for assisting die designers for design of <b>blanking</b> <b>dies</b> for sheet metal operations. The production rule-based expert system approach is utilized {{for development of}} the system. The proposed system labelled as INTBDIE is organized in form of twelve modules. Modules are coded in AutoLISP language and designed to be loaded into the prompt area of AutoCAD. For consultation, the user loads the system into the prompt area of AutoCAD. The proposed system generates friendly prompt eliciting from the user for data pertaining to the job. The recommendations imparted by the system for design of <b>blanking</b> <b>die</b> are automatically stored in various output data files which are further utilized for automatic modelling of die components and die assembly. This arrangement facilitates interfacing of design with drafting and can be operated on a PC/AT. The knowledge base of the proposed system can be modified depending upon the capabilities of a specific shop floor. As the system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software, therefore its low cost of implementation makes it affordable for small and medium-sized stamping industries.

5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened <b>blanking</b> <b>die</b> (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the <b>blanking</b> <b>die.</b> The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|R
