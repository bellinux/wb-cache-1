25|$|The {{inauguration of}} the airport was marked with problems. Aerobridge and bay {{allocation}} systems broke down, queues built up throughout the airport and baggage handling broke down. Bags were lost and there were waits of over five hours. Most of these issues were remedied eventually, though <b>baggage</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> was plagued with problems until it was put up for a complete replacement tender in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The <b>baggage</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> is {{the largest}} system and also the deepest in the world; it has a {{capacity}} to handle 8,000 bags per hour. The system includes 21 screening injection points, 49 make-up carousels, 90km of conveyor belts capable of handling 15,000 items per hour at a speed of 27km/h, and 4,500 early baggage storage positions. The entire system is located beneath the taxiway area. High-speed conveyors transport the items of baggage in individual trays, which permits better control at high speeds and leads to quicker passenger check-in and 100 percent accurate baggage tracking.|$|E

40|$|<b>Baggage</b> <b>handling</b> at {{airports}} {{is among the}} most complex tasks for material handling: <b>Baggage</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> form a large-scale conveying network connecting multiple sources and sinks. Also, they are used in a very dynamic environment: Many airports grow rapidly on average but have to absorb significant variance in passenger numbers at the same time. Therefore, baggage-handling systems that are flexible regarding expansions or modifications are desirable. This can be realized by using a highly modular approach with each module containing its own control. This results in self-organized systems, which are also known as the Internet of Things in facility logistics. However, it is necessary to quantify resulting advantages in monetary terms to compare them with additional costs like necessary RFID tags. In this paper, we analyze a conventional and two possible implementations of self-organized <b>baggage</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> for a reference airport on the base of all relevant life-cycle costs. To account for the dynamic nature of expansion flexibility, we use a dynamic programming approach. The data for the reference scenario was carefully collected by evaluating public and non-public sources and is provided in this paper. Results suggest that self-organized systems can decrease life-cycle costs of typical <b>baggage</b> <b>handling</b> <b>systems,</b> and that savings exceed the costs of necessary RFID tags...|$|R

40|$|Extending or {{changing}} {{systems that are}} in operation 24 / 7 should disturb the operation as little as possible.

2500|$|In {{accordance}} with the original contract specifications, Airtrans was originally built to support both freight and passenger service. Inter-terminal baggage was handled by 89 LD3 containers, which were loaded {{on a series of}} semi-automated conveyor belt systems at each terminal. During construction the airport demanded a lower required time for inter-terminal handling, and a different system had to be installed that could meet these increased speeds - the Airtrans <b>baggage</b> <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> was never used in operations. Likewise, the mail handling services were demonstrated at the [...] "Air Mail Facility", but the USPS declined to use it as they felt it was too demanding in that it required their employees to interface with an automatic system. An incinerator was built for trash handling, but never worked properly and was never put into use. Instead, trash from the terminals was moved on the existing passenger vehicles after hours. In the end, only the supplies facility would use the cargo vehicles, operating with great success until 1991 when increased demands for passenger services forced the cargo vehicles to be converted to passenger bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{a rather}} rapid {{increase}} in passenger numbers recently, the airport has already exceeded its original capacity limit of 17 million passengers and passed critical limit of 20 million in 2011.
