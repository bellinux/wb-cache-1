40|$|Introduction: Self-monitoring {{of blood}} glucose (SMBG) {{is one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of diabetes management. Aim of the study: To evaluate the potential for miscoding of a personal glucometer, to define a target population among pediatric patients with diabetes for a non-coding glucometer and the accuracy of the Contour TS non-coding system. Material and methods: Potential for miscoding during self-monitoring of blood glucose was evaluated by means of an anonymous questionnaire, with worst and <b>best</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> evaluated depending on the responses pattern. Testing of the Contour TS system was performed according to guidelines set by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. Results: Estimated frequency of individuals prone to non-coding ranged from 68. 21 % (95 % 60. 70 - 75. 72 %) to 7. 95 % (95 %CI 3. 86 - 12. 31 %) for the worse and <b>best</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> respectively. Factors associated with increased likelihood of non-coding were: a smaller number of tests per day, a greater number of individuals involved in testing and self-testing by the patient with diabetes. The Contour TS device showed intra- and inter-assay accuracy ? 95 %, linear association with laboratory measurements (R 2 = 0. 99, p &#x 003 C; 0. 0001) and consistent, but small bias of - 1. 12 % (95 % Confidence Interval - 3. 27 to 1. 02 %). Clarke error grid analysis showed 4 % of values within the benign error zone (B) with the other measurements yielding an acceptably accurate result (zone A). Conclusions: The Contour TS system showed sufficient accuracy to be safely used in monitoring of pediatric diabetic patients. Patients from families with a high throughput of test-strips or multiple individuals involved in SMBG using the same meter are candidates for clinical use of such devices due to an increased risk of calibration errors...|$|R
40|$|People {{affected}} by cancer want {{information about their}} prognosis but clinicians have trouble estimating and talking about it. We sought to determine the nature and accuracy of medical oncologists' estimates of life expectancy in newly referred patients with incurable cancer. With reference to each patient, medical oncologists estimated how long they thought 90, 50, and 10 % of similar patients would live. These proportions were chosen to reflect worst <b>case,</b> predicted, and <b>best</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> suitable for discussions. After a median follow-up of 35 months, 86 of the 102 patients had died with an observed median survival of 12 months. Oncologists' estimates of each patient's worst <b>case,</b> predicted and <b>best</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> were well-calibrated: 10 % of patients lived for fewer months than estimated for the worst 10 % of similar patients; 50 % lived for at least as long as estimated for 50 % of similar patients (predicted survival), and 17 % lived for more months than estimated for the best 10 % of similar patients. Oncologists' estimates of each patient's predicted survival were imprecise: 29 % were within 0. 67 – 1. 33 times the patient's actual survival, 35 % were too optimistic (> 1. 33 times the actual survival), and 39 % were too pessimistic (< 0. 67 times the actual survival). The proportions of patients with actual survival times bounded by simple multiples of their predicted survival were as follows: 61 % between half to double their predicted, 6 % at least {{three to four times}} their predicted, and 4 % no more than 1 / 6 of their predicted; similar to the proportions in an exponential distribution (about 50 %, 10 % and 10 % respectively).
