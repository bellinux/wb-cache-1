5|$|Germany, Poland and Hungary seized Czech <b>borderland</b> {{following}} the Munich agreement with UK, France and Italy, in October 1938, immediately putting into force their own restrictive gun laws within the occupied territory.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{brothers}} {{in their early}} 20s, one of them armed with a knife, attacked a 63-year-old man in a town in the Northern Bohemian <b>borderland.</b> He shot both attackers with his legally owned pistol, killing one of them. The police closed the case as legitimate self-defense six months later and brought charges against the surviving attacker.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th {{century the}} Commonwealth {{suffered}} {{a series of}} Tatar invasions. In the 16th century Cossack raids began descending on the Black Sea area Turkish settlements and Tatar lands. In retaliation the Ottoman Empire directed their vassal Tatar forces, based in Crimea or Budjak areas, against the Commonwealth regions of Podolia and Red Ruthenia. The <b>borderland</b> area to the south-east {{was in a state}} of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people had been captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.|$|E
5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more important, in terms of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed <b>borderland.</b> Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Coloman routed two {{bands of}} crusaders (the {{perpetrators}} of the Rhineland massacres) who were plundering the Western borderlands and defeated Petar Svačić in Croatia. The late 14th-century Pacta conventa states that Coloman was crowned king of Croatia after concluding {{an agreement with}} twelve local noblemen. Although most probably a forgery, the document reflects the actual status of Croatia proper, which was never incorporated into Hungary. In contrast, the region known as Slavonia, between the Petrova Mounts and the river Dráva, became closely connected to Hungary. Here many Hungarian noblemen received land grants from the monarchs. Zadar, Split and other Dalmatian towns also accepted Coloman's suzerainty in 1105, but their right to elect their own bishops and leaders remained unchained. In Croatia and Slavonia, the sovereign was represented by governors bearing the title ban. Likewise, a royal official, the voivode, administered Transylvania, the eastern <b>borderland</b> of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|From his {{extensive}} fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of South Indian culture on the Indus Valley Civilization. Using a geographic {{perspective of the}} socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the Indus Basin and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the Indo-Gangetic Plain did not play any {{significant role in the}} development of Indus Valley culture. Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the Bronze Age, although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western <b>borderland</b> that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the cultural history of Pakistan is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi influences. He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.|$|E
5|$|The new {{triangular}} arrangement between the Southern Song, Jin, and Western Xia continued {{the age of}} division and conflict in China. The region of Huainan (between the Yangzi and Huai rivers) became a new <b>borderland</b> and battleground between Song and Jin from 1128 to 1141, displacing {{hundreds of thousands of}} families who had lived there for generations. The Southern Song deployed several military commanders, among them Yue Fei and Han Shizhong, to resist the Jin as well as recapture territory, which proved successful at times. Yue Fei in particular had been preparing to recapture Kaifeng (or Bianjing as the city was known during the Song period), the former capital of the Song dynasty and the then southern capital of the Jin, after a streak of uninterrupted military victories.|$|E
5|$|When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi {{was well}} aware of the {{military}} power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king. Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing. The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious <b>borderland</b> regions in April 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (အပိ) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, the only {{specific}} ukraina mentioned very often in Polish and Ruthenian texts was the south-eastern <b>borderland</b> around Kiev, and thus ukraina {{came to be}} synonymous with the voivodeship of Kiev and later the region around Kiev.

25|$|In May 1969, a Willow Bunch {{advisory}} board {{responded to the}} parents' concern and began campaigning for equal instruction in French at the Willow Bunch School.

However, the Unit rejected their proposal for several months. After meetings October through November, the Unit’s position changed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1500s, Krsto Frankopan was {{involved}} in the struggle between Venice and Austria at the <b>borderland</b> of eastern Istria, Rašpor (Croatian Ćićarija) and Podgrad (Slovenian Ćićarija) citadel estates. It resulted with the Frankopans destruction of the Rašpor citadel because of a peace agreement in 1521 that made Podgrad Austrian and Rašpor Venetian property. Afterwards, western Jelovice, Novaki, Vodice and eastern Vele and Male Mune and Žejane village became Austrian property.|$|E
25|$|The {{old town}} {{was added to}} the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 due to the {{harmonious}} co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural <b>borderland</b> between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the old town consists of over 1000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to Contemporary.|$|E
25|$|Some historians {{suggest that}} the regions of Sandomierz, Lublin and Czerwień (western Red Ruthenia) were indeed annexed by Mieszko's state in the 970s, as lands {{valuable}} for trade reasons and {{as a starting point}} for a future attack against what was to become Lesser Poland, then in the hands of Bohemia. Sandomierz under this scenario was the central hub of the area, with Czerwień, Przemyśl and Chełm assuming the function of defensive <b>borderland</b> strongholds.|$|E
25|$|The Isaurians were {{a people}} who lived inland from the Mediterranean coast of Anatolia, {{in the core of}} the Taurus Mountains (generally what is now the Konya/Bozkir area of Turkey). Like most <b>borderland</b> tribes, they were looked upon as barbarians by the Romans even though they had been Roman {{subjects}} for more than five centuries. However, being Orthodox Christians rather than Arians, as the Goths and other Germanic tribes were, they were not formally barred from the throne.|$|E
25|$|The torture porn subgenre {{has proven}} to be very profitable: Saw, made for $1.2 million, grossed over $100 million worldwide, while Hostel, which cost less than $5 million to produce, grossed over $80 million. Lionsgate, the studio behind the films, made {{considerable}} gains in its stock price from the box office showing. The financial success led the way for the release of similar films: Turistas in 2006, , <b>Borderland,</b> and Captivity, starring Elisha Cuthbert and Pruitt Taylor Vince, in 2007. Indeed, in 2009 the Saw series became the most profitable horror film franchise of all time.|$|E
25|$|In the 10th century {{an eastern}} (east of the River Enns) outpost of the Duchy of Bavaria, {{bordering}} Hungary, was established as the Marchia orientalis (March of the East) or 'Margraviate of Austria' in 976, {{ruled by the}} Margraves of Babenberg. This 'Eastern March' (<b>borderland),</b> in German was known as Ostarrîchi or 'Eastern Realm', hence 'Austria'. The first mention of Ostarrîchi occurs in a document of that name dated 996 CE. From 1156 the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa created an independent duchy (Privilegium Minus) under the House of Babenberg, until its extinction in 1246, corresponding to modern Lower Austria.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Dukla Pass, {{also known}} as the Dukla / Carpatho-Dukla / Rzeszów-Dukla / Dukla-Prešov Offensive was the scene of bitterly contested battle for the Dukla Pass (<b>borderland</b> between Poland and Slovakia) on the Eastern Front of World War II between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in September–October 1944. It was part of the Soviet East Carpathian Strategic Offensive that also {{included}} the Carpathian-Uzhgorod Offensive. The operation's primary goal to provide support for the Slovaks was not achieved, though it concluded the full liberation of the Ukraine in its modern borders by the occupation of the Subcarpathian region as a territory of the former Carpatho-Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|The Peace of Riga {{settled the}} eastern border by {{preserving}} for Poland {{a substantial portion}} of the old Commonwealth's eastern territories at the cost of partitioning the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Lithuania and Belarus) and Ukraine. The Ukrainians ended up with no state of their own and felt betrayed by the Riga arrangements; their resentment gave rise to extreme nationalism and anti-Polish hostility. The Kresy (or <b>borderland)</b> territories in the east won by 1921 would form the basis for a swap arranged and carried out by the Soviets in 1943–45, who at that time compensated the re-emerging Polish state for the eastern lands lost to the Soviet Union with conquered areas of eastern Germany.|$|E
25|$|The World Heritage {{nomination}} {{is composed of}} eleven component parts that are representative for processes at the High Middle Ages that shaped the whole continent: Christianization, settlement and cultivation processes, the so-called Landesausbau, that took place between 1000 and 1300. This <b>borderland</b> region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the High Middle Ages. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self-confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers {{as well as to}} the region’s crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Otto {{had to settle}} a dispute between Bruning, a Saxon noble, and Duke Eberhard of Franconia, {{the brother of the}} former king Conrad I of Germany. After the rise of a Saxon to kingship, Bruning, a local lord with {{possessions}} in the <b>borderland</b> between Franconia and Saxony, refused to swear fealty to any non-Saxon ruler. Eberhard attacked Bruning's Helmern castle near Peckelsheim, killed all of its inhabitants and burned it down. The king called the feuding parties to his court at Magdeburg, where Eberhard was ordered to pay a fine, and his lieutenants were sentenced to carry dead dogs in public, which was considered a particularly shameful punishment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, about sixty French {{families}} {{were established in}} Acadia. They developed friendly relations with the Wabanaki Confederacy (particularly the Mi'kmaq), learning their hunting and fishing techniques. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; farming land reclaimed from the sea through diking. Living in a contested <b>borderland</b> region between French Quebec and British territories, the Acadians often became entangled in {{the conflict between the}} powers. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four French and Indian Wars as well as Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre's War).|$|E
25|$|The first {{intrusions}} of Lithuanian {{troops into}} the Moscow principality occurred in 1363. In 1368, Algirdas {{carried out the}} first major expedition against Moscow. Having devastated the Russian <b>borderland,</b> the Lithuanian prince routed the troops of the prince of Starodoub Simeon Dmitrievich Krapiva and prince of Obolensk Konstantin Yuryevich. On November 21, Algirdas routed the Moscow sentry troops on the river Trosna. However, he could not seize the Moscow Kremlin. The troops of Algirdas ruined {{the area around the}} city and captured {{a significant portion of the}} Muscovite population. In 1370, Algirdas made another expedition against Moscow. He ruined the area around of Volok Lamskiy. On December 6, he besieged Moscow and started to devastate the surrounding area. Having received the message that the prince Vladimir Andreevich was coming to help Moscow, Algirdas returned to Lithuania. In 1372 Algirdas attacked the Moscow principality again and reached Lyubutsk. However, the Grand Prince of Moscow Dmitry Ivanovich routed the sentry troops of Algirdas, and the Lithuanians concluded an armistice with Moscow. In 1375, Algirdas devastated the Smolensk principality.|$|E
25|$|Ewi’s Realm –Territoriality and Politics of Division in Ewi’s Kingdom: At {{the height}} of Ado-Ekiti {{influence}} in Ekiti country in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{legend has it that}} Ado kingdom consisted of 150 (ewadojo) communities and that the metropolis of the kingdom was Ado-Ekiti Township where the Ewi as Sovereign superintended over the realm as the sovereign head. The Oluyin, the Alare, the Alaworoko, the Elesure, the Eleyio and the Onigbemo are very important rulers of subordinate towns within the immediate precinct of the Ewi’s municipality. Within the Ewi’s Kingdom, heads of subordinate towns often performed specific political and spiritual roles and responsibilities {{in the service of the}} Kingdom in order to retain and sustain their relationship with the powerful King while supporting the layers of interrelations among towns in the realm. Legend has it that it was a tradition in Ado-Ekiti for influential members of the royal household (Omo Oba or Omo Owa) to be sent to subordinate Ado-Ekiti community to found new dynasties on established settlements in buffer zones and <b>borderland</b> areas.|$|E
25|$|After {{the peace}} {{negotiations}} Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled {{at the end}} of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested <b>borderland</b> areas, closely resembling the border between the Russian Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth before the first partition of 1772. Polish resources were exhausted, however, and Polish public opinion was opposed to a prolongation of the war. The Polish government was also pressured by the League of Nations, and the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski's National Democrats. Piłsudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (Sejm) was controlled by Dmowski: Piłsudski's support lay in the territories in the East, which were controlled by the Bolsheviks {{at the time of the}} elections, while the National Democrats' electoral support lay in central and western Poland. The peace negotiations were of a political nature. National Democrats, like Stanisław Grabski, who earlier had resigned his post to protest the Polish–Ukrainian alliance and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for Piłsudski's vision of reviving Międzymorze, the multicultural Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. This post-war situation proved a death blow to the Międzymorze project. More than one million Poles, living mostly in the disputed territories, remained in the Soviet Union, systematically persecuted by Soviet authorities because of political, economic and religious reasons (see the Polish operation of the NKVD).|$|E
