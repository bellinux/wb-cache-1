40|$|In this note, {{we present}} a {{luminosity}} model for RHIC gold runs. The model {{is applied to the}} physics fills in 2007 run without cooling, and with the longitudinal cooling applied to one beam only. Having good comparison, the model is used to project a fill with the longitudinal cooling applied to both beams. Further development and possible applications of the model are discussed. To maximize the integrated luminosity, usually the higher beam intensity, smaller longitudinal and transverse emittance, and smaller {beta} are the directions to work on. In past 10 years, the RHIC gold runs have demonstrated a path toward this goal. Most recently, a successful commissioning of the bunched beam stochastic cooling, both longitudinal and transverse, has offered a chance of further RHIC luminosity improvement. With so many factors involved, a luminosity model would be useful to identify and project gains in the machine development. In this article, a preliminary model is proposed. In Section 2, several secondary factors, which are not yet included in the model, are identified based on the RHIC operation condition and experience in current runs. In Section 3, the RHIC <b>beam</b> <b>store</b> parameters used in the model are listed, and validated. In Section 4, the factors included in the model are discussed, and the luminosity model is presented. In Section 5, typical RHIC gold fills without cooling, and with partial cooling are used for comparison with the model. Then a projection of fills with more coolings is shown. In Section 6, further development of the model is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Great {{interest}} {{in the community of}} hadron physicists has been raised by the recent proposal of the PAX Collaboration to perform experiments using a polarized antiproton beam at the future facility FAIR at Darmstadt. The availability of a beam of polarized antiprotons would allow us to access {{for the first time a}} wealth of fundamental physics observables. One of the most important is the so-called transversity, the distribution of the transverse polarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon, which is directly measurable by means of the double-spin asymmetry in the production of Drell-Yan pairs in double-polarized proton-antiproton interactions. Other unique measurements address the determination of the phase of the electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region and scattering observables in double polarized hard proton-antiproton reactions. A necessary preliminary step for these experiments is the production of an intense beam of polarized antiprotons. At the moment the most promising technique to polarize antiprotons is the "spin-filtering" technique. Spin-filtering exploits the spin dependence of the interaction between an initially unpolarized proton (or antiproton) <b>beam</b> <b>stored</b> in a storage ring and a polarized internal hydrogen target. The proof of principle of the technique has been carried out with a proton <b>beam</b> <b>stored</b> in the TSR ring in Heidelberg more than ten years ago.

In order to gain a full understanding of the spin-filtering technique, a series of experiments must be carried out at the COSY storage ring in Jülich with protons and at the AD storage ring at CERN with antiprotons...|$|R

40|$|Frequent {{polarization}} reversals, or spin-flips, of a beam in {{high energy}} storage rings, {{may be a}} powerful tool for greatly reducing the systematic errors of spin asymmetry measurements in scattering experiments. A spin-flipping technique using an artificially induced spin-depolarizing resonance, created by an rf magnet with a horizontal magnetic field, is being developed to allow such polarization reversals in a well-controlled way. We used a new ferrite rf dipole to study the spin flipping of a 2. 1 GeV/c vertically polarized proton <b>beam</b> <b>stored</b> in the COSY Cooler Synchrotron in Jϋlich, Germany. We swept the rf dipole's frequency through an rf-induced spin resonance to flip the beam's polarization direction. After determining the resonance's frequency, we varied the frequency's range and ramp time, and the number of flips. At the rf dipole's maximum strength and its optimum frequency range and ramp time, we measured a proton spin-flip efficiency of 99. 92 ± 0. 04 %. This result, along with previous similar IUCF results at lower energy, indicate that due to the Lorentz invariance of an rf-dipole's transverse ∫Bdl and the weak energy dependence of its spin-resonance strength, a small rf dipole should allow efficient spin flipping in very high energies in rings such as the 250 GeV RHIC or even the 7 TeV LHC. The accurate prediction of a spin-depolarizing resonance strength remains a challenge. We earlier analyzed all available data on the spin-flipping of <b>stored</b> <b>beams</b> of polarized protons, electrons and deuterons. We found 10 - 20 -fold deviations of the measured rf-induced resonance strength from the theoretically predicted strength. Therefore, we recently studied these resonance strength deviations experimentally by varying the rf dipole's voltage, and the size, momentum spread and vertical betatron tune with a 2. 1 GeV/c polarized proton <b>beam</b> <b>stored</b> in COSY. We found no dependence of the resonance strength on the beam's size or momentum spread.

The polarization was typically manipulated by linearly sweeping the frequency of an rf dipole or rf solenoid through an rf-induced spin resonance; spin-flip efficiencies of up to 99 : 9 % were obtained.
