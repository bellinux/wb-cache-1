40|$|Received [year] [month] [day]; {{accepted}} [year] [month] [day] Abstract A long {{plateau phase}} and an amazing brightness {{have been observed}} in the X-ray afterglow of GRB 060729. This peculiar light curve is likely due to long-term energy injection in external shock. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the energy injection process of magnetic dipole radiation from a strongly magnetized millisecond pulsar and model the multi-band afterglow observations. It is found that this model can successfully explain the long plateaus in the observed X-ray and optical afterglow light curves. The sharp break following the plateaus should {{be due to the}} rapid decline of the emission power of the central pulsar. At an even late time (∼ 5 × 10 6 s), an obvious jet break appears, which implies a relatively large half opening angle of θ ∼ 0. 3 for the GRB ejecta. Due to the energy injection, the Lorentz factor of the outflow is still larger than two 10 7 s post the GRB trigger, making the X-ray afterglow of this burst detectable by Chandra even 642 days after the <b>burst.</b> <b>Key</b> words:...|$|R

40|$|The {{duration}} of the prompt emission of long gamma-ray bursts is {{generally considered to be}} fairly similar to the {{duration of}} the activity of the engine {{in the center of the}} progenitor star. Here, we investigate the relation between the {{duration of the}} engine activity and that of the observed light curve, using inputs from both numerical simulations and observations. We find that the observed burst duration is a good proxy for the engine duration after the time necessary for the jet to break out the star’s surface is subtracted. However, the observed duration is a function of the viewing angle and can be significantly shorter than the duration of the engine activity. We also show that the observed, redshift-corrected burst duration evolves only moderately with redshift for both observations and synthetic light curves. We conclude that the broad distribution of the observed duration of long BATSE gamma-ray bursts is mostly accounted for by an engine lasting ∼ 20 s, the dispersion being due to viewing and redshift effects. Our results do not rule out the existence of engines with very long duration.

We investigate whether the tidal interaction of a Wolf-Rayet star with a compact object in a binary system can spin up the Wolf-Rayet star enough to produce a collapsar. Methods. We compute the evolution of close Wolf-Rayet binaries, including tidal angular momentum exchange, differential rotation of the Wolf-Rayet star, internal magnetic fields, stellar wind mass loss, and mass transfer. The Wolf-Rayet companion is approximated as a point mass. We then employ a population synthesis code to infer the occurrence rates of the various relevant binary evolution channels. Results. We find that the simple scenario — i. e., the Wolf-Rayet star being tidally spun up and producing a collapsar — does not occur at solar metallicity and may only occur with low probability at low metallicity.

The binding of antibodies to granule membranes by cells activated with phorbol ester or treated with cytochalasin B and lithium chloride were similarly increased.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{variable}} Eddington factor, {{depending on the}} flow velocity v, for the relativistic radiative flow, whose velocity becomes {{of the order of}} the speed of light. When the gaseous flow is radiatively accelerated up to the relativistic regime, the velocity gradient becomes very large {{in the direction of the}} flow. As a result, the radiative diffusion may become anisotropic in the comoving frame of the gas. Hence, in a flow that is accelerated from subrelativistic to relativistic regimes, the Eddington factor should be different from 1 / 3 even in the diffusion limit. As a simple form, the velocity-dependent Eddington factor may be written as f(β) = 1 / 3 +(2 / 3) β, where β = v/c. Using the velocity-dependent Eddington factor, we can solve the rigorous equations of the relativistic radiative flow accelerated up to the relativistic speed. We also propose a generalized form for a variable Eddington factor as a function of the optical depth τ as well as the flow velocity: f(τ,β) = 1 / 3 + (2 / 3) [1 + (τ + 1) β]/(1 + τ + β) for a spherically symmetric case.

This saturation of the response to progressively stronger synaptic inputs occurs not only in bursting neurons but also in tonically spiking neurons. We identified inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials as the cause of the saturation in the model neuron.

The activity of multiunit neuronal clusters under light urethane anesthesia was recorded through 100 -microelectrode arrays implanted in the infragranular layers of rat barrel cortex. Spontaneous activity was characterized by “bursts ” of spikes, synchronized across the barrel cortex. This allowed activity at one selected electrode to {{be taken as a}} reliable monitor of widespread cortical bursts. We used spikes at the selected electrode to trigger stimulation of two pairs of whiskers during a 50 min conditioning procedure: (1) for the “burst-conditioned ” whisker pair, each stimulus was delivered 1 msec after the triggering spike, activating cortex coincident with the burst; and (2) for the “interburst-conditioned ” whisker pair, each stimulus was delivered 300 msec after the triggering spike, activating cortex during the trough between bursts. The cross-correlation between cortical neurons in the pairs of columns matching the stimulated whisker pairs was estimated after the termination of the conditioning procedure. Conditioning produced a twofold increase in the degree of co-firing between infragranular neurons in columns receiving burstconditioned costimulation but no significant change in connectivity between infragranular neurons in columns receiving interburstconditioned costimulation, although the two pairs of columns received an equal number of sensory inputs.

40|$|Abstract. Bursting {{behavior}} in neurons is a recurrent transition between a quiescent state and repetitive spiking. When {{the transition to}} repetitive spiking occurs via a subcritical Andronov–Hopf bifurcation and {{the transition to the}} quiescent state occurs via double limit cycle bifurcation, the burster is said to be of subcritical elliptic type. When the fast subsystem is near a Bautin (generalized Hopf) point, both bifurcations occur for nearby values of the slow variable, and the repetitive spiking has small amplitude. We refer to such an elliptic burster as being of local Bautin type. First, we prove that any such burster can be converted into a canonical model by a suitable continuous (possibly noninvertible) change of variables. We also derive a canonical model for weakly connected networks of such bursters. We find that behavior of such networks {{is quite different from the}} behavior of weakly connected phase oscillators, and it resembles that of strongly connected relaxation oscillators. As a result, such weakly connected bursters need few (usually one) bursts to synchronize. In-phase synchronization is possible for bursters having quite different quantitative features, whereas out-ofphase synchronization may be difficult to achieve. We also find that interactions between bursters depend crucially on the spiking frequencies. Namely, the interactions are most effective when the presynaptic interspike frequency matches the frequency of postsynaptic oscillations. Finally, we use the FitzHugh–Rinzel model to evaluate how studying local Bautin bursters can contribute to our understanding of the phenomena of subcritical elliptic <b>bursting.</b> <b>Key</b> words. subcritical elliptic burster, “sub-Hopf/fold cycle ” burster, subcritical Andronov– Hopf bifurcation, double limit cycle bifurcation, Bautin bifurcation, normal form, canonical model...|$|R
40|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the central}} fixated stimulus before {{the appearance of a}} new target stimulus reduces the latency of saccades and pursuit, a phenomenon known as the “gap effect. ” The superior colliculus (SC) plays a prominent role in the gap effect for saccades, and recent data indicate that this structure also plays some role in the control of pursuit. We now show that the firing rate of buildup neurons in the rostral SC exhibits a gap effect during the initiation of both pursuit and saccadic eye movements to parafoveal targets. Most neurons exhibited an increase in tonic activity starting � 100 msec after the offset of the fixation spot, regardless of whether the target later appeared inside or outside of the response field of the neuron. The subsequent appearance of the target in the response field evoked phasic increases in activity that were approximately twice as large as the effects on tonic activity. For both pursuit and saccades, the levels of tonic and phasic activity were inversely correlated with latency on a trial-by-trial basis. These changes in activity provide a neuronal correlate for the shared effects on latency observed previously with the gap paradigm for pursuit and saccades. Finally, the phasic activity at pursuit onset exhibited a gap effect just like the target-evoked response, whereas the burst activity at saccade onset was fixed in amplitude. These results suggest how SC neurons may coordinate the initiation of pursuit and saccades: buildup activity may gate the initiation of pursuit, whereas it indirectly triggers saccades by recruiting a saccade-related <b>burst.</b> <b>Key</b> words: pursuit; saccade; superior colliculus; monkey; gap effect; attentio...|$|R

The specific torus canard trajectories occur in a small but finite parameter range where the dynamics of the full system move through a fold of limit cycles in the fast system and follow the branch of repelling limit cycles for some time.

Upon introduction of small stochastic forcing, the model generates irregular bursting. The statistical properties of the emergent bursting patterns are studied in the present work. In particular, we identify two principal statistical regimes associated with the noise-induced bursting. In the first case, type I, bursting oscillations are created mainly due to the fluctuations in the fast subsystem. In the alternative scenario, type II bursting, the random perturbations in the slow dynamics play a dominant role. We propose two classes of randomly perturbed slow-fast systems that realize type I and type II scenarios. For these models, we derive the Poincaré maps. The analysis of the linearized Poincaré maps of the randomly perturbed systems explains the distributions of the number of spikes within one burst and reveals their dependence on the small and control parameters present in the models.

The {{unavailability}} or poor {{service of}} web {{sites that are}} faced with surges in workload during important events, like product announcements, sporting events, and sales events, have frequently {{been the subject of}} news headlines. Companies that host such important events often do so with the aim of positively influencing their public profile or maximizing their revenue, whereby the negative news headlines that are often associated with such events, come into direct contradiction with these goals. The accurate prediction of event-associated workload <b>bursts</b> is <b>key</b> to more effectively managing important events, however many of the existing prediction methods fail to accurately predict the time and magnitude of such bursts. In this paper we extend on earlier work in event aware prediction to provide a generic method for predicting event-associated workload that can be re-used for multiple event types. We propose evaluation methods for this generic event aware prediction approach, which will be carried out in future work, for which a positive assessment can indicate the applicability of event-aware-prediction to a multitude of other domains beyond workload prediction...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the Bedtime Pass Program (BPP), an extinction-based procedure for treating bedtime resistance in typically developing children. Methods A randomized, controlled trial in which nineteen 3 - to 6 -year-old children demonstrating bedtime resistance {{were randomly assigned}} to a Bedtime Pass or Monitoring Control group. The experimental condition involved parent monitoring plus the Bedtime Pass: a card exchangeable for one parental visit or excused departure from the room after bedtime, with parents ignoring subsequent bids for attention. Results Children in the Bedtime Pass condition left their rooms and called and cried out significantly less frequently than controls. They demonstrated significant reductions in the time required to quiet each night. Treatment effects were maintained at 3 -month follow-up. Parents reported high levels of satisfaction and treatment acceptability. Conclusions BPP is a noncomplex, socially acceptable, effective treatment for bedtime resistance. It retains the powerful effects of extinction-based procedures without the “extinction <b>burst.</b> ” <b>Key</b> words bedtime resistance; behavioral pediatrics; extinction; sleep disorders in children; social validity. Bedtime resistance, manifested by children crying, call-ing out, or leaving their rooms after bedtime, {{is one of the most}} frequent presenting complaints in primary care pediatrics (Blum & Carey, 1996). Among the methods often prescribed, the most effective, in terms of sheer reductive potency, involve variations on a procedur...|$|R
