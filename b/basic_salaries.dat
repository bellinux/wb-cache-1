25|$|His {{early career}} at the Opéra was quite turbulent. The {{institution}} {{at the time was}} seething with discontent: the artistes resented the fact their wages were only a third of those of the actors of the Comédie-Française and the Comédie-Italienne; moreover, their pay was only partly fixed and permanent, the rest being linked to how frequently they appeared on stage and the size of their roles. The rebellious Lays soon became embroiled in a heated confrontation with the management, behaving almost like a modern union agitator, with the support of two singers who had joined the company around the same time, the haute-contre J. Rousseau (1761–1800) and the bass Auguste-Athanase Chéron (1760–1829). In June 1781, fire destroyed the second hall of the Palais Royal, the home of the theatre, causing performances to be suspended. This left the singers with only their meagre <b>basic</b> <b>salaries,</b> so the three decided to remedy the situation by accepting engagements elsewhere, even though they were prohibited by law from doing so as salaried artistes of the Académie Royale de Musique. Rousseau alone managed to travel to Brussels surreptitiously and appear at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, then the second most important French-speaking theatre in the world. Lays, however, was arrested on the evening of 20 August 1781, the day before he was due to set off, and spent ten days in prison. He was provisionally released on the 30th because he was indispensable for filling the haute-contre role of Cynire in a revival of Gluck's Echo et Narcisse in the small hall of the Menus-Plaisirs which acted as a substitute for the theatre which had burned down. His enormous popularity with the public, with an encore of the main aria and several curtain-calls, made it practically impossible to send him back to prison, although he was forced to sign a solemn undertaking that he would not leave Paris without the express permission of his superiors.|$|E

30|$|The social {{security}} payment {{is subject to}} a ceiling and a floor.

However, if the <b>basic</b> <b>salary</b> is below 60  % of the regional average, the payment is computed as if the <b>basic</b> <b>salary</b> was 60  % of the regional average. These features imply that not only is social security payment a heavy burden on employees and their employers but also a regressive levy among people who participate in the program. The very high payment rates also discourage participation in the program. There is a strong case for reducing the payment rate.|$|R

50|$|Although Soviet {{enterprises}} were theoretically {{governed by}} the principle of khozraschet ("accountability")—which required them to meet planners' expectations within the system of set prices for their inputs and outputs—they had little control over the biggest decisions affecting their operations. Managers did {{have a responsibility to}} plan future gross output, which they chronically underestimated in order to later exceed the prediction. The managers then received bonuses (premia) for surplus product regardless of whether it was produced in a cost-effective manner or whether their enterprise was profitable overall. The bonuses for output came in amounts sometimes equal to the managers' <b>basic</b> <b>salaries.</b> The system also incentivized pointless increases in the size, weight, and cost of production outputs, simply because 'more' had been produced.|$|E

40|$|In February 2012, the German Federal Constitutional Court {{declared}} {{the salaries of}} level W 2 professors in the State of Hesse unconstitutional due to their lack of sufficient alimentation power. In the meantime, federal and nearly all state legislators have provided (draft) laws in order to comply in the future with constitutional requirements. In either case, the new salary law still rests upon a dual system containing <b>basic</b> <b>salaries</b> (partly tiered) and a merit bonus component. However, the reform acts provided so far do not succeed in smoothing out existing alimentation deficits of salary law for professors or even create new constitutionally doubtful legal provisions. This is particularly {{due to the fact}} that legislators both miss a sufficient level of <b>basic</b> <b>salaries</b> compared to other public servants and try to cover additional expenses by curtailing given performance bonuses at the same time ("consumption" of old bonuses). This article provides an overview of current legal activities in the field, analyses the impacts of new salary law for the constitutional principles of merit, alimentation and nondiscrimination. Finally, main flaws of new salary law with respect to German constitutional law are derived from this. It is concluded here that the Federal Constitutional Court definitely ought to reappraise the federal and state salary law for professors...|$|E
