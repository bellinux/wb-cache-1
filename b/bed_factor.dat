40|$|The current OPSS and OPSD {{that provide}} {{specifications}} for drainage pipes in Ontario, are {{shown to be}} a simplified and more conservative version of the traditional Marston-Spangler method. The SIDD method was developed through extensive finite element analyses. It improves the pipe installation practice by lessening the requirements in bedding and compaction, and allowing the use of native backfill materials. There is potential cost-savings in using the SIDD method. The SIDD standard adopted by ASCE/ANSI, however, seems to have missed a few important pieces of design information and is inconsistent with the original SIDD research publication in the definition of soil types. The paper shows that an improved version of the SIDD method should be considered for adoption as an alternative in the OPSS, while the traditional Marston-Spangler method is maintained in the standards. 2. 1 Loads on buried pipe Design loads for rigid pipe have traditionally been determined using the Marston load theory (Marston 1930) : (1) where W = backfill load per unit length; C = load factor; = unit weight of backfill material; and B = trench width, B d, at top of pipe for trench condition or pipe outside width, B c, for embankment condition. The formulas for calculating load factor, C, vary for different types of installation (Marston 1930). 2. 2 <b>Bedding</b> <b>factors</b> In the Marston-Spangler method, <b>bedding</b> <b>factors</b> are used to relate the calculated external loads to the 3 edge -bearing strength of pipe: (2) where S eb = 3 -edge bearing strength; W = calculated external load; and B f, = <b>bedding</b> <b>factor.</b> <b>Bedding</b> <b>factor,</b> B f, is dependent on bedding angle, quality of contact between the bedding and the pipe, the supporting lateral pressure on the pipe, and the [...] ...|$|R

Thus, it was concluded that bubbling behaviour in a vibrating fluidized bed in dependent on the vibrations.|$|R

A distinction was made between immutable and mutable risk factors. This case-control study (part of the European Concerted Action on SIDS) comprised 73 SIDS cases and 146 controls and lasted from March 1995 to September 1996. Adjustments were made for sleeping position and <b>bedding</b> <b>factors</b> by treating them as covariables. Apart from these factors, well known risk factors that remain of importance in the Netherlands are: male sex, young maternal age, twins, and low socioeconomic status. These factors are largely immutable. Other well known risk factors which might reflect attitudes to child care and could possibly be mutable are: smoking, alcohol consumption by the mother, bottle feeding, and change of babycare routine. Intervention strategies should focus on early signalling, thereby assisting parents in changing these unfavourable parenting attitudes. Information on optimal child care and extra support by public health nurses specifically aimed at families at risk could help to decrease further the incidence of SIDS in the Netherlands. ...|$|R

S. virgatus inhabited more wave-exposed shores than H. mutabilis. On rock slopes receiving moderate wave action, both species formed contiguous mussel beds vertically, the former occurring from the upper to mid intertidal zones and the latter in the lower zone. Juvenile H. mutabilis were found abundantly in the mussel beds of both species, attaching to byssal threads or to the shell surface of other mussels. Very few S. virgatus of all sizes {{were found in the}} H. mutabilis bed. The amount of byssal thread material and the drag force required to detach mussels were both greater in H. mutabilis than in S. virgatus. Individual variation in shell shape was greater in H. mutabilis than in S. virgatus. A much larger amount of sediment accumulated in H. mutabilis beds than in S. virgatus beds.

The internal heat transfer can greatly affect the drying process while the effect of gas pressure distribution is insignificant.

Although the transthoracic and the transesophageal routes can be used, we always prefer, {{in the absence of}} contraindications, to perform transesophageal echocardiography. ARDS includes numerous affections which brutally damage the interface between the distal airway tract and pulmonary vascular <b>bed.</b> Two <b>factors</b> combine to produce right ventricular systolic overload, the pathologic features of the syndrome per se and mechanical ventilation. Acute cor pulmonale (ACP) reflects the severity of the pulmonary disease, but may also be caused or exacerbated by an aggressive and unsuitable ventilatory strategy. With tidal volume limitation, the incidence of ACP has declined to 25 %. Providing that ventilatory management is adapted to right ventricular function, ACP is no longer significantly associated with increased mortality. If not, it is demonstrated that right ventricular dysfunction is actually associated with a poor prognosis. In conclusion, whereas some have promoted a lung protective approach, echocardiography allows us to promote a right ventricular protective approach, by adapting respiratory settings to right ventricular function, which is key in the prognosis of these patients...|$|R

The mean percentage of inappropriateness for hospitalization was 22 %. The percentage of inappropriateness for the first 10 [*]d of hospitalization peaked in correspondence of the fourth (42 %). The logistic regression model on inappropriated admission reported that emergency admission was a protective factor (OR[*]=[*] 0. 4) and to be hospitalized in wards with ≥ 30 <b>beds</b> risk <b>factor</b> (OR[*]=[*] 5. 12). The second linear model on "percentage of inappropriateness" showed that inappropriated admission and wards with ≥ 30 beds increased the percentage (p[*]<[*] 0. 001); whereas the admission in Teaching Hospitals was inversely associated (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The present study suggests that the percentage of inappropriate admission depends especially on the inappropriate admission and the large number of beds in obstetric wards. This probably indicates that management of big hospitals, which is very complex, needs improving the processes of support and coordination of health professionals. The OAEP tool seems to be an useful instrument for the decision-makers to monitor and manage the obstetric wards...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Integra {{artificial}} skin (Integra) (Integra Life Sciences Corporation, Plainsboro, NJ) is increasingly {{used as a}} skin substitute in reconstructive surgery. However, reliable fixation to the wound <b>bed,</b> a <b>factor</b> of paramount importance for successful application, is often hard to achieve. The vacuum-assisted closure system (VAC; KCI, Switzerland), a well-established subatmospheric pressure device, might {{be of interest to}} overcome these problems because of its ability to conform to almost any surface. The goal {{of this study was to}} test whether negative pressure application yields reliable fixation of Integra in children undergoing reconstructive surgery. METHODS: Between 2001 and 2004, VAC was applied in 18 children (n = 18) aged 7 months to 16. 5 years. All required reconstructive surgery with implantation of Integra covering 1 % to 12 % of the total body surface area. After Integra implantation, VAC was installed for 13 to 30 days. RESULTS: The VAC fixation of Integra was successful in 17 patients (94. 5 %). The only failure (5. 5 %) occurred in a patient in whom negative pressure could not be maintained because of a lesion site susceptible to both dislodgement and infection (perianal region). Consequently, infection occurred, and Integra had to be removed. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that VAC is a valid tool for reliable fixation of Integra in children undergoing even demanding reconstructive surgery...|$|R
