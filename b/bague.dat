2500|$|To {{weaken the}} {{influence}} of the military, Sukarno rescinded martial law (which gave wide-ranging powers to the military) in 1963. In September 1962, he [...] "promoted" [...] the powerful General Nasution to the less-influential position of Armed Forces Chief, while the influential position of Army Chief was given to Sukarno's loyalist Ahmad Yani. Meanwhile, the position of Air Force Chief was given to Omar Dhani, who was an open communist sympathiser. In May 1964, Sukarno banned activities of Manifesto Kebudajaan (Manikebu), an association of artists and writers which included prominent Indonesian writers such as Hans <b>Bague</b> Jassin and Wiratmo Soekito, who were also dismissed from their jobs. Manikebu was considered a rival by the communist writer's association Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat (Lekra), led by Pramoedya Ananta Toer. In December 1964, Sukarno disbanded the Badan Pendukung Soekarnoisme (BPS), the [...] "Association for Promoting Sukarnoism", an organisation that sought to oppose communism by invoking Sukarno's own Pancasila formulation. In January 1965, Sukarno, under pressure from PKI, banned the Murba Party. Murba was a Trotskyite party whose ideology was antagonistic to PKI's orthodox line of Marxism.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{the diamond}} cross {{seen by the}} young officer in 1845 was set with {{diamonds}} great and small, and was, in his opinion, a gift from or through Rizzio. [...] "The queen wore it out of sight." [...] Here in the inventory we have a <b>bague</b> (which may be a cross) of diamonds small and great, connected with a secret only known to Rizzio's brother and to the queen. It is [...] "to be carried to one whose name the queen has spoken in her new secretary's ear" [...] (Joseph's), [...] "but dare not trust herself to write". [...] "It would be idle now to seek to pry into the mystery which was thus anxiously guarded," [...] says Dr. Robertson, editor of the queen's inventories. The doctor knew nothing of the vision which, perhaps, so nearly pried into the mystery. There is nothing like proof here, but there is just a presumption that the diamonds connected with Rizzio, and secretly worn by the queen, seen in the vision of 1845, are possibly the diamonds which, had Mary died in 1566, were to be carried by Joseph Rizzio to a person whose name might not safely be written. {35a} ...|$|E
