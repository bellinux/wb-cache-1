25|$|On 18 June 1985, {{the final}} for the Bulgarian Cup {{was held at}} the Vasil Levski National Stadium between CSKA and Levski Sofia. The match was marked by many {{questionable}} referee decisions and saw several brutal fights, including an assault on a referee by some of Levski's players. CSKA won the match 2–1, even though they had missed a penalty when the score was 2–0. By decree of the Central Committee of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> both teams were disbanded and re-founded under new management. CSKA was renamed Sredets while Levski was renamed Vitosha. Several players were banned from participating in official matches for varying periods of time, including Hristo Stoichkov and Kostadin Yanchev from CSKA. One year later, the committee's decision was reversed and the players were reinstated.|$|E
25|$|In October and November 1989 demonstrations on {{ecological}} {{issues were}} staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 – {{the day after}} the Berlin Wall was breached – Bulgaria's long-serving leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister Petar Mladenov. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) on 7 December. The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{lower end}} of the village (located west of today's Municipal building) was called Kasim Kuyucuk until 1931 and later Rakovski as a result of <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> {{assimilation}} policy.

25|$|The Macedonian {{literary}} circle (1938 – 1941) was {{a literary}} society created in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1938 by young and educated {{members of the}} Macedonian immigrant community, who were Bulgarian communists. After {{the resolution of the}} Comintern on the Macedonian Question published in 1934, the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> adopted its thesis and tried to urge some intellectuals to work out a plan {{for the creation of a}} distinct Macedonian language and for development of new Macedonian literature. With the foundation of this society, an attempt was made, to use it in order to do both. Most active from its members were: Nikola Vaptsarov, Venko Markovski, Kole Nedelkovski, Vasil Ivanovski, Gjorgji Abadžiev, Anton Popov, Mihail Smatrakalev, Dimitar Mitrev and others. However, the circle disbanded itself as useless in the spring of 1941, when most of Macedonia came under Bulgarian administration, and an euphoria overwhelmed its participiants, seeing in it a form of national unification.|$|E
25|$|Thracians or Thracian Bulgarians (Bulgarian: Тракийски българи or Тракийци) are a regional, ethnographic {{group of}} ethnic Bulgarians, inhabiting or native to Thrace. Today, the larger {{part of this}} {{population}} is concentrated in Northern Thrace, but much is spread across the whole of Bulgaria and the diaspora. Until {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century the Thracian Bulgarians lived also in the whole of Thrace, then part of the Ottoman Empire. After the persecutions during the Preobrazhenie Uprising and the ethnic cleansing, caused to the Bulgarian population in Eastern Thrace after the Second Balkan War, these people were expelled from the area. After World War I, Bulgaria was required to cede Western Thrace to Greece. A whole population of Bulgarians in Western Thrace was expelled into Bulgaria-controlled Northern Thrace. This was followed by a further population exchange between Bulgaria and Greece (under the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine), which radically changed the demographics of the region toward increased ethnic homogenization within the territories each respective country ultimately was awarded. At this period the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was compelled by Comintern to accept the formation of a new Thracian nation on the base of this people in order to include them in a new separate Thracian state, as a part of a future Balkan Communist Federation.|$|E

5000|$|Rabotnichesko Delo (Работническо дело, [...] "Workers' Deed") was {{a leftist}} Bulgarian {{newspaper}} {{that was the}} organ of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Central Committee {{and was one of}} the People's Republic of Bulgaria's highest-circulation newspapers. The newspaper was established in 1927 and was issued from Sofia. The paper was renamed to Duma in 1990. Duma, despite some financial troubles, is still issued today.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, the Politburo of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party’s</b> Central Committee {{proposed}} {{taking action}} against the Turkification of Gypsies, Tatars and Bulgarian Muslims. The measures included study of the ethnic origins of Bulgaria’s Tatars. This attested to a new policy: accentuating the community's ethnocultural specificity {{in an effort to}} highlight and restore the distinction (blurred as a result of Turkification) between Tatars and Turks.|$|R
50|$|Rabotnichesko Delo was {{initially}} the weekly of the Bulgarian Workers' Party. Although it was banned following the Bulgarian coup d'état of 1934, it was nevertheless published illegally until 1944. In 1938, it merged with Rabotnicheski Vestnik, the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> newspaper, founded in 1897. Rabotnichesko Delo criticized the bourgeois government, propagated {{the ideas of}} communism and was against the country's participation in World War {{as part of the}} Axis Powers, advocating closer ties with the Soviet Union instead.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in 1953, the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> began {{looking for a new}} leader to replace the rigid Chervenkov. In March 1954 it found a forty-one-year-old politburo member, Todor Zhivkov, who had {{commanded}} the People's Militia in Sofia at the end of World War II. [...] Zhivkov remained Party Secretary for thirty-three years, one of the longest rule of any Soviet-bloc leader.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> leaders took up {{a neutral}} {{position}} on the 9 June coup d'état and the subsequent June Uprising because it regarded {{what was happening in}} the country as [...] "struggle for power between the urban and rural bourgeoisie". This position was provoked by the belief of the party's older leaders, headed by Dimitar Blagoev and Todor Lukanov, that there were no ripe conditions for a revolution in Bulgaria yet.|$|E
2500|$|The September Uprising ( [...] , Septemvriysko vastanie) was {{an armed}} {{insurgency}} staged in September 1923 by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (BCP) under Comintern pressure, {{as an attempt}} to overthrow Alexander Tsankov's new government of Bulgaria that had come to power with the coup d'état of 9 June. Besides its communist base, the uprising was also supported by agrarians and anarchists. The uprising's goal was the [...] "establishment of a government of workers and peasants" [...] in Bulgaria, not the conversion of the country's socioeconomic system to communism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bulgarian</b> United <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (Bulgarian: Българска единна комунистическа партия) was a {{political}} party in Bulgaria. The party was founded on December 11, 1993. It was led by Atanas Vasilev and Michail Michailov.|$|R
5000|$|After {{spending}} some time in Moscow from 1918 on, from May 1919 to February 1920 he served as {{the representative of the}} Bolshevik Party in Bulgaria. In this capacity he criticized the perceived [...] "passivity" [...] of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>communists</b> under Dimitar Blagoev, and supported the efforts of some extreme-left factions to force the Bulgarian party to action through acts of terrorism such as the assassination of the former Interior Minister Mihail Takev in January 1920. While in Bulgaria, Goldstein was also active as a journalist in left-wing print media. In a brochure which he signed as [...] "Slavi Zidarov", Goldstein was critical of the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> inability to turn the 1918 soldier rebellion at Radomir into a nationwide communist revolution.|$|R

2500|$|From {{that time}} until the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union and the end of Communist rule in 1989, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and State Security coexisted in a closely symbiotic partnership, in which each supported the other. 11 (out of 15) [...] members of Bulgarian Orthodox Church's Holy Synod worked for communist State Security. The party supported the elevation of the exarchate to the rank of patriarchate in May 1953. The 1970 commemoration served to recall that the exarchate (which retained its jurisdictional borders until after World War I) included Macedonia and Thrace in addition to present-day Bulgaria. Along with other autocephalous Orthodox churches, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church does not recognize the autocephaly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.|$|E
2500|$|The Bulgarian royal house, of Catholic German extraction, was unsympathetic to the American {{inspired}} Protestants, {{and this}} mood became worse when Bulgaria sided with Germany in WWI and WWII. Matters became much worse when the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> took power in 1944. Like the Royal Family, it too saw Protestantism {{closely linked to}} the West and hence more politically dangerous than traditional Orthodox Christianity. This prompted repressive legislation in the form of [...] "Regulations for the Organization and Administration of the Evangelical Churches in the People's Republic of Bulgaria" [...] and resulted in the harshest government repression, possibly the worst in the entire Eastern Bloc, intended to extinguish Protestantism altogether. Mass arrests of pastors (and often their families), torture, long prison sentences (including four life sentences) and even disappearance were common. Similar tactics were used on parishioners. In fifteen highly publicized mock show-trials between 8 February and 8 March 1949, all the accused pastors confessed to a range of charges against them, including treason, spying (for both the US and Yugoslavia), black marketing, and various immoral acts. State appointed pastors were foist on surviving congregations. As late as the 1980s, imprisonment and exile were still employed to destroy the remaining Protestant churches. The Congregationalist magazine [...] "Zornitsa" [...] was banned; Bibles became unobtainable. As a result, the number of Congregationalists is small and estimated by Paul Mojzes in 1982 to number about 5,000, in 20 churches. (Total Protestants in Bulgaria were estimated in 1965 to have been between 10,000 and 20,000.) More recent estimates indicate enrollment in Protestant ("Evangelical" [...] or [...] "Gospel") churches of between 100,000 and 200,000, presumably reflecting the success of more recent missionary efforts of evangelical groups.|$|E

5000|$|As result, for a {{short period}} after World War II, the Yugoslav and <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Communist</b> leaders Josip Broz Tito and Georgi Dimitrov worked on a project to merge their two {{countries}} into a Balkan Federative Republic.

This was one of the conditions of the Bled Agreement, signed between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 1 August 1947. In November 1947, pressured by both the Yugoslavs and the Soviets, Bulgaria also signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.

50|$|For {{a period}} of some years after the war, the Yugoslav and Bulgarian leaders Josip Broz Tito and Georgi Dimitrov worked on a project to merge their two {{countries}} into a Balkan Federative Republic according to the projects of Balkan Communist Federation. As a concession to the Yugoslavian side, Bulgarian authorities agreed to the recognition of a distinct Macedonian ethnicity and language {{as part of their}} own population in the Bulgarian part of geographical Macedonia. This was one of the conditions of the Bled Agreement, signed between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 1 August 1947. In November 1947, pressured by both the Yugoslavs and the Soviets, Bulgaria also signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia, and teachers were sent from the Socialist Republic of Macedonia to Blagoevgrad Province to teach the Macedonian language. The Bulgarian president Georgi Dimitrov was sympathetic to the Macedonian Question. The <b>Bulgarian</b> government <b>Communist</b> <b>party</b> was compelled once again to adapt its stand to Soviet interests in the Balkans. The same process started regarding the populations in Dobrudja and Thrace. At the same time, the organisation of the old nationalist movement the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) in Bulgaria was suppressed by the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>communist</b> authorities.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Serbian and Bulgarian left-wing intellectuals envisioned {{in the early}} 20th century some sort of [...] "Balkan confederation" [...] {{including}} Macedonia, should the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire dissolve. This view was accepted from the Socialist International. In 1910, the First Balkan Socialist Conference was held in Belgrade, then within the Kingdom of Serbia. The main platforms at the first conference was the call for {{a solution to the}} Macedonian Question. It was offered to create a Balkan Socialist Federation and Macedonia would be a single state in it. After the Balkan Wars in 1915, it was confirmed on the Balkan Socialist Conference in Bucharest to create a Balkan Socialist Federation, and that divided from the imperialists Macedonia would be united into its framework. This ideology later found fruition {{with the support of the}} Soviet Union as an advent of Yugoslav communist federation. Various declarations were made during the 1920s and 1930s seeing the official adoption of Macedonism by the Comintern. In turn declarations were made by the Greek, Yugoslav and <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>communist</b> <b>parties,</b> as they agreed on its adoption as their official policy for the region. Also the demise of the IMRO and its ideology for much of the interwar period, led in Vardar Macedonia for part of the young local intellectuals, regarded at that time as Serbs, to find a solution in the ideology of Macedonism. This issue was supported during the Second World War by the Communist Resistance and in 1944 the wartime Communist leader Josip Broz Tito, proclaimed the People's Republic of Macedonia as part of the Yugoslav Federation, thus partially fulfilling the Comintern’s pre-war policy. He was supported by the Bulgarian leader from Macedonian descent and former General Secretary of the Comintern, Georgi Dimitrov in anticipation of a failed incorporation of the Bulgarian Macedonia into the People's Republic of Macedonia, and of Bulgaria itself into Communist Yugoslavia.|$|R
