5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective and differences in tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} salvage, clean-up, and {{compensation}} {{are believed to}} have totalled around US$120 million. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened the terminal and a feasibility study in 1985 showed that it no longer had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used the terminal (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic oil reserve. Initially, oil movement to and from the terminal was carried out by road. In 1990, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf war, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker to offload at the terminal on a one-off basis. In 1996, an unloading buoy was installed and this has been used since that time.|$|E

25|$|The Northridge {{earthquake}} led to {{a number}} of legislative changes. Due to the large amount lost <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies,</b> most insurance companies either stopped offering or severely restricted earthquake insurance in California. In response, the California Legislature created the California Earthquake Authority (CEA), which is a publicly managed but privately funded organization that offers minimal coverage. A substantial effort was also made to reinforce freeway bridges against seismic shaking, and a law requiring water heaters to be properly strapped was passed in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} total dollar amount of fraud is {{committed by the}} health insurance companies themselves. There are numerous studies and articles detailing examples of insurance companies intentionally not paying claims and deleting them from their systems, denying and cancelling coverage, and the blatant underpayment to hospitals and physicians beneath what are normal fees for care they provide. Although difficult to obtain the information, this fraud <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> can be estimated by comparing revenues from premium payments and expenditures on health claims.|$|E

25|$|Annuities {{provide a}} stream of {{payments}} and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies,</b> are regulated as insurance, and require {{the same kinds of}} actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and pensions that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a retiree will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.|$|E
25|$|Following {{approval}} of the vaccine, its entry in clinical practice was slow {{for a variety of}} reasons, including its cost, which was often not reimbursed <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies.</b> Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune and other side effects. Supported by some patient advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints.|$|E

The Somali government {{has been active in}} policing the area, though some believe that it wants to collaborate with the pirates as a bulwark against Islamist insurgents. An anti-piracy coalition known as Combined Task Force 150 established a Maritime Security Patrol Area in the Gulf of Aden, aided by India and Russia. By 2010, these patrols were paying off, with a steady drop in the number of incidents. As of October 2017, there were no major vessels or hostages remaining in pirate captivity.|$|E

500|$|The World Trade Center {{bombing in}} New York City in February 1993 had caused {{bankruptcy}} in 40% {{of the affected}} companies within {{two years of the}} attack, according to a report from analysts IDC. As a result of the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate bomb attacks, City-based companies were well-prepared to deal with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, with a spokesman for the Corporation of London stating: [...] "After the IRA bombs, firms redoubled their disaster recovery plans and the City recovered remarkably quickly. It has left the City pretty well-prepared for this sort of thing now." [...] The initial estimate of ¬£1 billion worth of damage was later downgraded, and the total cost of reconstruction was ¬£350 million. The subsequent payouts <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> resulted in them suffering heavy losses causing a crisis in the industry, including the near-collapse of the Lloyd's of London market. A government-backed insurance scheme, Pool Re, was subsequently introduced in Britain, with the government acting as a [...] "re-insurer of last resort" [...] for losses over ¬£75 million.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{ancillary}} costs that are higher in the U.S. Administrative costs are significantly higher in the U.S.; government mandates on record keeping and the diversity of insurers, plans and administrative layers involved in every transaction result in greater administrative effort.

Another ancillary cost is marketing, both <b>by</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>companies</b> and health care providers.
