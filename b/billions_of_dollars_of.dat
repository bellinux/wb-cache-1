On February 20, 2008, KFN was once again forced to delay the repayment of <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> commercial paper, and began {{a new round of}} talks with creditors. In April, KFN sold a controlling interest in a real estate subsidiary to an investment firm to raise cash and entered an agreement with the noteholders of certain secured commercial paper issued by two asset-backed entities.

5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are {{the primary}} cause of {{decomposition}} of wood, causing <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E

Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations also {{launched}} {{a series of}} humanitarian and relief efforts almost wholly funded by the United States. These efforts had important effects, but they lacked any central organization and planning, and failed to meet many of Europe's more fundamental needs. Already in 1943, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was founded to provide relief to areas liberated from Germany. UNRRA provided <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> rehabilitation aid, and helped about 8 million refugees. It ceased operation of displaced persons camps in Europe in 1947; many of its functions were transferred to several UN agencies.|$|E
25|$|U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded {{cautiously}} for {{the first}} several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets. On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region. The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's price of oil, and therefore control of the world economy, was at stake. Britain profited heavily from <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, {{who happened to be}} in the U.S. at the time.|$|E
25|$|Each year <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> illegal {{gambling}} {{takes place}} in New Jersey. Illegal gambling operations range from employees who make money on office sports betting pools to online poker websites to multimillion-dollar enterprises run by organized criminals. Despite the availability of legal gambling in New Jersey, {{studies have shown that}} illegal gambling persists because it offers options that are not available legally (e.g., casino gambling outside of Atlantic City), and because some gamblers prefer using a bookmaker whom they personally know. State law does not punish players, but a person operating an illegal gambling enterprise, or possessing equipment or records used for illegal gambling can face up to five years' imprisonment depending on the quantity and size of the bets. However, illegal gambling arrests are rare in New Jersey, and there is presumption of non-incarceration for first-time offenders.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in the <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989. Charleston was more used to hurricanes; historical preservation groups immediately stepped in to begin salvage and reconstruction, {{with the result that}} one year after Hugo, the city was virtually returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|Conrail was {{incorporated}} in Pennsylvania on October 25, 1974, and operations began April 1, 1976. The government owned 85% with employees owning the remaining 15%. The {{theory was that}} if the service was improved through increased capital investment, the economic basis of the railroad would be improved. During its first seven years, Conrail proved to be highly unprofitable, despite receiving <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>of</b> assistance from Congress. The corporation declared enormous losses on its federal income tax returns from 1976 through 1982, resulting in an accumulated net operating loss of $2.2 billion during that period. Congress once again reacted with support by passing the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 (NERSA), which amended portions of the 3R Act by exempting Conrail from liability for any state taxes and requiring the Secretary of Transportation to make arrangements {{for the sale of}} the government's interest in Conrail. After NERSA was implemented, Conrail, under the aggressive leadership of L.
