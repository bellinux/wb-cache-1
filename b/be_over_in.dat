Ohio State's football program, meanwhile, struggled in 1943 after Brown {{and many of its}} best players entered the military during World War II. Carroll Widdoes, an assistant under Brown, was appointed the acting head coach and led the team to a 3–6 record.|$|E

No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E

Meetings always started at six in the evening so that dinner would <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> time for the Royal Society meetings at 8:00 or 8:30pm in the Burlington House.|$|E
25|$|Madison {{hoped that}} the war would <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> a couple months after the capture of Canada, but his hopes were quickly dashed. Madison had {{believed}} the state militias would rally to the flag and invade Canada, but the governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate. Their militias either sat out the war or refused to leave their respective states for action. The senior command at the War Department and in the field proved incompetent or cowardly—the general at Detroit surrendered to a smaller British force without firing a shot. Gallatin discovered the war {{was almost impossible to}} fund, since the national bank had been closed and major financiers in the Northeast refused to help. The American campaign in Canada, led by Henry Dearborn, ended with defeat in the Battle of Stoney Creek. The British armed American Indians in the Northwest, most notably several tribes allied with the Shawnee chief, Tecumseh. But, after losing control of Lake Erie at the naval Battle of Lake Erie in 1813, the British were forced to retreat. General William Henry Harrison caught up with them at the Battle of the Thames, where he destroyed the British and Indian armies, killed Tecumseh, and permanently destroyed Indian power in the Great Lakes region. Madison remains the only president to lead troops in battle while in office, although that battle (the Battle of Bladensburg in 1814) did not go well for the American side. The British then raided Washington, as Madison headed a dispirited militia. Dolley Madison rescued White House valuables and documents shortly before the British burned the White House, the Capitol and other public buildings.|$|E

25|$|A 'Welcome Home Ken Barrington' {{dance was}} {{arranged}} {{on his return}} from New Zealand where he was presented with a silver trophy to a standing ovation {{in front of the}} Surrey team. With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington's achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by an innings. The Second Test at Lord's is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England's reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord's balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw. Fred Trueman's 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell's team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For all the excitement provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as {{this was the kind of}} cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) was less than what was expected of him. Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called Running in Hundreds, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.|$|E

He also cites Andrew Baterina from SoReal Cru; Movement Lifestyle's members Keone Madrid, Lyle Beniga, and Shaun Evaristo; Ian Eastwood; and Twitch. Park is also inspired by Taiwanese-American NBA player Jeremy Lin, saying that Lin [...] "was off the radar and now he’s {{playing with the}} best of the best. People can’t hate on him even though they want to because he’s so good. That’s how a K-pop star has to <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> America if they want to succeed. They have to be so good in every single way that even if people hate, they can’t really say anything".|$|E
500|$|Harkins resented his {{decreasing}} relevance, {{especially as}} his term in Vietnam would <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> six months anyway, {{so he decided}} to try to regain influence lost to Lodge by altering the shape of the Saigon regime. The split between Harkins and Lodge was also kept unresolved by domestic political imperatives in Washington. The Defense Department would not drop their support for Harkins, so he was not recalled early. Although Johnson said of Lodge [...] "He ain't worth a damn. He can't work with anybody. He won't let anybody else work", the president chose not to try to force any changes due to the upcoming US Presidential election. Lodge was the front-runner for the Republican nomination at the time, and Johnson wanted to keep him in Saigon rather than having the ambassador in the US campaigning against him and the Democratic Party. Aside from Harkins, General Maxwell Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also known to regard Khánh as the nation's foremost general, while Undersecretary of State George Ball told Lodge that [...] "Our [...] impression is that Khánh {{is one of the best}} of the generals, both courageous and sophisticated." [...] Khánh was known for his pro-American views, and Lodge's aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Khánh was not only a fluent speaker of English, but [...] "he spoke American; American Army in fact." [...] On one occasion Khánh had told American officials that South Vietnam [...] "must rely on American support".|$|E

2500|$|James Franklin and Chris Martin led the NZ attack, taking three wickets {{each for}} almost no runs at all, as the Zimbabwean's were {{dismissed}} for a dismal 59, with only Taylor (10) and Carlisle (20 not out) and extras (14) making double figures. [...] Five players, including all-rounder Streak failed to score. Forced to follow on, the home side managed 99 in nearly 50 overs. Hamilton Masakadza's 42 {{was the sole}} highlight, while nine batsmen were dismissed in single figures, and Vettori enjoyed a cheap four for 28. In the process, Zimbabwe became only the second Test side to be dismissed twice in a single day's play, {{and it was only}} the fourth Test match to <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> two days since 1948.|$|E

The podcast had some of the music (from outside sources) cut because of restrictions due to artist royalties (although a new joke was inserted in place of the music, such as [...] "Don't worry, it'll <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> a minute", or rants about the BBC's lawyers), although the complete show could still be heard for seven days after the broadcast on the BBC's listen again feature. This podcast was the fourth most popular podcast in August 2006, according to Schott's Almanac. However, due {{to the end of the}} trial, the twenty-second series, running from June to August 2007, was not available for download.

2500|$|The next {{battle for}} the 1st Marine Division would be the bloodiest yet at the Battle of Peleliu. They landed on 15 September 1944 {{as part of the}} III Amphibious Corps assault on the island. The division's {{commanding}} general, Major General William H. Rupertus had predicted the fighting would be, [...] "...tough but short. It'll <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> three or four days – a fight like Tarawa. Rough but fast. Then we can go back to a rest area." [...] Making a mockery of the prediction, {{the first week of the}} battle alone cost the division 3,946 casualties, during which time they secured the key airfield sites. [...] The division fought on Peleliu for one month before being relieved. [...] Some of the heaviest fighting of the entire war took place in places such as Bloody Nose Ridge and the central ridges of the island that made up the Umurbrogol Pocket. [...] The month of fighting against the 14th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) on Peleliu cost the 1st Marine Division 1,252 dead and 5,274 wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Fears {{over the}} ability of Pete Doherty to appear [...] proved unfounded as he was {{reported}} to have gone on a booze session and then slept on a mattress for two hours in his dressing room before taking to Stage 2/NME with Babyshambles. The band then went on to watch Bright Eyes perform on the Pet Sounds Stage. However Amy Winehouse threw the Sunday line-up on Stage 2/NME into chaos by pulling out of the festival. [...] As a result, many of the acts performing on that stage, such as The Thrills, CSS, Dogs and My Chemical Romance, began earlier or later than planned, to the disapproval of some fans. Another casualty was Snow Patrol keyboardist, Tom Simpson who was arrested following the band's appearance at Live Earth on the same day as their Oxegen performance. Despite this misfortune, the rest of the band carried on as planned as they performed a well-received headlining set that included [...] "Run", [...] "Chasing Cars" [...] and [...] "Open Your Eyes". [...] They even questioned if their loyal fans would rather <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> the Green Room watching Editors instead before dedicating a song to the band.|$|E

[...] In the fourth game, Evert would get her only game of the set that came off a break of service from Goolagong, but this set would <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> a half hour with an Evert loss of 6 games to her one. [...] The second set was delayed by rain partly the way through, but when they {{returned}} to the court it would be a more of the same. [...] Evert had a hard-time maintain her serve by hitting a drop shot from the baseline in the fourth game of the set. [...] At 4 games to three, Evert was up a break in the set, but Goolagong would break her serve to level the set at 4 games-all. [...] In the next game, Evert would be unable to convert on three breakpoint opportunities, which would prove costly later on. [...] Evert would eventually find herself in a must win tiebreaker, but would lose 4 to 7 points in the breaker.|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{was just}} one of an {{influential}} group of high-ranking Allied air commanders who continued to believe that massive and sustained area bombing alone would force Germany to surrender. On a number of occasions he wrote to his superiors claiming the war would <b>be</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> a matter of months, first in August 1943 following the tremendous success of the Battle of Hamburg (codenamed Operation Gomorrah), and then again in January 1944. Winston Churchill continued to regard the area bombing strategy with distaste, and official public statements still maintained that Bomber Command was attacking only specific industrial and economic targets, with any civilian casualties or property damage being unintentional but unavoidable. In October 1943, emboldened by his success in Hamburg and increasingly irritated with Churchill's hesitance to endorse his tactics wholeheartedly, Harris urged the government to be honest with the public regarding the purpose of the bombing campaign: [...] "The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive ... should be unambiguously stated [...] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany ... the destruction of houses, public utilities, transport and lives, the creation of a refugee problem on an unprecedented scale, and the breakdown of morale both at home and at the battle fronts by fear of extended and intensified bombing, are accepted and intended aims of our bombing policy. They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories." ...|$|E
