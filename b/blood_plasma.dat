5|$|In <b>blood</b> <b>plasma,</b> zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in <b>blood</b> <b>plasma</b> stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E

The measurements of the viscosity showed that whole <b>blood</b> and <b>plasma</b> behave as non-Newtonian power law fluid.

40|$|The {{influence}} of haematocrit on blood cyclosporin measurements {{has been studied}} in 276 paired <b>blood</b> and <b>plasma</b> samples from 21 renal transplant patients. A highly significant correlation was found between <b>blood</b> and <b>plasma</b> cyclosporin concentrations, r = 0. 8744, but the correlation between <b>blood</b> or <b>plasma</b> cyclosporin and haematocrit was not significant.

5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days.

A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed.

5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in <b>blood,</b> <b>plasma,</b> or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the <b>blood</b> <b>plasma,</b> including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a <b>blood</b> <b>plasma</b> concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E
5|$|Selenium may be {{measured}} in <b>blood,</b> <b>plasma,</b> serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.|$|E

In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell <b>blood</b> <b>plasma</b> in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that an increased whole <b>blood</b> and <b>plasma</b> viscosity contribute to diabetic organ complications. Blood viscosity {{was measured in}} 30 controls and four groups of insulin-dependent diabetic patients at three shear rates: 70 sec- 1, 0. 5 sec- 1 and 0. 05 sec- 1. Results were compared before and after correction for a haematocrit of 0. 45. Twenty-five patients without organ complications, 21 with microalbuminuria, 13 with overt nephropathy and 12 patients with leg ulcerations were studied. <b>Blood</b> and <b>plasma</b> viscosity were normal in the patients without organ complications and with microalbuminuria. Plasma viscosity was significantly elevated in the diabetic patient with nephropathy and leg ulceration.

In conclusion <b>blood</b> and <b>plasma</b> viscosity were only elevated in the patients with major organ complications {{and not in the}} patients without or with early complications.

5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is {{taken up by the}} B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in <b>blood</b> <b>plasma</b> and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the <b>blood</b> <b>plasma,</b> while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E

Anti-doping tests at the 2001 World Nordic skiing championships in Lahti, Finland revealed that Jari Isometsä, Janne Immonen and two other skiers from Finland's gold-medal relay team, Mika Myllylä and Harri Kirvesniemi, and two female skiers tested positive for hydroxyethyl starch (HES), a <b>blood</b> <b>plasma</b> expander usually used {{to cover up the}} use of erythropoietin (EPO).
