40|$|Components of the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) are {{subjected}} to a severe environment that includes high-temperature, high-velocity flows. Such flows represent a source of energy that can induce and sustain large-amplitude vibratory stresses and/or result in fluidelastic instabilities. Three components are already known to have experienced failures in evaluation tests {{as a result of}} flow-induced structural motion. These components include the liquid-oxygen (LOX) posts, the fuel turbine <b>bellows</b> <b>shield,</b> and the internal inlet tee splitter vane. Researchers considered the dynamic behavior of each of these components with varying degrees of effort: (1) a theoretical and experimental study of LOX post vibration excited by a fluid flow; (2) an assessment of the internal inlet tee splitter vane vibration (referred to as the 4000 -Hz vibration problem); and (3) a preliminary consideration of the <b>bellows</b> <b>shield</b> problem. Efforts to resolve flow-induced vibration problems associated with the SSMEs are summarized...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} {{streak camera}} measurements of unsta-ble bunches emitting bursts of coherent microwave and in-frared radiation. Our {{goal was to}} understand the origin of the impedance which excites the instability, creating lon-gitudinal beam density modulation during coherent bursts. The two possible candidates were the impedance from the corrugated <b>bellow</b> <b>shields</b> in the vacuum chamber or the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) impedance. To dis-tinguish between the two we checked if the beam den-sity modulation frequency depends on beam energy. Our data favor the impedance from the shields over CSR as the source of the measured modulation. ...|$|R
40|$|In two beam {{commissioning}} periods, {{clear evidence}} for intensity-related effects {{has been seen}} at the PEP-II High Energy Ring. In the presence of one unshielded bellows, beam currents appeared limited to about 60 mA and pronounced vertical beam motion was seen, which scraped parts of the beam out of the ring. With all <b>bellows</b> <b>shielded,</b> beam currents up to 300 mA were obtained, limited by a loss of longitudinal control at the highest beam current. Tune shift with intensity was observed, and there is evidence {{for an increase in}} bunch motion along an injected bunch train. ...|$|R
40|$|Towards {{the end of}} Run 5, {{transverse}} {{instability in}} the High Energy Ring (HER) curtailed the maximum beam current achievable during physics running. Techniques used in tracking down this instability included fast monitoring of background radiation, temperatures and vacuum pressure. In this way, {{the origin of the}} instability was localized and inspection of the vacuum system revealed several damaged <b>bellows</b> <b>shields.</b> Replacing these units significantly reduced the incident rate but did not eliminate it fully. After the end of the run, a number of damaged rf seals were found, possibly having caused the remaining incidents of instability. In Run 6, instability has recurred. In this paper we will outline the steps taken to diagnose the issue and compare the different signatures of instabilities we have seen in PEP-II...|$|R
40|$|In {{particle}} accelerators, bellows {{are commonly}} used to connect beamline components. Such <b>bellows</b> are traditionally <b>shielded</b> to lower the beam impedance. Excessive beam impedance can cause overheating in the bellows, especially in high beam current operation. For an SRF-based accelerator, the bellows must also be particulate free. Many designs of <b>shielded</b> <b>bellows</b> incorporate rf slides or fingers that prevent convolutions from being exposed to wakefields. Unfortunately these mechanical structures tend to generate particulates that, if left in the SRF accelerator, can migrate into superconducting cavities, the accelerator&#x 27;s critical components. In this paper, we describe a prototype unshielded bellows that has low beam impedance and no risk of particulate generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus for}} {{this study is the}} {{illumination}} of the function of loom weights and their purpose within the warp-weighted loom. This study deals with Iron Age loom weights excavated at Birka, within the area known as the Garrison. This category of objects was originally classified as being fragments of <b>bellow</b> <b>shields,</b> an interpretation seemingly more corresponding with the site’s traditional interpretation. In order to give a fuller depiction of the textile production as a whole, spindle whorls found within the same defined area have also been included in this study. The main goal for the analyses of these two groups of fragmented finds has been to establish and re-create the functioning variables of these objects, that is, foremost their original shape and weight. Furthermore the objective has been to enhance the understanding of the functional parameters of the textile production in this area. This is partly achieved with the aid of comparing data regarding textile implements found in other areas of Birka. The results can confirm that the area held a capacity to manufacture a variety of different textiles, including very fine threads and weaves...|$|R
40|$|The short {{interconnect}} length {{between the}} LHC superconducting magnets required {{the development of}} an optimised RF <b>shielded</b> <b>bellows</b> module, with a low impedance combined with compensation for large thermal displacements and alignment lateral offsets. Each <b>bellows</b> is <b>shielded</b> by slender copper-beryllium fingers working as preloaded beams in order to provide a constant force at the sliding contact. Unless the sliding friction and some geometrical parameters of the fingers are kept within a limited range, a large irreversible lateral deflection towards the vacuum chamber axis may occur and eventually block the beam aperture. The finite element analysis presented here simulates this failure mechanism, providing a complete understanding of the finger behaviour as well as the influence of the various design parameters. An implicit nonlinear two-dimensional model integrating friction on the sliding contacts, geometrical non-linearity and plasticity was implemented in a first stage. The design was then verified through the whole working range using an explicit formulation, which overcame the instabilities resulting from the sudden release of internal energy stored in the finger...|$|R

40|$|The „shields ” are PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) {{that can}} be placed over the Arduino boards, {{extending}} their capabilities.

The results of numerical simulations and impedance measurements for the <b>shielded</b> <b>bellows</b> are presented.

40|$|We {{present the}} history and {{analysis}} of different wake field effects throughout the operational life of the PEP-II SLAC B-factory. Although the impedance of {{the high and low}} energy rings is small, the intense high current beams generated a lot of power. The effects from these wake fields are: heating and damage of vacuum beam chamber elements like RF seals, vacuum valves, <b>shielded</b> <b>bellows,</b> BPM buttons and ceramic tiles; vacuum spikes, vacuum instabilities and high detector background; beam longitudinal and transverse instabilities. We also discuss the methods used to eliminate these effects. Results of this analysis and the PEP-II experience may be very useful in the design of new storage rings and light sources...|$|R
40|$|High {{luminosity}} in electron-positron factories requires high {{currents of}} very short bunches. SLAC PEP-II and KEKB B-factories are progressively increasing currents gaining {{more and more}} luminosity [1 - 2]. Simultaneously the interaction of high currents and vacuum chamber elements becomes more important for operation of the rings. High Order Modes excited by short intense bunches are propagating along the vacuum chamber, penetrating and dissipating inside vital vacuum elements, like <b>shielded</b> <b>bellows,</b> vacuum valves and vacuum pump. As a result, these elements get large temperature rise or temperature oscillations. Often HOM heating has a resonance character. HOM heating of vacuum pumps leads to increasing of the vacuum pressure. High frequency modes “check ” the quality of vacuum chamber: they detect small gaps, weak RF screens or feed-through. Smooth tapers and collimators become the source of HOM production. We will discuss the physical nature of these excitin...|$|R

The sys-tems have performed well, reaching the design pressures {{and being able to}} cope with beam currents of almost 1 A (HER) and in excess of 2 A (LER). The photo-desorption coefficient η was found in the HER to have reached values as low as 10 − 7. The <b>shielded</b> <b>bellows</b> have performed very well, with only one pair of bellows assemblies damaged due to higher-order mode generation from a known, nearby source. Issues encountered during normal operation have been a significant amount of dust trapping in the HER and the effect of a cloud of photo-electrons around the positron beam affecting the LER beam size. A couple of chambers in the HER failed; these failures arose from a combination of design and fabrications issues. The beam life time in the LER has been lower than expected based on the vacuum pressure and has been determined to be Touschek limited. ...|$|R
