40|$|Acquired {{ichthyosis}} (AI) is a reactive cutaneous manifestation {{that can}} be associated with malignant hematological disease, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Since it is difficult to distinguish AI from ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides, to select the treatment for CTCL with ichthyosis-like appearance and to evaluate its efficacy is sometimes challenging. In this report, we describe a case of primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified presenting AI successfully treated with oral bexarotene. In the present case, the administration of oral bexarotene was not only effective for lymphoma cells infiltrating ulcers and nodules, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> also eliminated <b>AI...</b>|$|R

[...] Kirkus Reviews was also positive about the novel saying [...] "Modesitt's abundant novelistic virtues--great characters and plotting, impressive attention to detail--aside: this is smart, aware, provocative, and engrossing on several political, economic, and professional levels." [...] Publishers Weekly said [...] "Modesitt strives for emotional rather than intellectual satisfaction. His future has much eye-pleasing chrome, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> lacks infrastructure, making the book seem more contemporary techno-thriller than SF (parents queuing up in hydrogen-powered cars {{to pick up their}} kids after school)." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is unknown}} {{exactly how the}} surgery Professor Kasukabe worked, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems to have changed Ai significantly. He is not {{explicitly}} shown using Smoke when he fought Shin and Noi or En, but {{all three of them}} felt an eerie sense of disquiet when facing him. They feel it again when they encounter him six years later and recognise <b>it.</b> <b>Ai</b> seems to be extremely powerful, being a master of the knife and possessing extreme speed. He easily kills En in Volume 12, decapitating him. He later removes the Devil Tumor from En's head and surprisingly uses En's Magic against Shin and Noi, severely injuring them. The Magic, as noted by Shou, seemed much more potent than En's as even an Elite regenerative Sorcerer like Noi required a month to regain consciousness.|$|R

40|$|Compiler {{design for}} stack machines, in {{particular}} register allocation, is an under researched area. In this thesis I present {{a framework for}} analysing and developing register allocation techniques for stack machines. Using this framework, I analyse previous register allocation methods and develop two new algorithms for global register allocation, both of which outperform previous algorithms, and {{lay the groundwork for}} future enhancements. Finally I discuss how effective global register allocation for stack machines can influence the design of high performance stack architectures. Included with this thesis is a portable C compiler for stack machines, which incorporates these new register allocation methods. The C compiler and associated tools (assembler, linker and simulator) are included in the CD.

40|$|Humans {{confront the}} {{unexpected}} every day, deal with it, and often learn from <b>it.</b> <b>AI</b> agents, {{on the other}} hand, are typically brittle—they tend to break down as soon as something happens for which their creators did not explicitly anticipate. The central focus of our research project is this problem of brittleness which {{may also be the}} single most important problem facing AI research. Our approach to brittleness is to model a common method that humans use to deal with the unexpected, namely to note occurrences of the unexpected (i. e., anomalies), to assess any problem signaled by the anomaly, and then to guide a response or solution that resolves it. The result is the Note-Assess-Guide procedure of what we call the Metacognitive Loop or MCL. To do this, we have implemented MCL-based systems that enable agents to help themselves; they must establish expectations and monitor them, note failed expectations, assess their causes, and then choose appropriate responses. Activities for this project have developed and refined a human-dialog agent and a robot navigation system to test the generality of this approach...|$|R
