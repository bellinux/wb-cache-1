40|$|Hurricane Katrina {{elevated}} levee {{risk in the}} US national consciousness, motivating {{agencies to}} assess and improve their levee risk assessment methodology. Accurate computation of the flood flow magnitude and timing associated with a levee <b>breach</b> {{remains one of the}} most difficult and uncertain components of levee risk analysis. Contemporary methods are largely empirical and approximate, introducing substantial uncertainty to the damage and life loss models. Levee <b>breach</b> progressions are often extrapolated to the final width and <b>breach</b> formation time based on limited experience with past <b>breaches</b> or using regression equations developed from a limited data base of dam failures. Physically based embankment erosion models could improve levee <b>breach</b> modeling. However, while several mechanistic embankment <b>breach</b> models are available, they were developed for dams. Several aspects of the levee <b>breach</b> problem are distinct, departing from dam <b>breach</b> assumptions. This study applies three embankments models developed for dam <b>breach</b> analysis (DL <b>Breach,</b> HR <b>BREACH,</b> and WinDAM C) to historic levee <b>breaches</b> with observed (or inferred) <b>breach</b> rates, assessing the limitations, and applicability of each model to the levee <b>breach</b> problem...|$|R

40|$|Current law and {{economics}} scholarship analyzes efficient <b>breach</b> cases monolithically. The standard analysis holds that <b>breach</b> is efficient when {{performance of a contract}} generates a negative total surplus for the parties. However, by simplistically grouping efficient <b>breach</b> cases as of a single kind, the prior literature overlooks that gainseeking <b>breaches</b> might be different from loss-avoiding <b>breaches.</b> To capture these different motives, we designed a novel game called Contract-Breach Game where we exogenously varied the reasons for the <b>breach</b> — pursuing a gain or avoiding a loss — under a specific performance remedy. Results from an incentivized laboratory experiment indicate that the motives behind the <b>breach</b> induce sizable differences in behavior; subjects are less willing to renegotiate when facing gain-seeking than loss-avoiding <b>breaches,</b> and the compensation premium obtained by the promisee is higher. Our analysis suggests that inequality aversion is an important driver of our results; indeed, inequality-averse subjects accept low offers more often in cases of loss-avoiding <b>breaches</b> than gain-seeking <b>breaches.</b> These results give us insight into the preferences and expectations of ordinary people in a case of a <b>breach...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{estimate}} {{the proportion of}} ADVOs <b>breached</b> and identify factors associated with a <b>breach</b> of a final order. Method: Details of all ADVOs granted between 1 July 2013 and 30 June 2014 (inclusive) were extracted from the NSW COPS database and linked to <b>breach</b> ADVO incidents occurring after 1 July 2013 and before 30 June 2015 using defendant and victim identifying information. <b>Breaches</b> were assigned to a particular order if they occurred after the order issue date and before the order expiry date or before a higher ADVO order was issued. Multivariate analysis was undertaken to examine factors independently associated with the time to first <b>breach</b> of a final ADVO. Results: Overall 23, 240 provisional orders, 18, 045 interim orders and 24, 458 final orders were issued during the observation period. The <b>breach</b> rate was much higher for final orders (20 %), which are longer in duration, than for provisional (5 %) or interim (9 %) orders. When <b>breaches</b> occurred, most often only one incident per order was recorded (88 % of provisional order <b>breaches,</b> 73 % of interim order <b>breaches</b> and 64 % of final order <b>breaches).</b> Of all ADVOs which did record a <b>breach,</b> 34 % were <b>breached</b> within one month of being granted, 23 % within 1 - 3 months and 18 % within 3 - 6 months. Male, Indigenous and younger POIs <b>breached</b> their final order sooner than other defendants. Final orders protecting just one victim, non-Indigenous victims or victims aged less than 20 took longer to be <b>breached.</b> Conclusion: Only a minority proportion of ADVOs record a <b>breach</b> whilst the order is in effect.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Assessing {{the value}} of {{information}} technology (IT) security is challenging {{because of the difficulty}} of measuring the cost of security <b>breaches.</b> An event-study analysis, using market valuations, was used {{to assess the impact of}} security <b>breaches</b> on the market value of <b>breached</b> firms. The information-transfer effect of security <b>breaches</b> (i. e., their effect on the market value of firms that develop security technology) was also studied. The results show that announcing an Internet security <b>breach</b> is negatively associated with the market value of the announcing firm. The <b>breached</b> firms in the sample lost, on average, 2. 1 percent of their market value within two days of the announcement—an average loss in market capitalization of $ 1. 65 billion per <b>breach.</b> Firm type, firm size, and the year the <b>breach</b> occurred help explain the cross-sectional variations in abnormal returns produced by security <b>breaches.</b> The effects of security <b>breaches</b> are not restricted to the <b>breached</b> firms. The market value of security developers is positively associated with the disclosure of security <b>breaches</b> by other firms. The security developers in the sample realized an average abnormal return of 1. 36 percent during the two-day period after the announcement—an average gain of $ 1. 06 billion in two days. The study suggests that the cost of poor security is very high for investors...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} the situational and offender characteristics associated with prison sentences for Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) <b>breaches.</b> Method: Case narratives from police incident reports of ADVO <b>breach</b> incidents in NSW were analysed. Two samples were examined: (1) <b>breach</b> incidents where the offender involved was imprisoned (n= 250) and (2) <b>breach</b> incidents where the offender involved received a non-custodial sentence (n= 250). The {{nature of the}} <b>breach</b> and the characteristics of persons involved in these two <b>breach</b> samples were compared using descriptive data and logistic regression models. Results: The majority of ADVO <b>breaches</b> in both samples involved male to female offending in spousal/ex-spousal relationships, occurred in the victim’s house and involved face-to-face contact. Compared with offenders in the non-prison group, {{a higher proportion of}} offenders who received a custodial penalty for the <b>breach</b> ADVO matter were male, Indigenous, had 5 or more prior court appearances (including prior offences for domestic violence (DV), assault and <b>breach</b> ADVO), had 3 or more prior prison penalties and had <b>breached</b> two or more conditions of their order. <b>Breaches</b> resulting in prison also had a higher proportion of matters involving physical assault, property damage, psychological aggression and parties who had a history of violence. After controlling for other factors, the following factors were independently associated with imprisonment for ADVO; the offender’s gender, prior imprisonment, prior proven DV offence, history of violence, involvement of physical assault in the <b>breach,</b> victim/offender relationship and residing with the victim. Conclusion: The profile of offenders who receive imprisonment for a <b>breach</b> ADVO offence is significantly different from those who receive a non-custodial penalty for these offences. The nature of the <b>breach</b> and the circumstances surrounding the event also vary for matters where prison is imposed for an ADVO <b>breach...</b>|$|R

40|$|Under very extreme {{conditions}} a flood {{that threatens to}} overtop a dam may be combined with strong winds that generate waves in the reservoir. Prolonged wave overtopping {{or a combination of}} wave overtopping followed by constant overflow may cause erosion of the dam crest and downstream face, leading to a dam <b>breach.</b> If these conditions occur in a reservoir with a long dam and an uneven crest, the dam may start to <b>breach</b> at multiple locations. If the <b>breach</b> at one location develops rapidly, the reservoir pool may be drawn down fast enough to “starve ” other <b>breach</b> locations so that the dam will only <b>breach</b> from one location ; otherwise, the dam may <b>breach</b> at multiple locations. A threedimensional numerical dam <b>breach</b> model was developed at the Utah State University to simulate this problem. The model incorporates the topography of the entire dam site and does not unrealistically limit the <b>breach</b> representation to a single dam height throughout the length of the dam. <b>Breaches</b> can be located anywhere {{along the length of the}} dam. The twodimensional Shallow Water Equations are solved at each <b>breach</b> location to calculate the flow characteristics. Threedimensional slope stability along the main flow direction in the <b>breach</b> channel is checked using Bishop’s simplified method before the dam fully <b>breaches</b> through.
