50|$|<b>Blue-spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> {{are known}} to be {{associated}} with unisexual (all-female) populations of ancient origin. The unisexual females often look like <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> but have hybrid genomes and require sperm from a co-occurring, related species to fertilize their eggs and initiate development. Usually the eggs then discard the sperm genome and develop asexually (i.e., gynogenesis, with premeiotic doubling); however, they may incorporate the genome from the sperm into the resulting offspring. Sperm incorporation commonly takes the form of genome addition (resulting in ploidy elevation in the offspring), or genome replacement, wherein one of the maternal genomes is discarded. This unique mode of reproduction has been termed kleptogenesis by Bogart and his colleagues.|$|R

50|$|A unique {{reproductive}} tactic for the Bluespotted-Jefferson Salamander Complex {{exists in}} nature. The Jefferson salamander {{is now known}} not to breed in the lab with the <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamander,</b> which was previously thought to produce 'hybrids', the silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander, between this supposed mating of Jefferson salamander and <b>Blue-spotted</b> <b>salamander.</b> The silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander are now known through genetic testing to be polyploid females (only 2% of males survive and they are sterile). These most often possess two of each chromosome from the Jefferson salamander and one of each chromosome from the <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamander,</b> resulting in an LJJ genotype (also called a Tremblay's salamander.) This genotype results when these polyploid females mate with a pure Jefferson salamander male, incorporating (often in warmer water conditions) the chromosome from the pure male Jefferson salamander into her egg, usually having an LJ diploid chromosome set or LJJ triploid chromosome set, to produce LJJ or LJJJ offspring, respectively. Often in cooler conditions, the LJ or LJJ female may mate with the Jefferson salamander male and only 'borrow' his spermatozoan to trigger genetic cloning of herself, not adding his chromosome (J) to her egg. The same polyploid reproductive strategy occurs for other mole salamander species. The presence of these polyploids {{makes it difficult to}} visually identify which species an individual may be, skewing population measures for both species.|$|E

Area-constrained surveys {{were conducted in}} each plot between 11 March and 3 June 2006 in which leaf litter and woody debris were searched for salamanders. Leaf litter density, soil temperature, and soil moisture were also measured to assess habitat conditions in burned and unburned plots. A total of 104 salamanders were captured during eleven sampling events: four <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma laterale), three spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), one eastern newt (Notophtalmus viridescens) and 96 red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus).

There was also no statistically significant difference in measured habitat characteristics in burned and unburned plots (paired t-test, p > 0. 05). The lack of a statistical difference in salamander captures and habitat structure between burned and unburned plots may be due to the patchy nature of the prescribed fire, which left greater than 75 % of two plots unburned. The practice of conducting low-intensity prescribed fire in oak-hickory woodlands does not appear to be harmful to salamanders when patches of land are left unburned. Further research should be conducted into the effects of fire specifically on Ambystoma salamanders and the eft phase of Eastern newts, as too few of these salamanders were captured to make reliable conclusions regarding their response to prescribed fire...|$|R

40|$|Wildlife {{in urban}} {{settings}} are a management challenge because wildlife populations and their habitats are often fragmented and degraded, but natural resource managers need information concerning their spatial distribution, spatial turnover, and spatial co-occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection. Based in the Chicago Metropolitan Area during 2009 - 2012, my study modeled 23 species across 5 wildlife taxa concerning patterns of site occupancy, spatial turnover (i. e., colonization and extinction), and/or spatial co-occurrence at 1 - 2 spatial scales. In detail, I investigated: (1) detection probabilities, site occupancy, and spatial turnover as affected by habitat and anthropogenic influences at 2 spatial scales for 6 species of songbirds: field sparrows (Spizella pusilla), great crested flycatchers (Myiarchus crinitus), willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii), bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), marsh wrens (Cistothorus palustris), and rose-breasted grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus); (2) detection probabilities, site occupancy, and spatial turnover as affected by habitat and anthropogenic influences at 2 spatial scales for 3 species of reptiles and 4 species of amphibians: common garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis), painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma laterale), tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), green frogs (Rana clamitans), and northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens); (3) habitat use and landscape site occupancy and spatial turnover as affected by habitat and anthropogenic influences for 4 species of mesocarnivores: coyotes (Canis latrans), raccoons (Procyon lotor), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana); and (4) detection probabilities and spatial distributions as affected by local habitat, an interacting species (dominant or subordinate), or both for 6 species of small mammals: short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), masked shrews (Sorex cinereus), and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus).

I examined the feasibility of reintroduction of three extirpated amphibians (spotted salamanders, wood frogs, and spring peepers) into MacArthur Woods Forest Preserve (MWFP) in Lake County, Illinois. MWFP is a flatwoods wetland north of Chicago that comprises the largest remnant tract of continuous forest in Lake County, Illinois. I examined the response of the amphibian community of MWFP to intensive habitat restoration implemented in 2000. Habitat restoration efforts included hydrologic alteration and removal of the exotic invasive shrub, European buckthorn. Four years after restoration commenced, I assessed the post-restoration amphibian community to determine if natural recolonization of the extirpated species had occurred. I examined amphibian responses to restoration through changes in species diversity over time. After determining that natural recolonization had not occurred, I assessed the feasibility of reintroduction for the three extirpated species from nearby extant source populations. Feasibility assessment included evaluation of restored habitat quality to ensure survival and recruitment of reintroduced amphibians, identification of threats to amphibian recruitment and persistence, and recommendations for additional restoration needs. I used a series of in situ experiments to compare hatching success and larval survival of amphibians in source population sites and restored sites. I compared hatching success and larval survival of the extirpated spotted salamander with its congener, the bluespotted salamander, that had persisted in MWFP. Using hatching experiments, I identified dissolved oxygen requirements of spotted and <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> as a habitat quality issue in need of additional restoration management. I used population viability analysis to project the probability of persistence of reintroduced spotted salamanders and wood frogs under several scenarios. Population models aided {{in the development of a}} reintroduction plan and in the evaluation of the probability of persistence of spotted salamanders and wood frogs released into MWFP. Finally, I examined the developmental impacts of emodin, a metabolite produced by the invasive European buckthorn, on the development of amphibians using the FETAX protocol. Emodin produced amphibian embryo malformation and mortality at ecologically relevant concentrations. This experiment identified a potential threat to the persistence of pondbreeding amphibians in areas where European buckthorn has become established...|$|R
40|$|Mole {{salamanders}} (Ambystoma) and woodfrogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) {{are abundant}} in New England and depend on ephemeral wetlands for breeding. Their aquatic habitats {{have been well}} studied and are protected by several local and regional regulations. State endangered species laws also protect mabled salamanders (A. opacum), Jefferson salamanders (A. jeffersonianum), and <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamanders</b> (A. laterale). However, these amphbibians {{spend most of their}} adult lives in terrestrial habitats that remain poorly protected and elusive to researchers. In chapter 1, I developed a novel technique using passive integrated transponders for tracking small animals. I used this technique to track marbled salamanders walking up to 200 m from their breeding pond during post-breeding migrations. In Chapter 2, I examined the importance of multiple habitat variables for predicting the distributions of woodfrogs and spotted salamanders at 455 ponds in western Massachusetts. Based on a variable-comparison technique I developed, the best predictor for either species of amphibian was the amount of forest in the surrounding vii landscape. Both species were found more frequently in upland forests where the ponds are least protected by state and federal wetland regulations. In chapter 3, I used my data from chapter 2 and three other similar data sets to conduct an analysis of spatial scale and to parameterize a recently published resistant kernel model. The complex model parameterized by an expert panel did significantly worse than the null model. The distributions of both amphibians were best predicted by measuring the landscape at very large scales (over 1000 m). The most effective scales for conservation may be largest for organisms of intermediate dispersal capability. In chapter 4, I explored the evolution and genetics of the Jefferson/blue-spotted/unisexual salamander complex. I framed research into the fascinating unisexual reproductive system with a model that relates nuclear genome replacement, positive selection on hybrids, and biogeography of the species complex. I parameterized this model using genetic data taken from salamanders spanning Massachusetts and an individual-based breeding simulation. If paternal genomes are transmitted to offspring with the frequencies reported from laboratory experiments, then my model suggests that there must be strong selection favoring unisexuals with hybrid nuclei...|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{amphibians}} that breed only in vernal pools {{spend most}} of their lives in the uplands within hundreds of feet of the vernal pool.

50|$|The nuclear DNA of the unisexuals {{generally}} comprises genomes from {{up to five}} species: the <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamander</b> (A. laterale), Jefferson salamander (A. jeffersonianum), small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), streamside salamander (A. barbouri), and {{tiger salamander}} (A. tigrinum), denoted respectively as L, J, T, B, and Ti. This flexibility results in {{a large number of}} possible nuclear biotypes (genome combinations) in the unisexuals. For example, an LJJ individual would be a triploid with one A. laterale genome and two A. jeffersonianum genomes, while an LTJTi individual would be a tetraploid with genomes from four species. Because they have hybrid genomes, unisexual salamanders are a cryptic species with morphology similar to coexisting species. For example, LLJs look like blue-spotted salamanders and LJJs look like Jefferson salamanders. Silvery salamanders LJJ (A. platineum), Tremblay's salamanders LLJ (A. tremblayi), and Kelly's Island salamanders LTT and LTTi (A. nothagenes) were initially described as species. Species names were later dropped for all unisexual salamanders because of the complexity of their genomes.

Embryos and tadpoles of six anurans, Bufo americanus, Rana sylvatica, Rana pipiens, Rana clamitans, Rana catesbeiana, and Hyla versicolor, and embryos and larvae of two salamanders, Ambystoma maculatum (the yellow-spotted salamander) and Ambystoma laterale (the <b>blue-spotted</b> <b>salamander),</b> were exposed to different UV-B radiation regimes in containers (12 cm in diameter and 4. 5 cm deep) with Nitex screening (1 mm) on the sides to permit natural exchange with pond water. The containers were secured to a floating structure in a small natural pond in south-central Ontario, where most of the species tested lived and successfully recruited offspring. Three exposure conditions were evaluated: (i) natural incident light, (ii) incident light with the UV-B radiation filtered out, and (iii) incident light with the UV-B radiation enhanced by UV-B lamps. Embryos of all species hatched successfully under enhanced and incident UV-B radiation conditions. However, salamander larvae and anuran tadpoles were sensitive to enhanced UV-B radiation conditions and a differential sensitivity was observed based on developmental stage. When 2 weeks old, anuran tadpoles showed greater sensitivity than when newly hatched. Incident levels of UV-B radiation had no significant effect on tadpoles or larvae. Because of the tolerance of the embryos and the very rapid attenuation of UV-B radiation in the water of small ponds (high in dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), little direct damage is likely to occur during the aquatic stages of these amphibians...|$|E
