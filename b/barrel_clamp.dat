25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down and bolted to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the <b>barrel</b> <b>clamp.</b> The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E
5000|$|Roll and <b>barrel</b> <b>clamp</b> {{attachment}} - A mechanical or hydraulic attachment used {{to squeeze}} the item to be moved. It is used for handling barrels, kegs, or paper rolls. This type of attachment may also have a rotate function. The rotate function would help an operator to insert a vertically stored paper into the horizontal intake of a printing press for example.|$|E

50|$|The {{curling iron}} {{can also have}} either a spring-loaded, Marcel, or {{clipless}} handle. Spring-loaded handles {{are the most popular}} and use a spring to work the <b>barrel's</b> <b>clamp.</b> When using a Marcel handle, one applies his or her own pressure to the clamp. Clipless wands have no clamp, and the user simply wraps hair around a rod. Most clipless curling irons come with a Kevlar glove to avoid burns.|$|R
50|$|The barrel is {{interchangeable}} {{with other}} calibres; {{this can be}} done in the field in about 15 minutes. With the <b>barrel</b> <b>clamped</b> in a <b>barrel</b> vice, the barrel is removed from the action, and another one screwed into the action and tightened in place with a torque wrench. Newer versions of Accuracy International rifles including the AX, AT (Accuracy Tactical), and AXMC (AX Multi-Calibre) feature a switch-barrel system that allow the user to change out the barrel with only the use of a 4mm hex wrench, allowing field barrel changes in under a minute.|$|R
50|$|The {{base plate}} is very heavy and is fitted with four {{carrying}} handles. The sight bracket fits the standard mortar sight. The barrel is heavily reinforced at the muzzle {{and has two}} raised ribs midway of the barrel, between which the <b>barrel</b> <b>clamping</b> collar is held. The firing mechanism {{is similar to that}} used on the Type 99, 81 mm short mortar. After the weapon has been loaded, a plunger, which projects upward from the mortar breech, is struck with a mallet or similar instrument, thus camming out the firing pin and firing the mortar. A safety lock is fitted on this firing plunger.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Barrel</b> <b>clamp</b> {{is widely}} used in {{metallurgy}} factories to convey steel barrels as specialized holding equipments. It is baked by barrel under high temperature during in working time, which will cause unfavorable effect {{to the performance of}} the clamp parts, especially hydraulic system. The thermal field of the hydraulic system was analyzed, which will be quantified to really reflect the temperature distribution of the hydraulic system. According to Analysis of the temperature distribution of the hydraulic oil, it can check the rationality of the materials with anti-radiation and heat insulation chosen...|$|E

50|$|The RM-38 was a Soviet 50 mm light {{infantry}} mortar, {{developed as}} {{a variant of the}} M1938 120 mm mortar. The <b>barrel</b> was <b>clamped</b> at two elevation angles only - 45 and 75 degrees. Range variations were made by altering a sleeve round the base of the barrel. This sleeve opened a series of gas ports which bled off exhaust gases and so determined the range.|$|R
50|$|The rigid match grade rifled <b>barrel</b> is <b>clamped</b> in {{the loading}} gate mount. Removable barrel weights of 150 g and 280 g {{to adjust the}} balance of the rifle are {{available}} for the LGR rifles. For the LGR Moving Target variant 160 g and 310 g barrel weights are available. These barrel weights can be mounted and regulated by sliding and clamping them along the barrel according to the shooters preference.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{finite elements}} analysis for 99 % aluminum bars forging and cold welding, demonstrating {{the differences between the}} material displacements due to the different clamping and pressing techniques. The analytical method is confirming our previous laboratory tests, for the case of butt cold welding, that when the pressing force is acting, the material flows first inside the bar producing cold hardening and, after that, the <b>barrel</b> between the <b>clamps</b> is obtained. Conclusions regarding the history of total die force versus material displacements in both cases, and the complete bars stresses analysi...|$|R
40|$|Prototype {{monitoring}} techniques play {{an important}} role in the safety guarantee of mooring systems in marine engineering. In general, the complexities of harsh ocean environmental conditions bring difficulties to the traditional monitoring methods of application, implementation and maintenance. Large amounts of existing mooring systems still lack valid monitoring strategies. In this paper, an underwater monitoring method which may be used to achieve the mechanical responses of a multi-point catenary mooring system, is present. A novel self-contained assembled water depth-inclination (D-I) sensor is designed and manufactured. Several advanced technologies, such as standalone, low power consumption and synchronism, are considered to satisfy the long-term implementation requirements with low cost during the design process. The design scheme of the water resistance <b>barrel</b> and installation <b>clamp,</b> which satisfies the diver installation, are also provided in the paper. An on-site test has previously been carried out on a production semisubmersible platform in the South China Sea. The prototype data analyses, including the D-I value in the time domain (including the data recorded during the mooring retraction and release process) and spectral characteristics, are presented to reveal the accuracy, feasibility and stability of the sensor in terms of fitting for the prototype monitoring of catenary mooring systems, especially for in-service aging platforms...|$|R
