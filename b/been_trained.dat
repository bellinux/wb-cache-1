Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger.

5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E
5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style {{than those of the}} late 17th century; many had <b>been</b> <b>trained</b> in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E

During the two funeral services, Himmler—the chief mourner—took charge of Heydrich's two young sons, and he gave the eulogy in Berlin. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals for Heydrich's death. Over 13,000 people were arrested, and the village of Lidice was razed to the ground; its male inhabitants and all adults {{in the village of}} Ležáky were murdered. At least 1,300 people were executed by firing squads. Himmler took over leadership of the RSHA and stepped up the pace of the killing of Jews in Aktion Reinhard (Operation Reinhard), named in Heydrich's honour. He ordered the Aktion Reinhard camps—the first extermination camps—to be constructed at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka.|$|E
