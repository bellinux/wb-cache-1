These production rates are compared with those predicted by photochemical models: we calculate that for many neutral species, DR has larger production rates than neutral chemistry. Concerning molecular growth in Titan's ionosphere, DR is shown to have two antagonistic effects: (1) a global chemical lysis of ions through C-C and C-N bond breaking (missed by the "H-loss" DR paradigm); and (2) an enhancement of the neutral chemistry by production of reactive radicals, such as C 2 H or NH 2. Further exploration of this chemistry requires the development of ionospheric coupled models taking explicitly into account the richness of the DR process and the strong impact of ions on the <b>budget</b> of <b>neutral</b> species.

The comparison shows that the neutral production rates are at least of the same order of magnitude, with neutral fluxes from DR reactions which are often even larger. This first study confirms the necessity to build coupled models for the ionosphere taking into account the respective impacts of ions on the neutrals and of neutrals on the ions budget.

The aim of this discussion is to highlight the importance of gender budgeting in addressing gender disparities while taking note of the fact that gender is a key variable in development. The term gender budgeting will be defined in an effort to show how the practice can lead to gender equitable resource allocation and improve revenue generation for nations. This enables government’s commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment move from paper to practical policies. In gender budgeting there is the creation of awareness regarding gender specific issues in the policies of all government agencies. It also brings to light the effort of women in running the economy and attaining economic efficiency by including equity in budget performance indicators. Considering that most nations signed and ratified international commitments on gender equality and equity, it is expected of them to put in place realistic budgetary measures towards the achievement of gender equality. Despite the fact that gender budgeting is a relatively new concept, it is undoubtedly an important ingredient in quickening the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and the fulfilment of international commitments on gender equality.

40|$|Collapsible channel flows that {{originated}} from physiological applications have many intriguing dynamic system behaviours. In this thesis, {{the stability of}} a two-dimensional collapsible channel flow is studied numerically. Three approaches are adopted to investigate the fluid-structure interaction problem: an in-house Finite Element Method (FE) based Fluid-Beam model (FBM), a commercial FE based code, ADINA, and an eigensolver derived from the FBM (linear analysis). Two types of inlet boundary conditions are considered. One is the flow-driven system where the inlet flow rate is specified, {{and the other is}} the pressure-driven where the pressure drop is given. It turns out that these two systems yield very different dynamical features even though the steady solutions are the same. For the flow-driven system, a range of steady solutions are studied with both zero and non-zero initial wall tension by means of both FBM (using initial stress configuration) and ADINA (equipped with both initial strain and initial stress configurations). As expected, the FBM agrees with ADINA when using the initial stress configuration, but not when the initial strain configuration is adopted. This established the importance of the initial configuration. The effects of different wall thicknesses on the steady wall performance have also been shown as significant. Fully-coupled unsteady simulations have also been performed with FBM (Bernoulli-Euler beam) and ADINA (Timoshenko beam) to demonstrate significant influences of modelling assumptions on the dynamical behaviour. In addition to unsteady simulations, linear stability analysis is also carried out to identify the critical parameter values that occur when the system is in the neutrally stable state. Using the faster Fourier transform, the unsteady results are then compared with the linear stability analysis results. Excellent agreements are achieved in terms of frequencies of modes of instabilities. Finally, we focus on the dynamical behaviour of collapsible channel flows in a pressure-driven system, and the differences with those of the flow-driven system (Luo et al. 2008). It is found that the stability structure for the pressure-driven system is no longer cascade as in the flow-driven case. Instead, the mode- 1 instability is the dominating unstable mode in the pressure-driven system. In the pressure drop and wall stiffness space, neutrally stable mode- 2 curve is completely enclosed by the mode- 1 neutral curve, and there is no purely mode- 2 unstable solution in the parameter space investigated. Interesting mode-switch is also observed. By analysing the energy <b>budgets</b> at the <b>neutral</b> stable points, we confirmed that in the high tension region (on the upper branch of the mode- 1 neutral curve), the stability mechanism is {{the same as that of}} Jensen & Heil (2003). Namely, self-excited oscillations can grow by extracting kinetic energy from the mean flow, with exactly two thirds of the net kinetic energy flux dissipated by the dissipations and the remainder balanced by increased dissipation in the mean flow. However, the mechanism doesn’t apply for the lower branch of the mode- 1 neutral curve. In addition, energy balance changes further for the mode- 2 curves in the flow-driven system. It is clear that different mechanisms are operating in different regions of the parameter space, and for different boundary conditions...|$|R

Due to increased government debt and debt service costs, however, national wealth and total output would decrease in the long run.

40|$|This {{testimony}} {{describes the}} results of a study of the Employment Service (ES) conducted by Dr. Jacobson and Prof. Arnold Katz of the University of Pittsburgh using data on over 100, 000 individuals who registered with the Pennsylvania ES between 1978 and 1987, and an even larger sample of non-registrants. One major finding is that much of the decline in the ES's performance over the past thirty years can be explained by changes in: funding, characteristics of registrants, and characteristics of job vacancies. Thus, we concluded that criticism of the ES often ignores changes in crucial factors outside of the ES's control that reduced its effectiveness. A second major finding is that most criticism of the ES is based on the inappropriate assumption that the primary goal of the ES should be to maximize placements. The proper measure of ES benefits is how well it reduces joblessness, increases earnings, and reduces UI and welfare payments. We found that the ES reduced the average duration of unemployment of long-term UI claimants by nine weeks. This was for UI claimants who were unemployed for at least 30 weeks. But the ES reduced joblessness of claimants unemployed for 12 weeks by less than two weeks. This is evidence that the ES is most effective in aiding claimants who had substantial trouble finding work on their own. But we suspect that the jobs found {{with the help of the}} ES do not compare favorably with jobs held prior to becoming unemployed. Thus, we believe the ES primarily acts as a backstop preventing large earnings losses. Finally, although savings in UI benefits and increases in earnings created by the ES may be modest, the cost of ES service is so low, $ 75 on average, that modest benefits would more than offset those costs. We believe our results, coupled with similar findings from related studies, is sufficiently strong to warrant increasing the funding of the ES. That measure is favored because it would be at least <b>budget</b> <b>neutral.</b> In contrast, other measures to assist the long-term unemployed, such as providing extended UI benefits or training, would not come close to being <b>budget</b> <b>neutral.</b> In addition, $ 1 spent on job search assistance is likely to be more effective in helping claimants than $ 1 spent on training. unemployment, insurance, employment, service, displaced, dislocated, Jacobson...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Millions of federal, {{state and}} local {{government}} employees have lifetime earnings that are divided between employment that is covered by the Social Security system and employment that is not covered. Because Social Security benefits are a non-linear function of covered lifetime earnings, the simple application of the standard benefit formula to covered earnings only would provide a higher replacement rate on those earnings than is appropriate given the individuals ’ total (covered plus uncovered) lifetime earnings. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), established in 1983, is intended to correct this situation by applying a modified benefit formula to earnings of individuals with non-covered employment. This paper analyzes the distributional implications of the WEP, and finds that it reduces benefits disproportionately for households with lower lifetime covered earnings. It discusses an alternative method of calculating the WEP that preserves the intended redistribution of the system. In recognition of the data limitations that prevent this alternative method from being used by SSA for at least another decade, the paper also analyzes two alternative ways of calculating the WEP that use the same information that SSA currently uses, are <b>budget</b> <b>neutral,</b> and come closer to maintaining the cross-sectional progressivity of Social Security than does the existing WEP formula...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: American Society of Anesthesiologists-Physical Status scores (ASA-PS) and {{age were}} used to adjust for case-mix {{differences}} when evaluating surgical morbidity and resource use after total hip replacement (THR), transurethral prostatectomy (TURP), or cholecystectomy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Variations in complication rates or resource use among patients treated for a particular primary condition should be adjusted for coexistent disease. Age and ASA-PS scores are readily available and can be useful to stratify surgical patients for risk. METHODS: One thousand ninety patients at five academic medical centers in California and Massachusetts who underwent THR, TURP, or cholecystectomy between 1985 and 1987 were studied. Data were obtained from medical records and a self-administered questionnaire to measure length of stay (LOS), postoperative complication rates, and follow-up physician visits. Data were analyzed with one- and two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Increasing age and ASA-PS scores were associated significantly with increased LOS, complication rates, and frequency of post-discharge physician office visits. No interaction effect between age and ASA-PS scores was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Age and ASA-PS scores can predict postoperative morbidity, specific for each operation studied. Assessment of co-morbidity in surgical patients can be accomplished easily and with minimal expense. While remaining <b>budget</b> <b>neutral,</b> the distribution of reimbursements {{should be based on}} those preoperative risk factors that predict longer LOS and higher complication rates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Harbor Maintenance Tax is a {{fundamentally}} flawed maintenance funding {{mechanism for the}} critical US port system. Three alternatives were analyzed. User fee rates were estimated for either a national or regional tonnage based fee. Our results indicate that maintenance cost recovering regional fees could vary widely from about 10 cents per tonne to nearly 80 cents per tonne. A national rate would be about 30 cents per tonne. The large regional differences and affects on bulk shippers are likely to make implementing and maintaining cost recovering tonnage based fees infeasible. Two other mechanisms are considered. One possibility is to abolish the HMT without a replacement mechanism. The obvious strength {{of this approach is}} its simplicity, the weaknesses {{is that it is not}} <b>budget</b> <b>neutral.</b> Another possibility is to increase the federal diesel tax rate. One strength of the approach is the reasonable rate increase required to recover port maintenance costs (estimated between 0. 278 and 0. 315 cents per liter). An additional strength is that relatively inefficient fuel users will either make the largest share of the additional payments or the freight will shift modes to one that is more efficient. One weakness is that the rate has been unchanged since 1997, this points to the political difficulty involved in passing such a rate increase...|$|E
40|$|Demographic and {{technological}} changes are driving increased utilizationof cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) remotemonitoring. In theUSA, fee-for-servicemodel of healthcare delivery, services rendered are valued based upon time, intensity, and technical or practice expense costs. As {{a consequence of}} this perspective, and to contain spending, Medicare has grouped physician services into families. Spendingwithin each family of services must, by law, remain <b>budget</b> <b>neutral.</b> Cardiac implantable electronic devices monitoring services, remote and in-person, are grouped into one family. As the volume of services within this family increases, the individual encounters are destined to be discounted into ever decreasing portions. However, if the value of remote monitoring is demonstrated to extend beyond the previous boundaries of in-person interrogations, a rational request {{can be made to}} reconsider the relative value of remote monitoring. Outcome data supporting the value-added benefits of remote monitoring are rapidly accumulating, including (i) patient convenience, with reduced use of office services, (ii) equal safety compared with in-person evaluation, (iii) shorter detection time to actionable events (arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease progres-sion, and device malfunction), (iv) reduced length of stay for hospitalizations, (v) reduced inappropriate shocks, (vi) increased battery longevity, and (vii) a relative reduction in the risk of death. Fully automatic wireless technology, only recently widely implemented, will add considerable clinical efficiencies and further increase the value of remote monitoring. The U. S. challenge will be to appropriately define the relative value o...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{multi-product}} partial equilibrium model, this paper firstly examines {{the potential impact}} of recent policy changes accruing from the mid term review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003 on the cattle and sheep sectors in Ireland. Secondly, this paper evaluates {{the potential impact of}} the implementation of a CAP <b>budget</b> <b>neutral,</b> common EU flat area payment across all Member States. The European Commission has signalled that it will be evaluating current differences in the level of support between Member States as, for example, in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Commission’s Health Check proposals the Commission argues that it is “increasingly harder to justify the legitimacy of significant individual differences in the support level which are only based on past support” (CEC, 2008; p. 18). This paper demonstrates how there are significant differences in the level of CAP payments per hectare across Member States, as generally farmers in more prosperous Western and Nordic countries receive a much higher level of payment per hectare than farmers in relatively poorer Central and Eastern European countries. In relation to Ireland, similar to most other EU- 15 countries, farmers benefit from the current inequitable distribution of payments and the results indicate that any move towards equalising the level of payments per hectare will have a significant negative impact on agricultural production and net trade.
