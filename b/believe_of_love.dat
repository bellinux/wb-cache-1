40|$|This {{study used}} a {{qualitative}} research design incorporating principles of social constructionism, hermeneutic dialectic method, Neo-Socratic dialogue and philosophy for reporting the tacit and social knowledge constructions underlying particular {{ways of knowing}} that inform the experiential reality <b>of</b> <b>love</b> {{in the practice of}} nursing and midwifery. The philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, that culminated in his magnum opus of the ‘metaphysics of otherness’, provided the theoretical underpinning for the interpretation of the experiences nurses and midwives <b>believed</b> were examples <b>of</b> <b>love</b> in their clinical practice in Australia, Singapore and Bhutan. What is love in nursing and midwifery? The answer is moral responsibility. The relational context has a nurse and midwife constantly exposed to patient situations that give rise to expressions <b>of</b> <b>love</b> as moral responsibility. It is a form <b>of</b> <b>love</b> that centres on the ability of our being, or at least the possibility of our being, to transcend its everyday form to a metaphysical state of being moral. It enables a nurse and midwife to transcend the isolation associated with their personal being as a self-project, to be ‘for’ the patient as a first priority. But while the ‘Goodness’ of the ‘Good’ assigns the nurse and midwife responsible and is expressed to their personal being {{in the form of the}} ‘urge to do’, ‘what to do’ in caring for the patient is a matter of living out the command to be responsible and will be different for each nurse and midwife. However, no matter the outcome, love as moral responsibility will always leave a nurse and midwife feeling there is still more to be done in being responsible...|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I {{to answer}} that?" [...] said the poet. [...] "Surely I do <b>believe</b> in vows <b>of</b> <b>love.</b> I have written much <b>of</b> <b>love,</b> and have ever meant {{to write the}} truth, as I knew it, or thought that I knew it. But the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> which we poets sing is not the <b>love</b> <b>of</b> the outer world. It is more ecstatic, but far less serviceable. It is the picture of that which exists, but grand with {{imaginary}} attributes, as are the portraits of ladies painted by artists who have thought rather of their art than of their models. We tell of a constancy in love which is hardly compatible with the usages of this as yet imperfect world. Look abroad, and see whether girls do not love twice, and young men thrice. They come together, and rub their feathers like birds, and fancy that each has found in the other an eternity of weal or woe. Then come the causes of their parting. Their fathers perhaps are Capulets and Montagues, but their children, God be thanked, are not Romeos and Juliets. Or money does not serve, or distance intervenes, or simply a new face has the poor merit of novelty. The constancy of which the poets sing is the unreal,--I may almost say the unnecessary,--constancy of a Juliet. The constancy on which our nature should pride itself is that of an Imogen. You read Shakespeare, I hope, Mr. Thwaite." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr Ajmal was {{successfully}} able to combine three parallel streams in his thought, Islam, Marxism, Sufism and Liberalism.

But above all he was a Sufi who <b>believed</b> that <b>love</b> <b>of</b> God can truly liberate man from the clutches of materialism and all the suffering that results from attachment. It was due to such eclecticism {{that he was able}} to admire great personalities such as Frithjof Schuon, Iqbal, Mao Zedong and Rene Guenon simultaneously. His love for Prophet Muhammad was intense and deep. He believed in establishing a separate psychological construct for Muslim psyche and worked to establish a Muslim tradition of psychotherapy since the 1960s, based on Sufism.|$|R
2500|$|British art {{historian}} Kenneth Clark wrote that Western Europe's first [...] "great age of civilisation" [...] {{was ready to}} begin around the year 1000.

Abbot Suger of the Abbey of St. Denis is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and <b>believed</b> that <b>love</b> <b>of</b> beauty brought people closer to God: [...] "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material".

He went to church on Sunday morning now, chiefly, I do <b>believe,</b> for <b>love</b> <b>of</b> the Confession, which was the one voice for his needs; and partly, too, because I had pressed for that outward token, thinking that it would lead him on to more; but it generally seemed more weariness than profit, and he never could sit still five minutes without falling asleep, so that he missed even those sermons of Mr. Ben Yolland's that I thought must do him good.|$|R

After his behaviour towards the Bertram girls, Fanny distrusts him and does not <b>believe</b> his declarations <b>of</b> <b>love.</b> Even so, Henry proposes and Fanny is pressured by her uncle to accept the offer; she disappoints the family by refusing. Angry, Sir Thomas gives Fanny an ultimatum - accept Henry's proposal of marriage or be sent back to her poor family and experience the difference in comfort. Fanny looks to Edmund for support, but his indifference forces her to choose the latter. Several days after her return home, Henry pays a visit to convince Fanny that his affections for her are genuine. Although she looks more favourably on him, Fanny continues to cling to her feelings for Edmund and rejects Henry. Only when a letter from Edmund arrives which discloses his hopes of marrying Mary does Fanny accept Henry's offer. However, Fanny realizes she does not trust him, and takes back her acceptance the next day. Henry leaves, exceedingly hurt and angry. Edmund arrives to take Fanny back to Mansfield Park to help care for Tom, who has fallen seriously ill and is near death. Edmund confesses he has missed Fanny.|$|R

60|$|I {{could not}} believe that Strickland {{had fallen in love with}} Blanche Stroeve. I did not <b>believe</b> him capable <b>of</b> <b>love.</b> That is an emotion in which {{tenderness}} is an essential part, but Strickland had no tenderness either for himself or for others; there is in <b>love</b> a sense <b>of</b> weakness, a desire to protect, an eagerness to do good and to give pleasure -- if not unselfishness, at all events a selfishness which marvellously conceals itself; it has in it a certain diffidence. These were not traits which I could imagine in Strickland. Love is absorbing; it takes the lover out of himself; the most clear-sighted, though he may know, cannot realise that his love will cease; it gives body to what he knows is illusion, and, knowing it is nothing else, he loves it better than reality. It makes a man a little more than himself, and at the same time a little less. He ceases to be himself. He is no longer an individual, but a thing, an instrument to some purpose foreign to his ego. Love is never quite devoid of sentimentality, and Strickland was the least inclined to that infirmity of any man I have known. I {{could not believe}} that he would ever suffer that possession <b>of</b> himself which <b>love</b> is; he could never endure a foreign yoke. I <b>believed</b> him capable <b>of</b> uprooting from his heart, though it might be with agony, so that he was left battered and ensanguined, anything that came between himself and that uncomprehended craving that urged him constantly to he knew not what. If I have succeeded at all in giving the complicated impression that Strickland made on me, it will not seem outrageous to say that I felt he was at once too great and too small for love.|$|R
