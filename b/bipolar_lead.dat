The results thus obtained may be summarized as follows : 1. The changes of the electric potential of the ventricles and those of the endocardium caused by cardiac disorders may be recorded on the electrocardiograms in the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead.</b> 2. The electrocardiograms in leads II and III of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> I and in leads I and II of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> II were marked by high amplitudes and unvarying curves. On the contrary, in lead I of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> I and in lead III of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> II, the electrocardiograms showed small amplitudes and variable waves. It seems that these interesting facts may be caused by the relationship between the position of the electrodes and the anatomical heart axis. 3. Intricate diphasic and triphasic waves were found in 80 〜 90 % of the P waves. The appearance of this intricate type is usually recognized in the normal horse in the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>leads</b> I and II. 4. Most of the PQ (PR) segments showed isoelectric waves. 5. Variation in the QRS complex in the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>leads</b> I and II occurs more frequently in the former than in the latter. 6. The S wave was observed in 30 % of S_I of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> I and in S_ of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> II respectively. The other cases almost always showed the arc-curved S. 7. The monophasic negative T wave was observed in 70 〜 80 % in T_I and T_ of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> I.

METHODS We analyzed digital 15 -lead ECGs (12 standard leads plus leads V- 1 to V- 3 recorded from the third intercostal space [V- 1 h to V- 3 h]) acquired during diagnostic ajmaline testing in 128 patients (80 men, age 37 +/- 15 years) with suspected Brugada syndrome and standard 12 -lead ECGs recorded in 229 healthy subjects (111 men, age 33 +/- 4 years). <b>Bipolar</b> <b>leads</b> between V- 2 (positive pole) and V- 4 or V- 5 (leads V 2 - 4, V 2 - 5) were derived by subtracting leads V- 4 and V- 5 from V- 2. All ECGs were examined for the presence of type 1 Brugada pattern. RESULTS During 21 (16. 4 %) positive ajmaline tests, type 1 pattern was observed in lead V- 2 h during 20 tests (95. 2 %) and in V- 2 during 10 tests (47. 6 %).

The extrema {{of the first three}} eigen-vectors were used to determine the positions of recording sites for three <b>bipolar</b> <b>leads.</b> These three <b>bipolar</b> <b>leads</b> were then used to reconstruct 12 -lead ECGs recorded from an unseen group of subjects (normal = 57, LVH = 59, MI = 69).

In several patients who needed intracardiac recording, a <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead</b> was placed across the chest, directed as conveniently {{as possible for}} the recording of His bundle electrical activity. A signal filtered (70 - 300 Hz) and amplified (X 100. 000), was processed by a multichannel analyzer for averaging. The temporal regime of the averager was determined by a trigger which established a fiducial point on the ECG. For this purpose a QRS detector fed to a normal peripheral <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead</b> was used. The temporal stability of the system was continually checked in order to reject the recordings over the limits of +/- 1 msec. The computer program was chosen in order to select a window (usually 200 msec) which occurred up to 150 msec prior and 50 msec after the trigger signal.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) is {{a measure}} of the collective electrical behavior of the heart based on body surface measurements. With computational models or tissue preparations, various methods have been used to compute the pseudo-ECG (pECG) of bipolar and unipolar leads that can be given clinical interpretation. When spatial maps of transmembrane potential (Vm) are available, pECG can be derived from a weighted sum of the spatial gradients of Vm. The concept of a lead field can be used to define sensitivity curves for different bipolar and unipolar leads and to determine an effective operating height for the <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead</b> position for a two-dimensional sheet of heart cells. The pseudo-vectorcardiogram (pVCG) is computed from orthogonal <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead</b> voltages, which are derived in this study from optical voltage maps of cultured monolayers of cardiac cells. Rate and propagation direction for paced activity, rotation frequency for reentrant activity, direction of the common pathway for figure-eight reentry, and transitions from paced activity to reentry can all be distinguished using the pVCG. In contrast, the unipolar pECG does not clearly distinguish among many of the different types of electrical activity. We also show that pECG can be rapidly computed by two geometrically weighted sums of Vm, one that is summed over the area of the cell sheet and the other over the perimeter of the cell sheet. Our results are compared with those of an ad hoc difference method used in the past that consists of a simple difference of the sum of transmembrane potentials on one side of a tissue sheet and that of the other...|$|E

40|$|Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are a {{major cause}} of {{cardiovascular}} disease and death in Europe. Sudden cardiac death accounts for 50 % of cardiac mortality in developed countries; ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is the most common underlying arrhythmia. In the ambulatory population, atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of stroke and heart failure, particularly in an aging population. Early detection of arrhythmias allows appropriate intervention, reducing disability and death. However, {{in the early stages of}} disease arrhythmias may be transient, lasting only a few seconds, and are thus difficult to detect. This work addresses the problem of extracting the far-field heart electrogram signal from noise components, as recorded in <b>bipolar</b> <b>leads</b> along the left arm, using a data driven ECG (electrocardiogram) denoising algorithm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods to enable continuous non-invasive monitoring of heart rhythm for long periods of time using a wrist or arm wearable device with advanced biopotential sensors.

MethodsBetween 1994 and 2008, of 121 consecutive patients having Fontan conversion and arrhythmia surgeries, 120 patients underwent pacemaker implantation {{at the time of}} Fontan conversion (mean age 22. 9 ± 8. 1 years). Prior pacemakers were in place in 32 / 120 (26. 7 %) patients. Between 1994 and 1998, single-chamber atrial antitachycardia pacemakers were implanted (n = 12); atrial rate-responsive pacemakers (n = 31) were implanted between 1998 and 2002. Dual-chamber rate-responsive pacemakers (n = 16) were used between 2002 and 2003, and subsequently dual-chamber antitachycardia pacemakers (n = 61) have become the pacemaker of choice. Leads have evolved from transatrial endocardial leads to epicardial unipolar and subsequently <b>bipolar</b> <b>leads.</b> ResultsAmong 87 patients with adequate follow-up, all are currently atrially paced at a minimum lower rate ≥ 70 beats per minute. Single-chamber atrial pacemakers were implanted in 43 (antitachycardia in 12), and dual-chamber pacemakers in 77 (antitachycardia in 61); multisite ventricular leads were placed in 7 patients. Far-field R-wave sensing in 78. 6 % of unipolar atrial leads led to use of epicardial <b>bipolar</b> <b>leads.</b> Late atrioventricular block (24 %) led to routine implantation of dual-chamber pacemakers. Antitachycardia pacing was utilized in 7 %. One patient required acute lead revision and 4 required late upgrade to dual-chamber pacemakers. There was no pacemaker-related infection.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) using quadripolar {{left ventricular}} (LV) leads provides more pacing vectors compared to bipolar leads. This may avoid phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and allow optimal lead placement to maximize biventricular pacing. However, a long-term improvement in patient outcome {{has yet to}} be demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 721 consecutive patients with conventional CRTD criteria implanted with quadripolar (n = 357) or bipolar (n = 364) LV leads were enrolled into a registry at 3 UK centers. Lead performance and mortality was analyzed over a 5 -year period. RESULTS: Patients receiving a quadripolar lead were of similar age and sex to those receiving a <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead,</b> although a lower proportion had ischemic heart disease (62. 6 % vs. 54. 1 %, P = 0. 02). Both groups had similar rates of procedural success, although lead threshold, impedance, and procedural radiation dose were significantly lower in those receiving a quadripolar lead. PNS was more common in those with quadripolar leads (16. 0 % vs. 11. 6 %, P = 0. 08), but was eliminated by switching pacing vector in all cases compared with 60 % in the bipolar group (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, LV lead displacement (1. 7 % vs. 4. 6 %, P = 0. 03) and repositioning (2. 0 % vs. 5. 2 %, P = 0. 03) occurred significantly less often in those with a quadripolar lead. All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the quadripolar compared to <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead</b> group in univariate and multivariate analysis (13. 2 % vs. 22. 5 %, P < 0. 001).

Thirty patients with coronary artery disease were studied during exercise tests in which ST segment depression (greater than 0. 5 mm) occurred {{in one or more}} standard electrocardiographic leads and 13 patients were studied during angioplasty that resulted in ST segment change in one or more leads (I, II, III, V 2, V 5, and CM 5). Lead CM 5 was the most sensitive lead (93 %) during exercise testing and also showed the greatest magnitude of ST segment change below the isoelectric line in 93 % of the patients. Only two patients, one with ST segment elevation in inferior leads and one with changes restricted to septal leads, had no ST segment depression in lead CM 5. When ST segment shift from the baseline electrocardiogram was measured the magnitude of depression was greatest in lead CM 5 in only 63 % of the patients. During angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery, lead CM 5 showed ST segment depression in seven patients, ST segment elevation in two, and a biphasic response in one. Two of the three patients with balloon inflation in right coronary artery developed ST segment elevation in lead CM 5. Thus lead CM 5 is a reliable lead for detecting subendocardial ischaemia experienced during everyday activities in anginal patients.

Spontaneous thalamic activities of the patients were recorded and analyzed by Walter type analyzer with electrical filters into five bands, i. e. 2 - 4 c/s, delta band; 4 - 8 c/s, theta band; 8 - 13 c/s, alpha band; 13 - 20 c/s, beta I band; and 20 - 30 c/s, beta Ⅱ band. EEG from parieto-occipital region were also recorded and analyzed simultaneously. Frequency power spectrum of the thalamus showed generally higher theta and delta band activities in both bipolar and monopolar records. In the patients with predominant tremor of the limbs it showed considerable high delta band and marked low alpha band activities, which were clearly differentiated from that of other type of Parkinsonism. This was characteristic in the bipolar record from the thalamus. Duration time of waxing and waning phenomenon of alpha band activity ranged from 0. 9 to 2. 0 seconds with average 1. 2 seconds in the thalamus, but longer duration up to 5 seconds in the scalp lead. Frequencies of alpha activities were noted mostly from 8. 5 to 10. 5 c/s. in EEG, but 8. 5 to 11. 5 c/s. in the thalamic lead. The patients with higher frequencies of alpha activities were closely corresponded to {{a good candidate for}} surgery in the thalamic <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead,</b> but not in thalamic monopolar lead or scalp EEG. On the other hand, a poor candidate for surgery had higher delta and theta activities in the frequency power spectra and slowing of frequencies of alpha activities in the thalamic <b>bipolar</b> <b>lead.</b> The scalp EEG findings were not specific, but thalamic activities were most closely related to the progress of symptoms, particularly tremor, rigidity and bradykinetic situation of a Parkinsonian patient...|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with the serial electrocardiogram recorded {{by means of the}} limb <b>lead,</b> <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>leads</b> I and II and semi-unipolar chest lead were obtained on one each of 40 normal dairy cattle. The data derived from the analysis of these records can be summarized as follows : 1. In the electrocardiogram of the limb lead when the left and right olecranons and left patella were chosen for the positions of lead points, the triphasic and diphasic P wave in each lead, r type of QRS complex in lead I and R type in leads II and III, and monophasic negative and positive T waves are observed, respectively. 2. In case of the use of the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> I in which the left and right olecranons and withers were selected for the lead points, the triphasic P wave, qR and R type of QRS complex and monophasic negative T waves were observed in each lead respectively. 3. When the <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>lead</b> II was employed using the withers, left shoulder blade and the apex of the heart on the left side for the lead points, W form of P wave in each lead, qR type in leads I and II, and qR, QR in lead III, and monophasic negative T wave in leads I and II, monophasic positive and diphasic waves in lead III were observed respectively. 4. In case of the use of the semi-unipolar chest lead, the waves in the lead at the upper portion of the heart showed negative P, and R type of QRS complex and negative T waves were also observed there. On the contrary in the lead at the apical portion of the heart, the positive P and QS type of QRS complex and positive T wave were traced. 5. On the basis of these experiments, the limb lead may not be suitable for clinical use in cattle because the variation of the electrical changes of the heart was not completely traced. The <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>leads</b> I and II, however, may be applicable for clinic use, for the variation of the electrical changes of the heart were apparentely registered on the electrocardiogram. The semi-unipolar chest lead may be of use in the diagnosis of disorders in the heart providing that different electrodes are placed close to the heart. From the findings described above, it may be considered that the use of <b>bipolar</b> chest <b>leads</b> I and II together with semi-unipolar chest lead is valuable for the clinical diagnosis of heart disorders...|$|R
40|$|The {{exercise}} electrocardiograms of 255 asymptomatic {{men were}} analyzed {{for changes in}} R wave amplitude and ST segments. The results were correlated with findings at cardiac catheterization. There were 65 men with coronary artery disease and 190 normal subjects. R wave amplitude changes were evaluated in <b>bipolar</b> <b>leads</b> X, Y and Z. The predictive value of an abnormal ST segment response for detecting disease was only 29 %. This value was improved to 42 % using R wave amplitude changes with a sensitivity of 28 % and specificity of 87 %Exercise-induced R wave amplitude changes enhance the specificity of detecting coronary disease in asymptomatic men over ST segment criteria alone but the sensitivity is poor and the predictive value is not enhanced. Thus, these criteria are limited in adding to the diagnostic accuracy of stress testing...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular {{abnormalities}} {{and small}} vascular size may preclude transvenous pacing and necessitate epicardial lead implantation. This study evaluates {{the performance of}} steroid-eluting, <b>bipolar</b> epicardial pacing <b>leads.</b> METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 114 children with 239 atrial and ventricular <b>bipolar</b> epicardial <b>leads</b> (Medtronic CapSure 10366 or 4968, Minneapolis, MN), followed up to 12. 2 years (median, 3. 2). Lead data were obtained at implant and at semi-annual visits. Analysis was done for left or right atrial and ventricular leads. RESULTS: Median atrial and ventricular pacing thresholds remained below 1. 2 V at 0. 5 ms. Thresholds did not differ between pacing sites: left atrial, 0. 82 V at 0. 5 ms; right atrial, 0. 74 V at 0. 5 ms (p = 0. 85); and left ventricular, 0. 96 V at 0. 5 ms; right ventricular, 0. 94 V at 0. 5 ms (p = 0. 65). Sensing demonstrated no difference for atrial leads, at left atrial, 3. 4 mV; and right atrial, 2. 9 mV (p = 0. 12), but there was superiority of left over right ventricular leads (11. 2 vs 7. 7 mV, p = 0. 002). During follow-up, the 239 atrial and ventricular leads experienced 19 (8 %) lead failures. Lead survival at 2 and 5 years was 99 % and 94 % for atrial leads and 96 % and 85 % for ventricular <b>leads,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Bipolar</b> steroid-eluting epicardial <b>leads</b> demonstrate excellent sensing characteristics and persistent low median pacing thresholds below 1. 2 V at 0. 5 ms in children during up to 12 years follow-up. Considering growing and active patients with most having congenital heart disease, the lead survival of 85 % to 94 % at 5 years is favorable. Subanalysis shows superior sensing for left ventricular <b>leads.</b> <b>Bipolar</b> steroid-eluting <b>leads</b> provide an alternative approach for permanent pacing and may also be considered for left atrial and ventricular pacing, resynchronization, or defibrillator therapy...|$|R
