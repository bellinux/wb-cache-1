25|$|When {{a battery}} is {{recharged}} at an excessive rate, an explosive gas mixture of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} may be produced faster than it can escape from within the battery (e.g. through a built-in vent), leading to pressure build-up and eventual bursting of the <b>battery</b> <b>case.</b> In extreme cases, battery chemicals may spray violently from the casing and cause injury. Overcharging - that is, attempting to charge a battery beyond its electrical capacity - {{can also lead to}} a battery explosion, in addition to leakage or irreversible damage. It may also cause damage to the charger or device in which the overcharged battery is later used.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{accessories}} {{are provided with}} the rifle, including a blade-type bayonet (AKM clipped point or the AK-74 spear point bayonet), four spare magazines, a leather or nylon sling, magazine pouch, cleaning kit and an accessory/maintenance kit for the telescopic sight. Also included is a cold weather <b>battery</b> <b>case</b> with a [...] "shirt clip", with a permanently attached cord 24" [...] long ending with another <b>battery</b> <b>case</b> cap that has an extension to press against the internal contact {{in lieu of the}} battery to complete the circuit. Placing the external <b>battery</b> <b>case</b> into the shooters' clothing close to the body keeps it from freezing; using the clip ensures it remains in place. The clamp-style bipod attaches to machined-out reliefs near the front of the receiver, it literally grabs the two cut out areas and securely mounts with a large round sized head on the clamp bolt able to tightly attach the bipod. The legs are individually adjustable opposed to fixed length found on many rifles and LMG's and can be folded and stowed in a forward position negating the need to remove the bipod before placing the rifle into the canvas carrying case. Interestingly enough, the two legs are held close together with a [...] "J" [...] shaped clamp attached to one leg and swung over the other leg. Original Soviet/Russian SVD bipods fetch a very high price when they rarely appear on the market.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{criminal}} law, which recognizes {{degrees of}} various crimes involving physical contact, there {{is but a}} single tort of battery. Lightly flicking a person's ear is battery, as is severely beating someone with a tire iron. Neither is there a separate tort for a battery of a sexual nature.
