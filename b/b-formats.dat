40|$|Theories of {{embodied}} cognition {{abound in}} the literature, {{but it is}} often unclear how to understand them. We offer several interpretations of embodiment, the most interesting being the thesis that mental representations in bodily formats (<b>B-formats)</b> {{have an important role}} in cognition. Potential <b>B-formats</b> include motoric, somatosensory, affective and interoceptive formats. The literature on mirroring and related phenomena provides support for a limited-scope version of embodied social cognition under the B-format interpretation. It is questionable, however, whether such a thesis can be extended. We show the limits of embodiment in social cognition...|$|E
50|$|Inside a UHJ decoder, {{the signals}} are {{processed}} in a phase amplitude matrix to recover {{a set of}} signals that resembles <b>B-Format.</b> In most cases the signal will actually be <b>B-Format,</b> {{but in the case}} of 2-channel UHJ there is insufficient information available to be able to reconstruct a true <b>B-Format</b> signal, only something that behaves in a similar way.|$|R
50|$|Ambisonic <b>B-Format</b> is the {{standard}} format {{for use in the}} studio. While itis possible to distribute <b>B-Format</b> recordings for decoding and listening by end-users, this is only starting to be more widespread with the advent of software-based players. Traditionally, Ambisonic recordings have been distributed in the form of 2-channel discs, CDs etc. using the 2-channel version of the UHJ encoding hierarchy, which, unlike <b>B-Format,</b> is designed to be stereo compatible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} sound source direction estimation in the three-dimensional space. An energetic analysis method based on <b>B-format</b> signals processing {{is presented in}} this paper. This method is able to estimate the direction of arrival for multiple sound sources in the three dimensional space. A single SoundField microphone {{can be used to}} pick-up <b>B-format</b> signals indirectly. The method has been simulated in Matlab and tested in a real environment. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of this method. Keywords—Sound source localization, <b>B-format</b> signals, energetic analysis method. I...|$|R

50|$|Creating (typically 2-channel) UHJ {{recordings}} is {{a simple}} matter of passing <b>B-Format</b> signals through a UHJ encoder and recording the result. These might be derived from soundfield microphone recordings or from mixdown. In addition, mixes can be created directly in UHJ by using a UHJ Transcoder, such as that offered by Audio & Design Recordings in the 1980s, along with other Ambisonic mixing hardware (see Ambisonic mixing: Legacy hardware). The Transcoder both encoded <b>B-Format</b> into 2-channel UHJ and in addition allowed a stereo front stage and a stereo rear stage (both with adjustable widths) to be transcoded direct to 2-channel UHJ, while other units facilitated the production of <b>B-Format</b> mixes that could be encoded into UHJ with the Transcoder.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>B-Format</b> is the {{standard}} audio format produced by a soundfield kit. It consists of the following four signals: ...|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{stage of}} DirAC {{is based on}} a time-frequency processing of the <b>B-format</b> input signals to estimate direction and diffuseness parameters. To this end, an energetic analysis based on pressure and velocity signals is carried out, which needs for an adequate calibration before starting the processing [13]. Besides using a <b>B-format</b> microphone, different array structures can be employed in this analysis stage with the aim of estimating the necessary direction and diffuseness parameters.|$|R
40|$|The <b>B-Format</b> {{microphone}} {{has been}} used since more than 20 years for recordings of natural 3 -dimensional sound fields. It outputs one pressure signal and three directional signals. Acoustical measurements carried out in this contribution show some systematic quality limitations of directional signals. A simulation environment is verified against these realworld measurements. It is used then to vary the design parameters of the <b>B-Format</b> microphone. Technical possibilities for quality improvements of the directional signals are identified and discussed. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Transmitting Ambisonic <b>B-format</b> between {{devices and}} to {{end-users}} requires a standardized exchange format. While traditional first-order <b>B-format</b> is well-defined and universally understood, {{there are numerous}} conflicting conventions for Higher-order Ambisonics, differing both in channel order and weighting, which might need to be supported for some time. Traditionally, the most widespread is Furse-Malham higher order format in the [...] container based on Microsoft's WAVE-EX file format. It scales up to third order and has a file size limitation of 4GB.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor’s {{thesis is}} focused on the system of {{recording}} and processing of acoustics signals called Ambisonics. It describes single sections of this system in the chain of acoustic signal processing. At most it is aimed at the <b>B-format</b> technology as the main ambisonic instrument, its encoding from the signals recorded with the special microphone capsule of the soundfield type or with help of encoding equations and its decoding into single speaker channels of various speaker arrays. The UHJ transmission format is also mentioned. The application <b>B-format</b> Decoder was created in the MATLAB programming environment. It consists of several functions and has friendly user interface, which provides the processing and decoding of <b>B-format</b> components for the speaker array with entered parameters. Among others this interface ensures loading, displaying, analysis and playback of source and resulting acoustic signals...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, linear time-invariant signal {{processing}} such as equalization {{can be applied}} to <b>B-format</b> without disrupting sound directions, as long as it applied to all component channels equally.|$|R
50|$|The {{playback}} configuration {{is equally}} flexible. Again in post-production, the <b>B-format</b> recording can be decoded to {{any number of}} speakers arranged in both the horizontal and vertical planes.|$|R
50|$|Since it is {{impossible}} to build a perfectly coincident microphone array, the next-best approach is to minimize and distribute the positional error as uniformly as possible. This can be achieved by arranging four cardioid or sub-cardioid capsules in a tetrahedron and equalising for uniform diffuse-field response. The capsule signals are then converted to <b>B-format</b> with a matrix operation.Outside Ambisonics, tetrahedral microphones have become popular with location recording engineers working in stereo or 5.1 for their flexibility in post-production; here, the <b>B-format</b> is only used as an intermediate to derive virtual microphones.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{components}} of first-order Ambisonics correspond to physical microphone pickup patterns, it is entirely practical to record <b>B-format</b> directly, {{with a collection of}} coincident microphones: an omnidirectional capsule, one forward-facing and one left-facing figure-of-eight, yielding the , [...] and [...] components.This is referred to as a native or Nimbus/Halliday microphone array, after its designer Dr Jonathan Halliday at Nimbus Records, where it is used to record their extensive and continuing series of Ambisonic releases. An integrated native <b>B-format</b> microphone, the C700S has been manufactured and sold by Josephson Engineering since 1990.|$|R
40|$|New {{software}} tools are presented, which enable a standard PC {{equipped with a}} multichannel sound board to be used both {{for the creation of}} <b>B-format</b> signals, and for their playback over a suitable array of loudspeakers. The encoding of <b>B-format</b> signals is obtained by convolution of each original soundtrack with a proper <b>B-format</b> impulse response, obtained from measurement in existing spaces or from computation by a room acoustics software. The decoding is made thanks to a small dedicated program, which can be set to emulate a standard Ambisonics decoder (with fixed-gain shelf filters), or a new, wider class of decoders based on the recent theory about Energetic Analysis of Sound Fields. The decoder includes convolution with inverse filters which compensate for the irregularities of the loudspeakers. The system was developed mainly as an analysis tool and as a support for subjective listening tests in the automotive field and in the room acoustics field. 1.

30|$|Directional Audio Coding (DirAC) is a {{recently}} proposed method for spatial sound recording and reproduction [9] which shares many similarities with the binaural synthesis technique {{described in this}} paper. In a first analysis stage, DirAC uses typically a <b>B-format</b> microphone to capture the spatial properties of the sound recorded in a given environment (although other alternatives {{can also be used}} [10]). In a second stage, the analyzed spatial features are employed to reproduce the recorded sound again by means of an arbitrary loudspeaker setup. Note that although <b>B-format</b> signals are used, there are substantial differences with conventional Ambisonics reproduction [11].|$|R

In fact many mixing applications went straight from multitrack to 2-channel UHJ {{before the advent of}} digital audio workstations and current Ambisonic mixing developments.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{a new technique}} for synthesizing individualized binaural room impulse responses for headphone-rendered virtual auditory space (VAS) from <b>B-format</b> room impulse responses (RIRs) recorded with a Soundfield micro-phone, and a listener’s anechoic head-related impulse responses (HRIRs). Tra-ditionally, <b>B-format</b> RIRs are decoded for loudspeaker playback using either Ambisonics or Spatial Impulse Response Rendering. For headphone playback, virtual loudspeakers are commonly simulated using HRIRs. However, the num-ber and position of loudspeakers should not really {{be a factor in}} headphone playback. Hence, we present a new technique for headphone-rendered VAS which is not limited by the number and position of loudspeakers and compare its performance with traditional methods via a psychoacoustic experiment...|$|R
5000|$|First order <b>B-format</b> can be {{manipulated}} in various ways to change the contents of an auditory scene. Well known manipulations include [...] "rotation" [...] and [...] "dominance" [...] (moving sources towards or away from a particular direction).|$|R
5000|$|For the {{simplest}} (two dimensional) case (no height information), and spacing the loudspeakers equally in a circle, we derive the loudspeaker {{signals from the}} <b>B-format</b> W, X and Y channels:where [...] is {{the direction of the}} speaker under consideration.|$|R
5000|$|In Furse-Malham higher-order format, an {{extension}} of traditional <b>B-format</b> up to third order, orders 2 (...) and 3 (...) begin with their z-rotationally symmetric member and then jump outward right and left (see table), with the horizontal components at the end.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{aggressive}} equalisation necessary, the timbral and noise performance of higher-order arrays is not currently comparable to traditional high-quality recording microphones, {{and the resulting}} <b>B-format</b> is increasingly band-limited towards higher orders, raising issues of up- and downwards compatibility.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>B-format</b> {{indicates}} a medium-sized paperback of 130 x 198 mm. This size {{has been used}} to distinguish literary novels from genre fiction. In the U.S., books of this size are thought of as smaller trade paperbacks (see below).|$|R
40|$|The time-frequency {{resolution}} of human hearing {{has been taken}} into account for long time in perceptual audio codecs. Recently, the {{resolution of}} humans has also been exploited in time-frequency processing. This has already lead into new methods to represent parametrically multichannel audio files and <b>B-format</b> recordings in time-frequency domain. This leads to drastic decrease in bit rate, and in reproduction of <b>B-format</b> recordings, also to increased audio quality compared to traditional methods. This workshop covers the capabilities and incapabilities of human spatial hearing and the audio techniques that exploit these features. Typically the techniques are based on estimation of directional information for each auditory frequency channel, which information is then used in further processing...|$|R
50|$|Ambisonic content can {{be created}} in two basic ways: by {{recording}} a sound with a suitable first- or higher-order microphone, or by taking separate monophonic sources and panning them to the desired positions. Content can also be manipulated while it is in <b>B-format.</b>|$|R
50|$|The major {{benefits}} of parametric decoding is a greatly increased angular resolution and {{the separation of}} analysis and synthesis into separate processing steps. This separation allows <b>B-format</b> recordings to be rendered using any panning technique, including delay panning, VBAP and HRTF-based synthesis.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} miniature and three-tiered <b>B-format</b> {{microphone array}} designs for accurate sound source localisation that are manufactured using 3 D printing and MEMs devices. The implications of pressure gradient resolution reduction in spatial-temporal sampling on {{the accuracy of}} Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is analysed through simulated room impulse response measurements and characterized by the directional signal to noise ratio. It is shown how the capsule spacing can be optimally chosen based on microphone capsule sensitivity and the required DOA accuracy. Through this method a new three tiered <b>B-format</b> microphone array is proposed, where each tier optimally records 3 D sound for a given frequency sub-band to achieve highly accurate DOA estimation for the full audible frequency range of 50 Hz to 20 kHz...|$|R
50|$|Note that two-channel UHJ {{requires}} the player to use different shelf filters than for three- and four-channel UHJ (and B-Format); W', X' and Y' {{are used to}} indicate that the result of decoding {{is not the same as}} the original <b>B-format</b> (Gerzon refers to this as E-format).|$|R
40|$|VR systems, {{like the}} cinema, tend to {{concentrate}} on the visual image, leaving the audible image as garnishing. If blind people are to make any use of virtual environments then the audible image needs to be greatly improved. An ideal system would encode the amplitude and direction of sounds {{in a way that was}} independent of the means used to portray the image to the user. The Ambisonic <b>B-format</b> describes four signals: a reference, and three vectors. These are simple to generate and manipulate and may easily be converted into loudspeaker feeds for one, two or three dimensional arrays of speakers. The generation of binaural signals for headset based systems is made difficult by the complexity of the head related transfer function(HRTF). Steering the virtual image to take account of head movements is computationally expensive and requires detailed knowledge of the users HRTF if the image is to be at all realistic. An alternative is to make use of virtual loudspeakers around which the image is moved but which have a fixed location relative to the users head. If the speaker feeds are derived from a <b>B-format</b> signal this may easily be panned and tilted by manipulating the relative amplitudes of the three vectors according to simple mathematical rules. The HRTF of the user can be measured at the positions of the virtual speakers and the resultant relationship between the combination of all these signals and the two headphone signals need only be computed once. This paper gives an introduction to the Ambisonic system and shows how <b>B-format</b> signals can be used to encode a virtual acoustic environment. It concludes by describing how the <b>B-format</b> signals may be manipulated and used to generate almost any number speaker feeds or headphone feeds...|$|R
50|$|In other words, the <b>B-format</b> {{recording}} can be decoded {{to model}} {{any number of}} microphones pointing in arbitrary directions: each microphone's pattern can be selected to be omnidirectional, cardioid, hypercardioid, figure-of-eight, or anything in between. This can be done live or in post-production (after the recording is made).|$|R

50|$|A Soundfield {{microphone}} kit, {{consisting of}} the microphone and a signal processor, produces two distinct sets of audio signals called A-Format and <b>B-Format.</b> The sound processor may be either dedicated hardware, or a computer running software.
