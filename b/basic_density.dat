50|$|Fodder: Not {{widely used}} as fodder, but in India 1-year-old {{plantations}} are browsed by cattle. Apiculture: The flowers {{are a source}} of pollen for honey production. Fuel: A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark. Fibre: The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp. Timber: The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. Tannin or dyestuff: The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. Other products: An edible mushroom, Tylopylus fellus, is common in plantations of A. auriculiformis in Thailand.|$|E

Karst.) wood from six 24 -year-old clones, grown on two sites in southern Sweden dif-fering in water availability. Hydraulic parameters assessed were specific hydraulic conductivity at full saturation (ks 100) and vulnerability to cavitation (Ψ 50), mechanical parameters included bending strength (σb), modulus of elasticity (MOE), compression strength (σa) and Young’s modulus (E). <b>Basic</b> <b>density,</b> diameter at breast height, tree height, and hydraulic and mechanical parameters varied considerably among clones. Clonal means of hydraulic and mechanical properties were strongly related to <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> and to growth parameters across sites, especially to diameter at breast height. Compared with stem wood of slower growing clones, stem wood of rap-idly growing clones had significantly lower <b>basic</b> <b>density,</b> lower σb, MOE, σa and E, was more vulnerable to cavitation, but had higher ks 100. <b>Basic</b> <b>density</b> was negatively correlated to Ψ 50 and ks 100. We therefore found a tradeoff between Ψ 50 and ks 100. Clones with high <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> had significantly lower hy-draulic vulnerability, but also lower hydraulic conductivity at full saturation and thus less rapid growth than clones with low <b>basic</b> <b>density.</b> This tradeoff involved a negative relationship be-tween Ψ 50 and σb as well as MOE, and between ks 100 and σb, MOE andσa. <b>Basic</b> <b>density</b> andΨ 50 showed no site-specific dif-ferences, but tree height, diameter at breast height, ks 100 and mechanical strength and stiffness were significantly lower at the drier site. <b>Basic</b> <b>density</b> had no influence on the site-de-pendent differences in hydraulic and mechanical properties, but was strongly negatively related to diameter at breast height.

The model, consisting of the mean structure with quadratic function of cambial age was able to describe the intra-tree variation in <b>basic</b> <b>density.</b> The model containing the random effects which consist of effect of the tree level and vertical stem position level explained the density variation adequately. The growth rate did not show the significant effect on the <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> variation within the stem.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{study of}} the wood {{characteristics}} is of fundamental importance for the correct use of this raw material and, among its properties, the <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> is a major, being reference {{in the quality of}} this material. This study aimed to evaluate the axial variation of <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> of the wood of Araucaria angustifolia (Bertoloni) O. Kuntze in different diameter classes. For this, three trees were selected in six diameter classes, called class 1 (20 - 30 cm), class 2 (30. 1 - 40 cm), class 3 (40. 1 - 50 cm), class 4 (50. 1 - 60 cm), class 5 (60. 1 - 70 cm) and class 6 (70. 1 - 80 cm). From each individual sampled was withdrawn a disc at 0. 1 m (base), 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of the height of the first live branch and in the diameter at 1. 30 m from the ground (DBH), which were used for determining <b>basic</b> <b>density.</b> The weighted average <b>basic</b> <b>density</b> was equal to 0. 422 g cm- 3 and, regardless of the diameter class analyzed, this property decreased in the axial direction. Diameter induced variation of <b>basic</b> <b>density,</b> but has not been verified a positive or negative systematic tendency in relation to the sampled interval...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study the {{evaluation}} of physico-chemical characterization of wood from Maclura pomifera adapted to the Egyptian environmental conditions was achieved. Fiber length, specific gravity and chemical composition: the lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, extractives, hot water solubility, cold water solubility, 1 % alkali solubility and ash contents were determined. The results revealed that fiber length of M. pomifera wood was 0. 87 mm. The dry, green and <b>basic</b> <b>densities</b> were 0. 83 ± 0. 090 g/cm 3, 0. 91 ± 0. 1 g/cm 3 and 0. 62 ± 0. 07 g/cm 3. The lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, extractives, hot water solubility, cold water solubility, 1 % alkali solubility and ash content were 40 ± 2. 45 %, 33. 34 ± 2. 76 %, 17 ± 1. 34 %, 8. 09 ± 1. 34 %, 6. 62 ± 0. 98 %, 4. 12 ± 0. 87 %, 21. 6 ± 2. 54 % and 0. 45 ± 0. 03 %, respectively. This is the first report about the chemical and physical properties of the wood from M. pomifera grown in Egypt...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{guidance}} on tree measurements applying a non-destructive approach in {{tropical forest ecosystems}} motivated the drafting of this paper. The paper guides step by step on how to conduct tree measurements to generate data for biomass and volume modelling. How <b>basic</b> wood <b>densities</b> and carbon content can be determined in the laboratory is also addressed. Guidance and references are provided to assist developing species specific models, generic models, {{as well as to}} quantifying forest biomass and carbon stocks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Didecyl {{dimethyl}} ammOnIum chloride, an alkylammonium compound (AAC) {{was tested}} for {{potential as a}} wood preservative using the method prescribed by Japanese Industrial Standard JIS A 9302 and by a technique developed at the New Zealand Forest Re-search Institute (NZFRI) for determining effectiveness of preservatives in protecting timber used in above-ground situations. Amendments to AAC treating solutions by addition of cupric chloride, which in practice {{may be required to}} increase activity against soft rot fungi, and am-monium hydroxide were evaluated to determine their effect on AAC activity against brown and white rot fungi. Cryptomeria japonica and Pinus radiata were used as test substrates and the effectiveness of the AAC solutions was compared with that of a proprietary copper-chrome-arsenate (CCA) preservative. At equivalent retentions, AAC was more effective than CCA in controlling decay in the JIS A 9302 test, but was less effective in the NZFRI test. Copper chloride and ammonium hydroxide amendments improved AAC effectiveness against white rot, but in dilute solutions adversely affected activity against brown rot. Differences in <b>basic</b> <b>densities</b> of the two test timbers resulted in differences in preservative retentions, particularly when these were expressed as a percentage weight/weight ratio, and some disparity in preservative effectiveness between each substrate was recorded...|$|R
