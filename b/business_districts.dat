5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{immigration}} from New England and New York—regions where most major towns had originated as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the <b>business</b> <b>districts</b> rather than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy behind it spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E

5|$|Later {{installations}} {{faced the}} opposite dilemma of having too few stations: one Streetsblog writer {{noted that the}} stations in the expansions were spaced further apart than the stations in the original service area, which would make the Citi Bike stations in these areas harder to access. In September 2017, a reporter for Time Out magazine wrote that the system did not serve the outer boroughs adequately, with stations only located in wealthier areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens that were closer to the Manhattan central <b>business</b> <b>districts.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central <b>business</b> <b>districts,</b> the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E
5|$|Many of Omaha's {{founding}} figures {{stayed at}} the Douglas House or the Cozzens House Hotel.

Cedar Hill closed in the 1860s and its graves were moved to Prospect Hill, where pioneers were later joined by soldiers from Fort Omaha, African Americans and early European immigrants. There are several other historical cemeteries in Omaha, historical Jewish synagogues and historical Christian churches dating from the pioneer era, as well. The city's pioneering history is celebrated at two sculpture parks, Pioneer Courage and Spirit of Nebraska's Wilderness and The Transcontinental Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The post-independence period {{witnessed}} {{rapid growth}} as Dhaka attracted migrant workers from across rural Bangladesh. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujib {{was assassinated in}} an internal coup d'état. There were further chaos and uprisings in November 1975. An actual military coup was undertaken on 24thMarch 1982 by the sitting Army chief of staff. In the 1980s, Bangladesh pioneered {{the formation of the}} South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and hosted its first summit in Dhaka. A mass uprising in 1990 led to the removal of then Indian backed government and the return of parliamentary democracy.

40|$|Abstract — In {{combination}} with the actual situation and {{the characteristics of the}} railway station <b>business</b> <b>district</b> in China, we formed the railway station <b>business</b> <b>district</b> maturity model, and applied both entropy method and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to the station <b>business</b> <b>district</b> maturity model evaluation. The establishment of entropy fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for a large number of fuzzy factors existing in the railway station <b>business</b> <b>district</b> can increase the scientific nature and the reliability of the evaluation results. This article, using the method to evaluate Beijing railway station, Beijing west railway station, Shanghai railway station and Shanghai Hongqiao railway station <b>business</b> <b>district,</b> then makes an example to verify the accuracy of the results, and puts forward the development strategy of Hongqiao railway station.

30|$|The main {{predictions}} of this simple model {{up to now}} are the following: (1) prices of housing services decrease with {{the distance from the}} central <b>business</b> <b>district</b> to offset the fact that households in suburban areas incur higher transport costs; (2) households can consume more housing services far from the central <b>business</b> <b>district,</b> (3) the rental prices of land also decrease with the distance from the central <b>business</b> <b>district</b> to incentivize developers to build in suburban areas, and as a consequence developers get spatially uniform zero profits; (4) buildings are higher close to the central business district; and (5) the closer to the central <b>business</b> <b>district,</b> the higher the population density.|$|R
5|$|There are six {{business}} {{routes of}} US Highway131 {{in the state}} of Michigan, and previously there was one bypass route. All of the business routes are former sections of US Highway 131 (US131). These former sections of the mainline highway, along with the necessary connecting roads, allow traffic to access the downtowns <b>business</b> <b>districts</b> of cities bypassed by sections of US131 built since the 1950s. The extant business loops connect to Constantine, Three Rivers, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Big Rapids, Cadillac, and Manton. The former bypass route in Grand Rapids allowed traffic to bypass that city's downtown at a time when US131 still ran through the heart of the city.|$|E
5|$|Troops {{withdrew from}} the Pearl Roundabout on 19 February, and protesters {{reestablished}} their camps there. The crown prince assured protesters {{that they would be}} allowed to camp at the roundabout and that he would lead a national dialogue. Protests involving up to one-fifth of the population continued over the next month until the government called in Gulf Cooperation Council troops and police and declared a three-month state of emergency. Despite the police crackdown that followed, smaller-scale protests and clashes continued, mostly outside Manama's <b>business</b> <b>districts.</b> By April 2012, more than 80 people had died during the uprising. As of December 2012, protests are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later known as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. Protests continued for a month reaching over 100,000 participants in a nation of about 500,000 citizens, until more than a thousand troops and police from the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived at the request of government and a three-month state of emergency was declared. Authorities then cracked down on the protests. However, smaller-scale protests and clashes continued to occur almost daily, mostly in areas outside Manama's <b>business</b> <b>districts,</b> with some rare marches {{in the center of the}} capital city. As of April 2012, more than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising and as of January 2013, near-daily clashes between protesters and police are ongoing.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the Melan Arch Bridge, the North Topeka {{side of the}} North Kansas Avenue Bridge {{does not}} connect {{directly}} with Kansas Avenue; it instead leads to N.E. Quincy St. This caused traffic to bypass the North Topeka <b>business</b> <b>district</b> on Kansas Avenue, which local merchants claim led to {{the decline of the}} <b>business</b> <b>district.</b> A fly-off ramp was built in 2004 to connect the bridge to the Kansas Avenue <b>business</b> <b>district</b> and Great Overland Station.|$|R

5|$|Dolmabahçe Palace, {{the seat}} of {{government}} during the late Ottoman period, {{is located in the}} Beşiktaş district on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait, to the north of Beyoğlu. The Sublime Porte (Bâb-ı Âli), which became a metonym for the Ottoman government, was originally used to describe the Imperial Gate (Bâb-ı Hümâyûn) at the outermost courtyard of the Topkapı Palace; but after the 18th century, the Sublime Porte (or simply Porte) began to refer to the gate of the Sadrazamlık (Prime Ministry) compound in the Cağaloğlu quarter near Topkapı Palace, where the offices of the Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) and other Viziers were located, and where foreign diplomats were received. The former village of Ortaköy is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the Ortaköy Mosque on the Bosphorus, near the Bosphorus Bridge. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus are the historic yalıs, luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes. Farther inland, outside the city's inner ring road, are Levent and Maslak, Istanbul's main <b>business</b> <b>districts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Istanbul {{is home to}} Borsa Istanbul, {{the sole}} {{exchange}} entity of Turkey, which combined the former Istanbul Stock Exchange, the Istanbul Gold Exchange, and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey. The former Istanbul Stock Exchange was originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Stock Exchange was located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central <b>business</b> <b>districts</b> of Levent and Maslak. In 1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (now Borsa Istanbul) moved to its current building in the İstinye quarter of the Sarıyer district. A new central business district is also under construction in Ataşehir and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion.|$|E
5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central <b>Business</b> <b>Districts</b> in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the major <b>business</b> <b>district</b> and the residential area of the commuters who commute to the major <b>business</b> <b>district</b> in Seoul, the city with the population of 10 million people and to analyze which <b>business</b> <b>district</b> is being more populated from which residential area with the commuters based on the public transportation provided by Seoul. This study aims to propose an implication in order to consider the spatial systematical structure of Seoul. The major <b>business</b> <b>district</b> of the public transportation users were derived by analyzing the public transportation card data and the residential area distribution for each major area had been analyzed. This leads us to the conclusion that the residential area is populated in the southwest and southeast area of Seoul, that Jongno <b>business</b> <b>district</b> lies from northeast to southwest area and that Yeouido <b>business</b> <b>district</b> and Gasan Digital Complex are populated in the west area. The data gathered from this study could be well utilized for the future reference when establishing a land usage strategy and configuring living space in city planning. Furthermore, this will provide a number of baseline data in the basic city planning of Seoul...|$|R
