5000|$|A {{five-speed}} transmission, {{available in}} normally aspirated cars (type 016) starting in 1979 and standard on all turbos (type G31), was a dog-leg shift pattern Porsche unit, with first gear below reverse {{on the left}} side. This was robust, but expensive due to some 915 internal parts, and was replaced for 1980 with a normal H-pattern Audi five-speed on all non-turbo cars. This lighter duty design was originally not used on the more powerful 924 Turbo. The brakes were solid discs at the front and drums at the rear. The car was criticized in Car and Driver magazine for this <b>braking</b> <b>arrangement,</b> which {{was viewed as a}} step backward from the 914's standard four-wheel disc brakes. However, four-wheel disc brakes, five stud hubs and alloys from the 924 Turbo were available on the base 924 as an [...] "S" [...] package starting with the 1980 model year. Also, standard brakes could be optioned on the turbo as a cost-saving measure.|$|E

50|$|Like G1 before them, the {{original}} GH fleet were fitted with four hatches - two per side, between the axles and {{either side of}} the brake gear along the centre of the underframe. This made access to the brakes unwieldy, and the four hatches released grain too quickly for the conveyor belt systems. To resolve both issues later wagons were built with only two hatches, centered one either side which halved the grain delivery rate and made access to the brake rigging much easier. GH150 and GH151 were constructed with alternative <b>braking</b> <b>arrangements,</b> by cutting a small enclave in underneath one end of the hopper and placing the brake equipment there. Some further wagons were modified, but many (including some then under construction) only had the cut-out section constructed without shifting the brake equipment.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a unidirectional high gain <b>brake</b> <b>arrangement</b> that includes in combination a shaft mounted for rotation within a housing. The shaft is rotatable in either direction. A brake is selectively releasably coupled to the housing {{and to the}} shaft. The brake has a first member. An intermittent motion device is respectively coupled through the first member to the housing and through a one-way clutch to the shaft. The brake also has a second member that is mechanically coupled to the first brake member and to the housing. The intermittent motion device causes the brake to be activated by movement imparted to the first brake member after a preset number of revolutions of the shaft in one direction. The brake is released by rotation of the shaft in an opposite direction whereby torque transmitted through the one-way clutch to the first brake member is removed...|$|R

25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and <b>brake</b> <b>arrangements</b> will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|R

5000|$|Air {{brake systems}} are {{typically}} used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a control pedal, and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there's a disc or drum <b>brake</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{which is designed}} to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these [...] "spring brake" [...] parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx [...] or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes in this application. The air compressor draws filtered air from the atmosphere and forces it into high-pressure reservoirs at around [...] Most heavy vehicles have a gauge within the driver's view, indicating the availability of air pressure for safe vehicle operation, often including warning tones or lights. A mechanical [...] "wig wag" [...] that automatically drops down into the driver's field of vision when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the compressed air storage tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full spring brake pressure immediately.|$|R
25|$|The {{hydraulic}} <b>brake</b> is an <b>arrangement</b> of <b>braking</b> mechanism {{which uses}} brake fluid, typically containing ethylene glycol, to transfer {{pressure from the}} controlling unit, which is usually near the operator of the vehicle, to the actual brake mechanism, which is usually {{at or near the}} wheel of the vehicle.

40|$|The {{limitations}} of current simulation packages {{in addressing the}} true longitudinal behaviour of railway bogie dynamics during braking/traction has prompted {{the development of a}} Rail Bogie Dynamics (RBD) program in this thesis. The RBD program offers novel features for the calculation of the speed profile {{as a function of the}} brake torque as well as explicitly determining wheelset angular velocity. With such capability, the speed profile is no longer treated as an input calculated as a priori as required by most of the current simulation systems. The RBD program has been developed using a formulation that includes the wheelset pitch degree of freedom explicitly with a coordinate reference system that is fixed in space and time. The formulation has made the simulation of the bogie dynamics during braking/traction possible in a natural way using the brake/traction torque as the input and the resulting speed profile as the output without any need for working out the speed profile as a priori. Consequently, severe dynamics during braking such as the wheelset skid and the onset of wheel climb derailment can be modelled and critical parameters investigated using the RBD program. The RBD program has been validated, where possible, through a series of simulations using a commercial software package (VAMPIRE). For cases which cannot be simulated by VAMPIRE such as the wheelset skid, a novel experimental program has been designed and commissioned in the Heavy Testing Laboratory of the Central Queensland University as reported in this thesis. One of the possible applications of the RBD program in examining the effect of asymmetric brake shoe force in bogies equipped with one-side push <b>brake</b> shoe <b>arrangement</b> is illustrated in this thesis. It is believed that the model and RBD program will have significant benefit in understanding the true longitudinal behaviour of wagons in suburban passenger trains that operate under braking/ traction torques for most of their travel. Similar studies will also be useful to freight train wagon dynamics during entry and exit of speed restriction zones and tight curves. " [...] abstract...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{questions}} that have not received a clear answer by academics yet is if the exchange rate regime choice could influence the economic growth. The success of the stabilization programs based on exchange rates, the pegged exchange rate <b>arrangements</b> <b>brake</b> up in some emerging countries, the current difficulties in the Euro zone show why this topic is still controversial and important. We used OLS and GMM methods to estimate a growth model with dummy variables that isolate the effect of exchange rate regimes on economic growth. The research has been employed on 16 Central and Eastern European countries, where the exchange rate arrangement choice is a key point in the years before Euro adoption. We got statistically significant coefficients for the regime dummy variables, independently of the estimation method. Our results suggest superior effect on economic growth of the floating and intermediate regimes comparing to the fixed arrangements. Although the exchange rate stability is commonly viewed as stimulation for economic growth, it seems that it doesn’t support growth if it was obtained by massive interventions of the monetary authorities to support the exchange rate level. Our surprising result does not explain why {{a major part of the}} selected countries adopted hard pegs, although the flexible regimes apparently stimulate growth.

40|$|The mode of {{vibration}} of a noisy {{disc brake}} is always diametral with a noise frequency marginally less than the free {{mode of vibration}} of the disc. Wheel speed {{does not affect the}} frequency but if brake pressure is altered then the noise frequency changes accordingly an increasing pressure resulting in an increasing frequency over a specified range. Such observations have been made of a variety of different disc brake designs from single piston sliding fist type calipers to four piston opposed rigid calipers with it being possible to relate the noise frequency to the free mode of vibration of the disc in all cases. If the characteristics controlling this behavior can be identified then the same principles and criteria may be used to predict the noise propensity of any brake at the design stage. The paper proposes, and shows, that the preferred frequencies of excitation of any disc brake system may be related directly to the free mode frequency of the disc. In addition it is shown that the interface geometry of the pad, the effective rubbing diameter of the disc and the effective working length of the pad are all important features regarding the frequency generated. It is demonstrated that this relationship allows the probable instability frequencies of a disc brake to be predicted and shows that the frequency will vary over a computable range {{as a result of the}} brake pressure. The principle is successfully extended to consider a <b>braking</b> system <b>arrangement</b> employing two calipers working on one wheel. The proposal suggests that brake noise be as much a basic design problem as a material selection problem and answers questions such as why chamfers on pads changes the propensity of a noisy brake to generate noise. A case study of a heavy vehicle using a four opposed piston caliper on the rear and a pair of four opposed piston calipers on each front wheel goes some way to validate the proposal. The study and tests show that angular positioning of the front wheel caliper pair has a significant influence on the propensity of the brake to generate noise and the frequencies that were subsequently emitte...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{retarding}} a moving vehicle or object {{in a controlled}} manner has been investigated over hundreds of years with many different solutions being developed over the years. As time has progressed a common overall design has almost uniformly been agreed upon for vehicle use; a brake disc and caliper or <b>brake</b> drum <b>arrangement.</b> As vehicle refinement has improved there has been increasing focus on the refinement of such designs with regards to their noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) characteristics. Whilst brake noise has had significant research analysing its cause, effect and solutions, brake judder has had less research focussed upon it. The principal reason for past research priorities and the recent interest in judder is because of the increased demands being placed on brakes – higher power absorption with lighter structures. The subject of this thesis was to address the least known phenomena of brake judder, that of the thermo-elastic deformation of vented brake discs. The research utilised experimental, analytical and empirical methods to give a broader understanding of the transient deformation process, both thermo-plastic and thermo-elastic, of a high performance vehicle disc brake. Initial characterisation of thermal judder was carried out on-vehicle where it was identified that brake pressure {{could be used as a}} reliable indicator to show the developing nature of this phenomenon. The brake pressure pulsation was shown to change from low order (first or second order) to high order (up to eighth order) over the duration of a high speed vehicle brake test which involved up to thirty braking events. The pressure pulsation indicated a link to brake disc deformation with the magnitude and order of brake pressure variation increasing with increasing disc temperature. The highly dynamic, transient, nature of brake disc distortion was also investigated on a bespoke quarter car suspension brake dynamometer. Thermoelastic wave-like deformation was shown to occur during the process of a single braking event with the order of deformation corresponding to the brake pressure variation. The order of this wave-like deformation was shown to be linked to the amount of energy transferred into the braking system with higher energy braking events resulting in higher order deformation. Thermal images of the brake disc have shown an equispaced formation of hot-spots on the inboard and outboard friction ring surfaces which was linked to the disc waveform. The wave-like deformation was attributed to circumferential buckling of the brake disc as suggested by Lang [1]. This resulted from rapid thermal expansion of the friction rings due to the sudden - 4 - influx of heat during braking. Thermal gradients between the hot and cold regions of the brake disc constrained the radial thermal expansion of the friction ring and caused compressive stresses to build up. When the tangential load causing the stress was in excess of the critical buckling load, buckling of the brake disc occurred with the mode order of the buckled disc related to the temperature of the friction ring. Stress relieving of the brake disc was shown to occur during brake testing on the brake dynamometer causing a thermo-plastic effect. This “in service” stress relieving effect removed the retained stresses resulting from the casting and machining processes and allowed the disc to adopt a second order mode of deformation. Data from the on-vehicle and dynamometer testing was used to generate and validate finite element analysis simulations which were used to investigate thermal inputs and heat dissipation from the brake disc. These findings were then combined with that of an associated aerodynamic study [2] to generate a modified brake disc vent profile which reduced the surface temperature variation, thermal gradients and maximum disc temperature. On-vehicle testing of the prototype design showed an average 14 % reduction in maximum disc temperature and it was proposed that this would reduce the propensity for the disc to generate judder by reducing the thermal deformation of the brake disc.
