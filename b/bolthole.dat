500|$|Waugh {{had decided}} {{in the summer of}} 1955 that he would sell Piers Court. By October 1956 the sale had been {{completed}} and he had acquired a new home in the Somerset village of Combe Florey. While the chaos of the move went on around him, Waugh worked on the novel; in November he moved to his pre-war <b>bolthole,</b> the Easton Court Hotel at Chagford, where he hoped to finish the book. As the date for the libel case against Nancy Spain and the Express approached, Waugh was involved in a second libel action, against the author and journalist Rebecca West and Pan Books, an additional distraction that delayed the novel's completion. In January 1957 Waugh rewrote the ending, creating a circularity with a return to the words that introduce the novel, and also gave the book its subtitle, [...] "A Conversation Piece". Waugh did not explain his choice of wording for the subtitle, but David Wykes in his literary biography believes it is an ironic reference to the traditional British paintings of families and friends in social gatherings; in this case the [...] "conversation" [...] is with enemies, not friends. The main title is an echo of George Meredith's Victorian novel The Ordeal of Richard Feverel. By the end of January 1957 the book was in the publishers' hands.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had Mr. Miller {{disappeared}} on his peace-making errand, {{when there}} was a noise like a fowl going through a quickset hedge, and Mr. Saltzburg, brandishing his baton as if he were conducting an unseen orchestra, plunged through the scenery at the left upper entrance and charged excitedly down the stage. Having taken his musicians twice through the overture, he had for ten minutes been sitting in silence, waiting for the curtain to go up. At last, his emotional nature cracking under the strain of this suspense, he had left his conductor's chair and plunged down under the stage by way of the musician's <b>bolthole</b> to ascertain what was causing the delay.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{is based}} around {{the idea that}} a group of American {{industrialists}} predicted the coming of an apocalyptic nuclear war, and began to create a plan for an emergency operations and reconstruction infrastructure that would survive that war. This plan is the eponymous [...] "Morrow Project". A number of volunteers were cryogenically frozen in hidden bunkers called <b>boltholes.</b> They were provided with caches of supplies and equipment, intended to help the teams rebuild civilization—once the war had ended and the resulting nuclear fallout had diminished enough.|$|R
40|$|The {{wheel hub}} in {{question}} has failed by fatigue. Three fatigue cracks {{were identified and}} all of them were found to have initiated at the fillet of the outer rim region close to the <b>boltholes.</b> After initiation, the cracks have propagated to a depth of about 15 mm. The crack lengths were measured to be in the range 45 to 60 mm. The microstructure of the wheel hub material was found satisfactory and there were no metallurgical abnormalities at the fatigue crack origins. The fatigue is stress related. From the pattern of failure, assembly stresses appear to be the most probable reason for fatigue crack initiation. However, the information provided is not adequate enough to ascertain this unambiguously...|$|R
5000|$|In jointed track, rails {{are usually}} {{connected}} with bolted fishplates (joint bars). The web {{of the rail}} experiences large shear forces and these are enhanced around the bolt hole. Where track maintenance is poor, metallurgical fatigue can result in the propagation of star cracking from the <b>bolthole.</b> In extreme situations {{this can lead to}} a triangular piece of rail at the joint becoming detached.|$|E

Churchill was not a very great fan of the constituency, regarding it as inferior in social status to a rural Conservative stronghold.|$|E
5000|$|Previous {{inference}} {{has suggested}} that he probably built Merville as a <b>bolthole</b> for contemplation and leisurely pursuits. But the actual reason why a room at Merville House is named after {{a member of the}} Donegall dynasty is because Chichester was the lawful possessor of the townland of Drumnadrough where Merville stands, as well as all of the neighbouring townlands that established the former civil parish of Coole or Carnmoney. His ancestor, Sir Arthur Chichester (1536-1625), was given the lands by King James I in May 1604 during the period of Irish History that became known as the Plantation of Ulster.

They deduce she is a formidable woman who knows Holmes's methods thoroughly and has infiltrated some of his secure <b>boltholes</b> in London. Faced with a powerful opponent, Holmes elects to frustrate her by leaving England entirely with Russell. The pair set off for Palestine for six weeks on a mission with two of Mycroft's spies.

40|$|AbstractAero engines clearly {{differ from}} other {{propulsion}} systems used in general mechanical engineering particularly through {{the materials used}} and the extreme stresses that occur during operation. <b>Boltholes</b> in rotating turbine and compressor disks {{are among the most}} highly-stressed geometric features of jet-engines. For manufacturers of jet-engine components it is important to assess the quality of these at an early stage in the manufacturing of the product. The use of commercially available monitoring systems in hole-making has been successful in individual cases so far. Major reasons for this lack of effectiveness are the large material variations within one production batch, the overall difficult machinability of the materials applied, the small lot size which makes “teach-in” operations ineffective. Additional challenges occur during the implementation of monitoring systems in production. Here, the monitoring solution is judged predominantly by its robustness, its reliability against false alarms and its level of integration in the machine tool. A high level of integration can be achieved by using internal data, provided by the components of the machine tools themselves. The paper describes a new approach in real-time monitoring for drilling <b>boltholes.</b> In an experimental setup, process data origination from the NC of a Sinumeric 840 D, collected by an OPC-Server had been processed. Comparing OPC data logging, DAU data logging and profibus data logging with respect to data quality, sample rate and real-time behaviour, profibus data logging appears to be the favourable choice. Compared to the price of many dedicated external sensors, all three methods to log internal data provide data access with small investments on a high level of integration. The experimental results indicate that OPC-data are suitable for tool wear monitoring and surface quality evaluation after drilling with solid carbide drills and face cutting reamers in Inconel 718 workpieces...|$|R

40|$|We used {{observations}} and manipulation experiments to investigate how meerkats, social mongooses living under high predation pressure, find shelter from predators quickly within their territory. We played back alarm calls to foraging meerkats and dug new boltholes and covered existing ones {{to see whether}} location or other cues were used. Meerkats almost always ran to the <b>bolthole</b> closest to them. This was not done by a simple rule of running back to a <b>bolthole</b> they had just passed, nor by escaping in any direction and finding a <b>bolthole</b> by chance. Meerkats nearly always ignored the boltholes that we dug but ran to those we had covered up. Our results {{support the hypothesis that}} meerkats know in which direction to run when an alarm call is given, without scanning the area for visual or olfactory cues of shelters. As meerkats have more than 1000 boltholes in their territory, our results suggest that they have detailed knowledge of the direction and the distance of specific locations. However, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} they have a spatial map of their territory; our results may be explained by place recognition or reorientation of specific landmark features...|$|E
5000|$|The lug holes {{should have}} been drilled and the tiebars secured by pins filling the holes (rather than bolts) (Cochrane had not been {{surprised}} that <b>boltholes</b> had been cast conical; moulders were notorious for this, unless you stood over them.

Pole - called by Bouch's counsel - agreed. Bouch said if he had known the holes were cast conical he would have had them bored or reamed.

40|$|Field {{observations}} and acoustic analyses {{have shown that}} suricate (Suricata suricatta) alarm calls vary in their acoustic structure depending on predator type. In this study, we tested whether receivers respond appropriately when hearing a call {{in the absence of}} a predator. Although the only way for suricates to escape from predators is to retreat to <b>boltholes,</b> responses to playbacks could be divided into distinct categories. The subjects responded differently to alarm calls given in response to aerial or terrestrial predators and to recruitment calls emitted in response to snakes and deposits on the ground. Suricates also showed rather distinct responses to low, medium and high urgency aerial calls. Differences in the responses were less obvious for different levels of urgency in the terrestrial and recruitment calls. Suricate receivers thus gain information about both the predator type and level of urgency from the acoustic structures of their calls...|$|R
50|$|Crannogs took on many {{different}} forms {{and methods of}} construction based on what was available in the immediate landscape. The classic image of a prehistoric crannog stems from both post-medieval illustrations and highly influential excavations such as Milton Loch in Scotland by C.M. Piggot after World War II. The Milton Loch interpretation is of a small islet surrounded or defined at its edges by timber piles and a gangway, topped by a typical Iron Age roundhouse. The choice of a small islet as a home may seem odd today, yet waterways were the main channels for both communication and travel until the 19th century in much of Ireland and especially Highland Scotland. Crannogs are traditionally interpreted as simple prehistorical farmsteads. They are also interpreted as <b>boltholes</b> in times of danger, as status symbols with limited access and as inherited locations of power that imply a sense of legitimacy and ancestry towards ownership of the surrounding landscape.|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{computer}} models of UT measurements {{are becoming more}} prominent in evaluating NDEmethods – {{a process known as}} Model Assisted Probability of Detection, or MAPOD. As inspection requirements become more stringent, the respective models become more complex. An important application for aerospace structures involves inspection for cracks near boltholes in plate and layered structures. This paper describes a project to develop and validate analytical models for <b>bolthole</b> crackinspection, as well as to implement and demonstrate those models within an integrated graphical interface which can be used to simulate these inspections. The work involves a combination of approximate, paraxial, bulk-wave models as well as more rigorous, analytical models that include both bulk and surface/plate modes. The simpler models have greater flexibility and efficiency for handling complex geometry, while the more exact models are useful for benchmarking and assessing the accuracy of the paraxial versions. Model results will be presented for <b>bolthole</b> cracks in single layered components. Extensions of the models to multiple layers and to more complex geometries and materials will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspection}} capability on {{turbine engine}} disks {{is important to}} the safety of an airplane. Eddy current inspection has been widely accepted as an effective tool in detecting small fatigue cracks on engine disks. The inspection of simple geometries such as <b>boltholes,</b> webs and bores in a engine disk is less complicated than those of complex geometries such as antirotation windows, scallops, dovetails and non-circular holes. One of the main difficulties in inspecting complex geometries is due to the presence of irregular edges. Raatz [1] reported the influence of edges in measuring conductivity. Williams, Tilson and Blitz [2] minimized the change of phase angle variation around an edge by the proper selection of inspection frequency and coil size. Elsberry and Bailey [3] enhanced edge defect detection by using a shielded probe to collimate the field. Hoppe and Stubbs [4], on the other hand, used the frequency content of the edge signals to discern the edge defect in antirotation windows. This frequency approach was extended to the inspection of other complex geometries such as antirotation tangs and live rims by Ko [5]. Furthermore, Ko [6] used the edge signals in scallops to position a rotational probe in a scallop prior to inspection. These techniques [4 – 6] are limited to partial inspection of the geometries; however, a new technique is needed if an entire inspection of a complex geometry is required. This paper discusses the use of a simple mechanical mechanism to adapt to a complex geometry, and a signal processing technique for the detection of edge defects...|$|R
50|$|In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Ancestor Cell by Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, Gallifrey is {{destroyed}} {{as a result}} of the Eighth Doctor's desire to prevent the voodoo cult Faction Paradox from starting a war between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy. Hints about this future war are dropped in several books earlier in the series beginning with Lawrence Miles' Alien Bodies. In order to have <b>boltholes</b> or decoys in case of attack, the Time Lords have created nine separate planet Gallifreys (it even hinted that the original Gallifrey may at some point be reduced to ruins) and special looms to constantly produce new soldiers. By this time TARDISes have evolved to point where they appear human and reproduce sexually (the Doctor's companion Compassion is the first such TARDIS). It is also hinted that the Celestial Intervention Agency will evolve into the beings of pure thought known as the Celestis, who observe the war from outside this dimension (the Last Parliament in which they sit resembles the Panopticon on Gallifrey and the closest anyone gets to describing them is similar to the Time Lords' robes). Faction Paradox itself is a counter to Time Lord society, dedicated to creating time-travel paradoxes, in contrast to the Time Lords' web of time. It was founded by a mysterious figure Grandfather Paradox, who it is believed was once a Time Lord from the House of Lungbarrow. The Ancestor Cell suggests that he is a future version of the Doctor, but this is retconned in The Gallifrey Chronicles, to him being everyone's potential future self. When the Doctor destroys Gallifrey the war no longer happens and his actions also apparently (and retroactively) wipe the Time Lords from history.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bolthole</b> {{represents}} an audio scene or {{moment in time}} from a larger work in progress intended for cd/dvd/website release. It was released as a track on a cd compilation of 1, 000 copies commissioned by the Vane Gallery {{as part of their}} "Otherliness" project This proposal for this starts from the notion of dens, boltholes and hideaways – secret and mysterious places we created physically as children to let our imaginations run wild. This sense of refuge often becomes more emotive and semiotic as we continue to seek these spaces as adults – a virtual pavilion which in times of social compression can enclose, surround and shelter us through subconscious projection. The text for <b>Bolthole</b> describes a field recording at Grindleford staion in the Peak District of a high speed train that enters Totley tunnel. This prompts the memeory of “The Last Train” a tv series (1999) where passengers on a train are put in accidental suspended animation while travelling through the same tunnel and emerge later into a devastated world. This links to my fascination and study of Urban Wildscapes I use specialised recording and playback techniques to document physical environments which can be manipulated to explore the heterotopic nature of space as a sensual and subconscious experience Typically these “sonic snapshots” are accompanied with grid references and photographs/videos web to encourage interactivity from a web-based interactive community...|$|E
