Chan lost his appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court on 10 May 2011 and Sukumaran's appeal was dismissed on 6 July 2011. <b>Both</b> <b>made</b> pleas for clemency to the Indonesian President that were rejected in December 2014 and January 2015.|$|E
5|$|Craig has {{appeared}} in two World Series and in <b>both</b> <b>made</b> history. In the 2011 World Series, he tied a record by collecting three hits that drove in the game-winning run. In 2013, {{he became the first}} player to score a game-winning run on an obstruction call.|$|E
5|$|Culturally, the {{campaign}} captured the public imagination in Britain and France: the Battle of Grand Port {{is the only}} naval battle that appears on the Arc de Triomphe, while in Britain Rowley and Bertie were <b>both</b> <b>made</b> baronets for their services in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

50|$|A later jet-powered design, the Ryan X-13 Vertijet, first flew in 1955. Two prototypes were <b>made,</b> <b>both</b> flew, <b>made</b> {{successful}} {{transitions to}} and from horizontal flight, and landed. The final test flight was near Washington DC in 1957.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{with the blessing}} and critical input of Apple Corps, including former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, who <b>both</b> <b>made</b> public appearances supporting the game. George Harrison's son Dhani helped to bridge discussion between Harmonix and Apple Corps, while Giles Martin, son of the Beatles' music producer George Martin, ensured high-fidelity versions of the Beatles' songs would be available.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{supported}} fixed four-year {{terms for}} {{both houses of}} Parliament. In 2006, he accused the ALP of failing to press for this change. In April 2007, he and Margaret Whitlam were <b>both</b> <b>made</b> life members of the Australian Labor Party. This {{was the first time}} anyone had been made a life member of the party organisation at the national level.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second half, the Terrapins kicked off to the Seminoles before both teams traded field goals. It would be the only points Maryland would muster all night. In the fourth quarter, Florida State added another field goal. On the next possession, Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott and receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey <b>both</b> <b>made</b> short runs for a first down. Scott lost his second fumble of the night on the Terrapin 43-yard line. Florida State took over and scored another touchdown. After Maryland went three-and-out, Seminoles kicker Graham Gano made his third field goal of the night.|$|E

5|$|Cagney's {{frequent}} co-star, Pat O'Brien, {{appeared with}} him on the British chat show Parkinson in the early 1980s and they <b>both</b> <b>made</b> a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise to her feet, the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|Fingleton scored 66 for the Australians in an innings {{victory over}} Western Australia before sailing for South Africa. It {{was to be}} the start of a very {{productive}} campaign. In the three matches leading up to the Tests, against Natal, Western Province and Transvaal respectively, Fingleton scored 121, 53, 99 and seven not out. Australia won the latter match by ten wickets and the others by an innings. In the match by Natal, Fingleton and Brown <b>both</b> <b>made</b> centuries and combined in a double century stand.|$|E
5|$|Harta Berdarah starred Soelastri and Zonder, and {{featured}} Moesa, Oedjang, Oesman, Haroen, and Abdullah. Many {{of these}} actors, including Soelastri and Fatimah, had had roles in Kedok Ketawa, and Moesa, though only recently signed, had previously acted for another company. Zonder, {{who made his}} film debut in Harta Berdarah, was well-versed in the traditional martial art of silat, while Soelastri was {{also known as a}} keroncong singer under the stage name Miss Ning; <b>both</b> <b>made</b> use of these skills for the film, which was scored by Hugo Dumas' musical troupe Lief Java. Cinematography for the production was handled by KH Tjit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Bath {{acquired}} its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, {{along with the}} Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, {{who presided over the}} city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors such as the wealthy London bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife, who <b>both</b> <b>made</b> long visits.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second-inning {{home run}} {{was the only}} hit by the Yankees against Pedro Martínez, who struck out 17 Yankees—the most strikeouts against a Yankee team ever. Martínez retired the last 22 batters after giving up the home run, {{including}} striking out eight of the final nine batters. The teams finished first and second in their division and <b>both</b> <b>made</b> the playoffs in the same season. This led to the very first post-season meeting in the longtime rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less common than other dairy products {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, <b>both</b> <b>made</b> from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E

5|$|The canal company carried {{goods in}} their own boats, and {{produced}} {{a report on the}} four years from August 1846 to June 1850 in 1851. This showed an income of £180,746 from tolls, and identified six main types of traffic. These included iron goods from the Wolverhampton area to Liverpool; limestone from Trevor and Crickheath to Nantwich or Wappenshall on the Shrewsbury Canal, with a back trade in iron ore from near Burslem; general merchandise, which was carried between Chester and Liverpool; and general merchandise for Shropshire and North Wales. All of these were profitable. The carriage of general goods from Birmingham to Liverpool and the Chester coal trade <b>both</b> <b>made</b> a small loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} prototype metre and kilogram were <b>both</b> <b>made</b> from a 90%platinum, 10%iridium alloy {{which is}} exceptionally hard {{and which has}} good electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The prototype had a special X-shaped (Tresca) cross section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons. and the prototype kilograms were cylindrical in shape. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms. At {{the first meeting of}} the CGPM in 1889 bar No.6 and cylinder No.X were accepted as the international prototypes. The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Australia won the toss and batted {{first in}} the Second Test at Lord's. They were on the back foot at 7/258 at stumps on the first day. On the second morning, the Australian lower order counter-attacked; Toshack joined Johnston with the score at 9/320 and they put on 30 runs before Johnston was stumped. Australia regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One {{sequence}} of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers. Both players swung wildly at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. <b>Both</b> <b>made</b> new Test best scores; Toshack scored 20 not out. Both Johnston and Toshack—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. England were then bowled out for 215. Toshack was wicketless, but was the most economical of the bowlers, conceding only 23 runs from his 18 overs. Toshack operated after the first new ball was taken, and as England had fallen to 4/46, they played him cautiously {{in an attempt to}} rebuild the innings. Australia then declared at 7/460 in their second innings with Toshack not required to bat, leaving England a target of 596.|$|E
