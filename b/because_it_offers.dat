25|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for playing {{miniature}} wargames, in both these respects, is <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>offers</b> players more freedom of play and a more aesthetically pleasing tactical element over traditional games or computer games. Additionally, many hobbyists enjoy the challenge of painting miniatures and constructing scenery. In many ways, miniature wargaming may be seen as combining many of the aesthetics of tabletop train modelling with an open strategy game predominantly, though not exclusively, with a military theme. There is also a large social component to wargames as very often games are played with several participants on a side.|$|E

25|$|Each year {{billions of}} dollars of illegal {{gambling}} takes place in New Jersey. Illegal gambling operations range from employees who make money on office sports betting pools to online poker websites to multimillion-dollar enterprises run by organized criminals. Despite the availability of legal gambling in New Jersey, studies have shown that illegal gambling persists <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>offers</b> options that are not available legally (e.g., casino gambling outside of Atlantic City), and because some gamblers prefer using a bookmaker whom they personally know. State law does not punish players, but a person operating an illegal gambling enterprise, or possessing equipment or records used for illegal gambling can face up to five years' imprisonment depending on the quantity and size of the bets. However, illegal gambling arrests are rare in New Jersey, and there is presumption of non-incarceration for first-time offenders.|$|E

[...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic.

500|$|While {{he enjoyed}} {{enthusiastic}} {{support from the}} conservative movement, Goldwater was opposed by liberals and moderates in the party, particularly New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who was also speculated to run for president. He cast Goldwater as an opponent of civil rights and an isolationist who wanted {{to withdraw from the}} United Nations. He vowed to stop Goldwater from running, [...] "at all costs". There were concerns that Goldwater and the more moderate Rockefeller could divide the Republican party, harming the its chances of winning the general election. Goldwater was the perceived leader of a grassroots movement in the American southern, southwestern, and western states staged by the more conservative wing of the party. Rockefeller, on the other hand, disagreed with most of the fiscal and social positions held by Goldwater, advocating a more progressive, mainstream approach to government for the Republican platform. News of Rockefeller's marriage in May 1963, eighteen months after he divorced his first wife, to a woman with whom he'd had a relationship for over five years spread quickly throughout the nation. Initially, Rockefeller's divorce received little media fanfare; however, news of his remarriage prompted a considerably negative reaction among many. Rockefeller, who had been leading in the polls over other Republican candidates by a comfortable margin just weeks previously, saw a significant decrease in support for his candidacy. In July 1963, he made an attempt to regain lost support by taking aim at what he viewed as [...] "extremist groups," [...] targeting Goldwater specifically. Goldwater responded by accusing Rockefeller of blurring the line separating the Republican and Democratic parties. In attacking Goldwater's politics and advocating his own, more progressive agenda, Rockefeller said to voters [...] "Americans will not and should not respond to a political creed that cherishes the past solely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>offers</b> an excuse for shutting out the hard facts and difficult tasks of the present." ...|$|E

2500|$|The terms MSM {{and women}} who have sex with women (WSW) have been used in medical {{scholarship}} since at least 1990. But, the term has been attributed to Glick et al., because their usage in a 1994 study solidified the concept in medical terminology. MSM is often used in medical literature and social research to describe such men as a group for research studies without considering issues of self-identification <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>offers</b> better behavioral categories for the study of disease-risk than identity-based categories (such as [...] "gay", [...] "bisexual", or [...] "straight"), because a man who self-identifies as gay or bisexual is not necessarily sexually active with men, and someone who identifies as straight might be sexually active with men.|$|E

2500|$|... "What is {{the purpose}} of science?" [...] is the {{question}} repeatedly asked in Poincaré's book. To this teleological problem, Poincaré responds by taking the opposite position from that of Édouard Le Roy, philosopher and mathematician, who argued in a 1905 article (Sur la logique de l'invention, [...] "On the logic of invention") that science is intrinsically anti-intellectual (in the sense of Henri Bergson) and nominalistic. In contrast to Le Roy, Poincaré follows the thought of Pierre Duhem. He explains that the notion that science is anti-intellectual is self-contradictory, and that the accusation of nominalism can be strongly criticized, because it rests on confusions of thoughts and definitions. He defends the idea of conventional principles, and the idea that scientific activity is not merely a set of conventions arranged arbitrarily around the raw observations of experiment. He wishes rather to demonstrate that objectivity in science comes precisely {{from the fact that the}} scientist does no more than translate raw facts into a particular language: [...] "(...) tout ce que crée le savant dans un fait, c'est le langage dans lequel il l'énonce". The only contribution of science would be the development of a more and more mathematized language, a coherent language <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>offers</b> predictions which are useful – but not certain, as they remain forever subject to comparisons with real observations, and are always fallible.|$|E
