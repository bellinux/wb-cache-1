5|$|Haddam Island State Park {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of bird species, {{especially}} during annual migrations, which make it suitable for birdwatching. Bird-banding and other research activities have taken place on the island. Other recommended activities are boating and fishing. Access via <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> available from the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch, a half mile south of Haddam Island. The northern side of the island has a beach that is fragile and cannot support heavy visitation, and the island has a significant amount of poison ivy.|$|E
5|$|One {{day when}} the <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> out, Sasha finds a bag with a very young cat inside it in the water. The captain takes him home and names him Patch. The spring thaw arrives, and the captain ties up the boat and prepares to go elsewhere. Sasha decides not {{to go with the}} captain and Patch because she now knows that she is going to have kits, and wants them born in the forest. Patch and the captain are sad, but they understand.|$|E
5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's fishing <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> {{taken away}} by creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> called shōrōbune (精霊船). The <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> said {{to carry}} {{the souls of the}} {{deceased}} on them. The <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> mainly built by people who have lost a family member in the last year, though they are also built by others.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} two other Stämpfli fours, most other <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> Janousek. The {{majority}} of <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> built for scull and sweep rigging for versatility, also necessary {{due to the}} limited boat racking space, meaning {{the total number of}} <b>boats</b> <b>is</b> limited.|$|R
25|$|Abosso had 12 lifeboats. The even-numbered <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> on her {{port side}} {{and it is}} not clear whether any of them was launched.

As No. 3 <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> being lowered, one of its falls was let go and all of the <b>boat's</b> occupants <b>were</b> thrown into the water. No. 3 boat seems to have been carrying most of the Dutch submariners. No. 5 <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> launched successfully and managed to rescue four of the Dutch from the water. No. 9 <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> also launched successfully. It <b>was</b> a motor <b>boat</b> and moved around picking up survivors from the water.|$|R
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last {{expedition}} {{and was a}} former schoolfriend of Shackleton’s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944. In 1967, the boat {{was given to the}} care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College and placed in a new location in the North Cloister, on a bed of stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the James Cairds permanent home, although the <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia and Bonn, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock to climb up on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Blackmer and Culp depart {{the next}} morning, their <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> {{attacked}} by an alligator, now enlarged {{because of the}} contamination. Orchard's assistant, Hector McGill, manages to rescue only Blackmer. The house is quickly surrounded by three giant alligators, which throw themselves at the building with Orchard, McGill, Blackmer and Mrs Files trapped inside. On the advice of Mrs Files, McGill contacts International Rescue and John (voiced by Ray Barrett) alerts Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) dispatches Thunderbirds 1 and 2. Arriving at the scene, Scott (Shane Rimmer) briefly dispels the reptiles with his hoverjet cannon and accesses the house through the laboratory window. Eventually the laboratory caves in, forcing Scott and the others {{to move to the}} lounge. There, the group is confronted by none other than Culp, who survived the alligator attack and holds them at gunpoint.|$|E
5|$|The affront at {{the heart}} of Show <b>Boat</b> <b>is</b> still very alive today. It begins with the book and its {{negative}} and one-dimensional images of Black people, and continues on through the colossal and deliberate omission of the Black experience, including the pain of a people traumatized by four centuries of attempted genocide and exploitation. Not to mention the appropriation of Black music for the profit of the very people who oppressed Blacks and Africans. All this continues to offend deeply. The ol' man river of racism continues to run through the history of these productions and is very much part of this (Toronto) production. It is part of the overwhelming need of white Americans and white Canadians to convince themselves of our inferiority – that our demands don't represent a challenge to them, their privilege and their superiority.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, the {{two characters}} attempt to coordinate an escape with their fellow people. A girl {{appears in a}} boat she constructed from wood used in the sand castle {{from the beginning of}} the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group loads onto it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had been in their own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, the man and woman spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with the man and woman, last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water. The final five frames of the comic, in which the <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> bobbing on the water, are currently rotating in an undetermined pattern for the comic on the xkcd website.|$|E
50|$|Larger <b>boats,</b> called moyaibune, <b>are</b> {{created and}} sent out by neighborhoods, local councils or organizations. Prior to the 1950s, {{these sorts of}} <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> more popular, as {{individual}} family <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> expensive and considered relatively luxurious.

Dick delivers the drugs, and Logan learns that Hector is now the prime suspect in Felix's death. Two FBI agents talk to Sheriff Lamb, intent on getting the baby back. Veronica shows some information about Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan stole a boat. However, when the <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> searched they do not find anyone—just evidence that people were there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away {{while he was in}} it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E
