50|$|The Jewish Ghetto Police {{which he}} joined, {{was not a}} benevolent force by any means. Emanuel Ringelblum {{referred}} to it as 'the direct instrument of extermination'. One of the first clandestine operations of the Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB) in Warsaw, was to assassinate its commanders. Perechodnik's account therefore, needs to be seen in its proper perspective. His memoir describes such events as his and his father’s compliance with the Polish radio <b>broadcast</b> <b>command</b> to go eastward to fight in 1939, the formation of the Judenrat in Otwock, Himmler’s visit to Warsaw, the death of Czerniakow, the rounding up of Jews in the ghettos; life in, and escape from, a work camp; the experience of being hidden in Warsaw, the beginning of understanding of {{what was happening in the}} death camps, the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. His information is now considered by various researchers and experts on the Holocaust to be remarkably accurate, and according to these researchers, the notes show proof that the Jews at that time knew what was happening.|$|E

30|$|Second, single-hop {{transmission}} suffices in many application scenarios, {{particularly in}} hierarchically organised networks. For example, in a battlefield scenario {{it would not}} be uncommon for a satellite or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to directly (i.e., single-hop) <b>broadcast</b> <b>command</b> and control messages to all soldiers in a troop unit. Likewise in a natural resource monitoring application a mobile base-station could periodically broadcast a set of instructions to all sensor devices in a region in a single-hop fashion. In such networks multihopping may not even be desirable (for possible reliability and energy reasons). So there is indeed value in developing security solutions that apply to such single-hop networks.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} specifies {{the prototype}} Clock and Control Board (CCB) for the CMS Endcap Muon electronics {{residing in the}} Sector Processor (SP) crates in the counting room. The standard set of modules in each crate consists of two SP and six Sector Receivers (SR). The general block diagram of the CCB is shown on Fig. 1. 1. TTC Interface The TTC interface {{is based on the}} TTCrx chip [1]. The prototype CCB includes connectors for the TTCrx mezzanine board. The general sequence of L 1 ACC, Reset and BX 0 commands is described in [2]. Particularly, for the Reset sequence, the TTC sends a <b>broadcast</b> <b>command</b> (either system, or user) to the TTCrx indicating that the next L 1 ACC has to be treated as a Reset. After this data is sent, a single L 1 ACC is generated. CCB decoding logic recognizes this command and treats the next incoming L 1 ACC as a RESET signal. After some predetermined interval the next <b>broadcast</b> <b>command</b> is transmitted over the TTC indicating that the next L 1 ACC should be treated as Bunch Crossing 0. In a similar fashion, CCB recognizes this command and treats the next L 1 ACC as a BX 0. After that CCB internal logic enables generation of L 1 A to backplane upon every L 1 ACC from TTC system. We use only one option when BrcstStr 2 and Brcst are synchronized to Clock 40 Des 1. We do not use an option when BrcstStr 2 and Brcst are synchronized to Clock 40 Des 2 The TTCrx chip can be programmed using an I 2 C interface and interface controller PCF 8584 over VME (see Fig. 2).

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} about {{stochastic}} recruitment, a control architecture for centrally controlling the ensemble behavior of many identical agents, {{in a manner}} similar to motor recruitment in skeletal muscles. Each agent has a finite set of behaviors, or states, which can be switched based on a <b>broadcast</b> <b>command.</b> By switching randomly between states with a centrally determined probability, it is possible to designate the number of agents in each state. This paper covers stochastic recruitment policies for the case when little or no feedback is available from the system. Feed-forward control policies based on rate equilibria are presented, with an analysis of the performance trade-offs inherent in the problem. Minimal feedback control laws are also discussed, and a policy is presented which minimizes the expected convergence time of the system given only the ability to halt the system when the desired output has been achieved. some input given to all agents in the system. The authors are actively working on applying this control framework to the problems of endothelial cell migration and artificial muscle actuators. Figure 1 illustrates the basic system architecture.

40|$|Many {{parallel}} {{applications are}} designed to conceal parallelism from the user. In this paper, we investigate a different approach where the user controls many tasks running in parallel. The idea is to let a user accomplish his goal more quickly by trying competing alternatives in parallel (or-parallelism) and by working on subgoals in parallel (and-parallelism). To help the user manage {{a large number of}} parallel tasks, the application must provide features to generate many tasks easily, to summarize the state of all tasks, to <b>broadcast</b> <b>commands</b> to related tasks, and to abort tasks that are no longer needed. A parallel interface to an application thus becomes crucial to enhance the user's productivity.

SensorScope has now been running continuously for 6 months. The paper presents an analysis of three 2 week periods and compares {{them in terms of}} parameter settings, and their impact on data delivery and routing tree depth stability.

The phenomena discussed in this paper are well known. The contribution of this paper is an insight to a long running sensor network that is more realistic than a testbed with a wired back-channel, but more controllable than a long-term, remote experiment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensors {{can improve}} {{our ability to}} monitor {{critical}} civil infrastructure, including highways & bridges. We have previously reported on highly miniaturized, wireless strain, acceleration, and inclination sensing systems capable of providing low & high speed data update rates. Signal conditioning, multiplexing, A/D conversion, processing, amplifying, data logging, and bi-directional wireless communications are fully integrated. Each node includes a unique address (RFID), allowing a single base station to orchestrate data collection from thousands of distinct sensing nodes. In order to enhance these capabilities, we have produced a new base station with remote cellular telephone interface. This allows access to the sensing network from anywhere where cellular communications are available. Key operating parameters such as triggering, data sampling rates, data sampling duration, continuous streaming duration, and number of active channels may all be programmed remotely. The base station can issue <b>broadcast</b> <b>commands,</b> such as “wake up, begin data logging, or “go back to sleep”. Node specific commands include “download data from node, remove offsets from a node’s channel, increase gain on a node’s channel”.

40|$|Communication with a {{spacecraft}} is typically performed using Radio Frequency (RF). RF is a well-established and well-regulated technology that enables communication over long distances as proven by the Voyager 1 & II missions. However, RF requires licensing of very limited radio spectrum and this poses {{a challenge in}} the future, particularly with spectrum time-sharing. This is of a concern for emergency communication when it is of utmost urgency to contact the spacecraft and maintain contact, particularly {{when there is a}} major mission anomaly or loss of contact. For these applications, we propose a backup laser communication system where a laser is beamed towards a satellite and the onboard photovoltaics acts as a laser receiver. This approach enables a laser ground station to <b>broadcast</b> <b>commands</b> to the spacecraft in times of emergency. Adding an actuated reflector to the laser receiver on the spacecraft enables two-way communication between ground and the spacecraft, but without the laser being located on the spacecraft. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of the concept in the laboratory and develop a benchtop experiment to verify the concept. We have also developed a preliminary design for a 6 U CubeSat-based demonstrator to evaluate technology meritsComment: 8 pages, 13 figures in IEEE Aerospace Conference 201...|$|R

40|$|Aggregated information, such as {{the total}} and free {{capacity}} of storages, computing power, network bandwidth, and so on, {{is very important for}} many peer-to-peer (P 2 P) ap-plications and P 2 P-based grid or cloud computing. Previous studies have proposed to build a broadcast tree for a structured P 2 P network. Along this tree, the root can broad-cast a command message to all the other peers, and in the reversed redirection, infor-mation can be aggregated from leaves to the root. Although <b>command</b> <b>broadcast</b> and in-formation aggregation can be processed within O(log N) hops expectedly, where N is network size, the required time may vary dramatically. In this paper, the authors further-more consider the order of message forwarding in a broadcast tree.

The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can signif-icantly reduce the time required to complete <b>command</b> <b>broadcast,</b> as well as information aggregation.

40|$|At the LHC, precise bunch-crossing {{clock and}} machine orbit signals must be {{broadcast}} over distances of several km from the Prevessin Control Room {{to the four}} experiment areas and other destinations. At the LHC experiments themselves, quite extensive distribution systems are also required for the transmission of timing, trigger and control (TTC) signals to large numbers of front-end electronics controllers from a single location {{in the vicinity of}} the central trigger processor. The systems must control the detector synchronization and deliver the necessary fast signals and messages that are phased with the LHC clock, orbit or bunch structure. These include the bunch-crossing clock, level- 1 trigger decisions, bunch and event numbers, as well as test signals and <b>broadcast</b> <b>commands.</b> A common solution to this TTC system requirement is expected to result in important economies of scale and permit a rationalization of the development, operational and support efforts required. LHC Common Project RD 12 is developing a multi-function optoelectronic TTC system which can meet the requirements of central signal broadcasting and local distribution at the different subdetectors of the experiments. A laser transmitter, modulator, encoder, VMEbus interface and machine interface are being developed as well as a subminiature radiation-hard optical fibre connector, active device mount and photodetector/preamplifier.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new architecture for controlling active material actuators inspired by biological motor recruitment. An active material is {{broken down into}} many small fibers and grouped together to form one large actuator. Each of these fibers is held in a binary state, either relaxed or contracted, using a small local controller which responds to a broadcast input signal from a central controller. The output force and displacement of the actuator {{is a function of}} the number of contracted fibers at any point in time. This architecture enables the creation of large-scale, controllable actuators from highly non-linear active materials. The key innovation enabling the central controller to coordinate the behavior of very many small identical units is to randomize the behavior of each unit. This thesis explains how a collection of active material motor units responding in a random, uncorrelated fashion to <b>broadcast</b> <b>commands</b> will exhibit a predictable response that can be stabilized with feedback control and observed using a Kalman filter. Various control strategies will be presented and discussed, including open-loop plant behavior, linear feedback, optimal control, and model-based look-ahead control. Performance metrics such as accuracy and convergence time will be analyzed using dynamic programming and other control techniques. Parallels will also be discussed between this control problem and similar control problems in the field of swarm robotics. (cont.) The stochastic, recruitment-like actuator architecture is demonstrated in shape memory alloy actuators, each composed of 60 individual elements, having a displacement of over 20 mm and a peak force of over 100 N. Control of displacement, isometric force and stiffness are demonstrated using the observer-controller framework. Two actuators are used in an antagonistic fashion to control the stiffness and position of a 1 -DOF arm joint. by Lael Ulam Odhner. Thesis (Sc. D.)
