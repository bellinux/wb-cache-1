5|$|The {{song thrush}} is {{the emblem of}} West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, The Throstles.|$|E
5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
5|$|Albion's main club badge {{dates back}} to the late 1880s, when club {{secretary}} Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge. Since then, the club badge has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, the Throstles. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{chaos of}} the civil war brought the introduction of legal tender notes, backed only by the credit of the government, and by mid-1862, gold and silver coins had vanished from circulation in much of the nation, their place taken by such makeshifts as fractional currency and postage stamps. The three-cent silver remained in circulation longer than the other silver coins, apparently <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> thought it was still made of debased silver, but by the autumn of 1862, it too was hoarded. With little point to issuing coins that would not circulate, mintage of the three-cent silver dropped from 343,000 in 1862 to 21,000 in 1863, a figure that would be exceeded only once (22,000 in 1866) {{during the rest of the}} series. In March 1863, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase wrote in a letter that the three-cent silver had entirely vanished from circulation, and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding.|$|E

Despite {{the loss of}} 5,000 hospital beds, {{there was never a}} shortage of facilities for the injured. Some of the reason for this was that those with postponable care were discharged, but mostly <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private facilities unified de facto during the crisis. There were also people rescued as late as ten days after the initial event.|$|E

As expressed in Daoji and Dag's research, {{one of the reasons why}} environmental concern is lacking among the Chinese is <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> awareness is low and therefore should be targeted.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Austin {{launched}} {{a series of}} civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure {{and many of its}} parks. In addition, the state legislature established the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled in large part <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> Works Administration provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most soap operas, which build a solid {{audience}} {{slowly over}} many years, The Edge of Night {{was an instant}} hit with daytime viewers; it amassed an audience of nine million in its first year, in some respects <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> perceived it as a daytime Perry Mason, as the producers of The Edge of Night had intended. Through the 1960s, the show continued to gain popularity; it consistently ranked {{as one of the}} top six rated soap operas, alongside the rest of CBS' daytime lineup. It peaked at #2 (behind As the World Turns) in the 1966–67 television season and came in at #2 between 1969 and 1971.|$|E

25|$|Tracht {{found a home}} at WAPE in Jacksonville, Florida, in August 1975 {{and became}} the {{dominant}} radio personality not just in northeast Florida, but in the Southeastern United States While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung {{in the window of}} the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.|$|E
500|$|A {{contract}} was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year, which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – {{one of the}} highest paid people in the world.

Freuler, the studio president, explained: [...] "We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> wants Chaplin and will pay for him." ...|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya" [...] {{was used}} as the {{national}} anthem, it never had official lyrics. The anthem struck a positive chord for some people because it did not contain elements from the Soviet past, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> considered Glinka to be a patriot and a true Russian. However, the lack of lyrics doomed [...] "Patrioticheskaya Pesnya". Various attempts were made to compose lyrics for the anthem, including a contest that allowed any Russian citizen to participate. A committee set up by the government looked at over 6000 entries, and 20 were recorded by an orchestra for a final vote.|$|E

500|$|The system, {{which was}} first {{supposed}} {{to start in}} fall 2011, got pushed back to summer 2012 due to uncertainties about where to place the rental stations. The city had originally intended to place Citi Bike stalls mostly on sidewalks and public plazas, {{but there were some}} locations where stalls would take up parking spaces. The 2012 implementation date was only for Phase 1 of Citi Bike, with more phases to come later. Software problems delayed the [...] planned July 2012 start until March 2013. These problems were also reported by Alta programs in Chicago and in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The problems reportedly occurred <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> Bike System Company, a Canadian affiliate of Alta, was involved in a dispute with software supplier 8D Technologies. Then, Hurricane Sandy damaged 1,000 bicycles and 60 stations in storage at Brooklyn Navy Yard. As planning progressed, some residents expressed dismay at the lack of docking stations in their neighborhoods while others fought against stations on their blocks.|$|E
500|$|The {{acquittal}} of Thornton was {{met with}} outrage in Warwickshire, and indeed across the country. Newspapers published letters and comments which were extremely hostile toward Thornton. The leading papers in this campaign were the Lichfield Mercury and the Independent Whig, but even The Times expressed delight when it learned that the case would be further pursued. Funds were obtained from contributors, and a local solicitor prevailed on Mary's brother, William Ashford, {{to bring an appeal}} of murder against Thornton. William Ashford was described as [...] "a plain country young man, about twenty-two years of age, of short stature, sandy hair, and blue eyes". A writ of appeal was issued on 1 October 1817, and Thornton was arrested on a warrant issued pursuant to that writ. As the appeal was to be tried before the King's Bench in London, Thornton was taken to London on 28 October. Supporters of the Ashford family did their best to find evidence to upset his alibi. They had little success. On 6 November, the case first came before the Court, but was quickly adjourned until the 17th when Reader indicated that he had just been instructed, and needed more time to advise his client as to his plea. The initial hearing was little attended, apparently <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> did not realise the notorious Thornton would be there in person.|$|E
500|$|The many polemics which {{surrounded}} Tzara in {{his lifetime}} left traces after his death, and determine contemporary perceptions of his work. The controversy regarding Tzara's role as a founder of Dada extended into several milieus, and continued long after the writer died. Richter, who discusses the lengthy conflict between Huelsenbeck and Tzara {{over the issue of}} Dada foundation, speaks of the movement as being torn apart by [...] "petty jealousies". In Romania, similar debates often involved the supposed founding role of Urmuz, who wrote his avant-garde texts before World War I, and Tzara's status as a communicator between Romania and the rest of Europe. Vinea, who claimed that Dada had been invented by Tzara in Gârceni ca. 1915 and thus sought to legitimize his own modernist vision, also saw Urmuz as the ignored precursor of radical modernism, from Dada to Surrealism. In 1931 the young, modernist literary critic Lucian Boz evidenced that he partly shared Vinea's perspective on the matter, crediting Tzara and Constantin Brâncuși with having, each on his own, invented the avant-garde. Eugène Ionesco argued that [...] "before Dadaism there was Urmuzianism", and, after World War II, sought to popularize Urmuz's work among aficionados of Dada. Rumors in the literary community had it that Tzara successfully sabotaged Ionesco's initiative to publish a French edition of Urmuz's texts, allegedly <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> could then question his claim to have initiated the avant-garde experiment in Romania and the world (the edition saw print in 1965, two years after Tzara's death).|$|E

2500|$|By 1869, Yoshitoshi was {{regarded}} as one of the best woodblock artists in Japan. However, shortly thereafter, he ceased to receive commissions, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> were tired of scenes of violence. By 1871, [...] Yoshitoshi became severely depressed, and his personal life became one of great turmoil, which was to continue sporadically until his death. He lived in appalling conditions with his devoted mistress, Okoto, who sold off her clothes and possessions to support him. At one point they were reduced to burning the floor-boards from the house for warmth. It is said that in 1872 he suffered a complete mental breakdown after being shocked by the lack of popularity of his recent designs.|$|E

Chauncey and Lillian had three daughters, Rosebud, Chauncina and Evelyn. Chauncey chose {{to send his}} daughters to the Rapid City public schools instead of the Indian School <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> schools had academic orientation, while the Indian School focused on vocational courses in agriculture, blacksmithing and domestic arts. On occasion, elderly Indians would visit {{the grounds of the}} Indian School and tell stories in the Lakota language.
