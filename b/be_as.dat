40|$|It is hard {{to avoid}} the {{assessment}} that the most visible product to date {{of the war on}} terrorism has been nothing much more, or less, than more war and more terror. The unhappy reality since September 11 seems to be that all our major cities, and concentrations of Westerners anywhere, <b>are</b> <b>as</b> vulnerable as ever; the capacity of terrorist actors to do harm <b>is</b> <b>as</b> great as ever; their motivations <b>are</b> <b>as</b> great as ever; their identity <b>is</b> <b>as</b> elusive as ever; international cooperation <b>is</b> <b>as</b> fragile as ever; and international policy priorities <b>are</b> <b>as</b> misplaced as ever...|$|R

5|$|After the attack, {{the base}} was secured and 150 mostly Afghan workers were {{detained}} and held incommunicado for three days. The attack {{was a major}} setback for the intelligence agency's operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was the second largest single-day loss in the CIA's history, after the 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, which killed eight CIA officers. The incident suggested that al-Qaeda might not <b>be</b> <b>as</b> weakened as previously thought.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes {{at the expense}} of the Democratic Party, liberal and conservative politics, to try to <b>be</b> <b>as</b> neutral as possible.

5|$|Cure {{rates in}} {{clinical}} trials have ranged from 20–45%; although clinical trials often include only younger people and those able to tolerate aggressive therapies.

5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
