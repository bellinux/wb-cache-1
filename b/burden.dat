40|$|Administrative <b>burdens</b> {{stemming}} from regulations are a worldwide cause {{of concern for}} policy-makers. Reducing administrative <b>burdens</b> has become an important policy objective in economic growth strategies for many governments. The European Commission set out a policy goal of reducing administrative <b>burdens</b> by 25 % by 2012, although the literature provides limited evidence of its impact. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of administrative <b>burdens</b> on growth by using 6 business regulation variables for a panel of 182 countries. The results from the fixed effect regression analysis suggest that reducing administrative <b>burdens</b> in certain policy areas spurs economic growth. In particular, reducing <b>burdens</b> concerning start-ups and paying taxes enhances growth significantly. Furthermore, using a panel of 26 European countries, our results suggest that reducing the administrative <b>burdens</b> by 25 % has {{a positive effect on}} growth of 1. 62 % in the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for vertical tax competition is strongest when {{different levels of}} government share the same base. Because there is greater sharing of common tax bases in Canada than in the United States, we expect vertical tax competition to be weaker in the United States than in Canada. Econometric analysis of US data supports this hypothesis. Taking account of the deductibility-related endogeneity of federal tax <b>burdens</b> by state, federal income tax <b>burdens</b> {{have no effect on}} average state income tax <b>burdens.</b> Introducing distributional considerations into the vertical tax competition model, we do find a significant displacement effect for higher income taxpayers, with higher federal <b>burdens</b> associated with lower state income tax <b>burdens</b> in the highest income quintile. For low-income taxpayers, federal and state tax <b>burdens</b> are complementary. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

5|$|The term double <b>burden</b> {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double <b>burden.</b> Some alternative terms for double <b>burden</b> include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the types of}} family <b>burdens,</b> mental health and Chinese health beliefs of Chinese caregivers with relatives suffering from a serious mental illness. It also examined the impacts of these beliefs on caregivers' <b>burdens</b> and mental health. A structured questionnaire was administered to 125 Chinese caregivers in out-patient clinics in Hong Kong. Measures included distress (General Health Questionnaire), family <b>burdens</b> and belief in traditional Chinese medicine. Family <b>burdens</b> exerted {{a significant impact on}} the mental health of caregivers. Significant differences were found between believers and non-believers of traditional Chinese medical beliefs in terms of financial <b>burdens,</b> disruptions to family interactions and decline in physical health. However, a moderating effect of Chinese health beliefs on family <b>burdens</b> and mental health was found. The lack of a moderating effect of health belief on family <b>burdens</b> may be related to caregivers' changes in perspectives from a traditional Chinese cultural perspective to a psychosocial and personality perspective.

Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body <b>burden</b> of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body <b>burden</b> is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the <b>burden</b> of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to assess the effect of {{regulatory}} <b>burdens</b> in the European dairy industry on its competitiveness. A theoretical foundation is provided by transaction cost economics and total quality management insights. The effects of legislation on administrative requirements and competitiveness are supposed to be mediated by impacts on innovativeness, company strategy, food safety system availability, as well as the available information & communication capabilities. We will connect to previous research (Wijnands et al., 2007) and the findings therein. Four sub-questions are addressed: • what is the relationship between administrative <b>burdens,</b> innovation and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between administrative <b>burdens,</b> food safety & quality system deployment and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between administrative <b>burdens,</b> food labelling requirements and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between administrative <b>burdens,</b> supply chain transparency and competitiveness? In addition to the theoretical framework presented earlier in Bremmers et al., 2008, this paper contains the first results of a survey in the European dairy industry. They are combined with the proceeds from a literature search. The results show that (Q 1) especially product innovation is negatively impacted by administrative <b>burdens.</b> Food safety and quality systems (Q 2) serve to provide a level playing field in Europe. They would be installed also if no legal requirements would enforce them, because clients ask for it, so that administrative <b>burdens</b> could easily be attributed to business strategy rather than legal obligations. To reduce administrative <b>burdens,</b> we advice to integrate food safety and quality requirements is necessary. It would reduce monitoring and reporting costs, both for private as well as public parties. Food labeling (Q 3) (a ‘made in Europe’ origin marking) could work contraproductive with respect to the competitive position of dairy firms and will have an increase of administrative <b>burdens</b> as a net-effect. And last but not least (Q 4), increased chain transparency (mentioning the name of intermediary producers on the end-product package) will accelerate administrative <b>burdens,</b> but will only be beneficial for SMEs with a differentiated product. Commodity-producers in the dairy industry which only follow a cost strategy will gradually merge and/or disappear. dairy industry, competitiveness, administrative <b>burdens,</b> food safety, labelling, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
