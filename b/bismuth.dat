5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of <b>bismuth.</b> They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably <b>bismuth</b> subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type. <b>Bismuth</b> has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of <b>bismuth</b> alloys (presently {{about a third of}} <b>bismuth</b> production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> in uses {{where it}} is {{dispersed}} most widely include stomach medicines (<b>bismuth</b> subsalicylate), paints (<b>bismuth</b> vanadate) on a dry surface, pearlescent cosmetics (<b>bismuth</b> oxychloride), and bismuth-containing bullets. <b>Bismuth</b> spread in the environment in these products is unrecoverable with present technology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> subnitrate (Bi5O(OH)9(NO3)4) and <b>bismuth</b> subcarbonate (Bi2O2(CO3)) {{are also}} used in medicine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> sulfide, , occurs {{naturally}} in <b>bismuth</b> ores. It is also {{produced by the}} combination of molten <b>bismuth</b> and sulfur.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% <b>bismuth)</b> through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process. <b>Bismuth</b> will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw <b>bismuth</b> metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while <b>bismuth</b> remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity <b>bismuth</b> metal (over 99% Bi). World <b>bismuth</b> production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E
5|$|In the Earth's crust, <b>bismuth</b> {{is about}} twice as {{abundant}} as gold. The most important ores of <b>bismuth</b> are bismuthinite and bismite. Native <b>bismuth</b> is known from Australia, Bolivia, and China.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> has few {{commercial}} applications, {{and those}} applications that use it generally require small quantities {{relative to other}} raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of <b>bismuth</b> were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing; 7% into <b>bismuth</b> alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBi and atomic number 83. <b>Bismuth,</b> a pentavalent post-transition metal {{and one of}} the pnictogens, chemically resembles its lighter homologs arsenic and antimony. Elemental <b>bismuth</b> may occur naturally, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface oxidation can give it a pink tinge. <b>Bismuth</b> is the most naturally diamagnetic element, and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> is {{also used}} in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it {{indicated}} a poisoning effect on modification of strontium (Sr). Some <b>bismuth</b> alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of <b>bismuth</b> to caesium enhances the quantum yield of caesium cathodes. Sintering of <b>bismuth</b> and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> is {{included}} in BSCCO (<b>bismuth</b> strontium calcium copper oxide) which {{is a group of}} similar superconducting compounds discovered in 1988 that exhibit the highest superconducting transition temperatures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> is used {{in metal}} alloys with other metals such as iron, to create alloys to go into {{automatic}} sprinkler systems for fires. It was also used to make <b>bismuth</b> bronze which {{was used in the}} Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} <b>bismuth</b> compensate each other and therefore lead and <b>bismuth</b> are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of <b>bismuth</b> and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. <b>Bismuth</b> is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{oxychloride}} (BiOCl, {{see figure}} at right) and <b>bismuth</b> oxynitrate (BiONO3) stoichiometrically appear as simple anionic salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO+) which commonly occurs in aqueous <b>bismuth</b> compounds. However, {{in the case}} of BiOCl, the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four <b>bismuth</b> atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} and has {{according to some}} reports been common in relatively recent times. As with lead, <b>bismuth</b> poisoning can result {{in the formation of}} a black deposit on the gingiva, known as a <b>bismuth</b> line. Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for benefit is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Demand for <b>bismuth</b> {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – <b>bismuth</b> compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of <b>bismuth</b> metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II <b>bismuth</b> was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Kussmaul {{suggests}} using <b>bismuth</b> compounds, an antibacterial agent, {{to treat}} peptic ulcers (<b>bismuth</b> subsalicylate {{has since been}} used in many commercial drugs, including Pepto Bismol as part of antibacterial H. pylori treatment). The antibacterial properties of <b>bismuth</b> were not known until much later.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little <b>bismuth,</b> the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair <b>bismuth</b> content, perhaps as <b>bismuth</b> phosphomolybdate, and then <b>bismuth</b> used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E
5|$|Ramsey {{publishes a}} study demonstrating that <b>bismuth</b> can help {{eradicate}} PUD. <b>Bismuth</b> is an antibacterial agent, {{although this is}} not recognized by Ramsey.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} sustainability fact about <b>bismuth</b> is its byproduct status, which can either improve sustainability (i.e., vanadium or manganese nodules) or, for <b>bismuth</b> from lead ore, constrain it; <b>bismuth</b> is constrained. The {{extent to which}} the constraint on <b>bismuth</b> can be relieved is going to be tested by the future of the lead storage battery, since 90% of the world market for lead is currently in storage batteries for gasoline or diesel-powered motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Whereas <b>bismuth</b> is most {{available}} {{today as a}} byproduct, its sustainability is more dependent on recycling. <b>Bismuth</b> is mostly a byproduct of the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling <b>bismuth</b> is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a <b>bismuth</b> colloid, such as <b>bismuth</b> subsalicylate. For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, the use of levofloxacin {{as part of the}} therapy has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> dissolves in {{concentrated}} {{sulfuric acid}} to make bismuth(III) sulfate and sulfur dioxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of <b>bismuth</b> crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, <b>bismuth</b> burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> is an {{ingredient}} in some pharmaceuticals, although {{the use of}} some of these substances is declining.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> subnitrate is a {{component}} of glazes that produces an iridescence and {{is used as a}} pigment in paint.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{vanadate}} is an opaque yellow pigment in artists' oil and acrylic paint. This compound is a non-toxic lightfast {{substitute for}} lemon yellow pigments {{such as the}} cadmium sulfides and the lead/strontium/barium chromates. Unlike lead chromate+lead sulfate lemon, <b>bismuth</b> vanadate does not readily blacken with UV exposure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bismuth</b> {{was long}} {{considered}} the element {{with the highest}} atomic mass that is stable. However, in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, decays via alpha decay with a half-life {{more than a billion}} times the estimated age of the universe. Because of its tremendously long half-life, <b>bismuth</b> may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>bismuth</b> is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. <b>Bismuth</b> expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, <b>bismuth,</b> zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is {{treated in a}} reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and <b>bismuth.</b> Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver and gold, both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of <b>bismuth</b> by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting <b>bismuth</b> dross can be skimmed off.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{researchers}} began to evaluate <b>bismuth</b> as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications.|$|E
5|$|No other metal is {{verified}} {{to be more}} naturally diamagnetic than <b>bismuth.</b> (Superdiamagnetism is {{a different}} physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it {{has one of the}} lowest values of thermal conductivity (after manganese, and maybe neptunium and plutonium) and the highest Hall coefficient. It has a high electrical resistivity. When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, <b>bismuth</b> is a semiconductor, despite being a post-transition metal.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has 33 known isotopes, all {{of which}} are radioactive. They have atomic masses that range from 188 to 220 u. 210Po (half-life 138.376days) is the most widely {{available}} and is made via neutron capture by natural <b>bismuth.</b> The longer-lived 209Po (half-life , longest-lived of all polonium isotopes) and 208Po (half-life 2.9years) can be made through the alpha, proton, or deuteron bombardment of lead or <b>bismuth</b> in a cyclotron.|$|E
5|$|See also bismuthia, a rare {{dermatological}} condition {{that results from}} the prolonged use of <b>bismuth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The average {{purity of}} the silver items is 96%. The {{remainder}} of the metal {{is made up of}} copper and a small amount of zinc, with trace amounts of lead, gold, and <b>bismuth</b> present. The zinc is likely to have been present in a copper brass used to alloy the silver when the objects were made, and the lead, gold, and <b>bismuth</b> probably were present in the unrefined silver ore.|$|E
5|$|The fungus Marasmius oreades can be {{used for}} the {{biological}} remediation of <b>bismuth</b> in polluted soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{price for}} pure <b>bismuth</b> metal has been {{relatively}} stable {{through most of the}} 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. <b>Bismuth</b> has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E
