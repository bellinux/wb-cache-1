25|$|In France, {{during the}} long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or {{skittles}} {{at one end of}} the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed to the table, and holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as <b>bagatelle.</b>|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Caroline Foulkes {{wrote in}} The Birmingham Post: [...] "The {{thing about this}} biography is the depths to which Taraborrelli has dug to get information on a famously controlling woman. He relates revealing anecdotes {{as if they were}} mere <b>bagatelle,</b> making News of the World style revelations look like kid's stuff. If Taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments 'thanks to the maid who let me into Madonna's bedroom to raid her underwear drawer', it wouldn't be any great surprise." [...] She also felt that [...] "despite the sensationalism, Taraborrelli's writing style lets him down. Too often it descends into the kind of mush you expect from an airport novel, with the singer coming across more like a character from Shirley Conran's Lace than a real woman." [...] Peter Sobczynski reviewed the book for the Post-Tribune and felt that [...] "the problem with writing an unauthorized tell-all biography is that, in this information-rich world that we live in, by the time a book gets written on somebody, most of the juicy stories are already common knowledge. To make up for that, the tell-all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of the subject at hand, or, frankly, newer and better dirt. Unfortunately, celebrity biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction, Madonna: An Intimate Biography." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1981 Alice {{had won the}} San Remo song {{contest with}} another Battiato composition, [...] "Per Elisa", which in turn both musically and lyrically was a {{paraphrase}} of Ludwig van Beethoven's <b>bagatelle</b> in A minor [...] WoO 59, popularly known as [...] "Für Elise".|$|E

Pieces like the [...] "2nd Mephisto-Waltz" [...] are unconventional because of their numerous repetitions of short motives. Also showing experimental characteristics are the Via crucis of 1878, as well as Unstern!, Nuages gris, and the two works entitled La lugubre gondola of the 1880s.|$|E

2500|$|Somewhere {{between the}} 1750s and 1770s, the <b>bagatelle</b> variant [...] 'Japanese billiards' was invented (in Western Europe, despite the name), which used thin metal pins and {{replaced}} the cue at the player's {{end of the}} table with a coiled spring and a plunger. The player shot balls up the inclined playfield toward the scoring targets using this plunger, a device that remains in use in pinball to this day, and the game was also directly ancestral to pachinko.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} summer and autumn of 1906 Alberto Santos Dumont made the first {{successful}} powered heavier-than-air flights in Europe in his 14bis, culminating in a flight of 220m (722ft) {{on the grounds of}} the Parisian Chateau de <b>Bagatelle</b> on 12 November, winning an Aéro-Club de France prize for a flight of over 100m. [...] Initially relying on pronounced dihedral to provide stability, by the November flight, octagonal-planform interplane ailerons somewhat like Esnault-Pelterie's design had been fitted to the aircraft.|$|E

The balls became marbles and the wickets became small metal pins. Redgrave's popularization of the spring launcher and innovations in game design are acknowledged as the birth of pinball in its modern form.|$|E

The quartet were given permission to make this transcription by the composer's widow and publisher Schott Music.

2500|$|Ten {{years later}} he {{purchased}} the position of chief architect to Monsieur, the comte d'Artois, brother of Louis XVI. For him Bélanger designed and constructed the party pavilion Château de <b>Bagatelle</b> in the Bois de Boulogne, 1777, winning his patron's bet with the Queen by completing the house in sixty-three days (and nights) and introducing décors in the style Étrusque. Bélanger constructed the Folie Saint James, a French landscape garden, in Neuilly from 1777 to 1780, and worked for the comte d'Artois at the Château of Maisons-Lafitte. [...] During the Revolution he {{spent some time in}} the prison of Saint-Lazare.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{documents}} are again lacking, Hubert Robert's name is invariably invoked {{in connection with}} Marie Antoinette's 'premier architecte' Richard Mique through several phases {{of the creation of}} an informal landscape garden at the Petit Trianon, and the setting of the petit hameau. Robert's contribution to garden design was not in making practical ground plans for improvements but in providing atmospheric inspiration for the proposed effect. At Ermenonville and at Méréville [...] "Hubert Robert's paintings both recorded and inspired", according to W.H. Adams: Robert's four large ruin fantasies, painted in 1787 for Méréville may be searched in vain for direct connections with the garden. Hubert's paintings of the Moulin Joly of his friend Claude-Henri Watelet render the fully-grown atmosphere of a garden that had been under way since 1754. His set of six Italianate landscape panels painted for <b>Bagatelle</b> were not the inspiration for the formal turfed parterre set in the thinned woodlands, designed by Bélanger; the later picturesque extensions of <b>Bagatelle</b> were carried out by its Scottish gardener, William Blaikie. Robert's commissioned painting of the long-delayed rejuvenation of the park at Versailles, begun in 1774 with the cutting down of the trees for sale as firewood, is a record of the event, resonant with allegorical meaning. Robert was more certainly responsible for the conception of the grotto and cascades of the 'Baths of Apollo,' tucked within a grove of the chateau's park and built to house François Girardon's celebrated sculpture group Apollo Attended by Nymphs.|$|E

2500|$|The early 1970s saw a slow {{shift from}} static, {{abstract}} pieces to pieces with more clearly defined rhythmic and harmonic structures, although {{the methods and}} forms Skempton used remained unorthodox. For instance, in the series of Quavers piano pieces (1973–75) the music consists solely of repeated chords with no pauses between them. In addition to [...] "landscapes" [...] two other categories appeared, dubbed [...] "melodies" [...] and [...] "chorales" [...] by the composer. The [...] "melodies" [...] are single melodic lines either with simple accompaniment (Saltaire Melody, for piano (1977)) or suspended in space (later works such as Trace for piano (1980) and <b>Bagatelle</b> for flute (1985)). [...] "Chorales" [...] are works where material is presented primarily (or solely) using chords. An example is Postlude (1978), for piano, in contradistinction to Eirenicon 3 (1978), also for piano, which is a [...] "landscape". The earlier [...] "melodies" [...] were apparently composed at the instrument, intuitively, whereas the later ones evolve {{from a series of}} written pitches.|$|E
2500|$|For {{two years}} Emma {{organised}} a winter reading {{room in the}} local school for local labourers, who subscribed a penny a week to smoke and play games, with [...] "Respectable newspapers & a few books... & a respectable housekeeper..there every evening to maintain decorum." [...] This was a common facility to save men from [...] "resorting to the public house". In 1873 the Revd. Ffinden opposed it, as [...] "Coffee drinking, <b>bagatelle</b> & other games" [...] had been allowed and [...] "the effects of tobacco smoke & spitting" [...] were seen when the children returned in the morning. Emma got Darwin to get {{the approval of the}} education inspectorate in London, and just before Christmas 1873 the Darwins and their neighbours the Lubbocks got the agreement of the school committee, offering to pay for any repairs needed [...] "to afford every possible opportunity to the working class for self improvement & amusement". A furious Ffinden huffed that it was [...] "quite out of order" [...] for the Darwins to have gone to the inspectorate behind his back. Darwin's health suffered as he argued over natural selection with St. George Jackson Mivart, and in the autumn of 1874 Darwin expressed his exasperation at Ffinden when putting in his resignation from the school committee due to ill health.|$|E
