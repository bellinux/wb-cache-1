25|$|Diana was {{the patron}} of HALO Trust, an {{organisation}} that removes debris {{left behind by}} war, in particular landmines. In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a <b>ballistic</b> <b>helmet</b> and flak jacket were seen worldwide. During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a 'loose cannon'. Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them. In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and travelled to Washington, D.C. to help promote the American Red Cross landmines campaign. From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{measurement}} techniques to evaluate ballistic impact protection {{in terms of}} head contact loads from non penetrating impacts on helmets. An aluminium head form instrumented with piezo-electric transducers, film sensors and accelerometers {{was used to measure}} impact forces applied by the back face deformation of <b>helmets</b> after <b>ballistic</b> impacts. The head form and an instrumented accelerated weight machine are also used to measure impact forces applied to the helmet and forces transmitted behind the helmet. Radius of curvature of back face deformation data were also collected from <b>ballistic</b> impacts on <b>helmets</b> mounted on conditioned plastilina® and was shown to correlate with published studies from Wilber [4] and Byers [5] which established a correlation between the force required to fracture a human skull and radius of curvature of the striker. It is shown that backface deformation of potentially damaging levels can be generated behind typical <b>ballistic</b> <b>helmets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{weaponry}} {{technology has}} advanced, the ballistic threat to humans has increased significantly. As {{well as the}} military, civilians who are exposed to these threats {{as part of their}} everyday work require adequate protective equipment. This increasing demand for body armour and <b>ballistic</b> <b>helmets</b> is driving the protective equipment industry to create lightweight, reliable protection adapted for specific applications and marketable {{to a wide range of}} consumers. This chapter focuses on a few theoretical aspects of head impact mechanics and related head injury criteria, considering design, manufacturing and testing procedures, with particular emphasis on the modern materials and tools used in the search for lightweight, cost-efficient and effective equipment...|$|R
