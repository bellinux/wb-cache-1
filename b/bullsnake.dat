50|$|The {{idea that}} <b>bullsnakes</b> {{occasionally}} eat rattlesnakes is sometimes given {{as a reason}} for humans not to harm <b>bullsnakes</b> when encountering them in the wild, although a better reason is the <b>bullsnake's</b> role in controlling warm-blooded vermin such as rodents.|$|R
5000|$|Though some <b>bullsnakes</b> can be docile, {{and with}} some time become {{accustomed}} to handling, most <b>bullsnakes</b> are quite defensive and known for their perceived [...] "bad attitude".|$|R
50|$|<b>Bullsnakes</b> {{are very}} {{powerful}} constrictors who eat small mammals, such as mice, voles, rats, pocket gophers, ground squirrels, and rabbits, {{as well as}} ground nesting birds, birds' eggs and lizards. They are also great climbers and can climb into trees and other structures to raid the nests (and birdhouses) of birds to eat the nestlings or sitting mother. One snake can eat five small birds within 15 minutes. Juvenile <b>bullsnakes</b> depend on small lizards, frogs, and baby mice. <b>Bullsnakes</b> kill their prey by constriction.|$|R

50|$|Various {{reptiles}} {{live in the}} park, such as the short-horned lizard, plateau lizard, many-lined skink, <b>bullsnake,</b> and garter snake.|$|E
50|$|When <b>bullsnakes</b> detect live objects {{too big to}} be prey {{they seem}} to {{perceive}} the object as a predator and take defensive action. Their first action is to remain quiet, not moving. Then when they feel {{they are able to}} move away from the object their next line of defensive is to move away as quickly as possible. <b>Bullsnakes,</b> however, are not fast movers and often have to take other defensive actions. When threatened by anything as large as a human, a <b>bullsnake's</b> next defensive action is to rear up and make itself look as large as possible while at the same time hissing at the perceived threat. It typically then begins lunging and retreating at the same time to escape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bullsnakes</b> can {{be found}} {{throughout}} central United States, central and northern Mexico, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and desert regions of British Columbia, Canada.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bullsnakes</b> {{breed in}} March or April ({{depending}} upon their location) and usually {{lay their eggs}} in April, May or June (again, depending upon when the snakes breed.) They lay on average a dozen eggs in sand or other protected areas and leave the eggs to incubate unprotected. Clutches of five to 22 eggs have been observed. The eggs are elliptical, leathery, rough, sticky, and up to 70 mm long. The eggs typically hatch in August or September. Baby <b>bullsnakes</b> are 20 - 46 cm at hatching. Their color is grayish until after their first shed.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bullsnake</b> (Pituophis catenifer sayi [...] ) {{is a large}} nonvenomous {{colubrid}} snake. It {{is currently}} considered a subspecies of the gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer).|$|E
5000|$|It has {{yellow flowers}} on many stems, arising {{from a single}} root crown.It was named after Charles Wright. The Zuni people apply a {{poultice}} of the chewed root to swellings that they believe are caused by being witched by a <b>bullsnake.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Wyoming, the <b>Bullsnake</b> {{is found}} in plains grasslands, {{sagebrush}} grasslands, sandhills, riparian shrub, marshes, rocky canyons, mountain foothills shrub, agricultural areas, and urban areas. The sub-species Pituophis catenifer deserticola, the Great Basin Gophersnake {{is found in}} sagebrush communities and desert habitats.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to rattlesnakes, which usually keep their tails elevated {{to sound the}} most efficient rattle, <b>bullsnakes</b> tend to keep their tails {{in contact with the}} ground, where they can be vibrated against something.|$|R
5|$|The few {{amphibians}} {{present in}} the forest include the Rocky Mountain tailed frog, long-toed salamander, and Columbia spotted frog, which has been listed as a sensitive species. Common snakes include <b>bullsnakes,</b> garter snakes, and rubber boas.|$|R
50|$|Predators of white-throated woodrat include weasels (Mustela spp.), bobcats (Lynx rufus), ring-tailed cats (Bassariscus astutus), coyotes (Canis latrans), American badgers (Taxidea taxus), Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), <b>bullsnakes</b> (Pituophis catenifer sayi), and rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.).|$|R
50|$|The Gophersnake or <b>Bullsnake</b> (Pituophis catenifer sayi) {{is a large}} non-venomous {{colubrid}} snake, {{widespread in}} {{the central part of}} the United States, northern Mexico, and southern Canada. It is a subspecies of the Gopher Snake (Pituophis catenifer). The epithet sayi is in honor of zoologist Thomas Say.|$|E
5000|$|Bullsnakes are {{sometimes}} mistaken for rattlesnakes and killed. Owing to its coloration, dorsal pattern, and semikeeled scalation, the <b>bullsnake</b> superficially resembles the western diamondback rattler (Crotalus atrox), {{which is also}} common within the same range. The <b>bullsnake</b> capitalizes on this similarity by performing an impressive rattlesnake impression when threatened. First, it hisses, or forcibly exhales through a glottis or extension of the windpipe. The end of the glottis is covered by a piece of cartilage known as the epiglottis which flaps back and forth when air is exhaled from the right lung, producing a convincing rattling sound. It also adopts a rattlesnake-like [...] "S-curve" [...] body posture as though about to strike. It commonly vibrates its tail rapidly in brush or leaves, and flattens its head to resemble the characteristic triangular shape of the rattlesnake. These defensive behaviors are meant to scare away threats, however, and not to sound an attack.|$|E
50|$|Professor Beardsley's Research Station- While {{not always}} {{open to the}} public, the exhibit is used mainly as an {{education}} center and is home to several of the zoo's education animals, such as yellow-naped amazon, European legless lizard, and <b>bullsnake.</b> The building is also where the zoo raises brook trout to be released into the wild. In June 2015, the zoo added three Eastern hellbenders to the exhibit.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{reptiles}} in the forest. Snakes species include <b>bullsnakes</b> {{and rubber}} boas, {{as well as}} western rattlesnakes, which {{are most likely to}} be found at lower elevations and in the Minidoka District. Amphibians including the Columbia spotted frog, long-toed salamander, and the Rocky Mountain tailed frog are relatively common.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the species}} that reside in the park, {{temporarily}} or year-round, include turtles, toads, lizards, <b>bullsnakes,</b> dragonflies, beavers, muskrats, cottontail rabbits, pocket gophers, rock squirrel, coyotes, and numerous birds including Cooper's hawks, great horned owls, American coots, Canada geese, ring-necked pheasants, mallards, wood ducks, black-capped chickadees, great blue herons, northern flickers and woodpeckers.|$|R
5000|$|Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana), {{northern}} pygmy owls (Glaucidium gnoma), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), and jays such as scrub jays (Aphelocoma species), pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) and Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) {{are typical}} avian predators of western tanager nests. Other reported nest predators include black bears (Ursus americanus), prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis), and <b>bullsnakes</b> (Pituophis catenifer) ...|$|R
50|$|Nine snake {{species are}} found in this arid environment, the plains hog-nosed snake, western coachwhip, <b>bullsnake,</b> longnose snake, plains {{blackhead}} snake, blackneck garter snake, plains garter snake, lined snake, and prairie rattlesnake. The broad-headed skink, prairie racerunner, red-lipped plateau lizard, northern earless lizard, eastern collared lizard, and Texas horned lizard are also indigenous to the area. Two types of turtle, the ornate box turtle and the yellow mud turtle {{have been found in}} the Black Mesa preserve. Only one frog is found in this desert habitat, the American bullfrog, but there are six other species of amphibians; the Great Plains narrowmouth toad, New Mexico spadefoot, plains spadefoot, Woodhouse's toad, red-spotted toad, and the western green toad, all toads.|$|E
50|$|With its {{combination}} of grassland, riparian habitat, coulees and badlands, the Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve host {{a variety of}} amphibians and reptiles, including rare northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), listed as threatened in Alberta and both a Canadian species at risk (SARA) and Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) species of special concern, as well as prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), <b>bullsnake</b> (Pituophis catenifer sayi), western hognose snake (Heterodon nasicus), western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), garter snake (Thamnophis radix), and the nationally and provincially endangered short-horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglassi), {{which is at the}} northern limit of its geographical range here.

50|$|Adult bullsnakes {{average about}} 4 to 6 ft in total length, and {{specimens}} {{of up to}} 8 ft have been recorded. Adult specimens can have an average weight {{in the range of}} 1 - 1.5 kg, though the heavier known specimens can attain 3.6 - 4.5 kg, larger specimens being quite bulky for a colubrid snake. This makes the <b>bullsnake</b> among the largest snakes native to Canada and the United States, although it is generally not as long as indigo snakes nor as heavy or as large in diameter as rattlesnakes. They are usually yellow, with brown, white, black or sometimes reddish blotching. The blotching pattern is as follows: large blotches on top, three sets of spots on the sides, and bands of black on the tail. Many color variations have been found, including albinos and white varieties. A scale count is required to distinguish juvenile bullsnakes from other juvenile gopher snakes.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats and <b>bullsnakes</b> hunt smaller animals, such as deer {{mice and}} white-tailed {{antelope}} squirrels in the park's riparian zones. Western pipistrelle bats feast on insects, and pallid bats eat beetles, centipedes, cicadas, praying mantises, scorpions, and other arthropods. On the Painted Desert rim, small animals find {{food and shelter}} among the denser foliage, and mule deer sometimes frequent the area.|$|R
40|$|Controlling snake {{problems}} around residences {{is covered}} here. Occasionally people encounter snakes around {{their homes or}} in other places, and wonder {{what to do about}} the snakes or whether they are dangerous. In nearly all cases, these are harmless types such as garter snakes or <b>bullsnakes.</b> However, Nebraska does have four kinds of poisonous snakes: the prairie rattlesnake, timber rattlesnake, small rattlesnake, copperhead...|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} the creek is also known for its snake population, which {{includes}} garter snakes, western hognose snakes, <b>bullsnakes</b> and occasionally rattlesnakes. Amphibians native to Colorado {{can be found at}} the creek as well. These include, the plains leopard frog, woodhouse's frog, and the striped chorus frog. The bullfrog, a non-native species, is also located in the Cherry Creek. In recent years, bullfrogs have contributed to the decimation of native amphibian species populations at the creek.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bullsnake</b> (Pituophis melanoleucus) {{predation}} on upland nesting ducks was monitored on Valentine National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) from 1982 - 86. The fate of 1, 999 duck nests of 9 {{species was}} observed under different treatments {{of land use}} and control of potential nest predators. Maximum potential levels of <b>bullsnake</b> depredation are masked by nest destruction by mammalian species; <b>bullsnake</b> nest depredation rates were 3 ̆e 65...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{regarding}} the thermal ecology of snakes {{are important to}} understanding their life histories. Yet, {{little is known about}} the thermal ecology of the North American genus Pituophis, which includes the <b>bullsnake</b> (Pituophis catenifer sayi). In an attempt to determine which independent variables significantly affected the thermal ecology of free-ranging bullsnakes, we tracked 12 – 19 radio-tagged individuals weekly from 2003 to 2005 in Wisconsin (USA) with temperature-sensitive transmitters. Although snake body temperature was found to vary based on several variables treated independently, two separate three-way interactions among variables were significant. We believe our results support the notion that P. c. sayi thermoconforms to environmental conditions in the upper Midwest, but more research on the topic is necessary...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} severe enteric {{infection}} of Sarcocystis sp. from a wild-caught <b>bullsnake</b> (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi). The animal was collected in October 1988 by a commercial dealer, imported into the United Kingdom during November 1988 and {{purchased by the}} London Zoo, in December 1988. The animal was not fed after capture and was anorexic {{from the time of}} purchase to the time of death in January 1989. On necropsy, the animal was emaciated and the mucosa of the proximal intestine was markedly thickened. The lamina propria was packed with oocysts, and enterocytes were parasitized by an organism which closely resembled Sarcocystis roudabushi and Sarcocystis idahoensis, two bisporocystid coccidia described previously from Pituophis melanoleucus. We propose that Sarcocystis idahoensis and Sarcocystis roudabushi are synonymous since both occur in the same host species, both invade the intestinal lamina propria and entreocytes, and sporocyst measurement ranges of both species overlap. This is the first report of death believed to be due to sarcocytosis in a naturally-infected definitive host...|$|E
5000|$|Reptiles include <b>bullsnakes,</b> common {{collared}} lizard, common snapping turtle, musk turtles, yellow mud turtle, painted turtle, western diamondback rattlesnake and {{the prairie}} rattlesnake. Some {{of the typical}} amphibians found {{in the region are}} the three-toed amphiuma, green toad, Oklahoma salamander, lesser siren and the plains spadefoot toad. In the Rocky Mountains and other mountainous areas of the inland is where the bald eagle is most observed, even though its habitat includes all of the Lower 48, as well as Alaska.|$|R

50|$|Many animals prey on eastern towhees {{and their}} eggs, {{including}} reptiles, mammals, and birds. A literature review summarizes several reports demonstrating that predators {{are a major}} cause of nest failure. The highest nest predation rate noted was 88% in a New York study. Mammals that are likely nest predators include northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), domestic cats (Felis catus), and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). Snakes such as <b>bullsnakes</b> (Pituophis catenifer), rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) and garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.) have been reported eating eastern towhee eggs. Weasels (Mustela spp.) and blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) are also likely nest predators. Several birds are known to prey on both young and adult eastern towhees, including northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Broad-winged (Buteo platypterus), short-tailed (Buteo brachyurus), sharp-shinned (Accipiter striatus) and Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii). Other predators include barred (Strix varia), short-eared (Asio flammeus) and eastern screech-owls (Megascops asio) and even the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), which is scarcely larger than a towhee. At least some mammals also feed on adult eastern towhees. In Maryland, an eastern towhee was found in the stomach contents of a red fox (Vulpes vulpes).|$|R
