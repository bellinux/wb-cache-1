To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E

The castle was <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E
