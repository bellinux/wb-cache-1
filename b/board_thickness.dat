Therefore, the condition of blowout occurrence and the properties of boards needed to be investigated according to several moisture contents.

This research {{was designed to}} investigate their mechanical properties and evaluate the various manufacturing conditions: pressing temperature and time, pressing pressure, board density, <b>board</b> <b>thickness,</b> grain size of raw materials, and addition of furfural. The mechanical properties (i.e., modulus of rupture and elasticity, internal bonding strength) of boards increased with increasing board density and met the requirement for 15 type medium-density fiberboard (MDF) by JIS A 5905 - 1994. Thickness swelling and water absorption of boards exceeded the maximum permitted levels for 15 type MDF and S 20 grade hardboard by JIS A 5905 - 1994, which indicates the low water-resistant property of binderless boards. In contrast to that in usual wood-based materials, internal bonding strength showed significant correlations with other board properties: modulus of rupture and elasticity, thickness swelling, and water absorption.

The reliability and potential failure mechanism of the flip chip technology on organic boards, such as FR 4, invoking the solder bump technology is widely studies, whereas the failure mechanism and therefore the criteria to optimize a SBB flip chip interconnection on MID is still largely unknown. In that work, an overview of potential failure mechanisms of SBB flip chip interconnections are presented and checked for relevance. This follows a detailed FE based stress analysis of the underfill fillet and the identification of critical locations. Two failure criteria based on physics-of-failure approach are chosen to describe the impact of design parameters and material properties of the flip chip interconnection.
