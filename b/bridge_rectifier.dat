25|$|Rectifiers supply polarised voltage for welding. In such {{circuits}} {{control of}} the output current is required; this is sometimes achieved by replacing some of the diodes in a <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> with thyristors, effectively diodes whose voltage output can be regulated by switching on and off with phase fired controllers.|$|E
25|$|For an {{uncontrolled}} three-phase <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier,</b> six diodes are used, and {{the circuit}} again has a pulse number of six. For this reason, {{it is also}} {{commonly referred to as}} a six-pulse bridge. The B6 circuit can be seen simplified as a series connection of two three-pulse center circuits.|$|E
25|$|For {{single-phase}} AC, if the transformer is center-tapped, {{then two}} diodes back-to-back (cathode-to-cathode or anode-to-anode, depending upon output polarity required) can form a full-wave rectifier. Twice as many turns are required on the transformer secondary {{to obtain the}} same output voltage than for a <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier,</b> but the power rating is unchanged.|$|E

30|$|Because of its {{simple system}} configuration, low EMI at input ac mains and reduced voltage rippled dc side, {{multi-pulse}} rectifier (MPR) {{is widely used}} in adjustable speed drives, electro-chemical processes, aircraft converter systems and renewable energy conversion systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. A MPR comprises a phase-shifting transformer and several three-phase diode <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> where the harmonics generated by one rectifier can be cancelled by other rectifiers [7]. The phase-shifting transformer produces a set of 3 N-phase voltages with proper phase-shift angle to feed the three-phase diode <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers</b> [8]. Therefore, the phase-shifting transformer is the necessary device in MPR.|$|R
25|$|If the {{three-phase}} <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{is operated}} symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the three-phase <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage. Powered by a transformer, earthing of the center point of the bridge is possible, provided that the secondary winding of the transformer is electrically isolated from the mains voltage and the star point of the secondary winding is not on earth. In this case, however, (negligible) leakage currents are flowing over the transformer windings.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts like a normal <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier.</b> With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} first converts the AC mains to a DC bus {{by means of a}} <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{substantially}} lower forward voltage (0.3V versus 0.7V for silicon diodes) germanium diodes have an inherent advantage over silicon diodes, especially in circuits like full-wave <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers</b> which result in 2X voltage drop because the current must pass through two diodes.|$|R
50|$|Early designs using LEDs and {{rechargeable}} batteries used dynamos much like small DC motors, but suffered from very short brush life. Small alternators with multipole permanent-magnet external cup rotors, combined with <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> offered long lives. Both single-phase and three-phase alternators are in use. Overcharge is possible, {{and to be}} avoided.|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{switched-mode}} power supply, a boost converter is inserted between the <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.|$|E
25|$|A full-wave <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> {{converts}} {{the whole}} of the input waveform to one of constant polarity (positive or negative) at its output. Mathematically, this corresponds to the absolute value function. Full-wave rectification converts both polarities of the input waveform to pulsating DC (direct current), and yields a higher average output voltage. Two diodes and a center tapped transformer, or four diodes in a bridge configuration and any AC source (including a transformer without center tap), are needed. Single semiconductor diodes, double diodes with common cathode or common anode, and four-diode bridges, are manufactured as single components.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ballasts}} {{contain a}} small circuit board with a <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier,</b> a filter capacitor and usually two switching transistors, {{which are often}} insulated-gate bipolar transistors. The incoming AC current is first rectified to DC, then converted to high frequency AC by the transistors, connected as a resonant series DC to AC inverter. The resulting high frequency {{is applied to the}} lamp tube. Since the resonant converter tends to stabilize lamp current (and light produced) over a range of input voltages, standard CFLs do not respond well in dimming applications and will experience a shorter lifespan and sometimes catastrophic failure. Special electronic ballasts (integrated or separate) are required for dimming service.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{insulated}} gate bipolar transistors are typical switching devices. In contrast to diode <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> PWM rectifiers achieve bidirectional power flow. In frequency converters this property {{makes it possible}} to perform regenerative braking.

40|$|Because {{miniaturized}} systems store little energy, their lifespans {{are often}} short. Fortunately, vibrations are consistent and abundant in many applications, so ambient kinetic energy {{can be a}} viable source. Vibrations induce the charges in piezoelectric transducers to build electrostatic forces that damp vibrations and convert kinetic energy into the electrical domain. The shunting switches and switched-inductor circuit of <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers</b> in [1 - 2] increase this output energy by extending the damping (i. e., harvesting) duration within a vibration cycle. Because the output voltages of <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifiers</b> clamp and limit the electrical damping forces built, switched-inductor converters in [3 - 4], whose damping voltages can exceed their rectified outputs, draw more power from vibrations. Still, electrical–mechanical coupling factors in tiny transducers are low, so electrical damping forces (i. e., voltages) remain weak. Investing energy into the transducer can increase this force, but unlike in [5 - 6], which demand multiple inductors and high-voltage sources, the system presented here invests energy with only one inductor at low voltages...|$|R
500|$|Bridge {{topology}} is {{an important}} topology with many uses in both linear and non-linear applications, including, amongst many others, the <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier,</b> the Wheatstone bridge and the lattice phase equaliser. [...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in circuit diagrams. [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a bridge circuit. [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations.

2500|$|The basic LCC {{configuration}} for HVDC uses a three-phase Graetz <b>bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> or six-pulse bridge, containing six electronic switches, each connecting one of {{the three}} phases to {{one of the}} two DC terminals. A complete switching element is usually referred to as a valve, irrespective of its construction. [...] Normally, two valves in the bridge are conducting at any time: one on the top row and one (from a different phase) on the bottom row. The two conducting valves connect two of the three AC phase voltages, in series, to the DC terminals. [...] Thus, the DC output voltage at any given instant is given by the series combination of two AC phase voltages. For example, if valves V1 and V2 are conducting, the DC output voltage is given by the voltage of phase 1 minus the voltage of phase 3.|$|E
