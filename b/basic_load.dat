2500|$|In September 2011, 19 {{soldiers}} {{participated in}} a two-week assessment of the LSAT light machine gun at Fort Benning, Georgia to demonstrate its capabilities against the M249 SAW. [...] In one test the soldiers, half armed with SAWs and half with LSATs, marched six miles in full combat gear then fired at targets to measure stress and muscle fatigue. [...] Another test had the soldiers sprint 200 yards wearing body armor and a <b>basic</b> <b>load</b> of ammunition, then rapidly engage close-range targets. [...] A third week involved soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment performing a squad maneuver live-fire exercise in an urban setting. [...] Feedback from participants favored the LSAT for its lighter weight and decreased recoil. [...] Soldiers remarked the LSAT had better accuracy than the M249. [...] The semi-automatic option made it more viable for room clearing. [...] One Ranger even said the LSAT performed better than the Mk 46 machine gun used by special operations forces. 15 out of 19 soldiers that participated in the assessment said they would prefer using the LSAT in combat rather than the SAW. [...] The LSAT LMG is 41 percent lighter than the [...] SAW and its ammunition volume is 12 percent less, enabling all the soldiers that maneuvered the woodland obstacle course to complete it faster when carrying it. [...] Participants also took less time to zero their machine guns when using the LSAT; one soldier failed repeatedly to accurately zero the SAW but successfully zeroed the LSAT on the first try. [...] The LMG users completed the course, on average, one minute and 11 seconds faster than SAW users due to increased mobility given by its shorter length, adjustable stock, and lighter ammo. [...] When firing, gunners felt virtually no recoil from the LSAT LMG. The eight prototype weapons fired a combined 25,000 rounds, moving its cased telescoped ammunition to technology readiness level 7.|$|E

50|$|Although the XM25 enables {{infantry}} {{units to}} engage enemies hiding behind cover, the weapon has been met with several points of criticism, specifically {{that it requires}} a soldier to exchange their rifle {{and use it as}} their primary weapon, making them unable to perform required tasks in many squad battle drills; there is also concern that the operator has a reduced capacity to engage targets at close range and that its <b>basic</b> <b>load</b> of 36 rounds can be depleted too quickly in direct-fire engagements. A soldier equipped with an M4 carbine with an M68 Close Combat Optic, AN/PEQ laser/infrared aiming device, weapon light, and 210 rounds has a 16 lb weapon load. Grenadiers carrying an M320 grenade launcher with a <b>basic</b> <b>load</b> of 36 40 mm grenades with their M4 have a 38 lb weapon load. An XM25 with 36 25 mm rounds means a soldier has to carry a 35 lb weapon load, so a combination of it and a rifle would require an individual infantryman to carry 51 lb in weapons.|$|E

50|$|The Sheridan {{was much}} {{appreciated}} by the infantry who were desperate for direct-fire support, which generally served {{in combination with}} ACAVs (M113s) as armored cavalry units consisted of both M113s and M551s {{as part of their}} TO&E. Armor units consisted solely of tanks (minus headquarters company) and Mechanized Infantry units consisted solely of M113s. In this role the real problem with the Sheridan was its limited ammunition load of only 20 rounds and 8 missiles (though M551s in Vietnam service were not equipped with missiles or their guidance equipment, increasing the <b>basic</b> <b>load</b> of conventional rounds).|$|E
5000|$|A {{battalion}} is {{the smallest}} military organization capable of [...] "limited independent operations", in that the battalion is the lowest-level organizational unit containing an organic coordinating, or executive, staff (i.e., S-1, S-2, etc.) and a support and services unit (e.g., headquarters and headquarters company). The battalion must, of course, have a source of re-supply to enable it to sustain operations {{for more than a}} few days. This is because a battalion's <b>basic</b> <b>load</b> of ammunition, expendable weapons (e.g., hand grenades and disposable rocket launchers), water, rations, fuel, lubricants, replacement parts, batteries, and medical supplies normally consists of only what the battalion's soldiers and the battalion's organic vehicles can carry.|$|E

5000|$|Due to Commodore's use of {{the same}} BASIC on {{multiple}} hardware architectures, the LOAD command was provided with an additional parameter to indicate the memory address where the program should start.
