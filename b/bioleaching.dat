The particle size of nearly 1 µm in the sulphide sludge sample {{was detected by}} optical microscopy. Based on chemical and X-ray diffraction analyses, covellite was detected as the major sulphide mineral. The batch <b>bioleach</b> amenability test was performed at 32 °C on the Tk 31 mine mesophilic mixed culture using a residence time of 28 days.

Throughout the 22 -day period of the <b>bioleach</b> test, copper recovery based on residue analysis indicated a copper extraction of 95 %, with copper concentration in the <b>bioleach</b> solution of 15 g/l. The slope of the straight line tangential to the exponential part of the extraction curve gave a copper solubilisation rate of 1. 1 g/l per day.

The raw data was analysed using a simplified film mass transfer model, making corrections for oxygen solubility in concentrated solution and for increased water vapour partial pressure at elevated temperatures. The results compared favourably against two independent experimental leach studies, indicating kLa values between 33 and 46 h− 1. The value varied with the particle size distribution of the packing, with kLa assuming larger values for those packings that had a higher fines contents. While kLa increases with temperature, the solubility of oxygen decreases simultaneously, resulting in net mass transfer rates being relatively unaffected by temperature in the range studied.

40|$|Sustainable {{treatment}} {{and disposal of}} mine waste is a serious environmental issue faced by the mining industry worldwide. Conventional methods of mine waste management predominantly involve indefinite retention in engineered tailings dams. The cost and liability of such surface storage facilities have increased significantly {{in recent years as}} an outcome of stringent environmental legislation and mine closure requirements gradually transforming the economics of mine waste disposal. Backfill methods, particularly cemented paste backfill, are increasingly perceived as sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives as they put waste material to practical use. Controlled low-strength materials (CLSM) offer an effective and practical alternative to similar analogues - requiring minimal compaction, being self-levelling and excavatable in the future if necessary. The aim of this research was to develop and evaluate CLSM, previously un-tested at mines, in which novel utilisation of <b>bioleach</b> waste is maximised and Portland cement content minimised while satisfying performance requirements for classification as CLSM. Leachability of toxic substances was minimised through encapsulating CLSM within a coating of relatively inert CLSM. Formulation and optimisation of CLSM using statistical mixture design and response surface analysis has ensured proper understanding of component interactions and influence on mechanical strength with a minimum amount of experiments. Optimised CLSM formulations were tested for their mechanical, physical, micro-structural, mineralogical and chemical properties. Effects of encapsulation were determined by assessing chemical leaching. The work indicated that <b>bioleach</b> waste could be beneficially reformed as CLSM of appropriate compressive strength for application in groundwork as loadbearing materials. Porosity and hydraulic conductivity were correspondingly high. Leachability of arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and zinc was significant (levels varied depending on waste type). Encapsulation significantly reduced leachability indicating promising potential for implementation of this technology in the mining industry. The research presented in this thesis substantiated the need for, and potential of, sustainable novel alternative technologies such as CLSM to augment future waste management strategies in the mining industry via safe emplacement of solid <b>bioleach</b> waste in the sub-surface.

The present study focuses on testing this process on crushed whole ore, after initial experiments conducted on low-grade Platreef flotation concentrate achieved promising results. Two samples of drill core Platreef ore with size distributions of − 25 mm + 1 mm and − 6 mm + 1 mm were first <b>bioleached</b> in cylindrical columns, to simulate heap leaching, at 65 °C and then leached with cyanide solution at 50 °C in cylindrical columns.

40|$|A typical <b>bioleach</b> heap is {{characterized}} by wide variation of temperature across the heap bed, leading to oxidation of target minerals occurring at different rates. Previous studies {{on the effect of}} temperature on the microbial oxidation of ferrous-iron were limited to a narrow range of temperatures (30 – 40 °C) near optimum conditions and mostly toAcidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The kinetics of ferrous-iron oxidation by Leptospirillum ferriphilum were studied in continuous culture. In this paper we focus on the effect of temperature (18 – 45 °C) on these kinetics. The study was {{based on the assumption that}} the effect of temperature can be studied independently of other, equally important factors such as pH, dissolved salts, etc. and independent of the reactor context. The experimental data were correlated using both, a simplified ferric-iron inhibitory model and the Pirt Equation. The results showed that the maximum specific ferrous-iron oxidation rate, increased with increasing temperature to a maximum at 42 °C. This trend can be described adequately by the Arrhenius Equation with an activation energy, Ea of 34. 46 kJ mol− 1 and frequency factor,K 0 of 1. 05 × 107 mmol Fe 2 +(mmolC) − 1 h− 1. An increase in temperature slightly reduces the steady state carbon biomass in the reactor, while the apparent affinity constant, K′Fe 2 + increases. The investigation further suggests that at low temperature (18 °C) and beyond the maximum temperature (42 °C), the culture cannot be sustained in a continuous mode. The maximum biomass yield followed a linear decline with increasing temperature, while cell maintenance on ferrous-iron followed a quadratic trend, although the small values indicates that it is not significant, as would be expected in continuous culture. The results indicate that L. ferriphilum is likely to perform optimally, at warm temperatures (25 – 42 °C) in heap <b>bioleach</b> operations before being taken over by thermophiles at higher temperatures...|$|R
