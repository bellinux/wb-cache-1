Then I thought, 'Twenty-five per cent of the world might get this, {{probably}} less, it's not worth it.' It happens all the time, because my references are usually off the Richter scale." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story with}} the Jack Donaghy {{character}} accidentally hitting his mother with {{his car was}} based on an experience by one of the 30 Rock writers. According to executive producer Robert Carlock: [...] "This actually happened. The niece of one of our writers hit her grandmother—the writer's mother—with her car. We kind of spent a day saying, 'Can we do this? Is everything going to be okay?' And she was fine, so we figured that would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun,</b> fraught thing to happen between Jack and his mom, especially right before Christmas." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tennis the Menace" [...] {{was written}} by Ian Maxtone-Graham and {{directed}} by Jen Kamerman {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001). Maxtone-Graham considers himself to be a bad tennis player and he has always wanted to win against his mother in a tennis match. This served as the inspiration for the episode, as he thought [...] "family dynamics around tennis would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> show." [...] Maxtone-Graham did a lot a research for the scenes {{at the beginning of the}} episode where the Simpsons visit a funeral salesman at a cemetery.|$|E

500|$|Before its release, Pokémon Pinball Ruby & Sapphire {{received}} generally positive impressions from critics. After a play test by Anoop Gantayat of IGN, he {{felt that}} fans of the series would enjoy it. He also praised the visuals, calling them [...] "bright, colorful, and happy". However, he bemoaned the lack of e-Reader support, a feature common in Game Boy Advance games at the time. Craig Harris, also from IGN, found it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> game, anticipating its release. IGN also included it in {{a list of the}} 10 big Game Boy Advance games of 2003. GameSpy described it as [...] "much more than a pinball game", describing its gameplay mechanics as [...] "unique".|$|E
500|$|The entire {{story of}} this episode was {{developed}} by David Cohen, although {{it was written by}} Brent Forrester, who felt that Cohen at least deserved a [...] "story by" [...] credit. To do research for this episode, Forrester went to one of the Lollapalooza concerts, which he thought would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> little perk, but ended up being a horrible experience. Several of the jokes in this episode are based on his experiences: cameras were being seized and thrown in the garbage, there were numerous advertisements, several [...] "sour faced teens", a real freak show (Jim Rose Circus), and at one point a stranger approached Forrester and asked [...] "how's it going, narc?".|$|E
500|$|... "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] was {{conceived}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> episode, {{based on a}} suggestion from the special effects teams about incorporating dinosaurs into Doctor Who. The storyline and characters were developed between Chibnall and head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat. Due to budget limitations, a wider plot had to be developed because the dinosaurs could not be the centerpiece. The dinosaurs were a mix of props and computer-generated imagery. Along with the third episode, [...] "A Town Called Mercy", [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] {{was in the first}} production block of the seventh series, with production commencing in early 2012 on large sets and Southerndown beach, Vale of Glamorgan. The episode was watched by 7.57million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics, though the reception of the gang of characters and Solomon's robots were mixed.|$|E

500|$|Since {{its release}} for the NES, Donkey Kong Jr. Math {{has been a}} {{critical}} and commercial disappointment. GameRankings reports an aggregate score of 32%, based on 5 reviews. [...] Nintendo spokesman Tom Sarris said that it [...] "wasn't a big hit", adding {{that no one was}} very enthusiastic about the title. He felt that if it had been received better, it would have led to more educational titles. Author Andy Slaven, writing in the Video Game Bible, criticized the premise, deriding Nintendo for combining a well-liked license with math, which is generally disliked by children. Inside Higher Eds David Epstein did not find it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> game, while 1UP.coms Bob Mackey called it the worst NES launch title, criticizing it for its lack of value. He commented that Donkey Kong Jr. moves as well as an infant would in real life.|$|E
500|$|Free Collars Kingdom {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from English-speaking audiences. Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork, noting that characters were [...] "cute and sexy {{with a wide}} variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character's personality" [...] and that, overall, the artwork was [...] "very clean with attractive characters and well-detailed backgrounds". In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that [...] "so far, the story continues to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> examination of what life might be like from the cat's point of view, but I don't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that [...] "the story probably received an early ending", but concluded that [...] "despite the series only being three volumes, it really is a worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} the {{children}} should go to a camp run by Krusty was first suggested by David M. Stern. The animators were enthusiastic about making this episode because they had all gone to summer camps as children and thought it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> episode to write for. The writers also thought that [...] "it would be fun if while the kids are gone Homer and Marge find that as the kids are miserable their marriage is better than ever." [...] The layout for Bart and Lisa's cabin {{was influenced by the}} director, Mark Kirkland, who as a child went to a Boy Scout camp that had exposed wires and other similar faults. Kirkland was also sure that the character Mr. Black was going to reappear later in the series, but he never did. Al Jean commented, [...] "I guess that the hydrofoil really got Mr. Black out of the show forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have noticed}} that the {{mechanics}} of the game — the actions available to the player, and the responses resulting from said actions — contrast pointedly with many mechanics of popular FPS games, and that the game deliberately used shooter genre clichés in order to illustrate how ludicrous they are in comparison to real warfare. In particular, unlike other games of its kind, some critics believe that Spec Ops: The Line does not intend the combat to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> experience for the player, but rather aims to engage the player by critiquing the shooter genre for being removed from reality and providing players with an unrealistic, morally dichotomous, escapist fantasy. The scene depicting the use of white phosphorus {{has been the subject of}} much scrutiny due to imagery that includes the corpse of a mother clutching her child, and was described as [...] "troubling". In response to complaints that the massacre was unnecessary or exploitative, Williams justified the scene by saying that the plot device was intended to evoke players' anger, and that a valid way to end the game is simply for the player to put the controller down and stop playing.|$|E
500|$|On 16 March 2011, judge Kyle Sandilands {{announced}} on his breakfast radio show, Kyle & Jackie O {{that he would}} not be returning to the judging panel for the third season. Of his decision, Sandilands said, [...] "Not because I didn't like it. I thought the show was great and it was great fun to do but it's just too hectic, it's too much work. So, I've told Channel Seven, no." [...] On 31 March 2011, it was announced that Natalie Bassingthwaighte would join the judging panel as a replacement for Natalie Imbruglia. When speaking of her role as a judge, Bassingthwaighte said she would focus on bringing an honest critique to the show and would guide [...] "the artists through the competition". In late April 2011, it was confirmed that Mel B would be Sandilands' replacement. Mel B said, [...] " [...] are either going to love me or hate me but it's going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> ride. I'm really easy to get on with and I'm a hard worker. I'm firm but nice." [...] Guy Sebastian and Ronan Keating were the only judges from the second season who returned.|$|E
500|$|Homer {{takes his}} children, Bart and Lisa, to {{a video game}} {{convention}} for another fun Saturday. Upon their return home, Marge feels upset that Homer gets to be the [...] "fun dad", while she is stuck doing unexciting things with the children. Next Saturday, she decides to take Bart and Lisa to an [...] "X-Games" [...] convention, thinking it will be something fun. However, when they arrive, they are disappointed {{to find out that}} it is a Christian event, and the actual name of the convention is [...] "† Games". The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia, where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food. Although initially averse to the exotic food, Marge is reminded that she wants to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> mom and therefore asks for the most authentic dish on the menu for her and her children. All three of them enjoy the food. At the restaurant, Marge, Bart, and Lisa bump into a group of foodies, who encourage them to start their own food blog, [...] "The Three Mouthketeers". The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and writing about it. This leaves Homer feeling left out and sad.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} episode, comparing it positively to previous episodes [...] "Casino Night" [...] and [...] "Booze Cruise": [...] "not as heavy or emotional, certainly, {{but still a}} chance to see our Dunderheads in a charming and demonstrative not-quite-work environment." [...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun,</b> and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E
500|$|The episode premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. Although initially cringing {{over the}} musical premise, Ramsey Isler of IGN called the episode [...] "admittedly fun" [...] because it [...] "gave us an indirect window to view how Walter feels about himself". In {{a review of}} the DVD, another critic from IGN later called it the [...] "worst overall episode" [...] of the season however, asking the question [...] "Musical numbers and Olivia Dunham: who thought {{this would be a good}} idea?" [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was also initially irritated after hearing Fox's musical plans, and consequently gave [...] "Fringe a lot of credit for pulling off this hour so cleverly" [...] Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic thought the episode was [...] "bizarre" [...] to watch; it [...] "held our interest for the entire 60 minutes, but really failed to introduce any new information about Peter and the unknown man that has crossed into our dimension". MTVs John Wigler loved the [...] "noir" [...] element, and thought [...] "each and every participating [...] "Fringe" [...] cast member exhibited great musical ability. Overall, it was a very solid effort on everyone's part". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad loved the scenes between Walter and Ella, and thought [...] "it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story". While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: [...] "All in all, what was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality – one of the turning points in the show’s mythology – fell flat". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing [...] "There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode [...] "edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well".|$|E
2500|$|Few {{media outlets}} {{thought this would}} be a {{particularly}} good game to watch, as it featured two mediocre teams, however since it was the first bowl game of the year, it received a decent amount of [...] hype beforehand. One preview noted that it should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> game to watch, as it [...] "promises to be a high-scoring" [...] game. Both teams featured strong offenses, however they juxtaposed one another in that Washington State, as typical of Mike Leach-coached football teams, heavily relied on the passing game, whereas Colorado State relied heavily upon the running game. Though Washington State was only a 3.5 point favorite, college football analysts were nearly unanimous in predicting a Washington State victory by an even larger margin.|$|E

2500|$|The {{producers}} embraced {{humor and}} wanted SG-1 to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> show {{that did not}} take itself too seriously. Brad Wright regarded SG-1 as a family show with adequate violence as opposed to random or gratuitous violence. Christopher Judge did not consider SG-1 as a [...] "message show {{by any stretch of}} the imagination, but occasionally there are messages there". Aimed at a popular audience, Stargate SG-1 emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referencing popular culture, like The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer had done before. Jonathan Glassner had written The Wizard of Oz references into his own scripts since the first season, which the other writers imitated after Richard Dean Anderson began referencing the film on his own. O'Neill references Richard Dean Anderson's favorite television series, The Simpsons, throughout the show. SG-1 makes meta-textual references to the process of writing and filming a science fiction TV series in several episodes and alludes to the main actors' previous TV roles in the pilot episode (Carter: [...] "It took us fifteen years and three supercomputers to MacGyver a system for the gate on Earth") and in a Farscape vignette in the milestone episode [...] "200".|$|E
2500|$|Greg McElhatton of CBR gave A-Force #1 {{three stars}} {{out of five}} writing, [...] "Ultimately, I wish the {{narration}} from Singularity had been dropped entirely from [...] "A-Force" [...] #1. You can still understand what's going on without it, and the disparate clash of her thoughts and dialogue would have never happened. Hopefully, they will get smoothed out a bit in future issues, but—for now—this issue is only alright." [...] Jeff Lake of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10 and said, [...] "Overall, A-Force #1 is a solid, if unspectacular debut. It's great to see this cast together again, especially {{in the hands of}} Wilson, Molina and Martin, but as of now this new direction feels hamstrung by its need to square peg its way into a round hole." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 saying, [...] "While this book starts off with a shaky foundation - namely, {{that you have to have}} read a Secret Wars tie-in to understand where Singularity came from - Wilson does a great job at firming things up, with her new heroine proving to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> addition to the Marvel Universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Birchett sisters {{also worked}} with Muhammed Kateeb and Otis Greyson to write the third leaked song, [...] "Hooked on You". Danja also {{produced}} two other songs for the album, [...] "Love and War" [...] (also written by the Birchett sisters) and [...] "Keeper". The latter bears some resemblance to T.I.'s [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] (2009) which was also produced by Danja. It also follows {{in the same vein}} as [...] "One Love" [...] with lyrics that focus on Lopez searching for and then finding Mr. Right. While [...] "Starting Over" [...] and [...] "One Love" [...] both made the album, Danja's other two productions did not. Meanwhile, Caren and Chris Sernal respectively produced and wrote the guitar-driven ballad [...] "Beautiful", which according to Rap-Up, is resemblant of production work by Ryan Tedder. Lopez {{also worked with}} Pharrell Williams and his production outfit The Neptunes on the album. One record they produced, [...] "Fresh Out the Oven" [...] was written by Williams, Pitbull, Lopez and Amanda Ghost. It also features additional vocals from Pitbull, but was only ever intended to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fun</b> record that was leaked by Epic Records and promoted in US night clubs. Neither track made the final track listing.|$|E
