5|$|Lem {{was awarded}} an honorary {{membership}} in the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given {{to people who do}} not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, and it seems that Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.|$|E

25|$|The New Zealand Company was a 19th-century English {{company that}} {{played a key}} role in the {{colonisation}} of New Zealand. The company was formed to carry out the principles of systematic colonisation devised by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who envisaged the creation of a new-model English society in the southern hemisphere. Under Wakefield’s model, the colony would attract capitalists who would then have a ready supply of labour—migrant labourers who could not initially afford to be property owners, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have the expectation of one day buying land with their savings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s when war was brewing Europe, the anti-religious {{propaganda}} carried {{the line that}} devout Christians could not make good soldiers because Christianity was anti-war, preached love of one's enemies, turning the other cheek, etc. This propaganda stood in sharp contradiction with the anti-religious propaganda that had been produced in the 1920s that blamed the church for preaching unqualified patriotism in World War I. To a lesser degree, it also differed from the criticism of Christians who had fought for Russia in World War I <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not take up arms for the USSR.|$|E
25|$|A {{television}} producer, {{working for}} producer Jack Webb, of Dragnet and Adam-12 fame, was in Los Angeles' UCLA Harbor Medical Center, doing background research for a proposed new TV show about doctors, when {{he happened to}} encounter these 'firemen who spoke like doctors and worked with them'. This novel idea would eventually evolve into the Emergency! television series, which ran from 1972–1977, portraying the exploits of a new group called 'paramedics'. The show {{captured the imagination of}} emergency services personnel, the medical community, and the general public. When the show first aired in 1972, there were only 6 full-fledged paramedic units operating in 3 pilot programs (Miami, Los Angeles, Seattle) in the whole of the United States. No one had ever heard the term 'paramedic'; indeed, it is reported that one of the show's actors was initially concerned that the 'para' part of the term might involve jumping out of airplanes! By the time the program ended production in 1977, there were paramedics operating in every state. The show's technical advisor was a pioneer of paramedicine, James O. Page, then a Battalion Chief responsible for the Los Angeles County Fire Department 'paramedic' program, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> go on to help establish other paramedic programs in the U.S., and to become the founding publisher of the Journal of Emergency Medical Services.|$|E
25|$|At {{least part}} of the novel may have been autobiographical. In 1802, the Reverend Harris Bigg Wither of the Church of England {{proposed}} marriage to Austen, which she declined. The reaction of her family is not known as after Jane's death in 1817, her letters from the year 1802 were burned by her family, but it is likely that her father who was anxious to get his daughter married off so that he would cease to have to support her would have been one of great disapproval. In Mansfield Park, Sir Thomas Bertram harshly lectures Fanny Price for refusing the marriage proposal of Henry Crawford, telling her she was being disgracefully selfish in not marrying a man she did not love, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have brought great material advantages. The novel ends with Price being vindicated in rejecting Crawford as supremely unsuitable husband material. Austen's sister Cassandra Austen wanted the novel to end with Price marrying Crawford, and this dispute {{is one of the few}} known between the sisters. The American scholar John Halperin also noted that Austen's mother loved all of her novels except Mansfield Park, which he suggests may have been in part because of the similarities between Sir Thomas and her husband. Another additional autobiographical influence might be Austen's brother, Charles Austen who served as a Royal Navy officer during the Napoleonic wars. In the novel, Fanny's brother William joins the Royal Navy as an officer, whose ship, the HMS Thrush is sited right next to the HMS Cleopatra at Spithead. Captain Austen commanded the HMS Cleopatra during her cruise in North American waters to hunt French ships from September 1810 to June 1811, and assuming that the same HMS Cleopatra that had just arrived back in Spithead in the novel is the same HMS Cleopatra commanded by Captain Austen would date the main's events of the novel to 1810–1811. Likewise, the gift that William gives Fanny of an amber cross echoes the gift of a topaz cross given by Captain Austen to his sister Jane before he set sail to the Royal Navy's North America station based in Halifax and Bermuda.|$|E

500|$|Opinions varied {{about the}} effect Libertarian nominee Dan Feliciano's {{candidacy}} had on the result. Former Governor Douglas suggested that Feliciano split the anti-Shumlin vote. The Burlington Free Press speculated that Feliciano drew voters dissatisfied with Shumlin <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have voted for Milne if they had {{realized that he had}} a chance to prevail. Feliciano stated that he was [...] "not a spoiler" [...] but drew voters who could not bring themselves to vote for the Republican candidate. A Feliciano campaign consultant felt, based on polling, that her candidate's stance against Shumlin's healthcare policy garnered votes. Milne, who did no polling, began criticizing Shumlin's healthcare policy later in the campaign than Feliciano. Republicans wondered whether they should have done more to push Feliciano out, whether Milne should have run more strongly against single-payer, whether 2012 nominee and former State Auditor Randy Brock should have run again, and whether the state party should have been less focused on state legislative races.|$|E
500|$|Sunday was {{a lifelong}} Republican, and he espoused the {{mainstream}} {{political and social}} views of his native Midwest: individualism, competitiveness, personal discipline, and opposition to government regulation. Writers such as Sinclair Lewis, Henry M. Tichenor, and John Reed attacked Sunday {{as a tool of}} big business, and poet Carl Sandburg called him a [...] "four-flusher" [...] and a [...] "bunkshooter." [...] Nevertheless, Sunday sided with Progressives on some issues. For example, he denounced child labor and supported urban reform and women's suffrage. Sunday condemned capitalists [...] "whose private lives are good, but whose public lives are very bad", as well as those [...] "who would not pick the pockets of one man with the fingers of their hand" [...] <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> [...] "without hesitation pick the pockets of eighty million people with fingers of their monopoly or commercial advantage." [...] He never lost his sympathy for the poor, and he sincerely tried to bridge the gulf between the races during the zenith of the Jim Crow era, although on at least two occasions in the mid-1920s Sunday received contributions from the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E
500|$|After London {{seasons in}} 1906–07 and 1908–09, the opera company {{did not perform}} in the West End again until 1919, {{although}} it continued to tour in Great Britain. [...] According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, [...] "Through {{the years of the}} Great War they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere. [...] They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory." [...] Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, [...] "I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London. [...] I thought the dresses looked dowdy.... I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> produce a décor attractive to the new generation." [...] In a 1922 memoir, Henry Lytton, having admired Richard D'Oyly Carte's keen eye for stagecraft, added, [...] "That 'eye' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son, Mr. Rupert D'Oyly Carte. [...] He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance, and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected". [...] In 1911, the company hired J. M. Gordon as stage manager, and Carte later promoted him to director. [...] Gordon, under Carte's supervision, preserved the company's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years.|$|E

500|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} the Buccaneers’ record. One was the stinginess of owner Culverhouse, who {{went so far as}} to lease the team jet from McCullough (the {{chainsaw}} manufacturer) Airlines. At times Culverhouse had to pay for fuel with his own credit card, because of McCullough’s financial difficulties. The offense was able to move the ball freely at times, but had difficulty getting the ball into the end zone. McKay and Spurrier had a difficult relationship, with Spurrier at times taking public potshots at McKay. Frustrated by the lack of quality receivers, Spurrier criticized McKay for playing his own son Johnny ahead of receivers Spurrier considered more capable. Coach McKay, for his part, questioned (rightly, according to Spurrier himself) Spurrier’s drive, although he publicly defended Spurrier by terming fans who booed him “idiots”. Spurrier was not the only player angered over the younger McKay’s retention, and Pat Toomay later alleged that Spurrier would throw passes over the middle to McKay in an attempt to get him injured, but that McKay made no effort to catch them. Injuries were a large factor. Only five Buccaneers started all 14 games, and neither of the team’s projected starting running backs, Harold Hart and Vince Kendrick, ever played a regular-season down for the team. The defense, who played the equivalent of two seasons in one due to the inability of the offense to mount sustained drives, was hit particularly hard by injuries. Toward the end of the year, [...] the roster got so thin that the team signed undersized ex-USC linebacker Jimmie “Psycho” Sims straight off the streets. With no time to learn the system, Sims was simply instructed to blitz on every down. Finally, the losing was in part by design: McKay was determined to give experience to young players who he felt could help the team in the future, rather than obtain veterans who might help the team win a few games in the short run, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> no longer be around by the time the team would develop into a championship contender.|$|E

2500|$|As a Catholic apologist of the {{religious}} and political status quo, Barruel downplayed his own Catholicism and presented himself as a neutral party within the radicalized debate surrounding the Revolution. [...] His tactic was to cite document after document with a commentary that effectively showed it was the truth. The reader of the Memoirs {{could have been any}} individual who doubted some of Barruels inferences, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> eventually be overwhelmed by the sheer weight of evidence against the Enlightenment and liberation movements. His fanatical hatred for revolutionary and enlightenment ideas is hidden behind a faux neutrality and casuistic slight of pen. By isolating single passages and quoting them out of context, Barruel presented {{what seemed to be a}} convincing case. He made up for quality with quantity and persuaded a number of contemporaries to adopt his view. The Memoirs is constructed according to reason and Barruel attempts to use the Enlightenments own tool to bring about its demise.|$|E
2500|$|Some Anglo-Catholic parishes {{used the}} English Missal, {{a version of}} the BCP which {{included}} the prayers of the Latin Mass both in translation and in the original interspersed with prayers from the prayer book; most used either the BCP or the 1928 Prayer Book, which though it was never approved has continued in print until the present with the warning [...] "The publication of this book does not directly or indirectly imply that it can be regarded as authorized for use in churches." [...] As time passed and liturgical scholarship proceeded, it became clear that a new attempt should be made to provide orders of service for the church. In an attempt to break the deadlock, Dom Gregory Dix, in his book The Shape of the Liturgy published in 1945, proposed that his own thinking about the Eucharist, using what he called the [...] "Four Action Shape", be the basis of a rite. He suggested that such a rite be produced by a number of bishops, too many for them to be victimised but not so many so as to suggest rebellion, who would allow such a rite to be used in their own dioceses <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not protect parish clergy from legal challenge if they used it.

2500|$|As Admiral Foote's wounded foot became swollen {{his overall}} {{conditioned}} worsened, making {{it extremely difficult}} for him to make his way about the ship, Captain Phelps was assuming {{more and more of the}} everyday responsibilities of running the flotilla. Foote summoned three surgeons to examine his condition, where they found that bones were broken and recommended that he be permitted to return home on a leave of absence. Foote forwarded their recommendation to Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles with the request that temporary command be given to Captain Charles Davis, as Acting Flag Officer. Foote had considered giving the young Phelps the command, maintaining that [...] "Although Lieutenant-Commanding Phelps, the flag captain, is qualified to command any squadron...", the Navy was bound by a system of seniority. Despite Phelps's proven ability he was deemed too young to assume command without inciting the resentment of other officers who had seniority, which, regardless, invoked the ire of Phelps. Knowing there were other officers on the list for promotion, many of whom had left the Navy five to ten years ago, <b>but</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> nonetheless be placed ahead of him on the promotion list, Phelps wrote to his influential friends in Washington requesting that a bill be enacted for purposes of allowing the most qualified officers to assume the various commands, regardless of any seniority. Since the growing Union Navy was in desperate need of experienced officers, Phelps's request, though compelling, was declined by the Senate fearing that it would counter efforts to invite former officers back into the Navy. Temporary command of the flotilla was eventually given to Davis on May 9.|$|E
