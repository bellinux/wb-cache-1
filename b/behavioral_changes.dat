Much of what is known about human lead toxicity and its effects is derived from animal studies. Animals are used to test the effects of treatments, such as chelating agents, and to provide information on the pathophysiology of lead, such as how it is absorbed and distributed in the body.|$|E

In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances.

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in HD {{is generally}} around 20years following {{the onset of}} visible symptoms. Most life-threatening complications result from muscle coordination and, to a lesser extent, <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> induced by declining cognitive function. The largest risk is pneumonia, which causes death in one third of those with HD. As the ability to synchronize movements deteriorates, difficulty clearing the lungs and {{an increased risk of}} aspirating food or drink both increase the risk of contracting pneumonia. The second greatest risk is heart disease, which causes almost a quarter of fatalities of those with HD. Suicide is the third greatest cause of fatalities, with 7.3% of those with HD taking their own lives and up to 27% attempting to do so. It is unclear to what extent suicidal thoughts are influenced by behavioral symptoms, as they signify sufferers' desires to avoid the later stages of the disease. Other associated risks include choking, physical injury from falls, and malnutrition.|$|E

They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{phases of}} the menstrual cycle correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause <b>behavioral</b> <b>changes</b> in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones may contribute to increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different {{phases of the}} menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E

40|$|Background Cost-effectiveness {{analyses}} of behavioral interventions typically use a dichotomous outcome criterion. However, achieving <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> {{is a complex}} process involving several steps towards a change in behavior. Delayed effects may occur after an intervention period ends, {{which can lead to}} underestimation of these interventions. To account for such delayed effects, intermediate outcomes of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> may be used in cost-effectiveness analyses. The aim {{of this study is to}} model cognitive parameters of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> into a cost-effectiveness model of a behavioral intervention. Methods The cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of an existing dataset from an RCT in which an high-intensity smoking cessation intervention was compared with a medium-intensity intervention, was re-analyzed by modeling the stages of change of the Transtheoretical Model of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change.</b> Probabilities were obtained from the dataset and literature and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Results In the original CEA over the first 12 months, the high-intensity intervention dominated in approximately 58 % of the cases. After modeling the cognitive parameters to a future 2 nd year of follow-up, this was the case in approximately 79 %. Conclusion This study showed that modeling of future <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> in CEA of a behavioral intervention further strengthened the results of the standard CEA. Ultimately, modeling future <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> could have important consequences for health policy development in general and the adoption of behavioral interventions in particular...|$|R

Methods : Participants were smoking family members of children enrolled at five kindergartens in two cities in Japan between December 2009 and January 2011. The stage of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> before and after the intervention and related variables were measured by self-administered questionnaires. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results : Valid responses were obtained from 110 participants in 101 households. Before the intervention, 39 participants(35. 5 ％) were {{in the first half of}} the pre-contemplation stage, 53 participants (48. 2 ％) were in the latter half of the pre-contemplation stage, 18 participants (16. 4 ％) were in the contemplation stage,and no participants (0. 0 ％) were in the preparation stage. A significant difference in stage of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> was found before and after the intervention (z＝－ 3. 350, p＝ 0. 001). The stage of change progressed after the intervention. The lower the stage of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> for smoking cessation before the intervention (odds ratio［OR］ 11. 90, 95 ％ confidence interval［CI］ 2. 24 - 63. 30, p＜ 0. 01) or the higher a parent’s anxiety regarding the children’s health (OR 4. 23, 95 ％CI 1. 34 - 13. 30, p＜ 0. 05),the more the intervention led to a progression in the stage of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change.</b> Conclusion : A biochemical feedback intervention for smoking family members who are in the first half of the precontemplation stage could lead to progress in the stage of <b>behavioral</b> <b>change</b> among smokers, and this progress might lead to an increase in the number of quitters. （Kitakanto Med J 2014 ； 64 ： 125 ～ 134...|$|R
