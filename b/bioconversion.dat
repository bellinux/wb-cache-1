25|$|Sugarcane {{is a major}} crop in many countries. It is one of {{the plants}} with the highest <b>bioconversion</b> efficiency. Sugarcane crop is able to {{efficiently}} fix solar energy, yielding some 55 tonnes of dry matter per hectare of land annually. After harvest, the crop produces sugar juice and bagasse, the fibrous dry matter. This dry matter is biomass with potential as fuel for energy production. Bagasse can also be used as an alternative source of pulp for paper production.|$|E
25|$|Independent of {{nitric oxide}} synthase, an {{alternative}} pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as spinach and arugula, and beetroot, {{have been shown}} to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the <b>bioconversion</b> of plant-derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet.|$|E

40|$|Nylon- 6 is a bulk polymer {{used for}} many applications. It {{consists}} of the non-natural building block 6 -aminocaproic acid, the linear form of caprolactam.

One of the biosynthetic pathways starts with 2 -oxoglutarate and contains <b>bioconversions</b> of the ketoacid elongation pathway known from methanogenic archaea.

40|$|In the Satake Centre for Grain Process Engineering we are {{developing}} cereal-based biorefining {{strategies for the}} production of biofuels, biodegradable plastics and platform chemicals. Cereal grains are complex biological entities and we target the exploitation of all cereal components providing both value-added end-products and precursors for chemical synthesis. Hydrolysis of natural polymers (e. g. starch, protein) contained in cereals requires supply of a range of hydrolytic enzymes (e. g. amylase, protease), which are produced by fungal <b>bioconversions.</b> On-site production of these enzymes would result in the production of a high amount of fungal biomass. Fungal autolysis can be used to bioconvert this low-cost byproduct into a nutrient-rich supplement (fungal extract) for microbial <b>bioconversions.</b> Mixing fungal extracts with cereal hydrolysates results in nutrient-complete microbial feedstocks. Optimising the exploitation of protein in cereal grains would enable the provision of optimum amounts of free amino acids and peptides to subsequent microbial <b>bioconversions</b> and the extraction of the remaining protein as a value-added co-product with various current (food) and potential (biodegradable plastics) market outlets. The use of amino acids and peptides would enhance productivities (e. g. polyhydroxybutyrate, succinic acid) and, in certain cases, production yields (e. g. polyhydroxybutyrate) improving significantly current fermentation practices that exploit only the starch component in cereal grains. In addition, the exploitation of all cereal components and low-cost by-product streams produced in a cereal-based biorefinery will result in waste minimisation and maximisation of carbon as well as other nutrient utilisation from the original cereal grain. This work will present different feedstock formulation strategies based on the production of wheat hydrolysates and fungal extracts for the microbial production of polyhydroxybutyrate and succinic acid...|$|R

30|$|Fungal cellulases play a {{significant}} role in the enzymatic saccharification of pretreated biomass (van den Brink and de Vries 2011). These growing large-scale <b>bioconversions</b> of lignocellulosic materials have led to an increasing concern about the commercial production of cellulase (Cherry and Merino 2007). The cellulase activity produced by fungi is mainly composed of cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases, β-glucosidases, and some auxiliary enzymes, and the hyper-expression of these proteins is still inducer dependent (Glass et al. 2013). Cellobiose and sophorose are the most effective but expensive inducers for commercial enzyme production (Bischof et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2014). Therefore, the present study investigated the feasibility of using cow manure for cellulase expression.|$|R

40|$|In {{continuing}} {{directed evolution}} of P 450 BM 3 for small alkane hydroxylation, {{we developed a}} high-throughput screen to directly assay for P 450 alkane hydroxylation activity. With {{the use of a}} pressurizable 96 -well reactor, the P 450 alkane hydroxylation reaction was conducted in high throughput and the alcohol product was quantified spectroscopically by a coupled enzyme assay utilizing 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) as a horseradish peroxidase (E. C. 1. 11. 1. 7) substrate to detect hydrogen peroxide generated by alcohol oxidase (E. C. 1. 1. 3. 13) oxidation of the product alcohol. Applying this screen to 370 P 450 variants generated in our laboratory, we identified variant E 31 (WT-A 74 L-V 78 I-A 82 L-A 184 V-L 188 W-A 328 F-A 330 W) as the best candidate for further engineering. Through subsequent rounds of site-saturation and random mutagenesis, multiple variants supporting 1, 700 – 4, 000 ethane TONs were identified. Recombination of the identified mutations generated variant E 31 -D 140 E-L 215 P-T 436 R supporting 5, 800 ethane TON.

In contrast, CYP 153 A 6, a natural terminal alkane hydroxylase, was able to produce ethanol in whole-cell alkane <b>bioconversions.</b> The inability of BM 3 variants to produce ethanol in vivo reflects their poor affinity for ethane and indicates they still lag behind a natural P 450 alkane hydroxylase in terminal hydroxylation of small alkanes. 120 B...|$|R
