6000|$|... "You {{ever been}} in a <b>banana</b> <b>grove?</b> It's as solemn as a rathskeller at seven A. M. It's like being lost behind the scenes at one of these {{mushroom}} musical shows. You can't see the sky for the foliage above you; and the ground is knee deep in rotten leaves; and it's so still that you can hear the stalks growing again after you chop 'em down.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>banana</b> <b>grove</b> {{was not far}} distant, {{and here}} the puma thought he would pay the monkey out for forcing him to carry him over the river. 'Friend monkey, look what fine bananas,' cried he. 'You are fond of climbing; suppose you run up and throw me down a few. You can eat the green ones, which are the nicest, and I will be content with the yellow.' ...|$|E

50|$|Tikbalang are {{generally}} associated with dark, sparsely populated, foliage-overgrown areas, with legends variously identifying their abode as being beneath bridges, in bamboo clumps or <b>banana</b> <b>groves,</b> and atop Kalumpang (Sterculia foetida) or Balite (Ficus indica) trees.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a little}} wooden hotel in {{the edge of a}} <b>banana</b> <b>grove,</b> facing the sea, that catered to the tastes of the few foreigners that had dropped out of the world into the triste Peruvian town. At Kalb's introductory: [...] "Shake hands with ----," [...] he had obediently {{exchanged}} manual salutations with a German doctor, one French and two Italian merchants, and three or four Americans who were spoken of as gold men, rubber men, mahogany men--anything but men of living tissue.|$|E
6000|$|... "We made it unanimous, {{and then}} we {{gathered}} our guns and assaulted the blue troops in force. We fired over their heads, and then charged 'em with a yell, and they broke and ran. We were irritated at having our barbecue disturbed, and we chased 'em {{a quarter of a}} mile. Some of 'em we caught and kicked hard. The General rallied his troops and joined in the chase. Finally they scattered in a thick <b>banana</b> <b>grove,</b> and we couldn't flush a single one. So we sat down and rested.|$|E
60|$|With {{purpose in}} his steps Blythe now moved rapidly {{through the town}} by way of its landward environs. He passed through the squalid {{quarters}} of the improvident negroes and on beyond the picturesque shacks of the poorer mestizos. From many points along his course he could see, through the umbrageous glades, the house of Frank Goodwin on its wooded hill. And {{as he crossed the}} little bridge over the lagoon he saw the old Indian, Galvez, scrubbing at the wooden slab that bore the name of Miraflores. Beyond the lagoon the lands of Goodwin began to slope gently upward. A grassy road, shaded by a munificent and diverse array of tropical flora wound from the edge of an outlying <b>banana</b> <b>grove</b> to the dwelling. Blythe took this road with long and purposeful strides.|$|E
5000|$|Homeo Road and Krishi Bhavan Road are two {{parallel}} roads originating from Ramanattukara bus station. Both these mud roads attract many joggers {{in the mornings}} and evenings as they are flanked by green paddy fields, <b>banana</b> <b>groves</b> and coconut plantations.|$|R

50|$|There {{are over}} 50 small sites. The slopes around Ntusi are blessed with thicker and fertile soil {{able to grow}} <b>banana</b> <b>groves,</b> sweet potatoes, maize, beans, {{groundnuts}} etc. This cultivation reveals archaeological evidence that comes to the surface like broken pots, food-bones, and grindstones. Farming threatens the archaeological features but the community at Ntusi {{have come up with}} a strategy to preserve the features as much as possible along with respecting the values of the community. Yet, the archaeological features have reduced in size. The largest archaeological features include two mounds and the bwogero basin. The mounds have suffered lowering through cultivation. The 'Ntusi male' and 'Ntusi female' are exceptionally large and are the most known. They are preserved as grass-covered eminences standing 4 meters above the surrounding fields and <b>banana</b> <b>groves.</b>|$|R

Traditionally animist, with female shamans, most Rungus are now Christian.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s, {{the site}} {{had become a}} swampy <b>banana</b> <b>grove</b> listed in city records as [...] "an impenetrable swamp." [...] In the early 1930s, David Breed Lindsay, a local newspaperman, {{purchased}} the grove to create a botanical gardens. Beginning in 1936, admission fees were charged and in 1940, Jungle Gardens opened for business in essentially its current form. In the late 1940s, Jungle Gardens was sold to the philanthropic Allyn family, who continue to manage it.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species was}} first {{discovered}} in a <b>banana</b> <b>grove.</b> (Gardner, 1977) Musonycteris harrisoni is endemic to Mexico. The main distribution within Mexico is in the states of Colima, Michoacán, and Guerrero. [...] This bat {{is one of the}} phyllostomid bats with the smallest range, covering only approximately 20,000 km^2. [...] Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. It is threatened by habitat loss. The maximum recorded altitude for the species is over 1,700 m.|$|E
5000|$|The nature carpets {{were created}} in the post-pop period of the late '60s. These are {{horizontal}} segments of nature reproduced with foam rubber, allowing for a real tactile and bodily experiencing of the works. The illustrated work [...] "Uragano" [...] (Hurricane), made in 1989, evokes a tropical terrain - a <b>banana</b> <b>grove</b> - with {{the evidence of the}} aftermath of a storm. The nature of these [...] "carpets" [...] is therefore that of capturing the accidentalness and chaoticness of things, thus reminding us of the biological cycle of life/death.|$|E

50|$|The pink-sided tree frog (Agalychnis litodryas) is {{a species}} of frog in the family Hylidae.It is found in Ecuador, Panama, and {{possibly}} Colombia.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and rivers.It is threatened by habitat loss. The frogs are an arboreal species of humid lowland forest. The single specimen in Panama was collected on a bush in a swamp. The holotype was found at night perched about {{one and a half}} meters above the ground in a bush {{at the edge of a}} swamp (Duellman and Trueb 1967). A gliding species, the Ecuadorian specimens have been heard calling from bushes overhanging a shallow pond in a <b>banana</b> <b>grove</b> at night (Duellman 2001). It deposits its eggs on the leaves floating on ponds, and larvae jump into the pond and develop in the water. Since it depends on the forest canopy, it is not very adaptable to disturbances.|$|E
50|$|An Israeli {{military}} jeep {{passed by}} first, {{but it was}} not targeted. As the bus approached Jericho, the attackers appeared out of a <b>banana</b> <b>grove,</b> and forced the bus to slow down. They hurled 3 molotov cocktails at it, setting the bus alight. Most of the passengers reacted quickly, and were able to escape the burning bus unharmed. But as the flames began to spread inside the bus, Rachel Weiss went into shock, then threw herself on her children in a vain attempt to keep them alive. IDF corporal David Delarosa, a passenger who had exited the bus, noticed Weiss sitting near the back door, and begged her to come out, but she refused. When he tried to pull her out, he heard her say Shema Yisrael, and he understood that she wished to remain with her children. Weiss perished along with her 3 children. Delarosa died {{a month and a half}} later from burns and smoke inhalation.|$|E
5000|$|Jerry St. Clair has booked psychic medium Clinton Baptiste (Alex Lowe) for the club, who {{had been}} {{recommended}} by Den Perry. Jerry seems oblivious {{to the fact that}} Den Perry wants the Phoenix Club to fail. Brian and Jerry then have to attend a fire safety seminar at the <b>Banana</b> <b>Grove</b> Club presented by Keith Lard (from That Peter Kay Thing), who was arrested for [...] "interfering" [...] with dogs, but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. After the meeting, Lard tells Brian he will be inspecting the club immediately to ensure it meets safety standards. Jerry and Brian rush back to the club before Keith inspects it, but a run-in with the police delays them and Keith shuts the club down for being unsafe. Never a quitter, Brian blackmails Lard with a faked photo of Lard's head on the body of a semi-nude man (with a dog) so that he re-opens the club, but the event they re-open for, the psychic night, forces Brian to refund all of his guests after Clinton Baptiste tells a bit more about the future than the guests would like.|$|E

60|$|The {{mountains}} {{reached up}} their bulky shoulders {{to receive the}} level gallop of Apollo's homing steeds, the day died in the lagoons and in the shadowed <b>banana</b> <b>groves</b> and in the mangrove swamps, where the great blue crabs were beginning to crawl to land for their nightly ramble. And it died, at last, upon the highest peaks. Then the brief twilight, ephemeral as the flight of a moth, came and went; the Southern Cross peeped with its topmost eye above a row of palms, and the fire-flies heralded with their torches the approach of soft-footed night.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{established}} that Jack {{comes from the}} 51st century. This is a particularly significant period in the Doctor Who fictional universe, being {{the time of the}} Great Breakout, an expansionistic period where mankind headed for the stars (The Invisible Enemy) as well as the home era of K-9. Other historical events of the 51st century include a new ice age, a near world war, early experiments in time travel, the establishment of the Time Agents and {{the rise and fall of}} the villainous Magnus Greel (The Talons of Weng-Chiang). Parts of the Tenth Doctor episode [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] as well as the entirety of [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead", and [...] "Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone", all written by Steven Moffat, take place in this era as well. The Doctor identifies Jack's sonic blaster as coming from the Weapon Factories of Villengard and implies that he blew them up. He also notes that there is a <b>banana</b> <b>grove</b> where the factories were, and that [...] "bananas are good". The Tenth Doctor repeats this sentiment in [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] and claims that he invented the banana daiquiri in 18th century France.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainstream}} Zionist {{approach to}} the insurgency, set forth by David Ben-Gurion, was to avoid reprisal and rather prioritize the strengthening of defenses in Jewish areas, a policy of Havlagah (lit. Restraint). Notrim and Jewish supernumeraries had however been active after having been recruited by the British army to help repress the Arab revolt.A militant form of Zionism, constituting a paramilitary organization calling itself Irgun soon broke ranks with the Haganah {{over the issue of}} restraint. It was dominated by activists who had originally identified with Ze'ev Jabotinsky’s Betar movement, which had been founded in 1923, and eventually evolved into the core of Zionist Revisionism. Jabotinsky himself initially advised a diplomatic approach and held reservations about recourse to measures of retaliation. The Irgun, adopted a policy change from passive defense to active aggression, and considered terrorism against Palestinians a form of deterrence against Arab attacks. The active defense tactic adopted consisted of 4 kinds of assault: (a) assassinations (b) shooting fellahin or urban Arabs (c) ambushes of transport vehicles carrying Arabs and (d) outright terrorist assaults on densely populated Arab areas Some of these practices were not new: on 20 April 1936, 2 Palestinians had been murdered while tending a <b>banana</b> <b>grove,</b> and on 20 April, pedestrians in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were subject to attacks where guns and hand-grenades were used. In March 1937 right-wing Zionists had thrown a bomb into a coffee house frequented by Arabs in Tel Aviv. Throughout the three years of the revolt, the revisionist group mounted some 60 acts of terrorism against Palestinian targets.|$|E

25|$|The bowl's bottom {{represents}} Cambodia's interior, about 75 percent, {{consisting of}} alluvial flood-plains of the Tonlé Sap basin, the lower Mekong River and the Bassac River plain, whose waters feed {{the large and}} almost centrally located wetlands. As humans preferably settle in these fertile and easily accessible central lowlands, major transformations and widespread cultivation through wet-rice agriculture have over the centuries shaped the landscape into distinctive regional cultivated lands. Domestic plants, such as sugar palms, Coconut trees and <b>banana</b> <b>groves</b> almost exclusively skirt extensive rice paddies, as natural vegetation is confined to elevated lands and near waterways. The Mekong traverses the north to south-east portions of the country, where the low-lying plains extend into Vietnam and reach the South China Sea at the Mekong Delta region.|$|R
50|$|The most {{extensively}} grown agricultural {{crops are}} corn and beans. Those {{who live in}} the dry lowland areas like Zare, Bura Station(Ng'ambwa) and Mwashuma grow millet, as it is drought resistant and does well in poor soil. Rice is grown in swampy areas like Barawa and Nyolo. On the cool hillsides like Bura Mission, Saghaighu, Tungulu, Mlambenyi and Dawida one finds <b>banana</b> <b>groves.</b> Those who are able to irrigate their land produce most of the vegetables grown in the area. These crops include tomato, cabbage and green pepper and they are marketed primarily in Mombasa. Other small-scale crops include cassava, sweet potato, citrus, pea, mango and sugar cane. Most farmers cannot afford farm machinery. They farm with hoes and hands.|$|R
