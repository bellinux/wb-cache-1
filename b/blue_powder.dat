5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} <b>blue</b> <b>powder</b> that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{carte blanche}} to choose his own education, in 1758 Fox {{attended}} a fashionable Wandsworth school {{run by a}} Monsieur Pampellonne, followed by Eton College, where he began to develop his lifelong love of classical literature. In later life he was said always to have carried a copy of Horace in his coat pocket. He {{was taken out of}} school by his father in 1761 to attend the coronation of George III, who would become one of his most bitter enemies, and once more in 1763 to visit the Continent; to Paris and Spa. On this trip, Charles was given a substantial amount of money with which to learn to gamble by his father, who also arranged for him to lose his virginity, aged fourteen, to a Madame de Quallens. Fox returned to Eton later that year, [...] "attired in red-heeled shoes and Paris cut-velvet, adorned with a pigeon-wing hair style tinted with <b>blue</b> <b>powder,</b> and a newly acquired French accent", and was duly flogged by Dr. Barnard, the headmaster. These three pursuits – gambling, womanising and the love of things and fashions foreign – would become, once inculcated in his adolescence, notorious habits of Fox’s later life.|$|E

60|$|On {{the stove}} {{was a small}} bowl of {{polished}} brass in which water was kept {{in order to give}} a certain moisture to the air. Oliver Haddo put his hand in his pocket and drew out a little silver box. He tapped it, with a smile, as a man taps a snuff-box, and it opened. He took an infinitesimal quantity of a <b>blue</b> <b>powder</b> that it contained and threw it on the water in the brass bowl. Immediately a bright flame sprang up, and Margaret gave a cry of alarm. Oliver looked at her quickly and motioned her to remain still. She saw that the water was on fire. It was burning as brilliantly, as hotly, as if it were common gas; and it burned with the same dry, hoarse roar. Suddenly it was extinguished. She leaned forward and saw that the bowl was empty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Activated carbon was {{prepared}} from <b>blue</b> coke <b>powder</b> by physical activation. The {{results show that}} the specific surface area (BET) is 697. 05 m 2 /g, the total pore volume is 0. 4569 cm 3 /g and the average pore size is 2. 6221 nm. The adsorption properties of Cr () onto <b>blue</b> coke <b>powder</b> activated carbon are discussed from the kinetics and thermodynamics viewpoints. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model shows the best correlation with experimental data. Langmuir and Freundlich models are used to fit the equilibrium, and it is indicated that Freundlich best fits these data.
