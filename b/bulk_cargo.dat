5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo,</b> such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|One of the Port of San Diego's two cargo {{facilities}} {{is located in}} Downtown San Diego at the Tenth Avenue Marine Terminal. This terminal has facilities for containers, <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo,</b> and refrigerated and frozen storage, {{so that it can}} handle the import and export of many commodities. In 2009 the Port of San Diego handled 1,137,054 short tons of total trade; foreign trade accounted for 956,637 short tons while domestic trade amounted to 180,417 short tons.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935. It is historically {{important as a}} transitional canal barge and {{as one of the}} few surviving wooden-hulled canal boats. It was used to transport <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo,</b> including shipping fertilizer, from Connecticut to Long Island Sound. It sank in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Priscilla Dailey in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. The sunken vessel has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in breaking it apart. The Berkshire No. 7 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E

Funding of €91million was approved on November 20, 2006, consisting of a €58.8million loan from the World Bank, a €11.2million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a provision of €21million by Croatia. By August 2010, €44.2M of the total had been spent, and the new container terminal was opened.|$|E
5|$|Priscilla Dailey, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Elizabeth E. Newell, is a wooden canal boat constructed in 1929 in Whitehall, New York. The barge was used to transport <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut harbors. It sunk in 1974 along with the Elmer S.

5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to move a <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along {{with the type of}} cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo.</b> The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Further {{investments}} beyond {{construction of}} the new terminal were planned since 2007 for <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> terminal equipment worth €80M, cargo terminal equipment worth €11million, replacement of equipment in pre-2007 port facilities valued at €26million and re{{construction of the}} liquid cargo terminal worth €70million. These investments were originally scheduled for 20072014, but the pace of development is slower than expected, and delays of a year to two had been observed by 2010. The required superstructure is planned to be funded through build-operate-transfer contracts and public–private partnerships. The investments made since 2007 and those planned as of 2011 are aimed at increasing the port's throughput from 8 to 10million tonnes of cargo per year.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Ploče Authority was {{established}} by the Government of Croatia on February 13, 1997, to oversee construction, maintenance, administration, protection and promotion of the Port of Ploče. Since 1998, the general and <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> operations of the port have been operated by Luka Ploče d.d. and development has resumed. In 2009, after negotiations with the Port of Ploče Authority, Luka Ploče was granted a 32-year extension of the concession contract for the cargo handling operations of the port. The contract requires the port authority to improve port infrastructure and Luka Ploče to invest in new cargo handling equipment. The Croatian government considers the Port of Ploče {{to be one of}} six seaports of national interest.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II and the Paris Peace Treaties, Rijeka {{became a}} part of Croatia and Yugoslavia. This {{provided}} the Port of Rijeka with a new market and sparked further development. A <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> terminal was completed in 1967, followed by warehouses in Škrljevo in 1978. In 1979, a container terminal in Sušak, a phosphate terminal in Rijeka and a timber terminal in Bršica were added. Joining them were a livestock terminal in Bršica and a general cargo terminal with a roll-on/roll-off ramp in the Bakar area in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The greatest volume of cargo was recorded in 1980, when 20.2million tonnes, including 13.1million tonnes of liquid cargo, were transported. The port suffered another period of stagnation in the 1990s due to the Croatian War of Independence, when a portion of the port's shipping switched to Trieste and Koper. Since 1996, the volume of operations of the Port of Rijeka has again been gradually growing.|$|E
5000|$|Open Hatch General Cargo, {{abbreviated}} OHGC), is a ship {{designed to}} transport forest products, <b>Bulk</b> <b>cargos,</b> unitized cargoes, project cargoes and containers. The vessel is typically fitted with two Gantry cranes for self-loading and unloading, with a typical SWL (safe working load) between 30 and 80 tons. Different equipment {{is connected to}} the gantry crane depending on cargo type as vacuum clamps for paper, unihook for unitised cargo, container frame and grab for <b>bulk</b> <b>cargoes.</b> Cargo holds are box shaped to fit containers and some holds can be equipped with tweendecks to improve flexibility of cargo mixture in same hold.

5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The port of Rijeka is {{the largest}} port in Croatia, {{handling}} the largest portion of the country's imports and exports. In 2008, 2418 ships docked at Rijeka itself, 872 at Bršica, 818 at Bakar, and 268 at Omišalj—a total of 4376. In 2010, the Port of Rijeka transported 10.2million tonnes of cargo, a 9% drop from 2009. However the figure represents a 69% increase of dry cargo transport volume compared to 2002. The 2010 figure includes 5.6million tonnes of liquid cargo, 2.3million tonnes of general cargo, 2.0million tonnes of <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> and 254,000 tonnes of timber. The container terminal recorded a substantial growth of business in past years. 137,048 TEUs were transported through the port in 2010, marking a 5% rise in turnover compared to 2009 and a ninefold increase over 2002. The Port of Rijeka also serves passenger and ferry lines operated by Jadrolinija to the nearby islands of Cres, Mali Lošinj, Susak, Ilovik, Unije, Rab and Pag, {{as well as to}} Adriatic ports further south, such as Split and Dubrovnik. The line to Split and Dubrovnik also serves the islands of Hvar, Korčula and Mljet. The passenger terminal serves approximately 200,000 passengers each year.
