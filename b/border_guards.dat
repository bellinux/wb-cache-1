5000|$|The Estonian <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> (Eesti Piirivalve) is the Estonian {{security}} authority {{responsible for the}} border security. It is a military organization, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior. The <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> also assists with Search and Rescue missions. The <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Flight Squadron (Piirivalvelennusalk) provides air support to the Estonian <b>Border</b> <b>Guard.</b> It is based at the Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport. Most <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> posts have helipads.|$|R

Reserve officers for all Sissi troops are trained at Reserviupseerikoulu. Rivalry between Sissi-troops in different services is traditionally high.|$|R
50|$|While {{volunteer}}s {{are nothing new}} to the Israel <b>Border</b> <b>Guard,</b> what makes the Yechidat Shai <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> unit unique {{is that it is}} the first ever all volunteer <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> unit in Jerusalem.|$|R
5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing <b>border</b> <b>guards.</b> Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> were unable to contact their superiors for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Later in the day, 19 KLA {{fighters were}} wounded when the VJ shelled an arms {{smuggling}} route {{near the site}} of the ambush. They were evacuated by Albanian <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of the mortar rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further tension between the two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav border patrol, wounding another soldier.|$|E
50|$|The <b>border</b> <b>guard's</b> {{active duty}} {{personnel}} consists of 3,800 men and women. The Finnish <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> has also 500 conscripts {{who are not}} used for border control during peace time. Upon mobilisation the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> would be wholly or partly incorporated into the Finnish Defence Forces and its strength increased with reservists who have served their conscription in the <b>border</b> <b>guard.</b> The mobilized strength of the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> is 12 600 servicemen. The Finnish-Russian border is actively monitored and patrolled by the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard.</b> The western sea borders and the western and northern land borders to Sweden and Norway are free to cross under the Nordic passport union, however the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> does maintain personnel in these regions owing to its SAR duties.|$|R
50|$|The State <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> (Valsts Robežsardze) is the <b>border</b> <b>guard</b> of Latvia.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard,</b> the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> {{headquarters}} has {{the same}} internal law enforcement authority as the Defence Command in the Defence Forces, {{in addition to the}} regular law enforcement powers of the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard.</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 14, while the Lithuanian {{government}} was discussing the ultimatum, Soviet soldiers began actions at the border. They fired shots at a border post near Alytus and killed policeman Aleksas Barauskas. At other points the Soviets interrogated Lithuanian <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> and harassed civilians, hoping to provoke a retaliation that {{would serve as a}} rationale for a full-scale military attack.|$|E
5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular <b>border</b> <b>guards,</b> between 1968 and 1985, to weed out {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to pilgrims, merchants often used the safe route across Hungary when travelling between Constantinople and Western Europe. Stephen's legends refer to 60 wealthy Pechenegs who travelled to Hungary, but {{were attacked by}} Hungarian <b>border</b> <b>guards.</b> The king sentenced his soldiers to death in order to demonstrate his determination to preserve internal peace. Regular minting of coinage began in Hungary in the 1020s. Stephen's silver dinars bearing the inscriptions STEPHANUS REX ("King Stephen") and REGIA CIVITAS ("royal city") were popular in contemporary Europe, as demonstrated by counterfeited copies unearthed in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> also deploys a {{large number}} of {{volunteer}} servicemen. These volunteer <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> members enlist as volunteers and serve in regular <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> units. The <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> relies on the volunteer soldiers in order to reinforce their manpower and help maintain the country's heavy security needs. The volunteer <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> are given special attention in sensitive places like Jerusalem where security threats are the highest and at times can double or even triple the manpower of full-time security forces in a given area.|$|R
50|$|The State <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Service is the {{organisation}} charged with controlling and maintaining the Lithuanian Border. The State <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Service falls under authority of the Ministry of the Interior, which supervises and controls the implementation of <b>border</b> <b>guard</b> policy.|$|R
50|$|Administrative {{units are}} {{responsible}} for the functions of the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard.</b> These administrative units are the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Headquarters, Southeast Finland, North Karelia, Kainuu and Lapland <b>border</b> <b>guard</b> districts, the Gulf of Finland and West Finland coast guard districts, Air Patrol Squadron and <b>Border</b> and Coast <b>Guard</b> Academy.|$|R
5|$|Republikflucht {{became a}} crime in 1957, {{punishable}} by heavy fines and up to three years' imprisonment. Any act associated with an escape attempt– including helping an escapee– was subject to this legislation. Those {{caught in the act}} were often tried for espionage as well and given proportionately harsher sentences. More than 75,000people– an average of more than seven people a day– were imprisoned for attempting to escape across the border, serving an average of one to two years' imprisonment. <b>Border</b> <b>guards</b> who attempted to escape were treated much more harshly and were on average imprisoned for five years.|$|E
5|$|The Bundeswehr {{gave the}} {{remaining}} <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> and other ex-NVA soldiers {{the task of}} clearing the fortifications, which was completed only in 1994. The scale of the task was immense, involving both the clearing of the fortifications and the rebuilding of hundreds of roads and railway lines. A serious complication was the presence of mines along the border. Although the 1.4million mines laid by the GDR {{were supposed to have}} been removed during the 1980s, it turned out that 34,000 were unaccounted for. A further 1,100mines were found and removed following reunification at a cost of more than DM250million, in a programme that was not concluded until the end of 1995.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} ways to die on the inner German border. Numerous escapees were shot by the <b>border</b> <b>guards,</b> while others were killed by mines and booby-traps. A {{substantial}} number drowned while trying to cross the Baltic and the Elbe river. Not all of those killed on the border were attempting to escape. On 13October 1961, Westfälische Rundschau journalist Kurt Lichtenstein was shot on the border {{near the village of}} Zicherie after he attempted to speak with East German farm workers. His death aroused condemnation across the political spectrum in West Germany. The incident prompted students from Braunschweig to erect a sign on the border protesting the killing.|$|E
50|$|The {{volunteer}} <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> members {{leave behind}} jobs and families {{on a regular}} basis in order to serve in this special combat unit. Some come from cities like Beit Shemesh, Ofrah, Ashkelon, Ra'anana and even Haifa to serve in the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard.</b> The volunteers receive no pay for serving in the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> units and serve in the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> in their off work hours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{restoration}} of <b>guarding</b> of <b>border</b> of the Republic of Latvia {{was started by}} organising control points at roads and taking over functions from the soviet <b>border</b> <b>guard</b> military units in ports and airports, {{it was based on}} the Latvian Republic Council of Ministers’ decision of 29 January, 1992 “On Ensuring Takeover and Guarding of the State Border of the Republic of Latvia”. [...] By the order of the Minister of Defence of the Republic of Latvia from 1 February, 1922 the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Brigade of Defence Forces of the Defence Ministry was established by uniting 7 border battalions, Riga’s Separate Border Control Points and Vārve’s Training Centre. By the order of Defence Minister of 23 November, 1995 the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Brigade of the National Armed Forces was reorganized into the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Forces. From 7 January, 1997 the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Forces are existing under the subordination of the Ministry of the Interior and staff is employed to serve in the Ministry of the Interior. From 14 February, 1997 the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> Forces were renamed the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> of the Ministry of the Interior. From 1 May, 1998 the <b>Border</b> <b>Guard</b> named the State <b>Border</b> <b>Guard.</b>|$|R

5|$|About 19:00 on 7 April, German {{units in}} regimental {{strength}} {{with a few}} tanks began to cross the Drava near Barcs in the divisional sector. They quickly overcame {{the resistance of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment, which was influenced by Ustaše propaganda. The <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> abandoned their positions and weapons and retreated to Virovitica. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the division had mobilised in Bjelovar and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. That night, Croat members of the regiment revolted, arresting the Serb officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar, where it joined up with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, <b>border</b> <b>guards,</b> and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 23, 1998 a band of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) fighters was ambushed by a much smaller group of Yugoslav Army (VJ) <b>border</b> <b>guards</b> near the Košare outpost, just west of Dečani. The fighters {{had been trying to}} smuggle weapons and {{supplies}} into Kosovo via northern Albania. Nineteen were killed in the ensuing attack, and a further two were captured. The VJ did not sustain any casualties. Some of the militants retreated back to Albania, while others managed to break through the ambush and make it past the Yugoslav border, into Kosovo. Following the clash, the VJ confiscated a large quantity of arms that the militants had been transporting.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Army {{faced the}} Hungarian 3rd Army, {{and during the}} first few days after the {{commencement}} of the invasion, there were exchanges of fire with Hungarian <b>border</b> <b>guards,</b> but the 1st Army faced no direct attacks. Neither the 1st Army or the Hungarians were ready for full-scale fighting, as they were still mobilising and deploying their forces. On 9 April, due to events in other parts of Yugoslavia, the 6th Army on the right flank of the 1st Army was ordered to withdraw south of the Danube and deploy on a line facing east to defend against an attack from the direction of Sofia, Bulgaria. 2nd Army Group also received orders to withdraw south of the line of the Drava and Danube. 1st Army began to withdraw, and on the same day elements were approaching the Danube crossing.|$|E
