25|$|In {{the case}} of a fossil fueled {{cogeneration}} plant, the heat output is typically sized to meet half of the peak heat load <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> will provide 90% of the heat supplied. The boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the cogeneration plant. It is not economic to size the cogeneration plant alone to be able to meet the full heat load. In the New York City steam system, that is around 2.5 GW. Germany has the largest amount of CHP in Europe.|$|R

The fell is often climbed {{as part of the}} Fairfield horseshoe walk but a direct ascent from Patterdale is required to show the fell's full potential, displaying the impressive crags just to the north east of the summit. The highest point was originally unnamed on maps, being just a minor top, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> the summit has adopted the name of Dove Crag by mutual accord..|$|E
25|$|In 1856, Harvard University-educated {{physician}} and Boston Brahmin George Cheyne Shattuck, {{inspired by the}} educational theories of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, turned his country home in the hamlet of Millville, New Hampshire into a school for boys. Shattuck wanted his boys educated in the austere, bucolic countryside. A newly appointed board of trustees chose Henry Coit, a 24-year-old clergyman, to preside over the school for its first 39 years. In addition to Shattuck's two boys and Coit and his wife there was one other student. The original location was 50 acres, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> surrounding lands were acquired.|$|E

When she was nine or ten years old, her grandfather, John Parker, was recruited to settle his family in north-central Texas; he was to establish a settlement fortified against Comanche raids, which had been devastating to the Euro-American colonization of Texas and northern Mexico. The Parker family, its extended kin, and surrounding families established fortified blockhouses and a central citadel—later called Fort Parker—on the headwaters of the Navasota River in what is now Limestone County.|$|E

25|$|Cruyff Courts, smaller sized {{football}} fields suitable for seven-a-side game.

25|$|The {{original}} role of such Mechanic's Institutes was {{to provide}} education for adults who had received little formal education as children. Thus most of the Schools of Arts and Institutes had libraries attached, and in NSW the government provided grants {{for the purchase of}} books. <b>But</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> as the colonial (and later State) governments began to take greater responsibility for public education, this meant the end of most of these philanthropic organisations – a process that sped up when local councils also began to provide free public library facilities. By the 1970s, the SMSA was in financial difficulty with a large heritage building to maintain but a declining membership. It eventually sold its original building to raise capital in 1987 and moved into new premises across the road in 2000.|$|E
25|$|It was Hucklesby's {{dream that}} the house would become a museum that would be 'interesting {{as well as of}} an {{educational}} nature'. Unfortunately, the house itself had been neglected and suffered from dry rot, Luton council could not immediately afford the renovations. It remained empty for several years until it became a military hospital during the First World War. After the war, rooms were let to council employees with a cafe opening on the ground floor. The museum opened in 1930, having moved from the Carnegie library where it started in 1927. At first the museum displays were held in just two rooms, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> it has filled the entire house. The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays from 10am to 5pm and Sundays from 1 to 5pm. Admission is free.|$|E
25|$|After his retirement, Wood stayed {{very active}} in the coaches {{associations}} he had become involved with over the years. He gave an abundant number of speeches and is notable for being one of Grant Teaff's Master Coaches in 2002. Over the years, Wood developed several medical conditions including skin tumors, artificial hips, a stroke, and having triple bypass surgery in 1990. He attempted {{to keep up with}} his hobbies, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> his conditions would no longer allow him to do so. The only hobby Wood would never give up is football. Even after retirement, he would travel across the state to watch high school teams compete on the gridiron. He watched many high school games vigorously until he died in December 2003. Coach Wood suffered from a heart attack and {{died at the age of}} 89.|$|E

25|$|Below {{the level}} of the shire each county was divided into areas known as {{hundreds}} (or wapentakes in the north of England). These were original groups of families rather than geographical areas. The Hundred Court was a smaller version of the shire, presided over by the hundred bailiff, formerly a sheriff's appointment, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> many hundreds fell into the private hands of a local large landowner. We are not well-informed about Hundred Court business, which must have been a mix of the administrative and judicial, but they remained in some areas an important forum for the settlement of local disputes well into the post-Conquest period. The Anglo-Saxon system put an emphasis upon compromise and arbitration: litigating parties were enjoined to settle their differences if at all possible. If they persisted in bringing a case for decision before a Shire Court then it could be determined there. The suitors of the court would pronounce a judgment which fixed how the case would be decided: legal problems were considered to be too complex and difficult for mere human decision and so proof or demonstration of the right would depend upon some irrational, non-human criterion. The normal methods of proof were oath-helping or the ordeal.|$|E
500|$|The Secretary-General is {{appointed}} by the General Assembly, after being recommended by the Security Council, where the permanent members have veto power.

It was one of several exclusive establishments using the name Hellfire Club that existed in Britain and Ireland in the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{people of}} this region {{are said to be}} direct decendents of Aryan race. One unique custom which is {{followed}} here is the concept of bride price. The custom owes its origin to some strong logic. The parents spend a substantial amount on raising, educating and making the life of the girl as good as they can make it. In return the girl is an asset to the family as she cooks, cleans, works on the farms etc. When a boy wants to marry the girl, he is taking away an asset of the family and must pay the fair price of the asset known as <b>the</b> bride price. <b>But</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> this practice is followed by a few masses.|$|R
50|$|Samsung even {{announced}} in late 2006 that by 2008 {{it would put}} such a device into production at the 40 nm process node, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> five <b>years</b> following this announcement many device designers found ways to push the cap structure to increasingly tighter process geometries, successfully producing NAND down to 20 nm node with this approach.|$|R
