5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, was <b>born</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, {{rose from the}} dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
