40|$|Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) {{is widely}} used to model {{sequential}} decision making process under uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of the environment. It requires strong computation capability and is thus usually deployed on powerful machine. However, as mobile platforms become more advanced and more popular, the potential has been studied to combine POMDP and mobile {{in order to provide}} a broader range of services. And yet a question comes with this trend: how should we implement POMDP on mobile platform so that we can take advantages of mobile features {{while at the same time}} avoid being restricted by mobile limitations, such as short battery life, weak CPU, unstable networking connection, and other limited resources. In response to the above question, we first point out that the cases vary by problem nature, accuracy requirements and mobile device models. Rather than pure mathematical analysis, our approach is to run experiments on a mobile device and concentrate on a more specific question: which POMDP implementation is the ``best'' for a particular problem on a particular kind of device. Second, we propose and justify a POMDP implementation criterion mainly based on battery consumption that quantifies ``goodness'' of POMDP implementations in terms of mobile <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate.</b> Then, we present a mobile battery consumption model that translates CPU and WIFI usage into part of the <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate</b> in order to greatly accelerate the experiment process. With our mobile battery consumption model, we combine a set of simple benchmark experiments with CPU and WIFI usage data from each POMDP implementation candidate to generate estimated <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rates,</b> as opposed to conducting hours of real battery experiments for each implementation individually. The final result is a ranking of POMDP implementations based on their estimated <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rates.</b> It serves as a guidance for on POMDP implementation selection for mobile developers. We develop a mobile software toolkit to automate the above process. Given basic POMDP problem specifications, a set of POMDP implementation candidates and a simple press on the ``start'' button, the toolkit automatically performs benchmark experiments on the target device on which it is installed, and records CPU and WIFI statistics for each POMDP implementation candidate. It then feeds the data to its embedded mobile battery consumption model and produces an estimated <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate</b> for each candidate. Finally, the toolkit visualizes the ranking of POMDP implementations for mobile developers' reference. Evaluation is assessed through comparsion between the ranking from estimated <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate</b> and that from real experimental <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate.</b> We observe the same ranking out of both, which is also our expectation. What's more, the similarity between estimated <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate</b> and experimental <b>battery</b> depletion <b>rate</b> measured by cosine-similarity is almost 0. 999 where 1 indicates they are exactly the same...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith the {{increasing}} number of domestic PV (photovoltaic) installations connected to battery energy storage systems for self-supply purposes in Germany, new research topics such as the sizing of the required system components have emerged. In this paper, the impact of the <b>rated</b> <b>battery</b> converter power on the utilization of PV-attached battery systems in residential buildings is discussed. First, the ratio between the <b>battery</b> converter <b>rating</b> and the storage capacity is analyzed for a variety of residential battery systems available on the market. Thereafter, simulations with a temporal resolution of 1 s are performed in order to identify how the <b>rated</b> <b>battery</b> converter power affects the energy throughput of the battery system taking account of the characteristic conversion efficiency curves. The results show that battery converter sizes in the range of 4 to 5 kW are optimal in terms of maximum discharged energy for the most system configurations under study. However, <b>battery</b> converters <b>rated</b> between 30 to 50 % of the optimal power rating are sufficient to provide more than 95 % of the maximum dischargeable energy from the battery system. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that small-sized <b>battery</b> converters <b>rated</b> at 1. 5 to 2 kW are sufficient for residential self consumption applications...|$|R
