30|$|When {{the ball}} is traversed through the points, some holes are {{generated}} in the triangulated mesh, either {{due to the lack}} of points, or lack of oriented normals in the point cloud. These holes in the generated mesh are filled up by creating triangles joining the boundary edges of the holes. As BPA algorithm strongly follows the 3 D points in the point cloud, presence of noise has a significant impact on the reconstructed surface. Noise handling can be done by using adaptive ball radius during the <b>ball</b> <b>pivot</b> reconstruction. BPA algorithm is data-driven, and it usually takes a longer time to generate 3 D surface than Poisson reconstruction algorithm.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCreating an interpolating mesh from an unorganized set of {{oriented}} {{points is}} a difficult problem which is often overlooked. Most methods focus indeed on building a watertight smoothed mesh by defining some function whose zero level set is {{the surface of the}} object. However in some cases it is crucial to build a mesh that interpolates the points and does not fill the acquisition holes: either because the data are sparse and trying to fill the holes would create spurious artifacts or because the goal is to explore visually the data exactly as they were acquired without any smoothing process. In this paper we detail a parallel implementation of the Scale-Space Meshing algorithm, which builds on the scale-space framework for reconstructing a high precision mesh from an input oriented point set. This algorithm first smoothes the point set, producing a singularity free shape. It then uses a standard mesh reconstruction technique, the <b>Ball</b> <b>Pivoting</b> Algorithm, to build a mesh from the smoothed point set. The final step consists in back-projecting the mesh built on the smoothed positions onto the original point set. The result of this process is an interpolating, hole-preserving surface mesh reconstruction. Source Code The ANSI C++ source code permitting to reproduce results from the on-line demo is available at the IPOL web page of this article 1.

It was also cheaper to build than a rocker shaft; this Pontiac-patented technology was immediately handed to the Chevrolet division for their first postwar V-8, which appeared the same year.

40|$|Consider an {{algorithm}} {{for generating}} a triangle mesh interpolating a fixed set of 3 D point samples, where the generated triangle set {{varies depending on}} some underlying parameters. In this paper we treat such an algorithm {{as a means of}} sampling the space of possible interpolant meshes, and then define a more robust algorithm based on drawing multiple such samples from this process and averaging them. As mesh connectivity graphs cannot be trivially averaged, we compute triangle statistics and then attempt to find a set of compatible triangles which maximize agreement between the sample meshes while also forming a manifold mesh. Essentially, each sample mesh “votes ” for triangles, and hence we call our result a consensus mesh. Finding the optimal consensus mesh is combinatorially intractable, so we present an efficient greedy algorithm. We apply this strategy to two mesh generation processes- <b>ball</b> <b>pivoting</b> and localized tangent-space Delaunay triangulations. We then demonstrate that consensus meshing enables a generic decomposition of the meshing problem which supports trivial parallelization. 1...|$|R

Players are entitled to balance {{on the other foot}} if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called stepping or travelling , as in the similar rule in basketball. Consequently, the only way to move the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a teammate. The ball can be held by a player for less than three seconds at any time. A player may tap or deflect the ball, let it bounce and then take possession and throw it. The player cannot catch the ball with both hands, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.|$|R

However, the critical area of marine structures remains insufficiently studied. The research presented here focuses on the problem of 3 -D surface reconstruction in the marine environment. This paper summarizes our hardware, software, and experimental contributions on surface reconstruction {{over the past few years}} (2008 – 2011). We propose the use of off-the-shelf sensors and a robotic platform to scan marine structures both above and below the waterline, and we develop a method and software system that uses the <b>Ball</b> <b>Pivoting</b> Algorithm (BPA) and the Poisson reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct 3 -D surface models of marine structures from the scanned data. We have tested our hardware and software systems extensively in Singapore waters, including operating in rough waters, where water currents are around 1 – 2 m/s. We present results on construction of various 3 -D models of marine structures, including slowly moving structures such as floating platforms, moving boats, and stationary jetties.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{reconstruction}} {{of a tree}} canopy {{is an important step}} in order to measure canopy geometry, such as height, width, volume, and leaf cover area. In this research, binocular stereo vision was used to recover the 3 D information of the canopy. Multiple images were taken from different views around the target. The Structure-from-motion (SfM) method was employed to recover the camera calibration matrix for each image, and the corresponding 3 D coordinates of the feature points were calculated and used to recover the camera calibration matrix. Through this method, a sparse projective {{reconstruction of}} the target was realized. Subsequently, a <b>ball</b> <b>pivoting</b> algorithm was used to do surface modeling to realize dense reconstruction. Finally, this dense reconstruction was transformed to metric reconstruction through ground truth points which were obtained from camera calibration of binocular stereo cameras. Four experiments were completed, one for a known geometric box, and the other three were: a croton plant with big leaves and salient features, a jalapeno pepper plant with median leaves, and a lemon tree with small leaves.

40|$|Surface {{reconstruction}} for freehand 3 D ultrasound is used {{to provide}} 3 D visualization of a VOI (volume of interest) during image-guided tumor ablation surgery. This is a challenge because the recorded 2 D B-scans are not only sparse but also non-parallel. To solve this issue, we established a framework to reconstruct the surface of freehand 3 D ultrasound imaging in 2011. The key technique for surface reconstruction in that framework is based on variational interpolation presented by Greg Turk for shape transformation and is named Variational Surface Reconstruction (VSR). The main goal {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the quality of surface reconstructions, especially when the input data are extremely sparse point clouds from freehand 3 D ultrasound imaging, using four methods: <b>Ball</b> <b>Pivoting,</b> Power Crust, Poisson, and VSR. Four experiments are conducted, and quantitative metrics, such as the Hausdorff distance, are introduced for quantitative assessment. The experiment results show that the performance of the proposed VSR method is the best of the four methods at reconstructing surface from sparse data. The VSR method can produce a close approximation to the original surface from as few as two contours, whereas the other three methods fail to do so. The experiment results also illustrate that the reproducibility of the VSR method is the best of the four methods...|$|R

30|$|Ball radius The most {{important}} parameter of BPA is ball radius (ρ). The algorithm is {{very sensitive to}} changes in ball radius. Using a very small radius makes the model susceptible to input noise. Using large ball radius results in loss of details in the model and holes are generated in the surface. The 3 D surface generated using a ball of radius ρ can’t handle a surface curvature larger than 1 /ρ. This is because, the <b>pivoting</b> <b>ball</b> can’t reach the region where the curvature is higher than 1 /ρ. In case of noisy data, slightly larger ball radius is encouraged, as it tends to cancel out the noise effect in the point cloud.|$|R

Controllable part is compensated by partial pole assignment in the inner loop. Prediction observer is designed for unmeasured states in the inner loop.

5000|$|A stride is {{performed}} {{from the beginning}} stance by rocking back, shifting the weight back to gain momentum and then moving the weight forward onto the <b>ball</b> of the <b>pivot</b> foot. The pitcher then pushes off the rubber with the pivot foot, pivoting that foot in a 30 to 40 degree, clockwise angle as the opposite leg moves out into a stride. The stride leg must land along the [...] "power line," [...] {{which means that the}} pitcher’s body is in line with the plate, with the pitcher’s hips facing the third base line. The angle of a pitch can be altered in different ways through the stride. If the pitcher is aiming for the outside corner of the plate, the pitcher will pivot, stride with the opposite foot, and land slightly outside of the “power line”; if the inside corner is aimed, the pitcher will land slightly inside. If the movement is very subtle, the batter will probably not be able to notice the change of angle. In most leagues during the pitcher's delivery, the pivot foot must drag along the ground in order for the pitch to be legal. If the drag foot lifts off the ground, an illegal pitch will be called for crow hopping. In this case, the batter is awarded with one ball to the count, and all base runners advance to the next base. In international play - and in most men's leagues - the pitcher is allowed to jump with the pivot foot. A crow hop here is considered legal.|$|R
