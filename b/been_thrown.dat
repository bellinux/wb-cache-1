5|$|A fair {{catch is}} a catch from any player {{provided}} the ball has not touched {{the ground or}} has not <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> from touch and is entitled to a free-kick.|$|E
5|$|They are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{and sometimes}} eat carrion, making them {{one of the}} few snakes to do so. Campbell and Lamar (2004) described having seen them feeding on fish heads and viscera that had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the water from a dock. Heinrich and Studenroth (1996) reported an occasion in which an individual was seen feeding on the butchered remains of a feral hog (Sus scrofa) that had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into Cypress Creek.|$|E
5|$|As in {{previous}} years, the spectators tried to assist their preferred riders {{by trying to}} impede their opponents. On the first stage, nails had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> on the road, and all cyclists except Lucien Petit-Breton punctured. This stage was won by Emile Georget in a sprint.|$|E
50|$|Reverse tennis {{is where}} one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> inside {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> over.|$|R
50|$|A ball can <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> {{backwards}} on a quick throw-in {{rather than}} having to <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> straight.|$|R
5000|$|Doubled pieces {{may move}} {{half the number}} if an even number <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> (e.g. move two spaces if a 4 <b>is</b> <b>thrown).</b>|$|R
5|$|During the launch, Launch Pad 39A {{sustained}} substantial damage, {{more than}} had been seen on any previous launch. Following liftoff, inspectors discovered that bricks and mortar from the launch pad's base had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> {{as far as the}} perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457m).|$|E
5|$|Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and {{included}} jetties to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, {{rather than being}} thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, where it had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{assigned}} Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. On April 5 Seward had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> {{from his}} carriage, suffering a concussion, a broken jaw, {{and a broken}} arm. On {{the night of the}} assassination he was confined to bed at his home in Lafayette Park. Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy and popular gun during the Civil War) and a Bowie knife.|$|E
5000|$|Many tricks or {{patterns}} are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> over (reverse) {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> under (inside). One juggles, [...] "a cascade with two balls while the 'tennis' ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{and forth over the}} top." ...|$|R
5000|$|Return boomerangs have a flat {{convex surface}} that must <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> upright {{with a sharp}} flick of the wrist, but <b>throwing</b> sticks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> horizontally.|$|R
5000|$|The next toss is a 3, which <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{under the}} arm {{by the second}} hand on the side {{opposite}} to where the 5 <b>was</b> <b>thrown.</b>|$|R
5|$|Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) lies unconscious, having <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> {{from her}} car after it plunged over a ravine. Steph Sims (Tonicha Lawrence) watches {{down from the}} top of the cliff before driving off. A few minutes later she calls for an ambulance, but is hit by a car before she can. As Connie regains consciousness, she notices Grace Beauchamp's (Emily Carey) shoe in the car. Flames begin erupting from the vehicle. Connie moves towards the car but before she can get to Grace it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits {{the fact that his}} son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward {{ride the}} wave {{and they see}} Mr. Krabs. He jumps up onto the board and drops Cashie into the ocean, so Jack Kahuna Laguna goes to {{retrieve}} it and acts as the sacrifice. SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are seen flying on the surfboard and approach Goo Lagoon. Sandy's helicopter crash-lands in Goo Lagoon. A welcome home party has <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> for SpongeBob, and Jack Kahuna Laguna returns with Cashie, which he returns to Mr. Krabs.|$|E
50|$|In ancient Rome, {{executed}} criminals <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{into the}} Tiber. People executed at the Gemonian stairs <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in the Tiber during the later {{part of the}} reign of the emperor Tiberius. This practice continued over the centuries. For example, the corpse of Pope Formosus <b>was</b> <b>thrown</b> into the Tiber after the infamous Cadaver Synod held in 897.|$|R

50|$|Eight no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> {{by major}} league {{pitchers}} in the 1884 season. In {{the modern era}} (since 1901), seven no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in 1990, 1991, 2012, and 2015.|$|R
5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where {{the bulk of the}} wreckage landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, a number of them intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the tail section of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Richard's corpse {{was taken}} to Leicester and buried without pomp. His {{original}} tomb monument {{is believed to have}} been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were lost for more than five centuries, believed to have <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by the Richard III Society on a city council car park on the site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory Church. The University of Leicester identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. Richard's remains were reburied in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E
5|$|After the {{monument}} was discovered and {{identified in the}} twentieth century, a folk motif came {{to be associated with}} it. According to this story, the circle's stones had landed in their location after having been hurled at Corfe Castle by the Devil. This is a variant of a story that has also been connected to the Agglestone Rock near Studland. According to stories associated with this large sandstone block, it had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> by the Devil from The Needles on the Isle of Wight, with the intention of hitting either the castle, Sherborne Abbey, Bindon Abbey, or Salisbury Cathedral.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{example of}} the {{discrete}} uniform distribution <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> a fair die. The possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and each time the die <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> {{the probability of a}} given score is 1/6. If two dice <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and their values added, the resulting distribution is no longer uniform since not all sums have equal probability.|$|R
50|$|Many tricks or {{patterns}} are generated from mixing cascade and reverse cascade throws. For example, tennis (siteswap: 3) one ball <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> over (reverse) {{while the other}} two <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> under (inside).|$|R
5|$|Autopsies showed {{all three}} victims had water in their lungs, proving they had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> {{into the water}} while still alive. Michelleidentified as the second body foundhad freed one hand from her bonds before she drowned. The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around their necks with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected by the force of the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R
50|$|In , {{the balls}} <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> underhand (palm up) and rarely they <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> {{overhand}} (palm under), and are metal. In standard , the wooden or plastic balls are tossed underhand (palm up) and rolled.|$|R
5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744". Each digit represents the number of throws that occur {{by the time that}} same prop will be caught. For example, [...] "333" [...] represents a common three-ball cascade, where three props <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> before the same prop will <b>be</b> caught and <b>thrown</b> again. Within the [...] "531531" [...] pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' <b>throw,</b> will not <b>be</b> caught until five <b>throws</b> have <b>been</b> made, including itself, where it will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with a '1' <b>throw,</b> which <b>is</b> a direct pass to the other hand and will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the very next throw as a '5'.|$|R
5|$|Having {{reached a}} hill behind his army's {{original}} position, Alexios began to regroup his army from the units that had broken. He sent out messengers to rally his scattered men with news that Bryennios had been killed, showing his parade horse as evidence. At the same time, the promised Turkish reinforcements began {{arriving at the}} scene, lifting his men's morale. All the while, on the battlefield, Bryennios's army had closed around Alexios's Franks, who dismounted and offered to surrender. In the process the rebel army had become totally disordered, with units mixed and their formations disordered. Bryennios's reserves had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> in confusion by the Pecheneg attack, while his front lines relaxed, thinking that the battle was over.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tunnel}} after the match tempers boiled over between staff of both clubs. A slice of pizza had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> at Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson by Cesc Fàbregas, which was {{initially}} unconfirmed until 13 {{years after the}} incident. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was furious in his post-match briefing, criticising Riley for his performance and describing Van Nistelrooy as a cheat. His comments were investigated by the Football Association, who later fined him £15,000 for improper conduct. Van Nistelrooy was retroactively banned for three matches as his challenge on Cole was missed by Riley.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had <b>been</b> <b>thrown</b> after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5000|$|Six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown.</b> They <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> by Ubaldo Jiménez (April 17), Dallas Braden (May 9), Roy Halladay (May 29), Edwin Jackson (June 25), Matt Garza (July 26), and Halladay again, {{this time}} in Game 1 of the NLDS. It was only {{the third time in}} major league history that at least six no-hitters <b>were</b> <b>thrown</b> in a single season. Braden's no-hitter and Halladay's first were both perfect games.|$|R
50|$|Back in the office, the {{reporter}} is desperate {{to know who}} <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the cream pies. Dunkfeather confesses that he <b>was</b> <b>throwing</b> the pies; however, this claim is compromised when, out of nowhere, a pie flies into his face.|$|R
