5|$|Meteos is a 2005 puzzle {{video game}} {{developed}} by Q Entertainment {{and published by}} Bandai and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. The game was released in Japan, North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia in 2005. In Meteos, the player moves colored blocks (meteos), launching three or more <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same color onto {{the top of the}} screen. Q Entertainment founder Tetsuya Mizuguchi produced the game, and Masahiro Sakurai was its designer. Meteos was inspired by the video game Missile Command (1980), the TV series 24 (2001-2010), and the film The Matrix (1999).|$|E

5|$|At dawn on {{the third}} day, ukukus grouped by {{moieties}} climb the glaciers on Qullqipunku to retrieve crosses set on top. Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable of dealing with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to oral traditions, ukukus from different moieties used to engage in ritual battles on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E
5|$|Infamous (stylized as inFAMOUS) is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Sucker Punch Productions {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3. The game was released in North America on May 26, 2009, in Europe on May 29, 2009, in Australia on June 4, 2009 and in Japan on November 5, 2009. In Infamous, the player controls the protagonist Cole MacGrath, a bike messenger caught {{in the center of}} an explosion that devastates several city <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fictional Empire City. The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity-based super powers. Though the game's story follows Cole using his new abilities to restore some semblance of order to Empire City, the player is given several opportunities to use these powers for good or evil purposes in the game's Karma system. These choices ultimately affect character growth, the reaction of the City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story.|$|E
5|$|NY174 {{has also}} had several minor realignments. After Route5 was realigned onto a new {{expressway}} from Camillus to Fairmount, NY174 was extended on its northern end to meet {{the west end of}} the bypass in Camillus. The new alignment makes a sharp hook west along the former Route5. NY174 has also been relocated onto a southeastern bypass around the village of Marcellus that also carries Route175. Originally, NY174 and175 entered the village along South Street. The routes were realigned to the bypass between 1976 and 1989. NY174 now enters downtown Marcellus using several <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historic Seneca Turnpike between the old and new alignments. This section of the route is maintained by Onondaga County as CR41. The former South Street alignment has been redesignated as CR83.|$|E

5|$|Past Alabama, NY63 {{continues}} northward {{across the}} Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge and into Orleans County. It traverses open, undeveloped {{areas of the}} town of Shelby to reach the village of Medina. This village begins at a junction with NY31 and NY31A. The latter highway continues eastward while the former joins NY63 through the village's historic central district on Main Street. At Center Street, NY31E comes in from the west and NY31 leaves NY63 to continue east. NY63 continues northwest on Main and Commercial streets {{to the edge of the}} village, where it turns northward onto Prospect Avenue and subsequently crosses over the Erie Canal. The northernmost two <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlap with NY31 are maintained by the village of Medina, as are the two blocks of Main Street leading away from the north end of the concurrency. This is the only segment of NY63 not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).|$|E
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|Sited {{adjacent}} to Housing and Development Board apartment <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building {{could be seen}} as an attempt to engage the wider community. The activities of the community building were planned to overlap and to coalesce, as a one-stop destination for the entire family. The rich congruence of the multiple programmes for the building is expressed architecturally as a collage of diverse elements. The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity of materials and forms.|$|E

5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system {{and all other}} units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced {{the concept of a}} coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the demand}} for {{education}} rose, especially for high school education. There was also a rising need to cater to {{students enrolled in the}} elementary schools affiliated to the Hokkien Hway Kuan. Thus, Nan Chiau Teachers' Training College was converted into a girls' high school, featuring a primary school section. Mr Yang Zhen Li was the first Principal of the institution, which had an initial student enrollment of 900. A female hostel was also built in the 1950s. By the 1960s, Nan Chiau Girls' High had gained {{reputation as one of the}} state's top high schools. In 1965, 2 million dollars was spent by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan to rebuild Nan Chiau Girl's High School to meet the needs of an increased student enrollment. During the re-construction, the high school section conducted lessons at a temporary campus at Guillemard Road, whilst the primary school section continued lessons at the unaffected classroom <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kim Yam Road campus. The new campus was officially opened by then Minister for Education Mr. Ong Pang Boon, on 8 March 1969.|$|E

5|$|Alongside the fatalities, {{the floods}} left several <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town without power. Water lines, bridges, and other {{infrastructure}} sustained {{varying degrees of}} damage. Several homes sustained water and mud damage. Total losses in Washington County reached $750,000. Flooding continued downstream into Arizona, rendering multiple roads impassible and damaging bridges around Colorado City; losses in the city amounted to $500,000. Around 150federal personnel and 500community volunteers, including 70–80percent of Hildale's residents, conducted search and rescue in the immediate aftermath. Twenty-four members of Utah Task Force One and twenty-six personnel from the Utah National Guard were dispatched to Hildale to assist in search and rescue along Short Creek. Dangerous conditions along the creek slowed the operation. By September17, 300personnel were searching for a 6-year-old boy who was still missing. Ultimately, thousands of people from more than 60agencies {{took part in the}} search for the final victim; efforts were called off by September29 and the missing boy was presumed dead. Local residents continued periodic searches for the boy through December. The Utah Department of Public Safety granted the Public Safety Award to Washington County Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, Hildale Mayor Philip Barlow and, Hildale Marshall’s Office Chief Jeremiah Darger for their response coordination. Following the floods, the Washington County allocated $1.6million through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for repair costs and mitigation efforts for future floods. Of this total, $1.5million went to Hildale. The United States Department of Agriculture also provided $100,000 through the Emergency Watershed Protection program.|$|E
5|$|From left {{to right}} across the four <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long- or 32-column form of the {{periodic}} table {{are a series of}} linking or bridging groups of elements, located approximately between each block. These groups, like the metalloids, show properties in between, or that are a mixture of, groups to either side. Chemically, the group 3 elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium behave largely like the alkaline earth metals or, more generally, s block metals but have some of the physical properties of d block transition metals. Lutetium and lawrencium, {{at the end of the}} end of the f block, may constitute another linking or bridging group. Lutetium behaves chemically as a lanthanide but shows a mix of lanthanide and transition metal physical properties. Lawrencium, as an analogue of lutetium, would presumable display like characteristics. The coinage metals in group 11 (copper, silver, and gold) are chemically capable of acting as either transition metals or main group metals. The volatile group 12 metals, zinc, cadmium and mercury are sometimes regarded as linking the d block to the p block. Notionally they are d block elements but they have few transition metal properties and are more like their p block neighbors in group 13. The relatively inert noble gases, in group 18, bridge the most reactive groups of elements in the periodic table—the halogens in group 17 and the alkali metals in group 1.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{scientist}} Nicolas Steno (1669) pioneered experimental {{investigations of}} crystal symmetry. Steno {{showed that the}} angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of {{a particular type of}} crystal, and René Just Haüy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Haüy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Schönflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive.|$|E

5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E
