The longitudinal and shear ultrasound velocities, determined by the MBS 8000 system, of both lead <b>bismuth</b> <b>borate</b> and phosphate glasses show decreasing trend as more PbO and Bi 2 O 3 are being added into the glass system.

In order to test this prediction, bismuth-borate (Bi 2 O 3 –ZnO–B 2 O 3) glasses, for which chi(3) increased with increasing Bi 2 O 3 content, were thermally poled and the second-order non-linear coefficient was determined.

Lead and zinc phosphate glasses were found to have a coordination number of four for Pb or Zn and the lead and zinc were both incorporated into the network structure. In ultra low expansion glass the titania was found to be four fold coordinated. Vitreous boron sulphide gives results consistent with borsulphol superstructural units. Diffraction patterns for the <b>bismuth</b> <b>borate</b> glasses suggest an asymmetric B-O bond length distribution for the BO_ 3 triangles and BO_ 4 tetrahedra. The fraction of four fold coordinated boron atoms increases from 0. 35 at 31 Mol. % to 0. 55 at 67 Mol. %. The data are also consistent with the presence of superstructural units. The results for bismuth germanate glass have confirmed that the bismuth atoms are six-fold coordinated but with distorted octahedra. The GeO_ 4 tetrahedra are relatively undistorted. In pressure compacted glasses the main mechanism is the compression of the network cages. In the case of the cesium borate glasses the B-O peak indicates the existence of both three and four coordinated boron. Superstructural units were found to be present even at high Cs_ 2 O contents.

Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopies {{were used for the}} structural characterization. These complementary techniques are sensitive to the short-range order as in the differentiation of tetrahedral and trigonal borate units or regarding the number of non-bridging oxygen ions per unit. Moreover, vibrational spectroscopy is also sensitive to the intermediate-range order and to the presence of superstructural units, such as rings and chains, or the combination of rings. In order to clarify band assignments for the various borate entities, examples are given from pure vitreous B 2 O 3 to meta-, pyro-, ortho-, and even overmodified borate glass compositions. For binary metaborate glasses, the impact of the modifier cation on the borate speciation is shown. High field strength cations such as Zn 2 + enhance the disproportionation of metaborate to polyborate and pyroborate units. Pb 2 + and Bi 3 + induce cluster formation, resulting in PbOn- and BiOn-pseudophases. Both lead and <b>bismuth</b> <b>borate</b> glasses show also a tendency to stabilize very large superstructural units in the form of diborate polyanions. Far-IR spectra reflect on the bonding states of modifier cations in glasses. The frequency of the measured cation-site vibration band was used to obtain the average force constant for the metal-oxygen bonding, FM-O. A linear correlation between glass transition temperature (Tg) and FM-O was shown for the metaborate glass series. The mechanical properties of the glasses also correlate with the force constant FM-O, though for cations of similar force constant the fraction of tetrahedral borate units (N 4) strongly affects the thermal and mechanical properties. For paramagnetic Cu- and Mn-borate glasses, N 4 was determined from the IR spectra after deducing the relative absorption coefficient of boron tetrahedral versus boron trigonal units, α = α 4 /α 3, using NMR literature data of the diamagnetic glasses. © 2016 Author(s) ...|$|E

E) {{in the direction of the}} laser beam polarization and the second with period (Lambda. k) in the direction of the light propagation, are identified from the cross-sectional images of the modified regions using scanning electron microscopy. The period Lambda. E is proportional to the wavelength of the writing laser and the period Lambda. k in the head of the modified region remains approximately the wavelength of light in fused silica. A new phenomenon in ultrafast laser processing of transparent optical materials, in particular silica glass, manifested as a change in material modification by reversing the writing direction, is observed. The effect resembles writing with a quill pen and is interpreted in terms of new physical effect - anisotropic trapping of electron plasma by a tilted front of the ultrashort laser pulse. Different types of modifications are induced in fused silica by controlling the pulse front tilt. Birefringent modification is demonstrated in the chalcogenide glass by femtosecond laser direct writing. The optical axis of the birefringent region is not determined by the laser polarization direction. It is observed that the information on the direction of writing can be recorded and be rewritable in the chalcogenide glass. Finally, a unique non-reciprocal photosensitivity is identified for the lithium niobate crystal for ultrafast laser direct writing. Therefore, in a non-centrosymmetric medium, modification of the material can be different when light propagates in opposite directions...|$|E

We first compare two nonlinear crystals available for second-harmonic generation: LBO and BiBO. The best results at 473 nm are obtained with a BiBO crystal, {{with an average}} output power of 3. 4 W at 20 kHz, corresponding to a second-harmonic generation efficiency of 38 %. This blue laser is frequency-converted to 236. 5 nm in a BBO crystal with an overall fourth-harmonic generation yield of 6. 5 %, corresponding to an average output power of 600 mW at 20 kHz. This represents {{an order of magnitude}} increase in average power and energy compared to previously reported pulsed lasers at 236. 5 nm. This work opens the possibility of LIDAR detection of dangerous compounds for military or civilian applications. The development of deep-UV solid-state lasers based on nonlinear frequency conversion has opened applications previously based on excimer lasers, such as material processing or spectroscopy applications. The most common approach is fourth-harmonic generation of the 1064 nm laser line of Nd:YAG, which has been a commercial product for many years. Unfortunately, important applications, such as manufacturing of Bragg gratings or waveguides, would be more efficient using wavelengths below 250 nm. Moreover, some particular spectroscopic applications, such as detection of dangerous compounds, require specific wavelengths in the deep-UV. One possible solution is to use a fundamental laser operating at a lower wavelength, such as the 946 nm laser line of Nd:YAG. Subsequent fourth-harmonic generation leads to a wavelength of 236. 5 nm, which lies in the absorption band of molecules related to improvised explosive devices or nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical components [1, 2]. The challenge is to obtain enough pulse energy to increase the detection range and accuracy. Unfortunately, previous works at 236. 5 nm only demonstrated a maximum energy of 500 nJ [3, 4], with an average power of 20 mW. This energy limitation comes from the difficulty to obtain significant laser output in Nd:YAG at 946 nm, because the quasi-three-level transition induces strong thermal effects. Recently, we demonstrated that single-crystal fiber technology could significantly improve the available laser output at 946 nm in Nd:YAG, owing to an optimized thermal management allowed by the crystal geometry and packaging [5, 6]. In this Letter, we propose to use a Nd:YAG single-crystal fiber Q-switched oscillator at 946 nm as a source for efficient fourth-harmonic generation. We show that this leads to an order of magnitude increase over previously reported results both in pulse energy and average power at 236. 5 nm. The experimental setup is displayed in Fig. 1. The laser is a Q-switched oscillator at 946 nm based on a Nd:YAG single-crystal fiber [6]. It emits an average power of 9. 2 W in a linearly polarized beam at a repetition rate of 20 kHz, with a pulse width of 45 ns. The beam profile is Gaussian with a measured beam quality of M 2 x  1. 11 and M 2 y  1. 13 (Fig. 3). The pulse energy is 460 μJ, corresponding to a peak power of 10. 2 kW. Several crystals are commercially available to perform second-harmonic generation (SHG) to the visible range. We consider three crystals: lithium tetraborate LiB 3 O 5 (LBO), <b>bismuth</b> <b>borate</b> BiB 3 O 5 (BiBO), and periodically poled titanium phosphate (PPKTP). Their material and nonlinear properties are displayed in Table 1. LBO is the most commonly used nonlinear crystal for visible SHG. While its nonlinearity is low compared to the other two crystals (d eff  0. 81 pm∕V), it has low walk-off, large angular acceptance, a very high damage threshold, and can be manufactured in large dimensions with very good optical quality. In contrast, BiBO has a large nonlinear coefficient (d eff  3. 34 pm∕V), but suffers from a large walk-off and low angular acceptance, often resulting in elliptical output beam. This also lowers the conversion efficiency for tight focusing when compared to crystals with a lower walk-off value. Furthermore, BiBO is a hygroscopic crystal that cannot be exposed to ambient air for a very long period of time...|$|E
