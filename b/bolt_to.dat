5|$|In June 2011, Malmö Stad {{decided that}} a new public {{swimming}} arena is {{to be built in}} the same area as the stadium in the near future. This leaves the stadium's future clouded in uncertainty. Recent occurrences have indicated that Malmö Stadion might continue to be used as an athletics arena, as MAI intends to revive the MAI Gala. In November 2012, MAI lobbied to attract 100 metres Olympic champion Usain <b>Bolt</b> <b>to</b> the stadium for the proposed MAI Gala in August 2014. MAI are also working towards hosting the European Athletics Junior Championships in 2015, and have written to the European Athletic Association to express their interest. On 31 January 2015 new reports suggested that the city council had reached an agreement that Malmö Stadion is to be demolished. The decision to approve the demolition of the stadium was taken on 2 February 2015. As of February 2015 it is still unknown when the demolition process will start and what will become of the area.|$|E
5|$|On the August 20, 2009 {{episode of}} Impact!, {{backstage}} interviewer Lauren, {{who was standing}} with and about to interview Christy Hemme, Tara, Taylor Wilde, and Sarita, announced that TNA were planning to host an eight-team single elimination tag team tournament to crown the first-ever TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. After a four-way match consisting of Hemme, Traci Brooks, Sarita, and Awesome Kong, TNA commentators Mike Tenay and Taz announced that the first round match of the tournament would {{take place on the}} August 27 episode of Impact! with Kong and Raisha Saeed facing Brooks and Sharmell. Kong and Saeed wound up winning the match, and moving to the next round of the tournament. On the September 3 episode of Impact!, the team of Hemme and Tara defeated the team of Hamada and Sojournor <b>Bolt</b> <b>to</b> move onto round two of the tournament. The next week on Impact!, the team of Sarita and Taylor Wilde defeated Alissa Flash and Daffney to also advance to round two. Later in that same episode, Angelina Love and Velvet Sky (collectively known as The Beautiful People) defeated the team of Madison Rayne and Roxxi. Round two began on the September 17 episode of Impact!, with the encounters of Kong and Saeed versus Sarita and Wilde and The Beautiful People versus Hemme and Tara. The first bout pitted Hemme and Tara against The Beautiful People, with the latter being victorious. Sarita and Wilde won the second encounter over Kong and Saeed. The finals for the tournament were then set for TNA's No Surrender PPV event, with The Beautiful People versus Sarita and Wilde. Sarita and Wilde defeated Madison Rayne, a substitute for Angelina Love who had been released from her contract prior to the event, and Velvet Sky (also collectively known as The Beautiful People) on September 20 at No Surrender to become the first official TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions.|$|E

50|$|In simple designs, {{the blades}} are {{directly}} <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the hub and {{are unable to}} pitch, which leads to aerodynamic stall above certain windspeeds. In other more sophisticated designs, they are <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the pitch bearing, which adjusts their angle of attack {{with the help of}} a pitch system according to the wind speed to control their rotational speed. The pitch bearing is itself <b>bolted</b> <b>to</b> the hub. The hub is fixed to the rotor shaft which drives the generator directly or through a gearbox.|$|R

25|$|C-Clamps are hook clamps {{that use}} a {{threaded}} <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> attach to a pipe or batten {{and to hold}} the instrument secure. Once secured, the fixture can be panned and tilted using adjustment knobs on the yoke and clamp. In addition, safety cables (a loop of aircraft cable terminated with carabiners) are used to support the lighting instrument in case the clamp fails.|$|E

25|$|After President Nixon's {{resignation}} in 1974, Rather {{took the}} assignment of chief correspondent for the documentary series CBS Reports. In December 1975, he became a correspondent of the long-running Sunday night news show 60 Minutes, just as the program was moved from a Sunday afternoon time-slot to primetime. Success there (and a threat to <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> ABC News) helped Rather pull ahead of longtime correspondent Roger Mudd in line to succeed Walter Cronkite as anchor and Managing Editor of CBS Evening News.|$|E
25|$|In {{a reality}} where villains have won and divided up America amongst themselves, Emma Frost marries Doctor Doom {{in order to}} ensure the {{survival}} of her species. Together with Doctor Doom, they rule a sector of what once was the United States of America called Doom's Lair, the only place on Earth where mutants can live without fear of persecution. She sends her lover Black <b>Bolt</b> <b>to</b> save Logan and Hawkeye from a Venom-possessed Savage Land Tyrannosaurus. Emma uses her telepathy to make herself look young.|$|E
25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|E

25|$|The Bizon uses {{a simple}} {{straight}} blowback method of operation, an unlocked breech system reduces cost and build complexity. The Bizon's operating cycle {{is characterized by}} a very short recoil stroke, standard 9×18mm ammunition will only drive the bolt partially {{to the rear of the}} receiver and produces a cyclic rate of 700 rounds/min. High-impulse ammunition forces the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> travel all the way to the end of the receiver, barely striking the receiver wall. A rate of fire of 650–680 rounds/min is the result. This has the effect of reducing perceived recoil and increasing controllability and hit probability.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 Cindrich {{returned}} to his native Western Pennsylvania and brought his management firm (now renamed Cindrich & Company) with him. That same year, Cindrich landed his first big-name client, Mark May, the offensive tackle from, the University of Pittsburgh who the Washington Redskins selected May with their first round pick (20th overall) in the 1981 NFL Draft. After tough negotiations that summer with the Redskins General Manager Bobby Bethard, May signed with the team in late July putting to rest rumors that he would <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> the Canadian Football League. Cindrich continues to represent May in all his television contracts.|$|E
25|$|Along with Williams, the Outlaws roster {{included}} rookie Oklahoma State star RB Ernest Anderson. Former Pittsburgh Steelers {{defensive coordinator}} Woody Widenhofer coached the team. Williams {{had been one}} of the biggest NFL stars to <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> the USFL. He left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they offered him a contract that would have still made him among the lowest-paid starters in the league, even though it would have been triple his previous salary. Williams was not a very refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to being a little rusty, but had a big arm and a knack for making plays.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier {{moves toward the}} butt of the gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as the neck of the case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis gun was gas operated. A {{portion of}} the {{expanding}} propellant gas was tapped off from the barrel, driving a piston to the rear against a spring. The piston was fitted with a vertical post at its rear which rode in a helical cam track in the bolt, rotating {{it at the end}} of its travel nearest the breech. This allowed the three locking lugs at the rear of the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> engage in recesses in the gun's body to lock it into place. The post also carried a fixed firing pin, which protruded through an aperture in the front of the bolt, firing the next round at the foremost part of the piston's travel.|$|E
25|$|The bolt in {{the bolt}} lock is a {{rectangle}} of metal that is constrained to slide only back and forward. When the knife is open a spring biases the <b>bolt</b> <b>to</b> the forward position where it rests above the tang {{of the blade}} preventing the blade from closing. Small knobs extend through {{the handle of the}} knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|E

Diagonal crossbeams of hardwood timber were used to brace the walls of the building. These elements are thought to be early adaptations of construction methods to cyclonic conditions.|$|R
