5|$|On {{the night}} of April 5, 1779, Charles Messier {{recorded}} Pallas on a star chart he used to track {{the path of a}} comet (now known as C/1779 A1 (Bode)) that he observed in the spring of 1779, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> assumed it {{was nothing more than a}} star.|$|E
5|$|Three men, Thomas Kenney, Aquilla Floyd, and Alexander Higginbotham, {{managed to}} escape. They eluded the warriors and arrived safely in Galena, Illinois three days later. It {{is said that}} Aaron Hawley was {{initially}} able to retreat from the scene, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> was later killed as he fled.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria used 26 tanks, {{delivered}} by Germany from used war reserve stock in early 1940, with the normal A-3 gun and 10 New T-11 tanks {{with the more}} powerful A-7 gun from the confiscated Afghan order were delivered between August and October 1940. They were supposedly relegated to training duties once the Germans began to deliver Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tanks in 1944, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> remained in service into the Fifties. But Kliment and Francev claim that the T-11s participated in the fighting in Yugoslavia and ended the war south of Vienna {{as part of the}} 1st Tank Brigade.|$|E
5|$|During a 19 May 1991 {{air show}} at Fairchild, Holland was the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} violated several safety regulations, including exceeding bank and pitch limits, flying {{directly over the}} air-show spectators, and possibly violating altitude restrictions. The base and wing commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, along with his staff, observed the demonstration, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> took no action.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E

5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> were more impressed {{at the fact that}} the group {{was one of the few}} applicants willing to pay the $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2009, Goodman {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two more species of M.manavi-like Malagasy Miniopterus: M.brachytragos from northern Madagascar and M.mahafaliensis from the southwest. On {{the basis of}} cytochrome b sequences, they found that M.aelleni was most closely related to a clade of M.brachytragos, M.manavi, and another recently described Malagasy species, M.petersoni. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> acquired their similarities through convergent evolution. At some places (for example, Namoroka) four cryptic species of M.manavi-like bats, including M.aelleni, occur together.|$|E
5|$|TK is {{a mysterious}} {{character}} {{who wears a}} large bandanna over his eyes and tends to break out in dance every so often. No one knows his real name or past. He speaks in semi-nonsensical English phrases depending on the situation, mainly quoted from pop culture, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> does not know English fluently. He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E

5|$|Una Aue / Frau Von Üxküll – Una Aue is Maximilien's twin sister. She {{is married}} to the aristocrat Berndt von Üxküll, and {{although}} she appears only briefly in person, she dominates Aue's imagination, particularly his sexual fantasies and hallucinations. She lived with her husband on his estate in Pomerania, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> moved to Switzerland with him {{towards the end of}} the war. Like her husband, she is critical of Germany's National Socialist regime which, along with his hatred of their mother and stepfather, and his attraction to her, led to her being estranged from Aue following the war.|$|E
5|$|Werber {{imposed a}} stern {{training}} regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for {{six to eight}} hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group's carefully prepared <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (<b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> disregarding the threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E

5|$|During the 2000s, {{molecular}} {{studies have}} revealed that the widely distributed African, Eurasian, and Australian genus Miniopterus is much more species-rich than previously thought. In a 1995 contribution to Faune de Madagascar on Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on Madagascar and the nearby Comoros, including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros. In 2008 and 2009, however, Steven Goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of M.manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically and molecularly distinct species of small Miniopterus. These included M.manavi itself in the Central Highlands, M.griveaudi and M.aelleni in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar, M.brachytragos in northern and western Madagascar only, and M.mahafaliensis in southwestern Madagascar. The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> acquired their similarities through convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|The game came {{online in}} May 2014, and {{remained}} active until its servers {{were shut down}} in November the following year. Upon release in Japan, the game had 500,000 registered users within a week, and one million by November of the same year, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> numbers dropped after later negative impressions. Japanese and Western journalists were positive at its release. In August 2015, {{it was announced that}} the game could not continue in its current form, and would be replaced by a new version. Planned versions for the PlayStation Vita and Windows devices were scrapped, along with an announced localization. Its successor, an online multiplayer game Final Fantasy Type-0 Online, was released in 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the nations of England and Scotland by the 1280s was one of relatively harmonious coexistence. The issue of homage did not reach {{the same level of}} controversy as it did in Wales; in 1278 King AlexanderIII of Scotland paid homage to EdwardI, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> only for the lands he held of Edward in England. Problems arose only with the Scottish succession crisis of the early 1290s. In the years from 1281 to 1284, Alexander's two sons and one daughter died in quick succession. Then, in 1286, King Alexander died himself, leaving as heir to the throne of Scotland his three-year-old granddaughter, Margaret. By the Treaty of Birgham, it was agreed that Margaret should marry King Edward's then six-year-old son Edward of Carnarvon, though Scotland would remain free of English overlordship.|$|E
5|$|To counter this, Philippicus {{ordered the}} men of the central {{division}} to dismount and form a shield-wall with their lances projecting from it (the fulcum formation). It is not clear what happened next, <b>but</b> <b>apparently</b> the Byzantine archers shot at the Persians' horses, breaking their momentum. At the same time, the Byzantine left managed to launch a successful counter-thrust which drove back the opposing Persian right in disarray. Soon the Persian right broke and fled, pursued by the Byzantines. With both wings having disintegrated, the Persian centre was now subjected to an attack from the reformed Byzantine right, which drove them towards the area once occupied by the Persian right. Outnumbered and attacked from several sides, the Persians soon began to break and flee.|$|E
