5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E

The ship is taken successfully, but McKay realizes that Silva is <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> thought of {{promotion}} and glory to the danger of the Flood; if even one Flood specimen escaped containment on Earth, the entire planet could fall. Jenkins draws McKay's attention to a vital energy line on the ship, and realizing that the destruction of the Flood is more important than Silva's promotion, cuts the cable, sending the Truth and Reconciliation crashing into Halo, killing all aboard.|$|E

5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E

After his victory, Musashi immediately jumped back in his boat and his flight from Sasaki's vengeful allies was helped by the turning of the tide. Another theory states he waited for the sun to get in the right position. After he dodged a blow, Sasaki was <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|E

25|$|The British {{found that}} they were at a {{disadvantage}} in night fighting as they were temporarily <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flash of their guns, while the Italian ships carried flashless cordite and good tracer ammunition.

The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two units, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, had meant that neither had the firepower to face the British escorts.|$|E

25|$|Leo Phokas {{was then}} sent a letter, in the Emperor's name, {{in which he}} was bidden not to react to these events.

Eventually, Leo was forced to flee, but was captured and <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Emperor's agents in Bithynia. Following the discovery of a plot by some of his friends a few months later, Phokas suffered a final humiliation, being paraded through the streets of Constantinople on a mule.

He then headed towards a nearby army encampment manned by Nahal Brigade soldiers some 175 meters away. He hurled grenades and sprayed automatic fire at the sentry, who panicked and ran away, allowing him free entry into the encampment.

25|$|The 105th fought at the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Emperor Napoleon {{ordered an}} unwell Augereau {{to attack the}} Russian left flank.

Pounded unmercifully by a 70-gun battery and swamped by counterattacking infantry and cavalry, Augereau's soldiers suffered huge losses and the remnants fled. His division commander Desjardin was killed. The decimated VII Corps was discontinued and the survivors distributed to other corps. Habert was transferred to Claude Legrand's division in Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps on 21 February. He fought at the Battle of Heilsberg on 10 June 1807 where he was wounded in the head and shoulder. On 11 July 1807 he became a commandant in the Légion d'Honneur.|$|E
25|$|The CIA's prime {{source in}} Lebanon was Bashir Gemayel, {{a member of}} the Christian Maronite sect. The CIA was <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{uprising}} against the Maronite minority. Israel invaded Lebanon, and, along with the CIA, propped up Gemayel. This got Gemayel's assurance that Americans would be protected in Lebanon. 13 days later he was assassinated. Imad Mughniyah, a Hezbollah assassin would target Americans in retaliation for the Israeli invasion, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the US Marines of the Multi-National Force for their role in opposing the PLO in Lebanon. On April 18, 1983, a 2,000lb car bomb exploded {{in the lobby of the}} American embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people including 17 Americans, and 7 CIA officers, including Robert Ames, one of the CIA's best Middle East experts. America's fortunes in Lebanon would only suffer more as America's poorly-directed retaliation for the bombing was interpreted by many as support for the Christian Maronite minority. On October 23, 1983, two bombs (1983 Beirut Bombing) were set off in Beirut, including a 10 ton bomb at a US military barracks that killed 242 people. Both attacks are believed to have been planned by Iran by way of Mughniyah.|$|E

The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages the three of them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the travelers enter the gates of the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being <b>blinded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. The Wizard appears to Dorothy as a giant head on a marble throne, the Scarecrow as a lovely lady in silk gauze, the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and the Cowardly Lion as a ball of fire. The Wizard agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Oz's Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of blindness and visual impairment from glaucoma is influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> criteria {{used to define}} these entities, which differ between countries and regions, as well as among published reports. The objective {{of the present study}} was to ascertain the extent to which different criteria of blindness and visual impairment influence estimates of the number of patients classified as blind or visually impaired by glaucoma in a clinic-based population. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of 914 patients with open-angle glaucoma to compare numbers of patients identified as visually impaired with and without considering visual field status. We also compared proportions classified using World Health Organisation (WHO) and United States (US) blindness criteria, and applying a new US Social Security Administration (SSA) disability criterion: perimetric mean deviation (MD) ≤ - 22 dB. Results Forty patients (4. 4 %) were bilaterally <b>blind</b> from glaucoma <b>by</b> <b>the</b> WHO criteria. Fifty-two (5. 7 %) were <b>blind</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> the US criterion. Assessing only visual acuity, 14 (1. 5 %) patients were <b>blind</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> WHO criteria and 24 (2. 6 %) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US definition. Eighty-five (9. 3 %) met the US SSA disability criterion. Among those, 52 were impaired also <b>by</b> <b>the</b> WHO definition. No patients impaired according to the WHO criteria had MD values better than - 22 dB. Conclusions Excluding visual field status will seriously underestimate the {{prevalence of}} glaucoma blindness. In our patient population, 30 % more patients were classified as <b>blind</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US than <b>by</b> <b>the</b> WHO definition. Also, 60 % more were identified as visually impaired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US SSA criterion than <b>by</b> <b>the</b> WHO criteria. Visual field assessment is vital to determine visual impairment caused by glaucoma. </p...|$|R
