25|$|Polystyrene foams {{are good}} thermal {{insulators}} {{and are therefore}} often used as <b>building</b> <b>insulation</b> materials, such as in insulating concrete forms and structural insulated panel building systems. Grey polystyrene foam, incorporating graphite has superior insulation properties. They are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures (such as ornamental pillars). PS foams also exhibit good damping properties, therefore it is used widely in packaging. The trademark Styrofoam by Dow Chemical Company is informally used (mainly US & Canada) for all foamed polystyrene products, although strictly it should only be used for 'extruded closed-cell' polystyrene foams made by Dow Chemicals.|$|E
500|$|Glass wool, {{which is}} one product called [...] "fiberglass" [...] today, was invented in 1932–1933 by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning, as a {{material}} {{to be used as}} thermal <b>building</b> <b>insulation.</b> It is marketed under the trade name Fiberglas, which has become a genericized trademark. Glass fiber when used as a thermal insulating material, is specially manufactured with a bonding agent to trap many small air cells, resulting in the characteristically air-filled low-density [...] "glass wool" [...] family of products.|$|E
2500|$|Expanded {{polystyrene}} (EPS) is a {{rigid and}} tough, closed-cell foam. It is usually white {{and made of}} pre-expanded polystyrene beads. EPS is used for many applications e.g. trays, plates, bowls and fish boxes. Other uses include molded sheets for <b>building</b> <b>insulation</b> and packing material ("peanuts") for cushioning fragile items inside boxes.

40|$|For recent years, {{silica aerogel}} has {{attracted}} great attention and been extensively used in different technical fields owning to its remarkable properties in optics, mechanics, acoustics etc. especially in thermology. The thermal conductivity {{of a number}} of different insulation materials has been measured both by Transient Plane Source (TPS) and a new designed experiment−Guarded hot plate method respectively. It turns out that silica aerogel has the lowest thermal conductivity value of 0. 0144 W/mK and accordingly the highest thermal resistance among all those common insulation materials which makes it a good choice in <b>buildings</b> <b>insulation</b> industry. Besides, the energy-saving and heating-cost of silica aerogel used as <b>building</b> <b>insulations</b> is calculated by the method of Life cycle cost analysis method (LCCA), and the result shows silica aerogel can help to reduce the annual heat loss of a building by 50. 9 % and also help to reduce about half of the annual heating costs when compared with other insulations. Due to the excellent thermal performances, however, silica aerogel has much higher selling prices (75. 24 US$/m 2) than the other normal insulation materials, and then a comparatively longer payback time (3. 54 years) has to be taken than the other competitive solutions (0. 22 years for EPS, 0. 07 years for XPS, etc.). And the feasibility of using silica aerogel as <b>building</b> <b>insulations</b> is discussed...|$|R

Additional regulations can target specific cases: in the United States, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency mandates the purchase of oil, paper, tires and <b>building</b> <b>insulation</b> from recycled or re-refined sources whenever possible.|$|E
2500|$|Asbestos mining existed {{more than}} 4,000 years ago, but {{large-scale}} mining {{began at the}} end of the 19th century, when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. Some of those properties are sound absorption, average tensile strength, affordability, and resistance to fire, heat, and electricity. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in <b>building</b> <b>insulation.</b> When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use continued to grow through most of the 20th century [...] until public knowledge (acting through courts and legislatures) of the health hazards of asbestos dust outlawed asbestos in mainstream construction and fireproofing in most countries.|$|E
50|$|Weatherization is {{distinct}} from <b>building</b> <b>insulation,</b> although <b>building</b> <b>insulation</b> requires weatherization for proper functioning. Many types of insulation {{can be thought of}} as weatherization, because they block drafts or protect from cold winds.

50|$|Maintaining {{acceptable}} {{temperatures in}} buildings (by heating and cooling) uses {{a large proportion}} of global energy consumption. <b>Building</b> <b>insulations</b> also commonly use the principle of small trapped air-cells as explained above, e.g. fiberglass (specifically glass wool), cellulose, rock wool, polystyrene foam, urethane foam, vermiculite, perlite, cork, etc. For a period of time, Asbestos was also used, however, it caused health problems.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new skeleton-based {{algorithm}} for the segmentation {{of individual}} fibres in 3 D tomographic images is described. The proposed method {{is designed to}} deal with low density materials featuring fibres with varied sizes, shapes and tortuosities, like composite fibreboards used for <b>buildings</b> <b>insulation.</b> To this end the paths of the skeleton are first classified according to their connectivity, the connectivity of their adjacent nodes, their orientation, their average radius and the variation of the distance transform along each path. This allows for the identification of spurious paths and paths linking two fibres. Reconstruction of {{the path of the}} fibres is done thanks to an optimal pairing algorithm which joins paths that show the most similar orientation and radius at each node/link. The segmented skeleton is finally dilated by means of a growing algorithm ordonned by the average radius of the fibres in order to reconstruct each identified fibres. As an application, the algorithm is used to segment a 3 D tomographic image of hemp/polymer fibreboard for <b>buildings</b> <b>insulation.</b> Information such as the number of contacts, tortuosity, length, average radius, orientation of fibres are finally measured on both the segmented skeleton and reconstructed image, which allow for a thorough characterization of the fibre network...|$|R

The apparent thermal conductivity(lambda) for biodegradable coconut and sugarcane fiber were investigated in accordance with ASTM C 518 over the density ranges 40 kg/m³ to 90 kg/m³ and 70 kg/m³ to 120 kg/m³ for the test temperature ranges 13. 2 ºC to 21. 8 ºC and 18 ºC to 32 ºC, respectively. The experimental data {{were used to determine}} empirical equations for lambda variation with density and temperature for both coconut and sugarcane fiber.
