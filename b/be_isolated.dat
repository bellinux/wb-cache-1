5000|$|Aspergillus penicillioides {{was named}} by Spegazzini in 1896. The species was {{described}} from mouldy sugar-cane in Argentina, {{but it was}} not cultivated by Spegazzini. The ex neotype strain CBS 540.65 <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from a human arm in Brazil that was misdiagnosed to lobomycosis. The fungus <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from several compounds in different places. [...] Strain CBS 116.26 <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from sugar cane in Louisiana, and it was sent to Spegazzini and recognized by him to fit description of his species. Strain CBS 539.65 <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from a gun firing mechanism and CBS118.55 <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from a man in Netherlands. Several other A. penicillioides strains <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from Indonesian dried fish in Australia and dried chili in Papua New Guinea.

5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{isotopes}} of fermium {{are known}} with mass numbers of 242–260. 254Fm, 255Fm and 256Fm are α-emitters {{with a short}} half-life (hours), which can <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> in significant amounts. 257Fm (t1/2 = 100 days) can accumulate upon prolonged and strong irradiation. All these isotopes are characterized by high rates of spontaneous fission.|$|E
30|$|In sum, {{nineteen}} fungal strains <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> {{for this}} study: five strains of F. fomentarius, 11 strains of F. pinicola, and three strains of P. betulinus. Strains <b>were</b> <b>isolated</b> from a narrow geographical area spanning {{a maximum of}} hundred kilometres, with a few control strains isolated form the southern side of the Alps, and one strain from the mediterranean area. F. fomentarius <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Quercus pubescens; F. pinicola <b>was</b> <b>isolated</b> from Abies alba, Alnus incana, Larix decidua and P. abies.

5|$|The first stable carbenes to <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> {{were based}} on an {{imidazole}} ring, with the hydrogen in carbon 2 of the ring (between the two nitrogen atoms) removed, and other hydrogens replaced by various groups. These imidazol-2-ylidenes are still the most stable and the most well studied and understood family of persistent carbenes.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally carbenes {{are viewed}} as so {{reactive}} that were only studied indirectly, e.g. by trapping reactions. This situation has changed dramatically {{with the emergence of}} persistent carbenes. Although they are fairly reactive substances, i.e., undergoing dimerization, many can <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> as pure substances.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N2, cannot <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> in condensed form, but B2F4 and B4Cl4 are well characterized.|$|E

The dark juveniles typical of these island forms are occasionally found in mainland Scotland and elsewhere, indicating some gene flow from faroensis or zetlandicus, subspecies formerly considered to <b>be</b> <b>isolated.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1778 Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite. Instead, Scheele {{correctly}} {{proposed that}} molybdena was an ore of a distinct new element, named molybdenum for the mineral {{in which it}} resided, and from which it might <b>be</b> <b>isolated.</b> Peter Jacob Hjelm successfully isolated molybdenum using carbon and linseed oil in 1781.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> from {{external}} influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, there {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> examples of Gothic church building, including L. G. Thomson's Reid Memorial Church, Edinburgh (1929–33) and J. Taylor Thomson's St John Renfield Church, Glasgow (1927–31). The most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings. Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton's Bangour Village Church (1924–30) and L. G. Thomson's Fairmilehead Church (1937). Roman Catholic examples included Reginald Fairlie's Immaculate Conception Church, Fort William (1933–34), and Archibald Macpherson's St Matthew, Rosewell (completed 1926).|$|E
5|$|Mesoionic carbenes (MICs) {{are similar}} to N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) except that {{canonical}} resonance structures with the carbene depicted cannot be drawn without adding additional charges. Mesoionic carbenes are {{also referred to as}} abnormal N-heterocyclic carbenes (aNHC) or remote N-heterocyclic carbenes (rNHC). A variety of free carbenes can <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and are stable at room temperature. Other free carbenes are not stable and are susceptible to intermolecular decomposition pathways.|$|E
5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} readily available, it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example time delay or tolerance to component variation. The {{difficulties of the}} image method were firmly put in the past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E

5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but not stored.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia {{is due to}} infections caused {{primarily}} by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites. Although {{there are more than}} 100 strains of infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible {{for the majority of the}} cases. Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in up to 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults. A causative agent may not <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> in approximately half of cases despite careful testing.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{potassium}} {{metal can}} <b>be</b> <b>isolated</b> by electrolysis of its hydroxide {{in a process}} that has changed little since it was first used by Humphry Davy in 1807. Although the electrolysis process was developed and used in industrial scale in the 1920s, the thermal method by reacting sodium with potassium chloride in a chemical equilibrium reaction became the dominant method in the 1950s.|$|E
40|$|All Lancefield group C beta-hemolytic streptococci {{isolated}} over 12 {{months from}} college students with clinical pharyngitis and age-matched healthy controls were identified.
