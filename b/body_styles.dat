5|$|After {{structural}} design on alternate <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> encountered obstacles, Ford offered the Pinto solely as a two-door sedan, with entry level models priced at $1850, undercutting GM's Chevrolet Vega and directly targeting imported models — which included such new competitors as the Mazda 1200 in 1971, the Subaru DL in 1972, and the Honda Civic in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the arrival}} of serious competitors—namely, the Ford Falcon, Chrysler Valiant, and Japanese cars—in the 1960s, Holden's locally {{produced}} large six- and eight-cylinder cars remained Australia's top-selling vehicles. Sales were boosted by exporting the Kingswood sedan, station wagon, and utility <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> to Indonesia, Trinidad and Tobago, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa in complete knock down form.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{implemented}} a staged roll-out of the VE variants, releasing the sedan first in July 2006. Prior to this, Holden stated they would manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores {{until the new}} station wagon and utility <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> were launched. Variants by Holden's performance vehicle partner, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV), were released soon after the sedan's debut alongside the long-wheelbase WM Statesman/Caprice models. The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 when it was accompanied by the previewing of a Sportwagon concept. The Sportwagon itself was subsequently introduced in July 2008 with the standard Commodore wheelbase instead of the extended wheelbase of previous Commodore wagons.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, {{the wide}} arch boxy with {{extended}} front spoiler <b>body</b> <b>style</b> is still favoured amongst kaido racer/silhouette car drivers, impersonators {{of the former}} and fans of the <b>body</b> <b>style,</b> who usually build a more exaggerated <b>body</b> <b>style.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1950, the Custom gained DeSoto's first consumer-designed {{station wagon}} <b>body</b> <b>style,</b> however the <b>body</b> <b>style</b> was not {{offered as a}} Deluxe. The Custom also {{received}} DeSoto's first hardtop coupe, which featured pillarless door design and trimmed to convertible standards, and again, the Deluxe was excluded from the premium <b>body</b> <b>style.</b> In 1951, the brakes grew to 12 inches in diameter.|$|R
50|$|The {{range was}} {{launched}} in 2003 in the sedan <b>body</b> <b>style.</b> In 2004, the estate <b>body</b> <b>style</b> was introduced. The E60/E61 {{was replaced by the}} F10/F11 5 Series in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{introduced}} {{as a single}} sedan body style, the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon. From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most <b>body</b> <b>styles,</b> with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and all-wheel drive (AWD) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E
5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon <b>body</b> <b>styles,</b> the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E

5000|$|Initially, the 5 Series {{was only}} {{available}} in a sedan <b>body</b> <b>style.</b> The wagon/estate <b>body</b> <b>style</b> (called [...] "Touring") was added in 1991 and the 5-door fastback (called [...] "Gran Turismo") was added in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The E85/E86 is {{the first}} {{generation}} of the BMW Z4, which was produced from 2002 to 2008. Initial models were in the roadster (E85) <b>body</b> <b>style,</b> with the coupe (E86) <b>body</b> <b>style</b> being added in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{remained}} the same since the first Clio RS, a 2.0-litre straight-4 petrol engine, with an FF layout and a three-door hatchback <b>body</b> <b>style.</b> The latest version changed to a 1.6-litre engine with a five-door hatchback <b>body</b> <b>style.</b>|$|R
25|$|For 1981, AMC {{introduced}} Eagle models (SX/4 liftback and Kammback sedan) {{based on}} both Spirit <b>body</b> <b>styles.</b>|$|E

5000|$|During the CBS {{era in the}} 1970s, the Telecaster <b>body</b> <b>style</b> {{was changed}} to a new [...] "notchless" [...] shape, having a less {{pronounced}} notch in the crook where the upper bout meets the neck. The notchless <b>body</b> <b>style</b> was discontinued in 1982.|$|R

25|$|Skylines are {{available}} in either coupé, or sedan <b>body</b> <b>styles,</b> plus station wagon, crossover, convertible and pickup/sedan delivery <b>body</b> <b>styles.</b> The later models are most commonly known by their trademark round brake and tail lights (as of 1972). While not distributed in the United States until its importation as the Infiniti G, the Skyline's prominence in video games, movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being imported there from 1989 to late 2005. The majority of Skyline models are rear-wheel drive, with four-wheel drive being available since the eighth-generation's debut.|$|E
25|$|The Chevette was {{assembled}} in New Zealand between 1976 and 1981. All <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> {{that were available}} in the UK were sold. The first models built were three-door hatchbacks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fifth-generation}} Prelude {{marked a}} return to the more square <b>body</b> <b>style</b> of the third generation (1988-1991), in an attempt to curb slumping sales of the fourth-generation <b>body</b> <b>style.</b> All models and trim packages stayed within the BB-chassis code (BB5-BB9) and housed either an H-series or F-Series engine: ...|$|R
25|$|The sixth {{generation}} Electras {{were initially}} offered in both 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> but the 2-door coupe versions were eventually discontinued in 1986 (Electra 380) and 1987 (Electra Park Avenue).|$|E
25|$|The LeSabre {{nameplate}} {{made its}} first appearance on the 1951 Le Sabre show car, which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the Buick Special. The Buick LeSabre was offered in a full line of <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> except between 1965-1969 when its station wagon variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon <b>body</b> <b>styles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{the last}} Bel Air was {{produced}} in 1975 in the U.S., the Canadian big Chevy lineup continued to include the Bel Air for 1976 and beyond in two door, four door and station wagon <b>body</b> <b>styles.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Alliance sold {{well with}} over 142,000 of the debut 1983 models. Sales were {{limited by the}} {{availability}} of only two <b>body</b> <b>styles.</b> American Motors' had several 4-door Alliances converted into stretch limousines for publicity and official use.|$|E
25|$|The upright {{design of}} the tail, which {{enlarged}} interior space, was aerodynamically efficient. Later, European and Japanese manufacturers similarly created different <b>body</b> <b>styles</b> on one compact car chassis by extending or curtailing the trunk (e.g. Volkswagen's Jetta and Golf models).|$|E
25|$|Launched {{concurrently}} in July 1987, {{both the}} LD Astra and N13 Pulsar were offered in four-door sedan and five-door hatchback <b>body</b> <b>styles.</b> Outside of Australia though, three-door hatchback and station wagon body variants of the Nissan were also available.|$|E

The introduction of the Cabriolet saw the popularity of the Mondial rise, particularly in the American market, where the convertible <b>body</b> <b>style</b> was highly desirable. The Cabriolet has the added distinction of being the only four-seat, mid-rear engine, convertible automobile ever manufactured in regular production. 629 units were produced between 1983 and 1985, making this the rarest version of the Mondial.|$|R
