5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E

Furthermore, based on these and other results from our laboratory, we conclude that the formation of stable Hoogsteen <b>base</b> <b>pairs</b> may not be the relevant structural change in vivo.

25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are found}} to be more common in repeat regions of DNA. A reason for this is because of slipping of the polymerase enzyme in repeat regions, allowing for mutations to enter the sequence. Experiments can be run to determine the frequency of the frameshift mutation by adding or removing a pre-set number of nucleotides. Experiments have been run by adding four basepairs, called the +4 experiments, but a team from Emory University looked at the difference in frequency of the mutation by both adding and deleting a <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> It was shown that {{there was no difference in}} the frequency between the addition and deletion of a <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> There is however, a difference in the end result of the protein.|$|E

25|$|A-minor motifs {{have been}} {{separated}} into four classes, types 0 to III, {{based upon the}} position of the inserting base relative to the two 2’-OH’s of the Watson-Crick <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> In type I and II A-minor motifs, N3 of adenine is inserted deeply within the minor groove of the duplex (see figure: A minor interactions - type II interaction), and there is good shape complementarity with the <b>base</b> <b>pair.</b> Unlike types 0 and III, type I and II interactions are specific for adenine due to hydrogen bonding interactions. In the type III interaction, both the O2' and N3 of the inserting base are associated less closely with the minor groove of the duplex. Type 0 and III motifs are weaker and non-specific because they are mediated by interactions with a single 2’-OH (see figure: A-minor Interactions - type 0 and type III interactions).|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the coil-to-helix {{transition}} of the DNA oligomer d(C 4 A 4 T 4 C 4), using circular dichroism measurements to monitor the formation of A.

The CD data of the helix form of the oligomer were consistent with the presence of paired oligomers, but not with hairpin loops. The pKa for formation of C.

25|$|While most chloroplasts {{originate}} from that {{first set of}} endosymbiotic events, Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently. It {{is not clear whether}} that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes. Being {{in the early stages of}} endosymbiosis, Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved. Paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped blue-green photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores, descended from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus. Chromatophores cannot survive outside their host. Chromatophore DNA is about a million base pairs long, containing around 850 protein encoding genes—far less than the three million <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> Synechococcus genome, but much larger than the approximately 150,000 <b>base</b> <b>pair</b> genome of the more assimilated chloroplast. Chromatophores have transferred much less of their DNA to the nucleus of their host.

25|$|Uracil {{is rarely}} found in DNA, {{and this may}} have been an {{evolutionary}} change to increase genetic stability.
