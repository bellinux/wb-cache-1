40|$|Angina-like {{chest pain}} of non-cardiac origin {{is a major}} {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic problem. The oesophagus is frequently suspected to {{be the cause of}} the chest pain in these patients. However, a positive statement for the oesophageal origin of the pain can only be made when during manometry or pH-monitoring the familiar pain attack appears to be accompanied by reflux, severe motor disorders or a combination of both. Due to the intermittent nature of the pain this is only rarely the case during short-listing conventional examinations. Provocation tests have been used to induce the familiar chest pain. The <b>Bernstein</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and the edrophonium test yield the best results. Prolonged (24 -hour) ambulatory recording of intra-oesophageal pressure and pH to increase the chances of recording chest pain concomitantly with an episode of reflux and/or motor disorders appears to be the most sensitive and also the most physiological test. It is the only test that provides reliable information on the underlying mechanism of the pain, especially in patients with the syndrome of irritable oesophagus, thus contributing in establishing the appropriate therapy for these patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that radiofrequency energy delivery at the gastroesophageal junction (the Stretta procedure) induces symptom relief in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), although improvement of acid exposure on pH monitoring was usually limited. A role for decreased esophageal sensitivity has been suggested. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of Stretta on symptoms, acid exposure, and sensitivity to esophageal acid perfusion in GERD. Thirteen patients with established proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -dependent GERD (three males; mean age, 51 +/- 10 years) participated in the study. Before and 6 months after the procedure symptom score, pH monitoring and <b>Bernstein</b> <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> were performed. The latter was done by infusing HCl (pH 0. 1) at a rate of 6 ml/min 15 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction for a maximum of 30 min or until the patients experienced heartburn. Results were compared by Student's t-test. Stretta procedure time was 51 +/- 4 min and no complications occurred. After 6 months, the symptom score was significantly improved (12. 5 +/- 2. 0 to 7. 5 +/- 2. 1; P< 0. 05), seven patients no longer needed daily PPI, and acid exposure was significantly decreased (11. 6 %+/- 1. 6 % to 8. 5 %+/- 1. 8 % of time pH< 4; P< 0. 05). The time needed to induce heartburn during acid perfusion decreased from 9. 5 +/- 2. 3 to 18. 1 +/- 3. 4 min (P= 0. 01), and five patients became insensitive to 30 -min acid perfusion, versus none at baseline (P= 0. 04). In conclusion, the Stretta procedure induces subjective improvement of GERD symptoms and decreases esophageal acid exposure. In addition, esophageal acid sensitivity is decreased 6 months after the Stretta procedure. The mechanism underlying this finding and its relevance to symptom control require further studies. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The Bernstein {{test has}} been used as a test of {{oesophageal}} acid sensitivity for over 30 years but its clinical value has been challenged by the advent of ambulatory pH monitoring. Furthermore, the relation between mucosal acid sensitivity, symptomatic reflux, and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time is unclear. This study examined the relation between these three parameters in patients referred for pH monitoring with unexplained chest pain or heartburn. Fifty consecutive patients were studied - nine with non-cardiac chest pain and 41 with a history of heartburn. Symptomatic reflux was defined as a greater than or equal to 50 % temporal association between pain episodes and reflux events (pH less than 4) during pH monitoring. A positive <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> (in which the patient's usual symptoms were evoked by acid, though not saline) had a 100 % sensitivity, 73 % specificity, and 81 % accuracy for the detection of symptomatic reflux.

However, symptomatic reflux or a positive <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test,</b> or both, were found in some patients with a normal oesophageal acid exposure time during pH monitoring. Mucosal acid sensitivity, abnormal oesophageal acid exposure time, and symptomatic reflux should be regarded as separate, though related aspects of reflux disease.

A positive test helps to identify an oesophageal cause of symptoms, particularly in patients in whom other aspects of 'gastro-oesophageal reflux disease' are absent, or who do not have symptoms during pH monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} fibreoptic {{endoscopy}} have been assessed retrospectively in 71 patients referred for {{consideration of the}} oesophagus as the possible or probable cause of their symptoms.

40|$|Gastric acid {{suppression}} {{could improve}} heartburn by healing oesophagitis or {{by reduction of}} oesophageal sensitivity to acid. To independently assess changes in oesophageal sensitivity, {{it would be necessary}} to study patients with reflux disease but no oesophagitis. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of acid suppression on oesophageal sensitivity and to assess the time course of any measured effect. Twenty seven patients were recruited, of whom 25 completed the study (14 men and 11 women, mean (SD) age 50 (15) years). All had classic symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux but normal results of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and oesophageal mucosal histological tests. Each had abnormal 24 hour pH studies and a positive <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>tests.</b> Subjects were assigned double blind to placebo (n = 11) or famotidine 40 mg twice daily (n = 14) for four weeks. <b>Acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out at 0, 4, 5, and 8 weeks and time to heartburn recorded. Time to heartburn (mean (SEM)) was 124 (78) seconds in the famotidine and 187 (154) in the placebo group at week 0 (NS). Compared with baseline, significant increases in time to heartburn was found with famotidine at weeks 4 (383 (102), p < 0. 01) and 5 (344 (92), p < 0. 01) but not week 8 (336 (90) seconds). No significant effects were found with placebo (219 (41), 146 (23), and 144 (25) seconds for weeks 4, 5, and 8). Heartburn symptom score decreased significantly with famotidine (mean scores 3. 6, 1. 9, 2. 1, and 2. 6 at weeks 0, 4, 5, and 8 (p= 0. 001)) and showed a significant negative correlation with time to heartburn (r(s) =- 0. 60; p< 0. 0001).

40|$|There are {{numerous}} tests {{for which a}} diagnostic value {{in the context of}} gastro-oesophageal reflux disease has been claimed. Some of these tests (e. g. the <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test)</b> have become obsolete after the advent of 24 -hour oesophageal pH monitoring. With the latter rest not only can excessive reflux be identified, but also, and more importantly, a temporal relationship can be demonstrated between a patient's symptoms and reflux episodes. Radiographical examination of the oesophagus has largely been replaced by endoscopy, although the use of the former test is still indicated in certain circumstances (e. g. in the differentiation of sliding from paraoesophageal hiatus hernia). In clinical practice, the so-called proton pump inhibitor test has gained considerable popularity. Despite several studies on the specificity and sensitivity of this test, its value has not yet been established with sufficient accuracy.

40|$|Fifty {{patients}} with non-cardiac chest pain underwent 24 hour intraoesophageal pH and pressure recording and provocation {{tests to determine}} the relative value of both techniques in establishing the oesophageal origin of the chest pain.

The 24 hour pH and pressure recording correlated spontaneous chest pain attacks with abnormal motility or gastro-oesophageal reflux in 19 patients (38 %). Fourteen of these patients also had at least one positive provocation test. Therefore, 24 hour pH and pressure recordings are only slightly better than a set of provocation tests in identifying the oesophagus as the cause of chest pain (10 % diagnostic gain).

However, she did not complain any reflux symptoms, and the score by the frequency scale for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease 1 was 0, thus she was diagnosed as “asymptomatic esophagitis (AE) ”. 2 An <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed and analyzed according to Fass’s method. 3 <b>Acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> sensitivity score (APSS) was calculated from the duration of typical symptom perception (T) and sensory intensity rating {{at the end of the}} <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (I) is as follows; APSS = I × T/ 100 (cm × sec/ 100). Her APSS showed zero points because both T and I were 0, which was lower than that of the healthy controls in our hospital (24. 2 ± 24. 0). Next, a Barostat test was performed based on modified Yang’s method, 4 in which the balloon expanded 10 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter according to the ramp distension protocol (2 mmHg/ 15 sec) (Fig. 2).

40|$|Acid reflux episodes {{that extend}} to the {{proximal}} esophagus {{are more likely to}} be perceived. This suggests that the proximal esophagus is more sensitive to acid than the distal esophagus, which could be caused by impaired mucosal integrity in the proximal esophagus. Our aim was to explore sensitivity to acid and mucosal integrity in different segments of the esophagus. We used a prospective observational study, including 12 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). After stopping acid secretion-inhibiting medication, two procedures were performed: an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and an upper endoscopy with electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and esophageal biopsies. Proximal and distal sensitivity to acid and tissue impedance were measured in vivo, and mucosal permeability and epithelial intercellular spaces at different esophageal levels were measured in vitro. Mean lag time to heartburn perception was much shorter after proximal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (0. 8 min) than after distal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (3. 9 min) (P = 0. 02). Median in vivo tissue impedance was significantly lower in the distal esophagus (4, 563 Ω·m) compared with the proximal esophagus (8, 170 Ω·m) (P = 0. 002). Transepithelial permeability, as measured by the median fluorescein flux was significantly higher in the distal (2, 051 nmol·cm(- 2) ·h(- 1)) than in the proximal segment (368 nmol·cm(- 2) ·h(- 1)) (P = 0. 033). Intercellular space ratio and maximum heartburn intensity were not significantly different between the proximal and distal esophagus. In GERD patients off acid secretion-inhibiting medication, acid exposure in the proximal segment of the esophagus provokes symptoms earlier than acid exposure in the distal esophagus, whereas mucosal integrity is impaired more in the distal esophagus. These findings indicate that the enhanced sensitivity to proximal reflux episodes is not explained by increased mucosal permeabilit...|$|R
40|$|Most {{patients}} with GERD are successfully treated with PPIs. One {{of the most}} important issues? in the treatment of GERD is the selection of patients who will respond to the different treatment options. In a prospective study we found that most GERD {{patients with}} typical symptoms seen at the primary care level respond favourably to a one-month empirical medical treatment. Surprisingly, the type of therapy chosen by the GPs in response to the presenting symptoms did not seem to significantly influence outcomes. Risk factors for non-responsiveness were the presence of alarm symptoms, alcohol use and a history of relapse after or lack of response to previous anti-secretory therapy. This observation reinforces the need for early endoscopy in patients with risk factors or alarm symptoms. Most GERD patients will have a relapse after the acute treatment. They can be treated with long-term PPI maintenance or they may undergo a Nissen anti-reflux fundoplication. Reservations regarding the long-term efficacy, side effects and its invasive character render surgery a less than ideal solution. A few years ago, a number of different endoluminal therapies were proposed as alternative long-term approaches to GERD therapy. Now, five years later, it is time to take stock and evaluate the true contribution of these procedures. We investigated in our centre the underlying mechanism of several endoluminal therapies, because if a new endoluminal therapy wants to be effective, it should interfere with the underlying pathophysiology of reflux disease. This will also help us to explain why some of these procedures failed and what an ideal procedure should be. A. LESP The most obvious mechanism of action for endoscopic anti-reflux procedures would be an increase in LES (Lower Esophageal Sphincter) pressure, or a suppression of transient LES relaxations. However basal LES pressures remained unchanged after the Stretta and Endocinch procedures[i], [ii]. In our small experience with the Enteryx procedure, we also found no significant increase in LES pressure. Thus, changes in LES pressure do not seem sufficient to explain symptomatic benefit or improvement in pH monitoring. It is well established that tLESRs are the most important underlying pathophysiological event in mild to moderate GERD. A number of observations suggest that these therapies reduce the occurrence of tLESRs[iii], [iv], [v]. By changing the compliance of the gastro-esophageal region, due to plications, heating with fibrosis, or the presence of implants, the threshold for triggering a transient relaxation could be increased. As radiofrequency energy induces nerve ablation (for example, the use of radiofrequency energy in the treatment of arrhythmias), the Stretta procedure could also interfere with the efferent or afferent nerves responsible for triggering the tLESRs. B. Sensitivity of the distal esophagus Neurolysis could potentially also induce reduced acid sensitivity at the gastro-esophageal junction. The effect on sensitivity before and after an endoluminal procedure was evaluated in two recent studies. Wenzel found after an Endocinch procedure a decrease of the esophageal sensitivity to acid[vi]. To investigate the sensitivity before and after a Stretta® procedure, we performed a <b>Bernstein</b> esophageal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test.</b> Six months after the Stretta® was performed, we found a significant increase in time elapsed before symptom occurrence during HCl infusion, suggesting that radiofrequency energy delivery reduces esophageal acid sensitivity over time 2. It is unclear whether this is related to or contributes to the clinical improvement after the procedure. Whether the change in esophageal acid sensitivity reflects a direct effect on acid sensitive receptors located at sensory nerve endings of the squamous layer or whether this occurs secondary to a reduction in esophageal acid exposure (with restoration of tight junctions and decreased mucosal permeability) remains unclear. Reduction of sensitivity could help to explain some of the discrepancy between symptomatic improvement and the abscence of normalization of pH monitoring. However, it is unclear whether all procedures will equally affect esophageal sensitivity. C. Distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction We investigated the distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction before and after a Stretta® procedure in a double-blind randomized cross-over study[vii]. In this study we found a significant difference in distensibility after a sham or a Stretta® procedure. After administration of sildenafil, an esophageal smooth muscle relaxant, GEJ compliance after Stretta® was normalised to pre-Stretta® level, which rules out GEJ fibrosis as an underlying mechanism. Decreased GEJ compliance, which reflects altered LES neuromuscular function, may contribute to the symptomatic benefit by decreasing refluxate volume. Recently it was proven that the distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction may contribute to determining the volume and constituents of reflux in GERD. [viii] Heartburn and regurgitation {{are more likely to be}} evoked when the refluxate’s proximal extent is high, and when volume and acid clearance are delayed. Symptomatic acid reflux episodes have a higher proximal extent and a longer clearance time, suggestive of a higher refluxate volume[ix]. By reducing the distensibility of the gastro-esophageal junction, the volume of the refluxate will be lower and the probability to be symptomatic higher. Small volumes of reflux will be picked up by a pH probe but will not cause symptoms. Thus, the Stretta® procedure could selectively decrease the more symptomatic large volume episodes, while distal esophageal acid exposure measured with a pH probe may not change substantially. Through such a mechanism, reduction of distensibility could help to explain the discrepancy between symptomatic improvement and lack of normalization of pH monitoring. D. Impedance Esophageal impedance monitoring and pH-monitoring were used concomitantly to evaluate the influence on all types of reflux episodes and their proximal extent after the Endocinch procedure. We found a clear improvement in reflux time (p< 0. 001) after endoscopic gastroplication, nearly normalizing to 1. 2 %. However, pH monitoring showed a significant reduction of pathologic acid reflux but not a normalization. The study showed a reduction of liquid and acid reflux episodes. Esophageal volume clearance was slightly improved and the total number of proximal reflux episodes was reduced. The last two observations indicate that the volume and proximal extent of the refluxate are reduced after the Endocinch® procedure. The reduction in the number of reflux episodes reaching the proximal esophagus after endoscopic gastroplication observed in the present study can help to clarify some of the discrepancy in the degree of improvement between symptoms and acid reflux parameters, because proximal esophageal extent of gastric acid is a main determinant of reflux perception, irrespective of acid exposure time of the distal esophageal mucosa[x]. E. Placebo effect One could argue that the results obtained by these procedures are a striking illustration of a placebo effect, where symptoms improve and objective parameters like pH monitoring hardly improve. However, in a sham controlled trial we found a significant symptomatic benefit in favor of the Stretta® procedure 4. Several other sham controlled randomised studies in the literature also showed significant clinical benefit for the Stretta®, Endocinch® and Enteryx® procedures[xi], [xii], [xiii]. The question remains how well these randomised studies were really blinded for the patients. The three active procedures are followed by more adverse events, such as shoulder pain or chest pain, compared to the respective sham groups. Such differential side effect profile may cause a partial unblinding if the patients are able to distinguish whether they had an active procedure or sham procedure. Through such unblinding, the placebo effect which was supposed to be eliminated by the double-blind sham control, could potentially be re-introduced. An ideal endoluminal anti-reflux procedure should also be effective at the long-term. We evaluated the effect of Endocinch® and Stretta® procedure 3 to 5 years after the intervention. This long-term follow-up showed a significant improvement of symptoms compared to pre-treatment status, although most of the patients are still taking PPIs on a regular basis. However, these results are insufficient to promote these endoluminal therapies in daily clinical practice. First of all, these data are uncontrolled and the natural history of GERD poorly responding to PPI’s after 3 to 5 years is unknown. Moreover, the procedures are relatively costly, not devoid of side-effects, and only effective in a unidentifiable subgroup of patients. Unfortunately, our experience seems to indicate that the other alternative, surgery, is also far from ideal in the group of patients with persisting symptoms despite an Endocinch® or Stretta® procedure. Symptoms were not significantly better in those we referred for surgery, and most of these patients continued to take PPIs. Our studies have identified two other mechanisms that may contribute to symptomatic benefit of endoscopic anti-reflux procedures. The first is a decreased distensibility of the LES, which may reduce the volume and proximal extent of reflux events. The other is a decreased sensitivity of the distal esophagus, although the exact underlying mechanism remains to be identified. Research in novel medical and endoscopic approaches to GERD is ongoing at full speed, and hopefully some of these research lines will lead to solutions that can address some of the unmet needs in current GERD therapy.

40|$|BackgroundPatients with {{functional}} heartburn (FH) experience troublesome heartburn that is {{not related}} to gastroesophageal reflux. The etiology of the heartburn sensation in FH patients is unknown. In patients with reflux disease, esophageal hypersensitivity seems associated with impaired mucosal integrity. We aimed to determine esophageal sensitivity and mucosal integrity in FH and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) patients. MethodsIn this prospective experimental study, we performed an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and upper endoscopy with biopsies in 12 patients with NERD and nine patients with FH. Mucosal integrity was measured during endoscopy using electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and biopsy specimens were analyzed in Ussing chambers for transepithelial electrical resistance and transepithelial permeability. Key ResultsLag time to heartburn perception was significantly longer in FH patients (median 12 min) than in NERD patients (median 3 min). Once perceived, intensity of heartburn was scored equal with median visual analog scale 6. 5 and 7. 1 respectively. Esophageal mucosal integrity was also comparable between FH and NERD patients, both in vivo extracellular impedance and ex vivo transepithelial resistance and permeability were similar. Conclusions & InferencesPatients with FH did not show acid hypersensitivity as seen in patients with NERD. However, once perceived, intensity of heartburn is similar. Esophageal mucosal integrity is similar between NERD and FH patients, and is therefore unlikely to be the underlying cause of the observed difference in esophageal acid perceptio...|$|R
40|$|Increased esophageal {{sensitivity}} and impaired mucosal integrity {{have both been}} described in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, but the relationship between hyper{{sensitivity and}} mucosal integrity is unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate acid sensitivity in patients with erosive and nonerosive reflux disease and control subjects to determine the relation with functional esophageal mucosal integrity changes as well as to investigate cellular mechanisms of impaired mucosal integrity in these patients. In this prospective experimental study, 12 patients with nonerosive reflux disease, 12 patients with esophagitis grade A or B, and 11 healthy control subjects underwent an <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and upper endoscopy. Mucosal integrity was measured during endoscopy by electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and biopsy specimens were analyzed in Ussing chambers for transepithelial electrical resistance, transepithelial permeability and gene expression of tight junction proteins and filaggrin. Patients with nonerosive reflux disease and esophagitis were more sensitive to <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> compared with control subjects, having a shorter time to perception of heartburn and higher perceived intensity of heartburn. In reflux patients, enhanced acid sensitivity was associated with impairment of in vivo and vitro esophageal mucosal integrity. Mucosal integrity was significantly impaired in patients with esophagitis, displaying higher transepithelial permeability and lower extracellular impedance. Although no significant differences in the expression of tight junction proteins were found in biopsies among patient groups, mucosal integrity parameters in reflux patients correlated negatively with the expression of filaggrin. In conclusion, sensitivity to acid is enhanced in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, irrespective of the presence of erosions, and is associated with impaired esophageal mucosal integrity. Mucosal integrity of the esophagus is associated with the expression of filaggri...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{test the}} {{usefulness}} of upper gastrointestinal investigations {{and quality of life}} assessment in Chinese patients with non-cardiac chest pain. Methods: Seventy-eight consecutive patients with noncardiac chest pain underwent upper endoscopy. Eight patients had upper gastrointestinal pathology (10 %). The remaining 70 patients received <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test,</b> oesophageal manometry and 24 -h ambulatory oesophageal pH (n = 65) /manometry (n = 61), and the results were compared with those of healthy controls (n = 20). Symptoms and quality of life (SF- 36) were assessed by standard validated questionnaire. Results: Significant acid reflux symptoms were present in five (5 / 70. 7 %) patients. Abnormal 24 -h oesophageal pH, indicating gastro-oesophageal reflux, was found in 19 (19 / 65, 29 %) patients. The percentage of simultaneous contractions was higher and the percentage peristalsis was lower in patients with non-cardiac chest pain when compared with normal subjects by 24 -h ambulatory manometry. Patients with non-cardiac chest pain had a lower SF- 36 score when compared to controls. Conclusions: Typical acid reflux symptoms are uncommon in Chinese patients with non-cardiac chest pain, but abnormal 24 -h pH results, indicating gastro-oesophageal reflux, were found in 29 % of patients. Ineffective contractions were more frequently found in patients with non-cardiac chest pain by 24 -h ambulatory manometry, which may have a bearing on the impaired quality of life in such patients. Upper gastrointestinal investigations are useful for the evaluation of Chinese patients with non-cardiac chest pain. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Heartburn symptom relief/resolution was subsequently evaluated. Results: In this study population, no relationship was apparent between esomeprazole dosage and efficacy variables for sustained heartburn resolution (seven days without symptoms) at week 4 (48. 0 %, 44. 0 %, and 41. 4 % for esomeprazole 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, and 40 mg twice daily, respectively). Nocturnal heartburn resolution with esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily showed a numeric improvement trend versus esomeprazole 20 and 40 mg once daily, {{but this was not}} statistically significant.

40|$|Background: Patients with Barrett's {{esophagus}} (BE) {{usually have}} severe gastroesophageal reflux. However, {{they often have}} surprisingly few reflux symptoms. We hypothesized that BE patients are less sensitive to acid than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients without Barrett {{and that this is}} due to an unusual preservation of mucosal integrity of the squamous epithelium prohibiting transepithelial acid diffusion. Methods: We prospectively analyzed esophageal sensitivity and esophageal mucosal integrity in GERD patients with and without BE and healthy subjects. An <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed and mucosal integrity was assessed in vivo by electrical tissue impedance spectroscopy and ex vivo by Ussing chamber experiments with biopsy specimens. Key Results: Gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with BE were less sensitive to acid than GERD patients without BE, but more sensitive to acid than healthy controls (time to perception Barrett's 14. 0 minutes, GERD 4. 6 minutes, controls 17. 5 minutes). However, extracellular impedance (6. 2 and 5. 7 vs 8. 4 x 10 (3) /m) and transepithelial resistance (94. 0 and 89 vs 118 /cm(2)) was similar in BE and GERD patients and significantly lower than in healthy subjects. Transepithelial fluorescein flux was equally increased in GERD patients with and without BE (1. 6 and 1. 7 x 10 (3) vs 0. 6 x 10 (3) nmol/cm(2) /h). Conclusions & Inferences: Esophageal hypersensitivity to acid is less pronounced in BE patients than in GERD patients without Barrett. However, mucosal integrity of the squamous epithelium is equally impaired in GERD patients with and without Barrett, indicating that factors other than esophageal mucosal barrier integrity explain the difference in acid sensitivity between those with BE and those withou...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the influence of acute psychological stress on oesophageal acid perception. In 15 healthy volunteers and 10 GORD patients with a positive symptom-reflux association an oesophageal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed, once with and once without the presence of an acute psychological stressor (IQ test). The order of the measurements was randomized. The time from onset of the acid infusion to first acid perception, discomfort and pain was noted. Blood pressure was measured to assess the effect of the stress task. In healthy volunteers, the time to first perception (control task: 617 +/- 174 s vs stress task: 561 +/- 162 s), discomfort (control task: 969 +/- 158 s vs stress task: 940 +/- 151 s) or pain (control task: 1393 +/- 122 s vs stress task: 1366 +/- 121 s) did not differ significantly between both measurements. In GORD patients, no significant differences between both measurements were found either in time to first perception (control task: 63 +/- 26 s vs stress task: 43 +/- 15 s), discomfort (control task: 153 +/- 44 s vs stress task: 249 +/- 62 s) or pain (control task: 558 +/- 139 s vs stress task: 633 +/- 118 s). Systolic blood pressure rose significantly during the stress task in both the healthy volunteers (6 +/- 1 mmHg) and the GORD patients (9 +/- 2 mmHg).

Of the 71 NCCP patients, 35 had a positive AP test (of whom 20 had an abnormal 24 hour pH) and 36 had a negative AP test (of whom 14 had an abnormal 24 hour pH study). Thus, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the AP test in this group was 59 %, 59 %, 57 %, and 61 %, respectively. The corresponding values in the oesophagitis group were 85 %, 67 %, 94 %, and 40 %. In the NCCP group when heartburn alone was used as the positive criterion the PPV rose to 74 %. When chest pain with or without heartburn was used, however, the PPV dropped to 38 %. A 'symptom index' was used to define the number of chest pain episodes that were caused by acid reflux. Only 48 % of AP test positive patients had demonstrable acid mediated chest pain. In the NCCP population with a normal oesophageal examination (1) AP test reproduction of chest pain is poorly predictive of GORD; (2) AP test reproduction of heartburn is more predictive of GORD but does not ensure that the chest pain is caused by GORD; (3) a negative AP test does not exclude GORD and (4) only 48 % of AP test positive patients have demonstrable acid mediated chest pain.

Experiments were performed on adult cats. Esophageal manometry and barostat were performed before, 24 h after, and every 7 days after intraesophageal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion</b> (0. 1 N HCl, 80 min).

At 24 h, distal peristaltic contractions disappeared, lower esophageal sphincter pressure was reduced by 60 %, the esophagus length was 1 - 2 cm shorter, and esophageal compliance was reduced by 30 %.

Subsequent repeated acute injuries induced similar endoscopic esophagitis but a different pattern of inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis in the mucosa and muscle layers, resulting in milder motor disturbances.

40|$|The {{pathophysiology}} {{of functional}} dyspepsia (FD) is unknown and several mechanisms associated with specific symptom patterns have been recently proposed. Increased duodenal acid exposure has been {{supposed to be}} associated with nausea, but recently an increase of severity of several dyspeptic symptoms was noted in a subset of dyspeptic patients. As its pathogenetic role is still unclear, we evaluated an involvement of duodenal acid exposure in symptom generation by inducing a hyperacidity status of the duodenum. Twelve young adult healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind protocol, underwent duodenal acid (0. 2 N, 5 mL min(- 1)) or saline perfusion, antropyloroduodenal manometry and duodenal pH monitoring both during fasting and postprandially. Every 15 min, severity of discomfort, fullness, bloating, belching, nausea, heartburn, epigastric burning, satiety and pain were evaluated by visual analogue scale. During <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion,</b> symptom scores for discomfort, bloating, nausea, epigastric burning were significantly higher (P < 0. 01) compared to saline. Postprandial antral motility index was lower (2. 96 +/- 1. 8 vs 3. 62 +/- 1. 8, P = 0. 01) and jejunal motility index higher (4. 87 +/- 1. 0 vs 4. 37 +/- 1. 4, P = 0. 01) during <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion.</b> Occurrence and duration of phases III of the migrating motor complex showed no difference.

The efficacy of treatment is usually evaluated by clinical trial which includes leaving a small non-functional catheter in situ and following liver function tests. The evaluation may be effectively {{done by the}} biliary manometric <b>perfusion</b> <b>test.</b> Aim: The aim {{of this paper is}} to emphasize the importance of percutaneous dilatation treatment of benign biliary strictures with focus on the role of the biliary manometric <b>perfusion</b> <b>test</b> and its future prospects. Methods and Results: Based on the literature and our own experience, this article gives a short overview of percutaneous treatment of benign biliary strictures, indications, techniques, complications and results. The treatment of these strictures has an overall success rate between 60 to 90 %. This article also explains the biliary manometric test, the technique and its importance in evaluation of treatment success.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Duodenal acid {{exposure}} induces a duodenogastric reflex {{resulting in}} gastric relaxation, inhibition of antral motility, and sensitization of the proximal stomach to distension. Duodenal hypersensitivity to acid {{has been identified}} as a potential pathogenic mechanism in functional dyspepsia. The nature and localization of the duodenal acid-sensitive receptors are still elusive. We hypothesize that acid directly activates superficial afferent nerve endings in the duodenal mucosa, triggering the duodenogastric reflex. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in 13 healthy volunteers, benzocaine, a local anesthetic, vs saline was perfused in the duodenum 15  min before duodenal <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion.</b> Gastric responses were monitored by a barostat. Stepwise isobaric gastric distensions were performed before and during <b>acid</b> <b>perfusion.</b> Symptoms were evaluated by visual analogue scales for six dyspeptic symptoms and an overall perception score. KEY RESULTS: Benzocaine perfusion caused a relaxation of the stomach prior to duodenal acidification, indicating the existence of an excitatory duodenogastric tone. Pretreatment of the duodenum with benzocaine reduced the acid-induced gastric relaxation by 50 % and abolished the inhibition of phasic motility of the proximal stomach. Finally, sensitization to distension was more pronounced in the benzocaine condition because of higher proximal gastric volumes. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: These findings support a model in which different neuronal subpopulations are responsible for the motor and sensory limb of the acid-sensitive duodenogastric reflex, making benzocaine an unsuitable drug to treat duodenal hypersensitivity to acid. These data provide more insight in the contribution of duodenal neuronal input to gastric physiology in the fasting state. status: publishe...|$|R
