Acevedo explained in an interview, [...] "Charlie goes {{out on this}} call, and he gets attacked by this mythological, genetically enhanced griffin. He fights for his life throughout the episode". Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her. Acevedo explained his choice was because, [...] "to create intimacy with someone who you don't know is actually not going to work. So to have your real wife do it, then you can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> on screen".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to 1941 spring training, Gee {{traveled}} to Ann Arbor to train with Michigan's coach Fisher and [...] "in an effort to recover his former ability and work the kinks out from his ailing arm." [...] Gee told reporters, [...] "I'm placing myself entirely under Fisher's directions.... He taught me all I know and he's the one who can straighten me out." [...] He worked out daily with Fisher at the Yost Fieldhouse on the University of Michigan campus. In late January 1941, Fisher told the press: [...] "All the soreness seems to be out. We don't know for sure until he starts bearing down next week, but Johnny should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> pitcher this year. He's only 25 and should have a lot of good baseball ahead of him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The team based {{the level}} design around a small Mario, {{intending}} to later make his size bigger {{in the final}} version. Then they {{decided it would be}} fun to let Mario change his size via a power-up. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in the first level of the game, the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released. The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the [...] "Mushroom Kingdom". Miyamoto said the shell-kicking 1-up trick was designed and carefully tested, but [...] "people turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> at pulling the trick off for ages on end than we thought".|$|E

"You'll go {{nearer to}} it over that, than over {{anything}} else: {{just because a}} lot of ignorant monkeys want a monkey of their own sort to do the Union work, and jabber to them, they {{want to get rid of}} you, and you eat your heart out about it. More fool you, that's all I say--more fool you. If you cared for your wife and children half what you care about your Union, you'd <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> pleased in the end. But you care about nothing but a lot of ignorant colliers, who don't know what they want except it's more money just for themselves.

People who go off and leave things for half a year shouldn't expect to find them just as they left them. My, my, my what a dreadful noise! Why don't they all get {{together}} and drive Bully and Mrs. Bully out of the Old Orchard? If they don't I'm afraid he will drive them out. No one likes to live with such quarrelsome neighbors. They don't belong over in this country, anyway, and we would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> off if they were not here. But I must say I do have to admire their spunk." ...|$|E

'You'll notice,' said I, 'that the sails are not all set, and for some reason the wind does not serve. When the engines are mended, we shall probably go spinning along.' She looked as if she was trying to appear satisfied. 'Thank you, sir,' she said. 'I hope we may shortly proceed on our way, but in the meantime I shall not say anything to my father about this detention. I think he has not noticed it.' 'That would be very wise,' I replied, and as she turned toward the companionway I was wild to say to her that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> for her to stay on deck, and get some good fresh air, instead of cooping herself up in that close cabin; but I didn't know her well enough for that." ...|$|E

60|$|Just as I {{got close}} up behind Jone, {{and was about}} to make a rush past him, his man turned into a side street. Of course I turned too, and then I put on steam, and, giving a laugh as I turned around to look at Jone, I charged on, {{intending}} to stop in a minute and have some fun in hearing what Jone had to say about it; but you may believe, ma'am, that I was amazed when I saw only a little way in front of me the bath-chair stand where we had hired our machines! And all the bath-chair men were standing there with their mouths wide open, staring at a woman running along the street, pulling an old bath-chair man in a bath-chair! For a second I felt like dropping the handle I held and making a rush for {{the front door of the}} hotel, which was right ahead of me; and then I thought, as now I was in for it, it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> to put a good face on the matter, and not look as if I had done anything I was ashamed of, and so I just slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the Old Hall. Four or five of the bath-chair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party I was pulling, and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife.|$|E

Because Dubenich contracts with the government, he could be {{in a lot of trouble}} due to regulations concerning contact with foreign nationals and that things would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> for him if he still had an undeposited check.

5000|$|Stunned Arnall {{supporters}} {{announced a}} write-in candidacy {{for the general}} election, insisting that Georgians must {{have the option of}} a moderate Democrat beside the conservatives Maddox and Callaway. In his general election campaign, Maddox equated the Callaway Republicans to the American Civil War and the 1864 March to the Sea waged in Georgia by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman. He criticized the Callaway family textile mill, which he alleged had kept wages at $10 a week in Troup County. Maddox said that Callaway was unable to relate to farmers, small businessmen, and the unemployed ... He would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> off if he knew about people as well as dollars."

5000|$|The {{theme of}} black exceptionality is {{explored}} in {{the characters of}} Gunnar and Scoby. Both Gunnar and Scoby represent [...] "the talented tenth", in that they escape Hillside {{and go on to}} higher education and promising futures. However, their successes are perceived differently by the white community. Scoby, the perfect Basketball player who is incapable of missing a basketball shot, is vilified and perceived as the pagan African demon with mystical powers. In contrast, Gunnar, a great player but not as good as Scoby, becomes “white society’s mercenary”. He is accepted, tolerated, and claimed by whiteness, because of his lack of apparent blackness. Because Gunnar has never fulfilled the stereotypical [...] "black" [...] role, whites view him as less of a deviance from the hegemonic ideals. This is a larger commentary on where Blacks are allowed to be in the social hierarchy, and the limitations placed on their successes. Gunnar comments of the white community’s treatment of Scoby saying “they would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> off if they simply called Scoby a god and left it at that, it's no way they’ll proclaim a skinny black man God”.|$|E
