40|$|A recent {{increase}} in the number of <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> downtime events at the Client’s sites and a changing economic environment has prompted the need for a better understanding of <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> resistance loads occurring at site. A better understanding of the loads actually occurring at site will be used to make recommendations on how the current design process could be improved. The Bruff and TUNRA methods currently used for <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> design were reviewed and used to predict the pressure of the <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> hydraulic drive system for a range of initial fill bin levels. Trials were then carried out at one of the Client’s iron ore sites to verify these design predictions over a range of bin levels. The results of the trial indicate that the current design methods significantly over-predict belt feed resistance. These prediction methods also fail to predict the relationship between initial start-up pull out force and initial fill bin level. The results suggest that an arched stress field is partially formed in the hopper during the filling process resulting in significantly lower initial pull-out forces. This implies that a smaller drive system could have been used for this particular application, potentially resulting in significantly reduced installation costs. The results do not, however, provide enough evidence to be able to confidently state that the pull-out force on a <b>belt</b> <b>feeder</b> in a different application would also be significantly less than the TUNRA prediction. Further trials need to be done, and the results from this project have shown that further investigation is warranted...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of species-specific behaviors for animals in zoological institutions is of top priority, as this can help ensure {{high levels of}} animal welfare.

Results suggest that automatic <b>belt</b> <b>feeders</b> that can feed at randomized times, will have the largest impact on behavior of all enrichment tested. However, there were individual differences observed between animals and the level of impact on their behavior. Using enrichment to increase the amount of time that zoo-housed gorillas spend searching for, acquiring, and consuming food can increase their overall activity levels and shift their behavior towards a more naturalistic direction...|$|R

The experimental diets were fed to three replicate groups of fish in flow through fibreglass tanks (1  m 3), with 6 fish per tank. During the experiment, water temperature was maintained at 4 – 6  °C. The water flow was approximately 15  L min− 1. Dissolved oxygen was maintained in a controlled system with oxygen meters recording the inlet water. The fish were fed twice daily, by using <b>belt</b> <b>feeders,</b> with a total daily allowance of 2  % of body weight, during the 4 -week experiment. The fish accepted the experimental diets and no mortality was observed during the experiment. Fish weight was recorded {{at the beginning and}} end of the experiment, in order to confirm that the fish had consumed the test diets and had a positive energy balance. The fish gain in weight on all diets, with the highest value for the ST and FM diet and less on the FZ diet, with a mean weight gain of 69.1, 59.2 and 14.1  g, respectively.

40|$|Abstract [...] - Automation is the {{technology}} that helps in meeting the increasing pace of development and industrialization. The increasing demand of productivity in terms of quality and quantity, increase in pressure for meeting the deadlines and the decrease in the availability of cheap labour {{has led to a}} tremendous increase in the research and development of the different tools that automate the production either directly or indirectly. The aim of our work is to design, fabricate and analyse the performance of a magnetic <b>belt</b> type <b>feeder,</b> which feeds the ferromagnetic parts in desired orientation and feed rate. A physical prototype of a conveyor type magnetic feeder was constructed and the feeding behaviour was studied experimentally by varying the input parameters such as speed of conveying, number of magnets and part population. Analysis was done by feeding cylindrical parts with large diameter to length ratio. The profile of the chute helps in orienting the parts along their length which is difficult to orient by conventional feeders. A study on the experimental setup was performed and conclusions were drawn about the effect of various parameters on the feed rate...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in almost all industrial processes handling molten metal is the accurate dosing of powder metal. This is particularly crucial in the pharmaceutical and food industries. The article looks at a new dosing system using an innovative new screw feed, analysing the results of tests {{carried out in the}} WAM Spa laboratories. The screw feed doser was developed to respond to the growing demand for an accurate dosing system {{as an alternative to the}} conventional weighing conveyor <b>belts.</b> Screw <b>feeders</b> are known for their simple construction and reliability. Originally developed for use in the food industry they have gone on to find application in a wide range of industries. The screw feed is a closed system capable of handling volatile material. Another important advantage is that it is as economical and as efficient as weighing belts. The screw feed system consists of a screw feed, weigh bridge and automatic checking and regulating system. The tests carried out produced satisfactory results, showing this system to be efficient and reliable. This system can certainly be used instead of a weighing belt in many applications, although in others the weighing conveyor belt cannot be replaced. Future developments in the screw feed system look very interesting although there is still a long way to go in terms of realising its full potential...|$|R

All species of reef fishes were visually assessed {{in the central}} and southern Mexican Caribbean in eight fringing reefs, four {{of which are in}} a protected biosphere reserve. The sampling design included three spatial scales from tens of meters to tens of kilometers. A total of 9, 908 individuals belonging to 128 species and 43 families were identified in 144 <b>belt</b> transects. Zooplankton <b>feeders</b> were the most important trophic group by number of individuals; plant and detritus feeders dominated by number of species.

Regression analyses showed significant inverse relationships between total fish species density and macroalgal index (a proxy for macroalgal biomass) and, for “large ” (≥ 25 cm diameter) stony corals, partial-colony mortality and live/dead ratio. Significant inverse relationships were also found between mean abundance of the plant and detritus feeders guild and macroalgal index and macroalgae abundance. Geomorphological factors and anthropogenic impacts, both positive (protection) in the reserve and negative (fishing and tourism) in unprotected areas, may explain these spatial patterns in reef-fish community structure...|$|R
40|$|The coal {{handling}} process involves {{a number of}} activities from loading and unloading to stockpile. This procedure {{can be carried out}} by coal conveying system which includes a large number of mechanical equipment. The important activities under {{coal handling}} include loading/unloading, dumping, transporting etc. which are done with the help of various mechanical equipment. Every organization wants to profit as much as possible and increases their production rate by using maximum effort for care and maintain. And it is possible if the equipment is running in good condition with zero breakdowns, zero accident, and zero wastage. This research work presents a practical analysis for monitoring the operational performance of equipment, which shows the two additional objectives: the first one is the identification of major causes of production losses which are born from malfunctions, breakdowns, and bad operating programme. And the second one is the implementation of a suitable and appropriate methodology for improvement of coal handling systems, which handling the coal from bunker to stockyard within an industry. The data are analyzed and compared with World class to Obtained OEE. During the operation, many reasons are there, which affect the production rate called six big losses. To minimize the six big losses and improve productivity, an accurate effective estimation of equipment is necessary and offers a suitable methodology. For the purpose of the study, a case study methodology is applied in order to analyze in the depth of maintenance in a real context. The primary focus of this research work is to monitor the equipment performance in coal handling plants and its contribution to the company for overall operation. The OEE data are recorded through tables and compared to world class OEE considering the operational losses and also performance reports are briefly analyzed through figures in terms of equipment failures in different locations, idle time for materials, operators and speed loss time for minor stoppages like sensor blocked, cleaning/checking or component jamming. For minimizing the downtime and promote productivity, a suitable methodology is developed through tables for determining the status of coal handling equipment viz. Tippler, Side arm charger, Reversible apron <b>feeder,</b> <b>Belt</b> conveyor system, Stacker, Reclaimer. This research work deals with the quantitative measurement of equipment performance in coal handling plant, which defines losses for many reasons. As a result, valuable information is provided concerning the performance monitoring of production equipment and implementing a suitable methodology for improvement of coal handling machinery operations viz tippler, side arm charger, reversible apron <b>feeder,</b> <b>belt</b> conveyor, stacker, reclaimer. Introduce the estimation and evaluation of OEE procedure which is highly valid and accurate performance indicator and has become very popular in all the industries starting from mining area for excavation of material to harbour area for material handling. OEE shows a right metrics to analyze the ordinary issue and improving the whole process. There are many formulas, systems and metrics being used to improve the whole production process, but one and only OEE reduces complex problem into easy. The biggest advantage of OEE allows companies to have separate business functions by applying a single easy to understand the formula.

40|$|Material {{handling}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{the most important}} and in fact an indispensable job in industries for it is encountered at every stage right from the time raw materials enter the factory gate to the point when it leaves in form of finished products. The engineering of material handling falls under two categories depending on form of material: bulk solid handling and unit handling. In case of handling lumpy materials like coals etc., feeder plays a vital role as an uninterrupted source of uniform feed provider to the conveyor system. Although several <b>feeders</b> like <b>belt,</b> apron, screw, <b>feeders</b> etc are available, reciprocating feeders are still in use because it ensures a continuous and controlled feed rate, is low in cost, its drive mechanism is simple, it can handle wide range of miscellaneous materials including lumps, easy in assembly and disassembly and maintenance requirement is quite low. The challenge which we have taken via the project, is to design a drive mechanism for a reciprocating coal feeder. We call it a challenge because we have to design various intricate components like couplings, worm reducers, gearbox etc. We call it complicated since all the components are interdependent on each other to a great extent. So we cannot design anything randomly. We have to take into considerations the smallest of small things like the various forces acting, how each component can fail under various stress conditions. We have to optimize everything right from the motor selection, to speed reduction ratio selection, to the capacity of coal which we can handle. We are going to follow the above-mentioned strategies so that our project does not remain just a theory but can become a reality for industries...|$|R
