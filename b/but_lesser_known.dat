500|$|At {{the front}} of the Civil Rights Movement, {{alongside}} such leaders as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, <b>but</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>known,</b> was Pauli Murray, an outspoken woman who protested {{discrimination on the basis of}} race and sex. She coined the term [...] "Jane Crow", which demonstrated Murray's belief that Jim Crow laws also negatively affected African-American women. She was determined to work with other activists to put a halt to both racism and sexism. Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", delivered in Washington, D.C. in 1964, sheds light on the long struggle of African-American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes. Pauli Murray ultimately helped advance the American Civil Rights Movement by letting her audience know that women's rights were just as important as civil rights.|$|E

In [...] "Panther Phobia Manifesto", Falco referenced lines from influences as disparate as William S. Burroughs, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Howlin' Wolf, Rod Serling, French psychedelic band The Dum Dum Boys, and Dadaist poet Louis Aragon, in wishing a [...] "huge firedamp explosion" [...] to closed-minded members of society who blindly follow the dictates of the establishment.

This idiosyncratic survey delves into areas of quantum information processing {{of interest to}} researchers in areas like information retrieval, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It overviews intriguing <b>but</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>known</b> results, corrects common misconceptions, and suggests research directions. Three types of applications of a quantum viewpoint on information processing are discussed: quantum algorithms and protocols; quantum proofs for classical results; the use of formalisms developed for quantum mechanics in other areas with linear algebraic or probabilistic components. This paper is not tutorial in nature; readers new to the field should read it {{in conjunction with a}} tutorial (Rieffel & Polak 2000) or book (Nielsen & Chuang 2001; Rieffel & Polak in preparation) on the subject. A number of themes underlie this paper: certainty in quantum algorithms and quantum mechanics, including a “fewer worlds ” correction to popular conceptions of the “many worlds ” interpretation of quantum mechanics; relations and distinct differences between probability theory and quantum mechanics, including how entanglement differs from correlation; what is known and what remains uncertain as to the source of the power of quantum information processing. The most startling thing about quantum mechanics is not that it is probabilistic, but rather that it disobeys fundamental laws of probability theory. A common framework encompassing both probability theory and quantum mechanics throws light on many of these themes. The most technical parts of the paper establish this framework and discuss its implications...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{questions}} in condensed matter physics concerns what other phases compete with superconductivity in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors. One candidate is the "stripe" phase, in which the carriers (holes) condense into rivers of charge separating regions of antiferromagnetism. A related <b>but</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>known</b> system is the "spin ladder", which consists of two coupled chains of magnetic ions forming an array of rungs. A doped ladder {{can be thought of}} as a high-Tc material with lower dimensionality, and has been predicted to exhibit both superconductivity and an insulating "hole crystal" phase in which the carriers are localised through many-body interactions. The competition between the two resembles that between static stripes and superconductivity in high-Tc materials. Here we report evidence, from resonant x-ray scattering, for the existence of a hole crystal in the doped spin ladder of Sr 14 Cu 24 O 41. This phase exists without a detectable distortion in the structural lattice, indicating it arises from many-body effects. Our measurements confirm theoretical predictions and support the picture that proximity to charge ordered states is a general property of superconductivity in copper-oxides.

40|$|Steven Pinker is {{something}} of a rarity in academic psychology, a literary stylist. In addition to his best-selling, prize-winning trade books, from The Language Instinct in 1994 to The Better Angels of Our Nature in 2011, he has accumulated a respectable <b>but</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>known</b> list of articles in serious academic journals. Language, Cognition, and Human Nature: Selected Articles is a collection of his favorites, covering the period from 1979 to 2010. A potboiler? Perhaps so, but these articles do allow the general reader to discover gems of writing that might otherwise escape attention. Some of them are probably unknown even to academics because they were published in relatively obscure outlets. In his introduction, Pinker notes the pain of publishing in respectable journals: The process of getting an article accepted for publication in an academic journal {{is by far the most}} unpleasant experience in intellectual life, since it requires devoting time and brainpower to making one’s article worse in an abject effort to satisfy the whims of an anonymous referee. (p. x) That comment alone may be worth the price of the book, especially to neophyte academics struggling to crack the publishing game. If even Pinker has problems, then their ow...|$|E

This grant is helping to create an Indigenous garden at the BSU community gardens land. The project involves {{the construction of a}} wetu, a traditional native dwelling, and the preparation, planting and tending of a “three-sisters” and medicinal garden. The garden and the wetu are being constructed by local Native participants. Additionally, local Native peoples will be instructed in the ways of their ancestors. This Indigenous garden {{is a reflection of the}} university’s mission and strategic plan, emphasizing diversity and inclusion and most especially, the use of our resources to support and advance culture in the region. Students and community members will be able to observe the site on a regular basis and to learn from the perspective of Native peoples about the purpose of the traditional aspects of the gardens, and the construction and maintenance of the wetu. Students can do coursework related to the construction and gardening. Traditional plants, tools, and vessels and their uses will be demonstrated and discussed. There will be onsite activities, ceremonies, and performances (drumming, meals, etc.) at which the public and the BSU community can take part in these social and learning experiences.
