With cave radio equipment, there has been a trend away from the use of {{induction}} loop antennas to the use of so-called earth-current antennas, i. e. long wires grounded at both ends. Both the HeyPhone and Nicola system use this type of antenna. However, the popular explanation for how this antenna works is fallacious. The antenna does not operate by allowing the current to flow in a 'big loop' in the ground, nor is it a 'conduction mode' of operation. In fact, it does not depend, fundamentally, on current flow in the ground at all.

40|$|This study’s {{focus is}} Jesus’ {{significant}} {{representation of the}} kingdom of God utilizable for mission today – a topic of importance for contemporary Christianity’s sustainable reaction to a globalizing world. Christianity should {{not have to be a}} spectator to globalization but one of its agents, one of the forces at work by extending interconnection between peoples, shared ideas and promoted social, political and cultural links. How should Christian churches conceive of their mission within the context of a globalizing world? It is remarkable that after two millennia of Jesus’ life, ‘mission in the kingdom of God’ is still of great importance for human life on earth. Indeed, contemporary secularists might not commend religion with the custody of such a fundamental burden of responsibility. Yet, considering the times we live in, a foundation of sustainable values for earth are inescapably important. Nevertheless, from what foundational values does Christianity draw to bear witness of the divine in a secular age? When considering all the factors mentioned, what foundational ethics and virtues of Christianity that we bear witness to are still believable in a secular age? The purpose of this study is not to provide a complete response to the question of mission of the church in a globalizing world, but to establish a framework within which answers may be sought. The study is informed from a variety of disciplines such as politics, cultural theory and politics, which are not the usual fields of New Testament Studies. Therefore, this study presents itself in five chapters informing one another. Chapter 1 addresses the issues that surface from current missional reaction and the broader implications that globalization has on changing social and institutional realities and the churches’ response to it. Chapter 2 identifies indispensable characteristics of the early twentieth century Social Gospel movement to implement those values as essential building blocks in globalized mission. In Chapter 3 investigates the potential use of Postcolonial Theory for categorizing postcolonial characteristics of marginalization, oppression, neo-imperialism and neocolonialism. Chapter 4 applies the outcomes of Chapter 1 through 3 with which Richard Horsley’s proposed perspective on Jesus’ mission in Roman Palestine as the ‘renewal of Israel’ is considered to discern about the first century world and the implications it has for the third millennium. The Christian faith, among others, has marginalizing practices derived from centuries old traditions and biased interpretations of Scripture. We see examples of it strewn over two millennia. Chapter 5 concludes this cursory study by summarizing the valuable and constructive characteristics in mission, globalization, postcolonial studies and the Social Gospel. These characteristics can inform the Christian faith in its responsibility of living, and letting others participate, through ‘mission’, in the kingdom of God. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not, what is still believable today about the significant life of Jesus?Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 New Testament StudiesPhDUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|M. Litt. et Phil. The {{role of the}} Spirit in the Eschatological Ethics of Revelation was a {{topic that}} has given me Great Joy to learn {{in the book of}} Revelation the role of the Spirit, Eschatology and Ethics. In this book I have {{discovered}} the plan of Salvation which was laid before the foundation of the World in a very clear manner. God, The Master of the universe, revealed to John the final story of this world's history, at the Isles of Patmos. The Trinity is well explained and even their duties as the God Head. God The Father, God The Son and God The Holy Ghost of which my dissertation is looking at the office or the role of the Spirit in the Second Coming of Christ. From Genesis to Malachi, it is God the Father who revealed himself to mankind, and from Matthew to Acts 1 : 8., It is God the Son who came in person to reveal God the Father and from Acts 1 : 9 to Revelation it is God the Holy Spirit who will teach us all that God the son could not finish teaching us. The Script is divided into Five Chapters which are the orientation into the book of Revelation, the theology and the ethics of the book of Revelation, the Eschatological Ethics in Revelation, the Holy Spirit in Revelation {{and the role of the}} Spirit and the Eschatological Ethics of Revelation, which is the theme of this script. Then we have the conclusion of the script. There are very few books written on Revelation and let alone on the Spirit but I have tried to outline the role of the spirit in this great book of the Bible and I hope to research further on some issues that are hard in Revelation. It is the book that summarises the history of the World Kingdoms in only 22 Chapters and I have limited mine to only Five Chapters. The Spirit has played the greatest role in Revelation because according to plan it is the time for it to play its role. The last events of this world will be shocking, the devil is angry. In the book of Revelation God calls Himself as the King of kings and Lord of Lords. He is the Almighty God. All creation own their existence to Him. It was one book of the Bible I did not like reading, but the research has helped me to develop some liking for the book. It is the book for our modern generation and unlike the book of Daniel which was to be put away until the end times, this one is to be read and a blessing is pronounce to the one who will read the book. We need to read this book very much and books that are in context should be written about the book. The few books that have been written on Revelation are not all very relevant. They miss the point. Most of them need well researched books to make clear the mysteries that are in Revelation and the Bible explains itself even in other books of the Bible which can also be used to explain the book of Revelation. The book of Daniel even though its in the old Testament, it has a lot in common with the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation opens for the reading of the book of Daniel in the old Testament and for one to understand Revelation well, one needs to read the book of Daniel together with Revelation. The beasts in Daniel are the beasts in Revelation. Even though some people would want to divide the old and the new Testament, they are the same and they interpret each other very well. The new testament has a lot of old testament quotations. I am trying to correct some misinterpretation of some verses found in the Book of Revelation and It will be good for any one who will read this script to read it carefully and critically because in the field of learning we learn by making mistakes and your input will be appreciated. In Revelation the devil is being given the last warning and all those that need life are called to come out of Babylon the Mother of all Harlots <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not come out of her and keep the commandments of God, then we will drink of the wrath of God which will be poured without a mixture for all those that worship the beast and its image...|$|E
40|$|When {{agricultural}} projects fail {{to achieve}} desired results in sub-Saharan Africa, managerial deficiencies are hardly ever mentioned {{as one of}} the major causes of failure. Instead, the cause is often traced to inappropriate technologies. But technologies only make production and productivity 'possible'; it is people who actually achieve production and productivity. The effective and efficient management of people is, therefore, the key to success in agricultural development. Like any other activity, agricultural development everywhere has to be managed effectively and efficiently if its objectives are to be achieved. However, agricultural development in sub-Saharan African countries is a relatively recent enterprise and is yet to be fully understood. This poses serious constraints to the effective and efficient management of agricultural development <b>because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have a good idea of what we are supposed to be managing, how can we decide in what way to do it better? The removal of these managerial constraints to successful development has sometimes been made difficult through the appointment of specialists or technologists, who all too often lacked adequate training in management, to lead institutions involved in agricultural development. This has often resulted in the development of technological interventions at the expense of managerial interventions. Yet, twenty years ago, it was made clear that 'The problem of increased food production is no longer primarily technological, but shows a pervasive managerial deficiency at all levels in assuring the delivery of services to the small farmer, who must make the critical decisions required to increase productivity,' (International Programme for Agricultural Knowledge Systems). However, little heed appears to have been paid to this observation. For example, only one out of a network of eighteen International Agricultural Research Centres specializes in research on how to improve policy and management for agricultural research in developing countries; and many workshops, seminars and symposia aimed at disseminating information to increase agricultural productivity continue to be dominated by technological interventions. This writer is also aware that there are only two institutes in sub-Saharan Africa the Mananga Management Centre (formerly the Mananga Agricultural Management Centre) in Swaziland and the Agricultural and Rural Training Institute in Illorin, Nigeria - whose training programmes are dominated by courses aimed at improving agricultural management. But it is people, not technological interventions, that make production and productivity actually happen. These people have to be managed effectively and efficiently. According to Professor R W Revans, formerly of Manchester University, ' [...] the manager comes first and the technologist afterwards; the manager decides what to do and the technologist provides the materials and the tools to do it; the manager poses the questions and the technologist answers them. It is said that it is easier to answer questions than to ask them; and it is necessary to ask not just any questions, but the right ones. This makes management more difficult than developing technologies and calls for the appointment of specialists to positions of management only after they have acquired and shown the necessary managerial competence. Only then will the right questions be asked and the right decisions be taken. This is crucial in sub-Saharan Africa where success continues to elude agricultural development and where appointments or promotions to managerial positions continue to be based on past performance, long service and sometimes political inclinations. This has often resulted in manifestations of Dr Peter's principle whereby 'people get promoted to their level of incompetence since they are promoted on the basis of performance in the job below, rather than {{on the basis of their}} potential for the job above. ' Thus, someone who has been around longest or performs most creditably in his specialized field is not necessarily the one who must be promoted to become the manager of an agricultural establishment. Seniority and research accomplishment are rarely the sole attributes of a successful research manager, especially if the person lacks the experience and training in research management, as is noted by Mr Amir Muhammed, Chairman, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council in his foreword to the book Research management for development by Dr John Nickel, former Director General of the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT). In summary, we can say that training and systematic preparation in management are essential for all those who are to manage agricultural development. There is wide recognition that the major cause of business failure is incompetent management and it must be accepted that this applies equally to failure of rural development projects. For agricultural development to proceed satisfactorily in Africa, and perhaps in other ACE countries, changes in perception followed by changes in selection and training of managers must be pre-requisites. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTAWhen agricultural projects fail to achieve desired results in sub-Saharan Africa, managerial deficiencies are hardly ever mentioned {{as one of the}} major causes of failure.

40|$|Rt. Hon. Nicholas Braithwaite is Prime Minister of Grenada. Formerly {{he was an}} educationalist. As Youth Planner for the Commonwealth Secretariat he was {{involved}} in educational and development programmes in many Commonwealth countries and spent several years working in the South Pacific. Many countries in the Caribbean contemplate a dilemma regarding economic development: to what effect and how rapidly should tourism be developed, bearing in mind the risk of drawing away resources and labour from agriculture? Some other ACP countries face the same choice. I believe that there is the opportunity for tourism and agriculture to benefit each other rather than for one to develop {{at the expense of the}} other. We in Grenada have been developing tourism, and rightly so. We have seen a collapse in our nutmeg industry, fluctuating prices for our cocoa and uncertainty hangs over our banana exports to the EC following adoption of the single market. But agriculture must remain the most important sector in the development of Grenada. With tourism we get additional visitors and they surely provide a greater market for our farmers. What we want our farmers to do, is to go into a diversification programme that would stress the importance of fruits, vegetables and other crops. We see the production of fruit and vegetables for our tourist hotels as providing the linkage between tourism and agricultural development. Unfortunately, agriculture has been in decline in Grenada in recent years but we have now taken definite steps to ensure that there is a revival in the industry. We have made more estate lands available for settlement by farmers and we have had technical assistance from French and Taiwanese missions to identify new markets end new crops. ClDA and the UN World Food Programme have helped us to strengthen the infrastructure including plant quarantine facilities, rehabilitation of cocoa and packhouse facilities for exporting fruit and vegetables. We are concerned at this time to deal with the productive sectors of our economy with agriculture as a first priority because if a country like ours has a fiscal problem it is as well to consider structural adjustment, a programme we are engaged in currently in Grenada. In such a programme we can reduce expenditure by reducing the size of the public service; we can privatize to get money to provide counterpart funding for some of our infrastructural development projects. But, in the final analysis, the single most important area for concentration is increased production, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not earn more we are going to find ourselves in recession for a long time. In addition, structural adjustment is likely to lead to unacceptably high levels of unemployment and agriculture provides one of the ways in which we can provide additional employment opportunities for our people. In order to achieve this, however, we must show that agriculture and, through agriculture, agro-industries can offer people a reasonable standard of living. While we seek to diversify into vegetables and fruit, we have also to continue to make the most of our nutmeg, cocoa and bananas. It is clear that there is a threat to the banana growing countries of CARICOM: Belize, Jamaica and the Windward Islands. If we do not get some special concessions as provided in the Lomé Convention, we are going to be in serious difficulties. But competition is a reality we have to face and in the first place we have to make sure that we look at something that is unique, in my view, and that is quality. We also have to emphasize productivity, because the higher the yield the greater the chances of being able to sell at a slightly lower level. Quality is going to become more and more important in an increasingly competitive market. Finally, there is the urgent need to develop agro-industries as part of our agricultural development. What we have had so far is a cottage-type industry where we have used some of our raw materials for making syrups, jams, jellies, sauces and packages of spices. In future we will have to produce in large quantities because unless we can supply local market demands our supermarkets and tourist hotels will continue to import from abroad. We must also change the attitude of some people that the imported item is in some way superior to the home-produced one. So there is undoubtedly the prospect of a dynamic agriculture supplying exports, the tourist industry and agro-processing industries and this could offer our young people worthwhile careers. Unfortunately I cannot say at this time, with the confidence that I would like to, that we can see a change in attitude of our youth towards agriculture. Nevertheless, I am hopeful and the key factor will be to demonstrate that agriculture can pay. The problem we have had with our previous land tenure system with estates and the majority of people involved in agriculture being workers, is that agriculture has been seen in relation to poverty. But if, through ownership of land, we can develop a system of farming where young people can become self-employed, then I think the youth would be attracted. The essential element will be to show that the income from agriculture would allow people to enjoy the same standard of living as a teacher or a civil servant. It is a challenge but one that we must accept in Grenada and, I suspect, in many other ACP countries also. The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CTA. Rt.

This magazine was produced by a collaboration between the ECU Journalism Program and the Shire of Ashburton that set out to track the shifts in the community sentiment in Onslow over the construction phase of the Wheatstone and Macedon gas hubs. The project aims to capture the stories being told in Onslow as the town changes, regardless of their factual accuracy. Where possible we have sought to verify facts and provide balance, {{but we have not}} excluded comments by community members {{on the grounds that they}} didn 2 ̆ 7 t check out, <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that, then this would not be an accurate record of what people are saying. In all cases we have been careful to correctly report what people said in our interviews. The result is a sometimes optimistic and sometimes disgruntled reaction to the town 2 ̆ 7 s rapid, but in some ways not rapid enough, growth spurt. We hope that you enjoy this snapshot of what was being said in Onslow in the middle of 2013 and find it interesting food for thought about the impact of major resource projects on their host communities. There is a digital version of the magazine available on the website so you can email a link to it to your family and friends in other places. The website also has soon-to-be updated galleries showing how parts of the town have changed almost beyond recognition and video interviews with Onslow locals. We look forward to seeing you when we come back in early 2014...|$|R

The American Founding Fathers, said Johnson, [...] "believed <b>if</b> <b>we</b> moved away from those truths, and the Natural law philosophy, we would be in trouble [...] [...] [...] So their admonition to us was to [...] [...] [...] interpret the Constitution very carefully and according to its original intent <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> fail to <b>do</b> that, <b>we</b> would drift away from the moorings. It is a perilous position, and that is where we find outselves today." ...|$|R
40|$|Quality has multidimensional perspectives. It is a {{continuous}} and dynamic process. A systematic search {{of national and}} international literature was conducted from peer-reviewed databases MEDLINE, CINAHL and PubMed during January to July 2012. There are many frameworks to assess and measure quality. All frameworks give some levels in which quality could be assessed. Therefore, multiple frameworks {{should be used for}} measuring quality based on the situation and environment. Measuring quality is very important for primary healthcare programme, especially for developing countries <b>because</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> will not <b>do</b> quality assessment, our resources will not be utilised effectively and people may divert to curative services. Thus, in developing countries where healthcare system needs to optimise resources for increased population coverage and scale up the care, quality approaches can suggest workable solutions to using resources appropriately...|$|R

Fisk had been traversing northern Syria talking to Syrian troops on the front line, and when asked by Australian ABC’s television program Lateline: “who are they the FSA and how powerful are they?” Fisk answered: “The Free Syrian Army, I think, drinks a lot of coffee in Istanbul (…) I think that the FSA is a complete myth, and I don’t believe that it really exists, and nor do the Syrians the Syrian Army, <b>because</b> they say <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> come across them, we don’t mind 'cause they always run away; it’s the ISIS people who don’t, they fight to the death”. [...] In March 2015, Rami Jarrah, a prominent Syrian-British activist, claimed: [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} the Free Syrian Army, people still use the term in Syria to make it seem like the rebels have some sort of structure. But there really isn't." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{this program}} at Human Rights Watch <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{a lot more}} work with {{individuals}} than {{any other part of}} Human Rights Watch does. For the most part, Human Rights Watch focuses on the big picture. We look at patterns of violations and policy recommendations to fix them. And I think that's very important in dealing with LGBT rights, partly because we get told so often that these abuses are sporadic or unsystematic or accidental or they just don't happen, you know? I think being able to demonstrate: [...] "No, there is a syndrome, there is a pattern, these are serious, they happen to a lot people" [...] -- it's critical for getting attention paid to them.But the fact is that in most countries in the world, still, things that happen to queer folks are shrouded in secrecy and stigma and shame ... It requires much more effort for us to find the stories and to find {{people who are willing to}} talk to us and to find people to whom this has happened. And because of that, we need to pay attention to the individual abuses because they are often our only key to finding out what the larger pattern is. It's only by grabbing that single thread that we can untangle the whole carpet of abuses that people are facing.So, I make it very much our policy here that when we have somebody come to us with an individual story ... we should always try to answer and figure out what <b>we</b> can <b>do,</b> <b>because</b> ... <b>if</b> <b>we</b> hadn't <b>done</b> that in Iraq we would never have found out the scope of what was going on there... It's really critical.|$|R
