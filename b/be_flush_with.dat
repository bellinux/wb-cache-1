500|$|After the Second World War {{began in}} August 1939, Vindictive was {{transferred}} to Devonport for a modernisation like that of her sister , with nine [...] guns, four twin-gun [...] mounts and a catapult. She had a low priority so little work had been done by early October, when a less complex modernisation was considered. This proposal had six 6-inch guns and three 4-inch AA guns, and her former aft boiler room was to be converted from a laundry into an oil tank to extend her range, but this was rejected in favour of a conversion into a fleet repair ship. Her armament was removed and her forward superstructure was extended over the former hangar's roof. Her aft superstructure was extended to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> her sides and slightly lengthened, and a large deckhouse {{was built on the}} quarterdeck. Her armament now consisted of six single 4-inch QF Mk V AA guns, all on the centreline, two quadruple [...] "pom-pom" [...] mounts, one on each side, and six depth charges. In this role, she had a standard displacement of [...] ( [...] at full load) and her draught increased to [...]|$|E

50|$|A closet flange (the {{drainpipe}} flange {{to which}} a flush toilet is attached) is a specialized flange designed to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the floor, allowing a toilet to be installed above it. The flange must be mechanically strong to accommodate slight misalignments or movements, and resist corrosion.|$|E
50|$|MonoFlat Unison (MFU) is {{a sliding}} door system that enables doors to move inward and slide {{sideways}} without use of door handles {{in order to}} close flush with the wall.

50|$|The {{single seat}} cockpit was fully {{enclosed}} with Plexiglas and was fitted with an adjustable seat to accommodate pilots of different stature. Visibility through the canopy {{was very good}} {{and it could be}} jettisoned to enable the pilot to bail-out in an emergency, later in 1954, the canopy was modified to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the fuselage.|$|E

Originally the fort {{would have been}} placed so that, when lowered, it would <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the ground; this example has been installed at ground level {{so that it is}} possible to see the internal mechanism through a small window. The animation runs 16 times faster than real time.|$|E
50|$|In 1906, the Canadian Pacific Railway sold Yosemite to the Puget Sound Excursion Company. This {{company had}} been {{organized}} by Capt. Thomas Grant to run cruises and excursions out of Seattle {{in connection with the}} Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. Once in Seattle, Yosemite was rebuilt somewhat by John B. Mitchell. The main deck and social hall were extended all the way forward to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the bow, and a large dancing pavilion was installed.|$|E
50|$|The karahafu (kara-hafu) (唐破風) {{is a type}} of gable with a style {{peculiar}} to Japan. The characteristic shape is the undulating curve at the top. This gable is common in traditional architecture, including Japanese castles, Buddhist temples, and Shinto shrines. Roofing materials such as tile and bark may be used as coverings. The face beneath the gable may <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the wall below, or it may terminate on a lower roof.|$|E

50|$|A {{trapdoor}} is {{a sliding}} or hinged door, {{flush with the}} surface of a floor, roof, or ceiling, or in the stage of a theatre. A hatch, an opening which may also be in a wall and need not <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the surface, is similar; in some cases either name is applicable. A small door in a wall, floor or ceiling used to gain access to equipment is called an access hatch or access door.|$|E
50|$|The crumb-or-bread sponge is a thickly encrusting sponge with a glistening bumpy surface. Specimens found intertidally {{are bright}} yellow. Specimens from deeper water are darker. The oscula are {{scattered}} {{across the surface of}} the sponge and may <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the sponge surface or on raised mounds. The form of the sponge is variable, depending on its environment. In sheltered areas, branched structures grow from the base. In areas with wave action the surface is convoluted or flat.|$|E
50|$|Other designs {{such as the}} Safari and Studio come in rollerball form too, though certain designs such as the Swift {{are uniquely}} rollerball pens. The {{distinguishing}} design feature of the Swift is the retractable clip. When the point is extended, the Swift's clip retracts to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> {{the body of the}} pen, which helps the pen sit in the hand more comfortably, and also serves as a preventative reminder not to reinsert the pen into one's pocket with the point extended, which may cause staining.|$|E

50|$|Jeff - Jeff's {{installation}} {{is going}} swimmingly until Jeff and Fred decide to screw their window into their shim (which {{would cause the}} shim to split). Then, Fred, believing that the screws that came into the window were too small (due to believing that the screws should <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the window's inside frame - and hence the predrilled holes are too big), proceeds to void the window's warranty by drilling holes next to the window's predrilled holes. When informed by Andrew of Fred's mistake, though, they do manage to finish.|$|E
50|$|In an open boat it {{is often}} {{fastened}} to the keel and hog {{in such a way}} that it can be removed for maintenance. Again, it lies above the boat's frames or timbers as they cross the hog but in this instance, its main function is frequently to provide a means of holding down the bottom boards {{in such a way that}} they can easily be removed for maintenance. The keelson of an open boat is normally arranged to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the bottom boards so as to reduce the chance of the crew's tripping over it.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to sliding screen doors are {{a version of}} pocket doors, retractable screen doors which 'disappear' out of sight into their own protective housing or casing. These casings can be mounted in several ways. An inside mount is where is can <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the door frame. A surface mount can be mounted {{on the surface of}} your door frame. Thirdly, you can build in your casing inside the wall and your screen and casing will recess completely out of the way. These screen doors are custom made to fit the measurements of your doors.|$|E

50|$|Two primary {{types of}} vehicle {{turntables}} are available: the above-ground version and the in-ground version. The two versions are analogous to an above-ground and an in-ground swimming pool.

The in-ground version <b>is</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the driveway or garage pad and does require excavation.|$|R
50|$|Reining {{horses are}} usually fitted with special horseshoes on the hind feet called slide plates. Slide plates have wider bar steel and are {{smoother}} than regular horseshoes, with even the nail heads filed to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the shoe. When the horse plants its hind feet for a sliding stop, the shoes allow the hind legs to slide {{along the ground}} with less resistance. Slide plates often have long trailers to help the horse's hind legs slide in a straight path {{as well as a}} rolled toe so that the front of the hoof does not accidentally catch the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{whaleback}} {{was designed}} by Captain Alexander McDougall to carry cargoes of iron ore or grain economically around the Great Lakes. A pair of coal-fired Scotch boiler engines provided steam for the three-cylinder, triple expansion steam engine which drove a single screw propeller. The hull was built of heavy steel plates double-riveted to steel angle frames. The bow and stern were of a conoidal shape, with the center part of the hull being roughly cigar-shaped. The ship was 308 feet (94 m) long, with a 38 ft beam and a 24 ft deep hold. The hatches on the deck had no coamings, vertical sections that would have prevented water from coming into the hatches. Instead, the hatches were designed to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> {{the surface of the}} deck, and were simply bolted to the deck.|$|E
5000|$|City trams {{often use}} tight curves - {{sometimes}} with a radius of {{much less than}} about 20 m, and canting may be impossible because the surface is shared with road vehicles or pedestrian zones or sidewalks, so the track often has to <b>be</b> <b>flush</b> <b>with</b> the road surface or pavement. In sharp curves, the rail grooves are sometimes made very shallow, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the rail has a groove so that {{the rim of the}} flange can take most of the weight, the [...] "out-board" [...] tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as no more than a vertical plate.|$|E
