40|$|Background and aims: Extensive {{research}} has shown that male <b>bodybuilders</b> are at high risk for exercise dependence, but few studies have measured these variables in female <b>bodybuilders.</b> Prior {{research has}} postulated that muscular dysmorphia was more prevalent in men than women, but several qualitative studies of female <b>bodybuilders</b> have indicated that female <b>bodybuilders</b> show the same body image concerns. Only one study has compared female <b>bodybuilders</b> with control recreational female lifters on eating behaviors, body image, shape pre-occupation, body dissatisfaction, and steroid use. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare exercise dependence and muscle dysmorphia measures between groups of female weight lifters. Methods: Seventy-four female lifters were classified into three lifting types (26 expert <b>bodybuilders,</b> 10 or more competitions; 29 novice <b>bodybuilders,</b> 3 or less competitions; and 19 fitness lifters, at least 6 months prior lifting) who each completed a demographic questionnaire, the Exercise Dependence Scale (EDS), the Drive for Thinness scale (DFT) of the Eating Disorder Inventory- 2, the Bodybuilding Dependence Scale (BDS), and the Muscle Dysmorphia Inventory (MDI). Results: Female <b>bodybuilders</b> scored higher than fitness lifters for EDS Total, BDS Training and Social Dependence, and on Supplement Use, Dietary Behavior, Exercise Dependence, and Size Symmetry scales of the MDI. Discussion and conclusions: Female <b>bodybuilders</b> seem to be more at risk for exercise dependence and muscle dysmorphia symptoms than female recreational weight lifters. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deal with}} role of proteins in nutrition of recreational <b>bodybuilders.</b> The first {{aim of this}} thesis is to describe the main sources (food and supplements) of protein of conditional <b>bodybuilders.</b> The second aim is to describe average intake of proteins of choosen conditional <b>bodybuilders.</b> Theoretical part of this thesis summarize all important informations about proteins in connection with bodybuilding. The thesis could be useful as a manual for recreatioonal <b>bodybuilders</b> to better understand of protein issue. At first, I occupy with general facts about proteins and recreational bodybuilding. Progressively I describe the protein metabolism and differences in protein intake between common population and <b>bodybuilders.</b> I simply concern important sources of protein in food. I devoted separate chapter to protein timing (nutrient timing) and protein supplements. The final chapter deal with high-protein diets, which are very popular in bodybuilding latest time, especially in weight loss. To acchieve the goals of this bachelor thesis, I have chosen quantitative and qualitative research. The collection of data for quantitative research was realized via questionnaires which were distributed to recreational <b>bodybuilders</b> in the written and electronic form. Written questionnaire was given to several recreational <b>bodybuilders</b> in the gym. Electronic questionnaire was published on online bodybuilding forum Ronnie. cz. Results of quantitative research are presented {{in the form of}} the graphs. For qualitative research I have used the recording sheet to which the selected recreational <b>bodybuilders</b> recorded their one-week diet. These data were evaluated in the program Nutriservis. The results were compared with the recommendations of protein intake and interpreted {{in the form of the}} tables and text evaluation. Results of the research confirmed my hypothesis that most of recreational <b>bodybuilders</b> consume more proteins than they actually need. According to frequency form, recreational <b>bodybuilders</b> prefer rather animal proteins than plant proteins. Qualitative evaluation also indicated that conditional <b>bodybuilders</b> diet is often very stereotypical...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the factor structure, validity, {{and reliability of}} the bodybuilding dependence scale and to investigate differences in bodybuilding dependence {{between men and women}} and competitive and non-competitive <b>bodybuilders.</b> Methods: Seventy two male competitive <b>bodybuilders,</b> 63 female competitive <b>bodybuilders,</b> 87 male non-competitive <b>bodybuilders,</b> and 63 non-competitive female <b>bodybuilders</b> completed the bodybuilding dependence scale (BDS), the exercise dependence questionnaire (EDQ), and the muscle dysmorphia inventory (MDI). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis of the BDS supported a three factor model of bodybuilding dependence, consisting of social dependence, training dependence, and mastery dependence (Q = 3. 16, CFI = 0. 98, SRMR = 0. 04). Internal reliability of all three subscales was high (Cronbach’s a = 0. 92, 0. 92, and 0. 93 respectively). Significant (p, 0. 001) and moderate correlations were found between all BDS and MDI subscales, and between five of the eight EDQ subscales.

Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{debut in the}} 1990 film En Kadhal Kanmani, which was {{followed}} by a series of small-budget Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu films in the 1990s, many of which went unnoticed. However, the success of Bala's tragedy film Sethu (1999), in which Vikram appeared as a rogue turned lover, started Vikram's successful career as an actor. In the early 2000s, Vikram appeared in a series of masala films, with Dhill (2001), Gemini (2002), Dhool (2003) and Saamy (2003) becoming commercially successful ventures. During the period, Vikram also appeared in diverse roles and received critical acclaim for his performance as a blind villager in Kasi and a Robin Hood-esque figure in Samurai. In 2003, Vikram's performance as a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorders in Bala's Pithamagan saw him win the National Film Award for Best Actor, with his character only speaking a couple of lines of dialogue in the entire film. His appearance as an idealistic lawyer with multiple personality disorder in Shankar's blockbuster Anniyan (2005) also won critical acclaim, as did his appearance as a superhero in Kanthaswamy (2009). Vikram's portrayal of Veeraiya, a tribal leader inspired by the Ramayana character Ravana, in Mani Ratnam's Raavanan saw him secure further accolades, as did his appearance as a mentally challenged adult with the maturity of a six-year-old boy in Deiva Thirumagal (2011). He consequently appeared in multiple get-ups as a <b>bodybuilder</b> and a crippled hunchback, losing up to 35 kilograms for sequences, during the making of Shankar's romantic thriller I (2015) and won rave reviews from critics for his performance. It is currently the fifth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time.|$|E
