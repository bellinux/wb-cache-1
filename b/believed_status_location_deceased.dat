A large-scale dataset of individual purchases of women's shoes (16, 236 transactions) across {{five years and}} 2, 007 women reveals a balance of conformity and consistency, moderated by changes in <b>location</b> socioeconomic <b>status.</b> Women conform to new local norms (i. e., average heel size) when moving to relatively higher <b>status</b> <b>locations,</b> but mostly ignore new local norms when moving to relatively lower <b>status</b> <b>locations.</b> In short, at periods of transition, it is the fashion norms of the rich that trickle down to consumers.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to contribute information on toxic ornamental plants in Venezuela. Information on taxonomy, common names, habit, origin, <b>status,</b> <b>location,</b> propagation and toxicology (part of the plant, effects) was compiled from articles, books, catalogs, herbarium collections. A botanical analysis (taxonomy, common names, habit, origin, <b>status,</b> <b>location,</b> propagation) and toxicology (part of the plant, effects) was performed. The information about plant poisoning cases was requested to SIMET (Pharmacy faculty -UCV). Seventy-eight species were found in 34 families, the most important were: Apocynaceae (10 genera/ 12 species), Araceae (9 / 9), Euphorbiaceae (4 / 10) and Solanaceae (5 / 6). Genus Euphorbia was the most species rich. Most species were exotic species (79. 5 %) and shrubs (32. 1 %). The entire plant (35) and latex (19) were the most toxic parts and the most frequent accidental ingestion (61. 5 %). Twenty cases were reported between 2009 - 2013, of which 80 % were minors, female and urban areas. There is very little information published in Hispanic American countries</p...|$|R

This study to identify the internal and external variables that affect to nurse obedience based on the Milgrams theory. The study was a cross sectional design using a quantitative approach. Data collected in 12 nursing teams by questioner. Research subjects use a total population. The independent variables are nurse responsibility, <b>status</b> of the <b>location,</b> legitimacy of authority figures, status of authority figures, peer support, proximity of authority figures and the dependent variable was nurse obedience in nursing documentation. The result was nursing teams with good responsibility (50, 0 %), good <b>status</b> <b>location</b> assesment (55, 6 %), good legitimacy of authority figure (71, 4 %), good status of authority figure (75, 0 %), good proximity of authority figure (71, 4 %) have a good obedience. Nursing teams with good peer support (55, 6 %) have a fair obedience. The conclusion is nurses responsibility, <b>status</b> <b>location</b> assesment, legitimacy of authority figure, proximity of authority figures are affecting to the obedience in nursing documentation. The nurses obedience in documenting can be improved by increasing responsibility, the legitimacy of authority figure, regular meetings, give positive support, competitions and giving awards for the best nursing care documentation.

Data were accessed at regular intervals on public “power tracker” or “outage map” websites that update the <b>status,</b> <b>location,</b> and number of customer outages and give general possible restoration timescales for those “without lights.” The websites were usually very complete and only occasionally were not accessible presumably due to reporting overload, update intervals intermittently changing, or reporting delays and gaps of many hours.|$|R

We propose an experimental DNS infrastructure for IoT, {{in the domain of}} transport logistics. We have simulated the behaviour of the DNS infrastructure using a 3 tier hierarchy of domain name servers and a three level caching strategy. Preliminary results indicate that a DNS approach could be a feasible proposition to realise object tracking in IoT...|$|R
