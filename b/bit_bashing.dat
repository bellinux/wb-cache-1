50|$|Bit {{twiddling}} and <b>bit</b> <b>bashing</b> {{are often}} used interchangeably with bit manipulation, but sometimes exclusively refer to clever or non-obvious ways or uses of bit manipulation, or tedious or challenging low-level device control data manipulation tasks.|$|E
40|$|The Dirty Electronics Mute Synth II (MSII) is a {{hand-held}} synth and sequencer. At {{the core of}} the instrument is a versatile mini patchbay that provides expansion and modification permutations and a grid-like visual representation of patched parameters using coloured jumpers. The patchbay encourages a particular interaction with the instrument and playfulness. The printed circuit board artwork, black and silver finish, has multiple touch electrodes in the form of small squares that provide a labyrinth of possible connections and resulting behaviours. Different rhythmic sequences are created through hybrid 4 -bit binary coding, feedback loops and <b>bit</b> <b>bashing.</b> The graphical artwork for the printed circuit board was done in collaboration with Adrian Shaughnessy. The Mute Synth II is Dirty Electronics’ second hand-held synth with Mute Records, the first being created in 2011. One of the main ideas behind the Mute Synth II was to consider the dissemination of a musical idea other than through recorded fixed media, and to explore the intersection between sound object and artwork etching. The synth also presents the notion of writing music through electronics and code. The Mute Synth II is a statement against MPEG culture and places an onus on active participant rather than passive consumer. The synth has been born out of Dirty Electronics’ ongoing commitment to DIY approaches and noise aesthetics, and serves as a catalyst for experimenting with electronic sound. Additional modules and hacks allow for the instrument to be customised...|$|E
50|$|OmniBus art {{style is}} similar to classic PlayStation games' low-poly 3D design, and its unstoppable bus has been {{compared}} to the plot of the 1994 film Speed. Development on the game began in summer 2014, when DePaul University students Amir Badri and Jeremy Crockett decided to make a physics-based game about a bus; however, the development was halted for almost a year. After development resumed, the team released a playable demo of OmniBus to itch.io and launched a Kickstarter campaign. During the campaign, it was announced the game would be shown at indie game festival <b>Bit</b> <b>Bash</b> in Chicago, Illinois, on August 22, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|We kind {{of learned}} it pretty quickly 'cause there wasn't {{that much to}} learn. Then Brian got his slide out, his steel (guitar) out and dadaw... dadaw... and we said, Yeah, that's better, dirty it up a <b>bit</b> and <b>bash</b> it out, and we kind of {{completely}} turned the song around and made it much more tough, Stones- and Elmore James-like.|$|R
