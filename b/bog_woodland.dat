These ratings result from a combination of factors: spatial fragmentation; invasion of unwanted plant species; browsing by deer, grazing by livestock and grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinienis) damage; and a prolonged absence of management.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{reconstitute}} the changes in the local water cycle and plant habitats occurring in wetlands under anthropic influence. The selected area for the study in this paper is the swamp of Pobłockie Peatbog, located in the catchment area of the river Łeba in northern Poland. The fieldwork was performed in October of 2013. Using ArcMap the hydrographic network of the study area in the years 1837, 1918, 1936, 1976 and 2000 were digitized and represented. Using a LIDAR image, the terrain model for the swamp of Pobłockie Peatbog was generated in ArcMap. This was then used to create a map showing the location of runoff pathways from the waterlogged areas. Long-term drainage and the construction of new drainage ditches have led to the encroachment of <b>bog</b> <b>woodland</b> on the originally treeless swamp of Pobłockie Peatbog...|$|E

40|$|The {{observations}} on macrofungi {{were carried out}} in the period 2004 – 2010, in the 91 D 0 <b>Bog</b> <b>woodland</b> habitat from “Grădiniţa” peat bog, habitat included in the Natura 2000 site “Larion” (Eastern Carpathians, Romania). In total 69 macrofungi species were recorded, most of them basidiomycetes, on different substrates, such as peat, wood, litter and mosses. The analysis of the trophic groups point out that most species are ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic lignicolous, which are associated with woody flora of this habitat: Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Betula alba subsp. glutinosa and Salix caprea. In addition to some frequent species, in the “Gradinita” peat bog were inventoried some hydrophilous species (rare in Romania), such as: Gymnopus aquosus, Entoloma cetratum, Leccinum oxydabile and Suillus flavidus.

40|$|Aim: We {{evaluate}} {{differences between}} and {{the applicability of}} three linear predictive models to determine butterfly hotspots in Belgium for nature conservation purposes. Location: The study is carried out in Belgium for records located to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cells of 5 x 5 km. Methods: We first determine the relationship between factors correlated to butterfly diversity by means of modified t-tests and principal components analysis; subsequently, we predict hotspots using linear models based on land use, climate and topographical variables of well-surveyed UTM grid cells (n = 197). The well-surveyed squares are divided into a training set and an evaluation set to test the model predictions. We apply three different models: (1) a 'statistically focused' model where variables are entered in descending order of statistical significance, (2) a 'land use-focused' model where land use variables known {{to be related to}} butterfly diversity are forced into the model and (3) a 'hybrid' model where the variables of the 'land use-focused model' are entered first and subsequently complemented by the remaining variables entered in descending order of statistical significance. Results: A principal components analyses reveals that climate, and to a large extent, land use are locked into topography, and that topography and climate are the variables most strongly correlated with butterfly diversity in Belgium. In the statistically focused model, biogeographical region alone explains 65 % of the variability; other variables entering the statistically focused model are the area of coniferous and deciduous woodland, elevation and the number of frost days; the statistically focused model explains 77 % of the variability in the training set and 66 % in the evaluation set. In the land use-focused model, biogeographical region, deciduous and mixed woodland, natural grassland, heathland and <b>bog,</b> <b>woodland</b> edge, urban and agricultural area and biotope diversity are forced into the model; the land use-focused model explains 68 % of the variability in the training set and 57 % in the evaluation set. In the hybrid model, all variables from the land use-focused model are entered first and the covariates elevation, number of frost days and natural grassland area are added on statistical grounds; the hybrid model explains 78 % of the variability in the training set and 67 % in the evaluation set. Applying the different models to determine butterfly diversity hotspots resulted in the delimitation of spatially different areas. Main conclusions: The best predictions of butterfly diversity in Belgium are obtained by the hybrid model in which land use variables relevant to butterfly richness are entered first after which climatic and topographic variables were added on strictly statistical grounds. The land use-focused model does not predict butterfly diversity in a satisfactory manner. When using predictive models to determine butterfly diversity, conservation biologists {{need to be aware of}} the consequences of applying such models. Although, in conservation biology, land use-focused models are preferable to statistically focused models, one should always check whether the applied model makes sense on the ground. Predictive models can target mapping efforts towards potentially species-rich sites and permits the incorporation of un-surveyed sites into nature conservancy policies. Species richness distribution maps produced by predictive modelling should therefore be used as pro-active conservation tools. SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

50|$|Thirteen {{thousand}} {{species of}} plants {{have been identified in}} the Alpine regions. Alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be limestone or non-calcareous. The habitats range from meadows, <b>bogs,</b> <b>woodland</b> (deciduous and coniferous) areas to soil-less scree and moraines, and rock faces and ridges. A natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief deciduous trees—oak, beech, ash and sycamore maple. These do not reach exactly to the same elevation, nor are they often found growing together; but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation. This limit usually lies about 1200 m above the sea {{on the north side of}} the Alps, but on the southern slopes it often rises to 1500 m, sometimes even to 1700 m.|$|R
