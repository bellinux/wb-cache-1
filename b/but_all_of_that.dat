40|$|This study {{examines}} support for ethnic profiling in the United States as a counterter-rorism tactic. It first compares support for counterterrorism profiling with support for profiling Black motorists. Then, it investigates whether {{the status of}} the profilee as a U. S. citizen of Arab or Middle Eastern appearance or as an immigrant alters either sup-port for profiling or the determinants <b>of</b> <b>that</b> support. In both sets of analyses, the study investigates how competing ideas about the meaning of American identity shape opin-ions about profiling. Particular attention is paid to liberalism’s emphasis on the rights of citizenship and ethnoculturalism’s emphasis on the ascriptive boundaries of American identity. The results show that support for counterterrorism profiling is higher than support for profiling Black motorists, that people are more supportive of profiling immigrants than they are of profiling U. S. citizens, and that how people define {{what it means to be}} American is a powerful predictor of such support. The per-spective promoted by the increasing number of radical activists on issues related to immigration—that being American means being a White European Christian—is the most powerful predictor of support for profiling.

In developed countries, there has been a remarkable im-provement in mortality from breast cancer, <b>but</b> almost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> benefit has occurred in the estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) - 2 subsets. Triple-negative breast cancer, de-fined as tumors that are negative for ER, progesterone receptor, and HER- 2, represent a minority of breast cancers. However, because of the poor prognosis in this particular subtype, triple-negative disease accounts for a disproportionate number of metastatic cases and breast cancer deaths. While chemotherapy is effective in triple-negative disease, research continues to better target therapies and predict prognosis. Recent studies have suggested a link between BRCA mutations and tri-ple-negative disease, but the nature of this link remains opaque. Antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab have demonstrated efficacy across subtypes. More re-cently, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors appear {{to take advantage of the}} concept of synthetic lethality, or dual pathway inhibition, in attacking triple-negative and BRCA-associated tumors.
