In the working process, machine tool has two main sources, one is called cutting heat generated from cutting workpiece, and another is friction heat generated from bearing’s high-speed rotating.

50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} use conical rollers {{that run on}} conical races. Most {{roller bearings}} only take radial or axial loads, but tapered roller bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered roller bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered roller bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> compared to ball bearings.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} start a train and {{accelerate}} it to a given speed, the locomotive(s) must develop sufficient tractive force to overcome the train's drag (resistance to motion), which {{is a combination of}} inertia, axle <b>bearing</b> <b>friction,</b> the friction of the wheels on the rails (which is substantially greater on curved track than on tangent track), and the force of gravity if on a grade. Once in motion, the train will develop additional drag as it accelerates due to aerodynamic forces, which increase with the square of the speed. Drag may also be produced at speed due to truck (bogie) hunting, which will increase the rolling friction between wheels and rails. If acceleration continues, the train will eventually attain a speed at which the available tractive force of the locomotive(s) will exactly offset the total drag, causing acceleration to cease. This top speed will be increased on a downgrade due to gravity assisting the motive power, and will be decreased on an upgrade due to gravity opposing the motive power.|$|E

The aim is to know the proportion of the friction moment caused by each frictional source in the <b>bearing’s</b> total <b>friction</b> moment, which is helpful to optimize the bearing design to deduce the friction moment. In the model, the cage dynamic equations considering six degree-of-freedom and the balls dynamic equations considering two degree-of-freedom were solved. The good trends with different loads between the measured friction moments and computational results prove that the model under constant rate was validated. The computational results show that when the speed was set at 5  r/min, the <b>bearing’s</b> maximum total <b>friction</b> moment when oscillation occurred was obviously larger than that occurred at a constant rate. At the onset of each oscillatory motion, the proportion of the friction moment caused by cage in the <b>bearing’s</b> total <b>friction</b> moment was very high, and it increased with the increasing speed.
