40|$|The {{effect of}} the local anaesthetic, <b>butacaine,</b> on adenine {{nucleotide}} binding and translocation in rat liver mitochondria partially depleted of their adenine nucleotide content was investigated. The range of <b>butacaine</b> concentrations that inhibit adenine nucleotide translocation {{and the extent of}} the inhibition are similar to the values obtained for native mitochondria. <b>Butacaine</b> does not alter either the total number of atractyloside-sensitive binding sites of depleted mitochondria, or the affinity of these sites for ADP or ATP under conditions where a partial inhibition of the rate of adenine nucleotide translocation is observed. The data are consistent with an effect of <b>butacaine</b> on the process by which adenine nucleotides are transported across the mitochondrial inner membrane rather than on the binding of adenine nucleotides to sites on the adenine nucleotide carrier. The results are briefly discussed in relation to the use of local anaesthetics in investigations of the mechanism of adenine nucleotide translocation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Butacaine</b> sulfate is an ester of p-aminobenzoic acid {{which has}} been widely used as a local {{anaesthetic}} {{and it is a}} long standing agent particularly for spinal anaesthesia. For this reason, a kinetic study of oxidation of <b>butacaine</b> sulfate by sodium N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (chloramine-B or CAB) has been carried out in HClO 4 medium at 303 K in order to explore this redox system mechanistic chemistry. The rate shows a first-order dependence on both [CAB]o, and [substrate]o, and a fractional-order dependence on acid concentration. Decrease of dielectric constant of the medium, by adding methanol, increases the rate of the reaction. Variation of ionic strength and addition of benzenesulfonamide or NaCl have no significant effect on the rate. The reaction was studied at different temperatures and the activation parameters have been evaluated. The stoichiometry of the reaction {{has been found to be}} 1 : 2 and the oxidation products have been identified by spectral analysis. The observed results have been explained by plausible mechanism and the related rate law has been deduced...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} is presented which allows {{to describe the}} binding of different local anesthetics to lipids. Lipids (DL- alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin) are spread at the air-water interface and the anesthetic (procaine, <b>butacaine,</b> tetracaine) injected into the aqueous subphase. The equilibrium constants associated to the interfacial reaction: D+ (subphase) +L- (monolayer) in equilibrium DL (monolayer) (where D+ denotes the anesthetics, L- the lipid anionic site and DL the complex) are calculated from an experimental evaluation of the surface potential of the lipid monolayer. This mode of determination is based essentially on the good correlation between the experimental values of the surface potential and the theoretical predictions from the Gouy-Chapman theory. Fluorescence measurements on liposomes are carried out in order to locate {{the position of the}} drug in the lipid layer. This method can be extended to any positively charged drug-anionic lipid interaction. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Glycine-protected, hypoxic, {{proximal}} tubules develop severely compromised energetic function. Glycine-treated, hypoxic, proximal tubules {{developed a}} progressive energetic defect {{that resulted in}} failure to restore ATP levels to greater than 10 to 20 % of control values during reoxygenation after 60 minutes of hypoxia despite continued cytoprotection by glycine. The defect was not corrected by supplementation with exogenous purines and was not modified by lowering the pH during hypoxia or reoxygenation. In the continued presence of glycine, the failure to restore ATP was associated with impaired recovery of structural changes that developed during hypoxia and, if glycine was withdrawn, lethal membrane damage occurred. The lesion was significantly ameliorated by the presence during hypoxia of two agents known to suppress development of the mitochondrial permeability transition, cyclosporine A and <b>butacaine,</b> which were most effective when used in combination. The data suggest that development of the mitochondrial permeability transition in glycine-protected tubules during hypoxia contributes to continued metabolic and structural impairment and cell death that occur despite glycine replete conditions such as exist frequently during in vivo insults and may be a target for therapeutic maneuvers...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria {{isolated}} from potato tubers fail to undergo passive osmotic swelling when suspended in isotonic Na+ acetate or phosphate, in NaCl following addition of tripropyltin, or in Na+ nitrate following addition of an uncoupler. Swelling under {{each of these}} conditions in mitochondria from other sources {{has been attributed to}} the inward movement of Na+ on an endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger. Such a monovalent cation/H+ exchanger has also been implicated in respiration-dependent cation extrusion and contraction of swollen mitochondria. Potato mitochondria swollen in chloride and nitrate salts extrude ions and contract when respiration is initiated. The contraction reaction is slower and less efficient than that in beef heart mitochondria, but like the latter, is sensitive to uncouplers and stimulated by nigericin, <b>butacaine,</b> and Mg 2 +. These comparative studies suggest that a cation+/H+ exchanger is present in potato tuber mitochondria, but that it functions exclusively as a cation-extruding mechanism. They further suggest that cation+/H+ exchange activity is not identical in mitochondria from different sources and that these exchange components may have a directionality and regulatory features which differ with the metabolic needs of the source tissue...|$|E
40|$|A sensitive, {{simple and}} {{accurate}} differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetric (DPAdSV) method for determination of benzocaine (BZE) and <b>butacaine</b> (BTE) using a nafion modified glassy carbon electrode (NMGCE) is described. NMGCE exhibited significantly increased sensitivity and selectivity for BZE and BTE {{compared to the}} bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Factors affecting peak currents, such as accumulation potential, accumulation time, presence of surfactants, buffer pH, etc. for the determination of BZE and BTE, were studied using DPAdSV. The modified electrode was less susceptible to peak depression than the bare electrode {{in the presence of}} surfactants and ascorbic acid. Peak currents showed a linear response in the concentration range 3. 2 x 10 – 9 to 4. 5 x 10 – 7 mol dm– 3 for BZE and 4. 2 x 10 – 9 to 3. 6 x 10 – 7 mol dm– 3 for BTE, with the respective limits of detection (LOD) of 2. 4 x 10 – 9 mol dm– 3 and 3. 6 x 10 – 9 mol dm– 3 at NMGCE. The method has been successfully applied for the determination of BZE and BTE in a spiked human urine sample. Repeatability and reproducibility of the proposed method were also studied...|$|E
40|$|Corynebacterium glutamicum can be {{triggered}} to excrete glutamate {{by the addition}} of local anesthetics, particularly tetracaine. Glutamate efflux is a carrier-mediated process and not due to unspecific membrane permeabilization. The concentration of local anesthetics triggering optimum excretion depended on the type of anesthetic and varied, ranging from 0. 1 (chlorpromazine), 1. 3 (tetracaine), and 2. 6 mM (<b>butacaine)</b> to 15 mM (benzocaine), in close resemblance to the order of efficiency in anesthetic effect. The onset of glutamate excretion was not correlated to a change in the viscosity or fluidity of the membrane, as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, nor was it related to an action of the anesthetic as an uncoupler. Tetracaine-triggered glutamate excretion was sensitive to changes in the transmembrane osmotic gradient, although an osmotic gradient alone could not trigger glutamate excretion. Tetracaine-triggered glutamate efflux was inhibited by an external rise in osmolality and stimulated by a corresponding decrease. The effects of osmotic gradients and the addition of local anesthetics on glutamate excretion were mutually exchangeable, indicating similar modes of action. We suggest that this common principle is a change in the membrane strain. C. glutamicum cells which excrete glutamate without manipulation of the membrane, e. g., biotin-limited cells or glutamate production mutants, were not stimulated {{by the addition of}} tetracaine...|$|E
40|$|Local anesthetics (LA) {{have been}} found to {{interact}} with phospholipids and lipids extracted from nerve and muscle. This reaction is demonstrated by: (a) Inhibition by LA of phospholipid (and tissue lipid) facilitated transport of calcium from a methanol: water phase into chloroform. This action is dependent upon the cationic form of the LA. (b) LA increase the electrical resistance of "membranes" prepared by impregnating Millipore filters with cephalin:cholesterol or tissue lipid extracts and bathed with NaCl or KCl solutions. (c) LA coagulate aqueous dispersions of cephalin, phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and inositide, an action shared by calcium. The order of potency in coagulating cephalin sols is tetracaine > calcium > <b>butacaine</b> > procaine. Na+ and K+ do not coagulate phospholipid dispersions at 0. 1 M concentration and antagonize the effect of Ca 2 +. (d) LA produce a marked fall in the pH of cephalin sols equivalent to that produced by calcium, (e) Ca 2 + and LA form 1 : 2 molar complexes with phospholipids probably by ion-ion and ion-induced polar type of binding at the phosphate groups of the lipid. It is suggested that such reactions with cell membrane phospholipids may underlie inhibitory effects of LA on cellular ion fluxes and provide a chemical basis for anesthetic action...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mitochondrial}} transition pore (MTP) is implicated as {{a mediator}} of cell injury and death in many situations. The MTP opens in response to stimuli including reactive oxygen species and inhibition of the electron transport chain. Sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by oxidative stress and specifically involves a defect in complex I of the electron transport chain. To explore the possible involvement of the MTP in PD models, we tested {{the effects of the}} complex I inhibitor and apoptosis-inducing toxin N-methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+) on cyclosporin A (CsA) -sensitive mitochondrial swelling and release of cytochrome c. In the presence of Ca 2 + and Pi, MPP+ induced a permeability transition in both liver and brain mitochondria. MPP+ also caused release of cytochrome c from liver mitochondria. Rotenone, a classic non-competitive complex I inhibitor, completely inhibited MPP+-induced swelling and release of cytochrome c. The MPP+-induced permeability transition was synergistic with nitric oxide and the adenine nucleotide translocator inhibitor atractyloside, and additive with phenyl arsine oxide cross-linking of dithiol residues. MPP+-induced pore opening and cytochrome c release were blocked by CsA, the Ca 2 + uniporter inhibitor ruthenium red, the hydrophobic disulfide reagent N-ethylmaleimide, <b>butacaine,</b> and the free radical scavenging enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. MPP+ neurotoxicity may derive from not only its inhibition of complex I and consequent ATP depletion, but also from its ability to open the MTP and to release mitochondrial factors including Ca 2 + and cytochrome c known to be involved in apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose, An {{in vitro}} study {{was carried out}} to {{determine}} the iontophoretic permeability of local anesthetics through human epidermis. The relationship between physicochemical structure and the permeability of these solutes was then examined using an ionic mobility-pore model developed to define quantitative relationships. Methods. The iontophoretic permeability of both ester-type anesthetics (procaine, <b>butacaine,</b> tetracaine) and amide-type anesthetics (prilocaine, mepivacaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, etidocaine, cinchocaine) were determined through excised human epidermis over 2 hrs using a constant d. c. current and Ag/AgCl electrodes. Individual ion mobilities were determined from conductivity measurements in aqueous solutions. Multiple stepwise regression was applied to interrelate the iontophoretic permeability of the solutes with their physical properties to examine {{the appropriateness of the}} ionic mobility-pore model and to determine the best predictor of iontophoretic permeability of the local anesthetics. Results. The logarithm of the iontophoretic permeability coefficient (log PCj,iont) for local anesthetics was directly related to the log ionic mobility and MW for the free volume form of the model when other conditions are held constant. Multiple linear regressions confirmed that log PCj,iont was best defined by ionic mobility (and its determinants: conductivity, pK(a) and MW) and MW. Conclusions. Our results suggest that of the properties studied, the best predictors of iontophoretic transport of local anesthetics are ionic mobility (or pK(a)) and molecular size. These predictions are consistent with the ionic mobility pore model determined by the mobility of ions in the aqueous solution, the total current, epidermal permselectivity and other factors as defined by the model...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of uptake of Ca 2 + by rat heart mitochondria {{were studied}} by a spectrophotometric method with Arsenazo III indicator. The exponential rate coefficients measured {{with or without}} added phosphate increase {{with the amount of}} Ca 2 + added up to about 24 μm. Evidence is given that the effect is attributable to a combination of formation of chelates at low concentrations to act as Ca 2 + buffers, with co-transport of substrate to provide more respiratory fuel. The inhibitory effect of Mg 2 + depends on the Ca 2 + concentration, so with a constant [Mg 2 +] the low concentrations of Ca 2 + are most inhibited, and the rate coefficients are still more Ca 2 +-dependent. Ca 2 + uptake is slowed by local anaesthetics such as <b>butacaine</b> and dibucaine, and also by propranolol and palmitoyl-CoA. After an uptake, the release of Ca 2 + was investigated. The spontaneous release involves an initially slow and small appearance of free Ca 2 + and is followed by an auto-accelerated phase. The release is accompanied by a gradual decrease in internal ATP; it is initiated by palmitoyl-CoA (reversed by carnitine), by lysophosphatidylcholine, by Na+ salts (reversed by oligomycin) and by K+ salts added to a K+-free medium containing valinomycin. The process is probably a response to an increased energy load imposed on the mitochondria by the various conditions, which include the spontaneous action of phospholipase activated by traces of Ca 2 +. The problem of how much mitochondrial activity is participating in normal heart Ca 2 + turnover is discussed, and experiments showing only 7 – 14 % exchange of the mitochondrial Ca 2 + occurring in vivo in 10 or 20 min are reported...|$|E
