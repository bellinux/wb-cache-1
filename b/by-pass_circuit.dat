40|$|A new {{reconfigurable}} linearized {{low noise}} transconductance amplifier (LNTA) {{design for a}} software-defined radio receiver is presented. The transconductor design aims at realizing high linearity at RF {{in a way that}} is robust for Process, Voltage and Temperature variations. It exploits resistive degeneration in combination with a floating battery <b>by-pass</b> <b>circuit</b> and replica biasing to improve IIP 3 in a robust way. The LNTA with current domain mixer is implemented in a 45 nm CMOS process. Compared to an inverter based LNTA with the same transconductance, it improves PIIP 3 from 2 dBm to a robust PIIP 3 of 8 dBm at the cost of 67 % increase in power consumption...|$|E
40|$|Software-defined radio {{receivers}} increasingly exploit linear RF V-I conversion, instead of RF voltage gain, to improve interference robustness. Unfortunately, the linearity of CMOS inverters, {{which are often}} used to implement V-I conversion, is highly sensitive to Process, Voltage and Temperature variations. This paper proposes a more robust technique based on resistive degeneration. To mitigate third-order IM 3 distortion induced by the quadratic MOSFET I-V characteristic, a new linearization technique is proposed which exploits a floating battery <b>by-pass</b> <b>circuit</b> and replica biasing to improve IIP 3 in a robust way. This paper explains the concept and analyzes linearity improvement. To demonstrate operation, an LNTA with current domain mixer is implemented in a 45 nm CMOS process. Compared to a conventional inverter based LNTA with the same transconductance, it improves IIP 3 from 2 dBm to a robust PIIP 3 of 8 dBm {{at the cost of}} 67 % increase in power consumption...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a circuit}} and method of limiting the charging current voltage from {{a power supply}} net work applied to an individual cell of a plurality of cells making up a battery being charged in series. It is particularly designed for use with batteries that can be damaged by overcharging, such as Lithium-ion type batteries. In detail. the method includes the following steps: 1) sensing the actual voltage level of the individual cell; 2) comparing the actual voltage level of the individual cell with a reference value and providing an error signal representative thereof; and 3) by-passing the charging current around individual cell necessary to keep the individual cell voltage level generally equal a specific voltage level while continuing to charge the remaining cells. Preferably this is accomplished by by-passing the charging current around the individual cell if said actual voltage level is above the specific voltage level and allowing the charging current to the individual cell if the actual voltage level is equal or less than the specific voltage level. In the step of bypassing the charging current, the by-passed current is transferred at a proper voltage level to the power supply. The <b>by-pass</b> <b>circuit</b> a voltage comparison circuit is {{used to compare the}} actual voltage level of the individual cell with a reference value and to provide an error signal representative thereof. A third circuit, designed to be responsive to the error signal, is provided for maintaining the individual cell voltage level generally equal to the specific voltage level. Circuitry is provided in the third circuit for bypassing charging current around the individual cell if the actual voltage level is above the specific voltage level and transfers the excess charging current to the power supply net work. The circuitry also allows charging of the individual cell if the actual voltage level is equal or less than the specific voltage level...|$|E
40|$|For {{the steam}} {{reformer}} of the ADAM/EVA II facility a 2 -dimensional computer code is made, which includes local radiation quantities and <b>by-pass</b> <b>circuits.</b> Not only integral sizes (reaction, fission end temperature) and curve {{states as well}} as individual tube states are computable by this programme. It is shown that the experimental results are to understand very good with this model. For a steam reformer with NTIW-geometry in the 20 MW range the model was changed. Finally an anchor cooling is proposed to release the thermalmechanical heavily loaded supporting structure. It is possible to describe quantitatively the cooling effect with the plottedcomputer code. It shows that the anchor wall temperature falls round about 50 K in a 5 % cooling circuit. This could prevent the extension of anchors, as well as prolong the lifetime of the bundle and make possible the competence of license...|$|R
