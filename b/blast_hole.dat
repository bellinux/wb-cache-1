40|$|Mining {{is basic}} {{in the process}} of {{exploitation}} of mineral raw materials, whether it is a surface or underground mines. Separate section is the special blasting which must ensure strict, advance superiors conditions. Success in performed blasting depends on the applied method, the rocky massif and quantity of explosives. To determine the method for blasting and the quantity of explosive in the <b>blast</b> <b>holes,</b> it is necessary to know the mechanical properties of the ground: direction of foliation, degree of cracking, Jung modulus of elasticity and other parameters which are used for mathematical modeling to define the position of the <b>blast</b> <b>holes</b> and the optimal quantity of explosive in them. As a proper geophysical method for defining the mechanical properties of the rock complex is seismic method which gave all relevant parameters for successful blasting. Seismic method could be useful applied in defining the explosion zones: zone of thermal influence, internal plastic zone and external plastic zone. In the paper, briefly, will be presented seismic method and the mechanical parameters derived from investigation...|$|R

The crystallization quantity {{was measured by}} water dissolution method after emulsion explosive was pressed, {{and the relationship of}} crystallization quantity of emulsion explosive and desensitization degree was analyzed. Experimental results show that the crystallization quantity increases with dynamic pressure rising, and the desensitization degree increases, too. The crystallization quantity is relation to the type of sensitizing agent, the crystallization quantity of emulsion explosive sensitized by GMB is less than that of expanded perlite. 1 Introduction When emulsion explosive is applied to millisecond blasting job, if the hole pattern parameters design is not reasonable, the stress wave produced by initial <b>blasting</b> <b>hole</b> charge will act on the subsequent <b>blasting</b> <b>hole</b> charge, which makes the subsequent hole charge happen “dead pressed” effect or detonate incompletely, especially, when the hole distance is small, underwater blasting or water spraying working face in mine, the phenomenon is more obviously [1, 2].

50|$|Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (carbon in pulp) {{extraction}} process. Ore {{is extracted}} via a <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or {{in the event of an}} outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.|$|E
40|$|Using {{blasting}} caps with electronic delay units, {{it has become}} possible to employ wave superposition in rock blasting. This paper presents computer simulations to investigate the hypothesis that fragmentation is improved in areas between blast holes where the tensile waves meet, overlap and interact. In this study, a numerical methodology using the code LS-DYNA was developed. LS-DYNA is a commercially available multi-purpose finite-element code, which is well suited to various types of dynamic modeling. Two different element formulations were used — Euler formulation in, and close to, the <b>blast</b> <b>hole,</b> and Lagrange formulation in the rock volume farther from the <b>blast</b> <b>hole.</b> The models used have a resolution (element size) of 50 mm and comprise approximately 20 million elements. Single and dual <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> configurations have been studied, and a methodology to calculate possible fragmentation based on model interpretation was developed. The {{results showed that the}} amount of explosives and the <b>blast</b> <b>hole</b> spacing had the largest effect on fragmentation. The effect of varying delay times was small and local, implying that a significant increase in fragmentation should not be expected through wave superposition. Godkänd; 2012; 20120608 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of a {{selected}} large-scale Philippine open pit copper operation’s value chain, specifically the grade control aspect, was undertaken {{to assess the}} potential of enhancing its operating efficiency. Over 5, 200 copper assays from <b>blast</b> <b>holes</b> were processed to determine the average grade continuity along three dimensions. Results indicated that modification of the existing sampling pattern of <b>blast</b> <b>holes</b> can translate to enhanced operating efficiency without losing operating effectiveness. This modified pattern is expected to translate to a 73 % reduction in total variable costs mainly attributed to lower sampling and analytical costs. A trade-off equivalent to an insignificant 5 % average increase in grade variability expressed in semi-variance is anticipated with the modified sampling pattern.
