Representative of four soils from Dalori, Chad-basin, Jimtilo, and Domboa-road areas of Maiduguri {{were selected for}} the study. The four land uses studied were cultivations of orchard, cereal, and leguminous crops alongside bare soil which served as a control. They are representatives of land use practices found throughout Maiduguri and its surrounds. The samples were subjected to rainfall from stationary rainfall simulator. Results showed runoff volumes, soil loss and soil erodibility varied with land use types and locations. Runoff volumes, soil loss and soil erodibility were all higher in cereal crop-cultivated lands, and least in leguminous-crop cultivated lands. Parallel to that, runoff, soil loss and soil erodibility were highest from soils taken from Dalori area, and they were least from soils collected from Chad basin area. Leguminous cropped areas {{were found to be}} more effective in <b>binding</b> <b>soil</b> particles than tree crops. Cereal crops demonstrated poor soil binding effectiveness.

40|$|Soils provide {{essential}} {{ecosystem services}} such as primary production, regulation of biogeochemical cycles and their consequences on climate, water filtration, resistance to pests and diseases, and regulation of above-ground biodiversity. These services result from functions supported by soil organisms. Their abundance, diversity and activities vary according to environmental factors and Human activities. Despite progress made {{over the last decade}} in assessing soil biodiversity, the huge reservoir of biodiversity represented by soils remains superficially explored as do the relations between soil biodiversity and functioning. This lack of knowledge is related to the small size of most organisms, their hidden location, the matrix structure of the soil and the immense variety of environmental conditions. Knowing the range of biodiversity, its contribution to soil functioning and ecosystem services, and the impact of the variety of environmental situations on both parameters is thus a critical challenge to be addressed.

40|$|Soil {{aggregates}} provide pore {{spaces of}} various sizes supplying water, gases and nutrients to plant roots and microorganisms, and facilitate moisture retention and availability. Soil aggregate stability is indicative of soil biological and structural health, and is increased by soil carbon derived from plant roots and the soil microbial biomass. Aggregate stability and soil carbon can be enhanced by increasing organic matter through compost additions or by planting cover crops. Additionally, aggregate stability is enhanced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that form a symbiotic association with plant roots, and consolidate soil particles into aggregates through hyphal networks and through the production of glomalin, <b>binding</b> <b>soil</b> particles together. The use of herbicides decreases soil carbon as it removes vegetation and the microorganisms associated with it. Soils having poor aggregate stability slake and disperse into primary soil particles becoming dense and subject to erosion when exposed to heavy rains. The use of herbicides amplifies this risk as it removes vegetation, leaving the soil bare, with nothing to absorb rainfall impact. The effect of vineyard floor management practices on aggregate stability, soil carbon and grapevine fruit yield was studied at two vineyard sites located within the Estrella district of Paso Robles, CA. In late fall of 2008, treatments were applied to the vine line including an herbicide, an herbicide plus compost, a cover crop, a cover crop plus compost and a cover crop plus a fungal inoculant treatment.

In the present study, an investigation was conducted to comprehensively analyze the effects of heavy metal (HM) contamination on AMF status, soil properties, aggregate distribution and stability, and their correlations at different soil depths (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 40 cm). Our {{results showed that the}} mycorrhizal colonization (MC), hyphal length density (HLD), GRSP, soil organic matter (SOM) and soil organic carbon (SOC) were significantly inhibited by Pb compared to Zn at 0 - 20 cm soil depth, indicating that HM had significant inhibitory effects on AMF growth and soil properties, and that Pb exhibited greater toxicity than Zn at shallow layer of soil. Both the proportion of soil large macroaggregates (> 2000 μm) and mean weight diameter (MWD) were positively correlated with GRSP, SOM and SOC at 0 - 20 cm soil depth (P < 0. 05), proving the important contributions of GRSP, SOM and SOC for <b>binding</b> <b>soil</b> particles together into large macroaggregates and improving aggregate stability. Furthermore, MC and HLD had significantly positive correlation with GRSP, SOM and SOC, suggesting that AMF played an essential role in GRSP, SOM and SOC accumulation and subsequently influencing aggregate formation and particle-size distribution in HM polluted soils. Our study highlighted that the introduction of indigenous plant associated with AMF might be a successful biotechnological tool to assist the recovery of HM polluted soils, and that proper management practices should be developed to guarantee maximum benefits from plant-AMF symbiosis during ecological restoration...|$|E
40|$|MSc (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Gold mine {{tailings}} material facilities {{are characterized by}} sparse vegetation and an abundance of dust. Mine tailings facilities are examples of extreme geotechnical and geochemical conditions which make it almost impossible for higher plants to establish and grow without rehabilitation intervention. In most cases higher plants such as grasses and trees are the focus areas for rehabilitation, but, having a look at something a little smaller such as biological crusts, it is seen that these micro-organisms play very important roles in any ecosystem. Various {{studies have shown that}} biological crusts, consisting of micro-organisms such as lichens, algae and cyanoprokaryotes enhance the soil quality by <b>binding</b> <b>soil</b> particles together, forming aggregates which counteract the erosive forces of wind and water. They play a part in nitrogen and carbon fixation, increase the soil surface temperature and increase the water retention of the soil. Thus, these organisms improve the overall health of the soil, which will in time encourage the successful establishment of higher plants. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the presence of cyanoprokaryotes and soil algae on {{mine tailings}} storage facilities that have been rehabilitated for different periods of time as well as to correlate the presence of these species with the physical and chemical characteristics of the mine tailings material. Chemical, physical and biological analyses of soil samples were done. Some of the ecologically important and dominant species were isolated and protocols were developed in order to identify the most successful manner in which to re-inoculate the organisms to a chosen substrate and how to measure biomass. Due to the immense cost of standard rehabilitation practices there is a need for a more cost effective, sustainable manner in which to protect the tailings material against the erosive forces of wind and water with as little input as possible. The influence of an organism cultured in normal Bold’s Basal medium (BBM) growth medium, BBM growth medium with half the phosphate concentration and BBM growth medium with half the nitrate concentration on the establishment of a biological soil crust (BSC) was tested. To test the influence of the inoculums already present in the tailings material and in the air, trials with mulch, water and nutrients without the addition of an organism was also investigated. This was done in the controlled environment of a glasshouse, as well as in field conditions. The biomass of the cyanoprokaryotes and algae, as well as the soil surface strength was also tested. The results show that the time of rehabilitation did not have an influence on the cyanoprokaryotes as well as algal species that occurred on the tailings material. Chlorella sp., Chlorococcum sp. and Klebsormidium sp. were present on all six sites, except on the fresh material and 15 year old material where no rehabilitation has been done. As for dominance; Chlamydomonas sp., Chlorococcum sp., Klebsormidium sp. and Phormidium sp. were dominant on all six sites except for the fresh material, where nothing grew. An array of methods exists for measuring algal biomass as a measure of growth. During the development of protocols for further use in investigating the growth of algae, the extraction solvent ethanol, for use in chlorophyll a extraction, was identified as the most sufficient. The re-inoculation of cyanoprokaryotes and soil algae onto a chosen substrate is most successful when pouring the organisms, cultured in growth medium and 0. 1 % agar, over the substrate. During the glasshouse trials the influence of the growth medium and growth medium with half the nitrate and half the phosphate concentrations showed that Chlamydomonas sp. produced the highest biomass when cultured in BBM. With Nostoc sp. the highest biomass occurred with culturing in BBM and BBM with half the phosphate concentration. Microcoleus vaginatus showed no significant difference when cultured in the three different growth mediums (BBM, BBM with half the nitrate concentration and BBM with half the phosphate concentration). Overall Nostoc sp. produced the highest biomass (34. 33 μg/g), followed by Microcoleus vaginatus (17. 05 μg/g) and Chlamydomonas sp. (6. 12 μg/g). Soil surface strength, measured with a hand held penetrometer showed that Chlamydomonas sp. cultured in BBM growth medium produced the most stable crust (2. 58 kg/cm 2), although it had the lowest biomass measurements (6. 12 μg/g). Nostoc sp. produced the highest biomass (34. 44 μg/g), but had the lowest soil surface strength results (1. 75 kg/cm 2). Microcoleus vaginatus proved to be the species with high biomass production (17. 05 μg/g), as well as high soil surface strength (2. 08 kg/cm 2). M. vaginatus is also a pioneer species and is therefore a good choice as primary inoculum on bare tailings material. It was decided to use Nostoc sp. in the field trials due to its high biomass and Microcoleus vaginatus due to the high soil surface strength produced. Despite the occurrence of a severe thunder storm on the afternoon of application and poor water management during the field trials the significance of water on the establishment of soil algae and cyanoprokaryotes on tailings material was determined.

This study was carried out to address the long-standing problem of irreversible <b>binding</b> to <b>soil</b> NOM and biomass, commonly observed during the reductive transformation of polynitroaromatic contamination. The study focused on partially reduced metabolites rather than the completely reduced arylamine metabolites {{that have already been}} extensively investigated for their role in <b>binding</b> to <b>soil</b> NOM. In the simple bioreduction system of Clostridium acetobutylicum cell-free extract/molecular hydrogen (electron donor), 10 % of the initial 14 C was found bound to solid proteinaceous material following sequential anaerobic/aerobic treatment. A review of the nitroso and hydroxylamino functional group chemistry revealed that the nitroso-thiol reaction was most likely responsible for the reaction with proteins. The introduction of a model thiol, 1 -thioglycerol, into an anaerobic mixture of 4 -hydroxylamino- 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (4 HADNT) and 2, 4 -dihydroxylamino- 6 -nitrotoluene (DHA 6 NT) resulted in the formation of a new product, only when the reaction mixture was exposed to air. The results from the model reaction confirmed that thiols could act as competing nucleophiles for nitroso compounds, which are readily formed from hydroxylamino compounds upon exposure to air. The {{reactivity of}} arylhydroxylamines and nitrosoarenes with standard humic acids was investigated using 4 HADNT and nitrosobenzene as model compounds, respectively. Contrary to results reported by others, 4 HADNT was found to be nonreactive towards humic acid at humic acid concentrations in excess of dissolved organic matter concentrations found in nature. Conversely, nitrosobenzene reacted rapidly with humic acids, with the extent of reaction being highest for humic acids that had a high protein content. Humic acids that were pretreated with a thiol derivatizing agent showed diminished capacity for reaction with nitrosobenzene. Since nitroso intermediates from TNT reduction are difficult to synthesize and are rarely observed in nature due to their high instability, their electrophilic characteristics were evaluated using a molecular modeling approach. Molecular models of potential TNT nitroso intermediates were compared with those of the strongly electrophilic nitrosobenzene.
