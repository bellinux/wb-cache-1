50|$|By January 1985, experts {{estimated}} that IBM had sold 250,000 PCjrs, including 200,000 {{in the fourth}} quarter of 1984. When the discounts ended, however, sales decreased from an estimated 50 computers sold per store in December to 2.4 in February. By this time three PCjr-specific magazines had ended publication. IBM was unable to meet the demand for its new PC AT <b>business</b> <b>microcomputer,</b> but the home-computer market was in decline and the company was likely unable to make a sufficient profit when selling the PCjr at a discount.|$|E
50|$|The {{rapid rise}} of the <b>business</b> <b>microcomputer</b> in the late 1980s, and {{especially}} the introduction of powerful 32-bit systems in the 1990s, quickly eroded the value of DEC's systems. DEC's last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the DEC Alpha 64-bit RISC instruction set architecture. DEC initially started work on Alpha {{as a way to}} re-implement their VAX series, but also employed it in a range of high-performance workstations. Although the Alpha processor family met both of these goals, and, for most of its lifetime, was the fastest processor family on the market, extremely high asking prices were outsold by lower priced x86 chips from Intel and clones such as AMD.|$|E
5000|$|IBM had {{recently}} developed the Datamaster <b>business</b> <b>microcomputer,</b> which used a processor and other chips from Intel; familiarity {{with them and}} the immediate availability of the 8088 was a reason for choosing it for the PC. The 62-pin expansion bus slots were designed {{to be similar to}} the Datamaster slots. Differences from the Datamaster included avoiding an all-in-one design while limiting the computer's size so that it would still fit on a standard desktop with the keyboard (also similar to the Datamaster's), and 5.25" [...] disk drives instead of 8". Delays due to in-house development of the Datamaster software was a reason why IBM chose Microsoft BASIC—already available for the 8088—and published available technical information to encourage third-party developers. IBM chose the 8088 over the similar but superior 8086 because Intel offered a better price on the former and could provide more units, and the 8088's 8-bit bus reduced the cost {{of the rest of the}} computer.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Data were {{collected}} from Minnesota secondary and postsecondary business teachers regarding their instructional microcomputer applications and their attitudes about several instructional computing issues. Usable surveys were returned by 342 teachers in 236 schools. The predominant brand of computer {{at the secondary level}} was the Apple II; most postsecondary schools used both Apple II and IBM personal computers. High schools had an average of 19 computers for instructional use in the business department; postsecondary schools had an average of 35. The <b>business</b> <b>microcomputer</b> applications currently taught most frequently were word processing, accounting, BASIC programming, spreadsheet use, and database applications. Computers were infrequently used to teach content. The content areas most frequently taught using computers were accounting and keyboarding. Teachers infrequently used computer...|$|E
40|$|This study compares two {{instructional}} {{approaches to}} teaching {{the college of}} <b>business</b> <b>microcomputer</b> applications course. The two approaches are the traditional approach and the information systems approach. With the traditional approach, word processing receives the emphasis while the database application is downplayed. The information systems approach on the other hand, emphasizes database and spreadsheet applications, while word processing is not emphasized. The pre-test/post-test methodology was utilized and {{the results will be}} available during the presentation. As well, textbooks will be considered as part of the equation since, until very recently, there have been few, if any textbooks that emphasize the information systems approach. PURPOSE Today’s colleges of business graduates are expected to have computer proficiency skills. These skills include a working desktop knowledge of word processing, spreadsheet, database, presentations, electronic mail, and the World Wide Web. The majority of businesses and educational institutions use the Microsoft Office tools including Word, Excel, Access...|$|E
40|$|Information {{technology}} [...] computers, communication {{networks and}} the like [...] has assumed a role of growing importance in {{both private and public}} sector organizations during the 19802 ̆ 7 s. This technology is no longer the private preserve of small groups of computer specialists; rather, the office automation and end user computing movements are placing information technology into the hands of workers at all levels, and in all areas. The emergence of the <b>business</b> <b>microcomputer</b> has {{played a central role in}} this trend.;The rapid growth of microcomputers in the workplace, however, has not been without problems. In some offices, even where having a microcomputer is viewed as a status symbol, the systems themselves are highly used.;Because information technology, and in particular the microcomputer, has come to play such an important role in modern organizations, it is crucial that we develop a better understanding of the various factors that affect managers 2 ̆ 7 decisions whether to adopt this technology. The purpose of this research is to develop and test a model of the relationships between a variety of external variables, and the managers 2 ̆ 7 usage of computers.;Fishbein 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 theory of reasoned action, 2 ̆ 7 a widely accepted model of human behaviour, lies at the core of this study. Fishbein 2 ̆ 7 s model posits that one 2 ̆ 7 s intention to act a certain way (e. g., begin to use a microcomputer) is derived from two general classes of factors: attitudes, and subjective norms. Furthermore, intention leads to action (barring the presence of external variables, e. g., unavailability of a microcomputer).;Data was collected from a cross-sectional survey of 519 managers, drawn from managers of 54 corporations in Ontario. The results provided support for 11 of the 16 propositions in the model. Using LISREL as the data analysis technique, it was found that positive attitudes towards computer usage, and subjective norms that supported usage led to higher levels of usage. In turn, attitudes were affected by computer anxiety, computer skills, the quality of the system and management support. Subjective norms were affected by management support, and usage by upper level managers and peer managers in the organization...|$|E

5000|$|During the 1960s {{there was}} {{considerable}} overlap between second and third generation technologies. [...] IBM implemented its IBM Solid Logic Technology modules in hybrid circuits for the IBM System/360 in 1964. As late as 1975, Sperry Univac continued the manufacture of second-generation machines such as the UNIVAC 494. The Burroughs large systems such as the B5000 were stack machines, which allowed for simpler programming. These pushdown automatons were also implemented in minicomputers and microprocessors later, which influenced programming language design. Minicomputers served as low-cost computer centers for industry, business and universities. It became possible to simulate analog circuits with the simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis, or SPICE (1971) on minicomputers, one of the programs for electronic design automation (...)

40|$|Given the {{proliferation}} of <b>business</b> workstation <b>microcomputers</b> for managers, the authors discuss the need for familiarizing students {{with the use of}} decision support systems (DSS) to make business decisions. In addition, combining a DSS with the mainframe business simulation is suggested to enhance the pedagogical effectiveness of the simulation method. The authors describe a current application of this approach whereby continual simulation play across semesters affords each team a unique starting point and generates a rich history base. Teams are required to learn and use Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 as a custom-made DSS to analyze the history file and develop their marketing strategy. This approach affords the benefits of realism, relevance, computer literacy, flexibility, and opportunity for refinement. Suggestions for future simulation enhancements include providing teams with the ability to decide when to make decisions and the addition of an expert system as a strategic advisor...|$|R

5000|$|In 1984 IBM {{introduced}} the PC/AT, unlike its predecessor {{the most sophisticated}} personal computer from any major company. By 1985 the PC family had more than doubled Future Computing's 1986 revenue estimate, with more than 12,000 applications and 4,500 dealers and distributors worldwide. In his obituary that year, The New York Times wrote that Estridge had led the [...] "extraordinarily successful entry of the International Business Machines Corporation into the personal computer field". The Entry Systems Division had 10,000 employees and by itself {{would have been the}} world's third-largest computer company behind IBM and DEC, with more revenue than IBM's minicomputer business despite its much later start. IBM was the only major company with significant minicomputer and <b>microcomputer</b> <b>businesses,</b> in part because rivals like DEC and Wang did not adjust to the retail market.|$|R
40|$|The 1997 Fourteenth Annual UCLA Survey of Business School Computer Usage {{extends the}} focus of the {{previous}} surveys, providing a comprehensive overview of the business school computing, communication, and information environment. Results of the survey show that business schools are now allocating about the same amount of their overall budget to support information technology as in 1985. The 1997 ratio of 3. 3 % represented a drop from the peak of 4. 6 % in 1993. The average number of <b>business</b> school owned <b>microcomputers,</b> 244, also declined from the 1993 peak of 258. The figure emphasizes that although budgets have returned level of a decade ago, the average number of microcomputer systems supported is three times what it was in the mid-eighties. Other findings showed 85 % of the business schools with access to distance learning and teleconferencing equipment, but only 39 % with regular usage for instruction. Further, required on-line student use of databases and information resources has grown substantially, reflecting the power of the World Wide Web. Reminiscent of the early surveys when there would be 25 different word processing packages on the market, each offering something slightly different, the schools identified 108 separate Web tool software packages. Detailed appendices identify key bench marking metrics by business school including computers ownership requirements, microcomputers and staff density ratios, as well as innovations in the areas of curriculum, Web development, and the technological environment...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, IBM shipped {{its first}} read/write floppy disk drive, the 33FD, as a {{component}} of the 3740 Data Entry System, code named [...] "IGAR", designed to directly replace IBM's punched card ("keypunch") data entry machines. A significant feature of IBM's read/write disk media was the use of a Teflon-lubricated fabric liner to lengthen media life. In 1976, media supplier Information Terminals Corporation enhanced resilience further by adding a Teflon coating to the magnetic disk itself. The new system used a different recording format that stored up to 250¼ kB on the same disks. Drives supporting this format were offered by a number of manufacturers and soon became common for moving smaller amounts of data. This disk format became known as the Single Sided Single Density or SSSD format. It was designed to hold just as much data as one box of 2000 punch cards. The disk was divided into 77 tracks of 26 sectors (a total of 2002 sectors), each holding 128 bytes.When the first microcomputers were being developed in the 1970s, the 8-inch floppy found a place on them {{as one of the few}} [...] "high speed, mass storage" [...] devices that were even remotely affordable to the target market (individuals and small <b>businesses).</b> The first <b>microcomputer</b> operating system, CP/M, originally shipped on 8-inch disks. However, the drives were still expensive, typically costing more than the computer they were attached to in early days, so most machines of the era used cassette tape instead.|$|R
5000|$|CPU had {{financed the}} {{development}} of a SC/MP based microcomputer system using the income from its design-and-build consultancy. This system was launched in January 1979 as the first product of Acorn Computer Ltd., a trading name used by CPU to keep the risks of the two different lines of <b>business</b> separate. The <b>microcomputer</b> kit was named as Acorn System 75. Acorn was chosen because the microcomputer system was to be expandable and growth-oriented. It also had the attraction of appearing before [...] "Apple Computer" [...] in a telephone directory.Around this time, CPU and Andy Hopper set up Orbis Ltd. to commercialise the Cambridge Ring networking system Hopper had worked on for his PhD, but it was soon decided to bring him into CPU as a director because he could promote CPU's interests at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. CPU purchased Orbis, and Hopper's Orbis shares were exchanged for shares in CPU Ltd. CPU's role gradually changed as its Acorn brand grew, and soon CPU was simply the holding company and Acorn was responsible for development work. At some point, Curry had a disagreement with Sinclair and formally left Science of Cambridge, but did not join the other Acorn employees at Market Hill until a little while later.The Acorn Microcomputer, later renamed the Acorn System 1, was designed by Sophie Wilson (then Roger Wilson). It was a semi-professional system aimed at engineering and laboratory users, but its price was low enough, at around GB£80, to appeal to the more serious enthusiast as well. It was a very small machine built on two cards, one with an LED display, keypad, and cassette interface (the circuitry {{to the left of the}} keypad), and the other with the rest of the computer (including the CPU). Almost all CPU signals were accessible via a Eurocard connector.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{objective}} {{decision making}} (MODM) {{is perhaps the}} most important research topic in the field of management science today. Over the past decade, numerous researchers have come forth with various studies in the area of MODM. Several recent studies concerning MODM pointed out that goal programming (GP) has been widely used in MODM problems and that it is the predominant technique of MODM. ^ Today, a computer-based organizational information system is very essential to effective management decision making. With the ever-increasing complexities of the environment, the computer-based decision making has become vital for the survival of any organization. Recently, the use of the microcomputer as a decision making tool has received increasing attention from management scientists and practicing managers. The introduction of microcomputer software has reached a stage where management science techniques can now be used effectively for solving decision making problems. Those who stand to gain the most from the introduction of the microcomputer to the decision making process, namely the small business owners/managers, have already embarked on this using microcomputers for decision making trend. Currently available microcomputers in the market can use GP almost as effectively as a large scale computer. ^ The four main areas of this research are: (1) to survey the comprehensive literature of multiple objective decision making, especially goal programming and related studies published in the management literature, including textbooks, specialized works, dissertations, and journal articles, (2) to present a review of decision making in small <b>business,</b> and the <b>microcomputer</b> applications in small business, (3) to develop an interactive goal programming system on the IBM Personal Computer for the small business, and (4) to discuss several critical issues concerning implementation of the system and future research needs in the related areas. ^ The illustrative application this research is based on real data obtained from a small business in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. The analysis of a GP model is accomplished through the interactive methodology. Microcomputer-based interactive system indicates that the GP approach enables the small business manager/owner to test a variety of alternative strategies reflected by goal levels and priority structures. ...|$|R
