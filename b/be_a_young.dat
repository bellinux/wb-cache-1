Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E

When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them.

Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency pretending to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless.

25|$|Ahmed Bedier’s {{involvement}} in civil liberties began after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The St. Petersburg Times called his mosque {{for a response}} to the attack.

This led to volunteer work with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in public relations. In December 2003, when CAIR opened a Tampa office, Bedier became the director.|$|E

The plot is loosely based upon the themes and characters of The Time Machine with references to The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man and The Island of Doctor Moreau. The story jokingly suggests that Wells's inspiration for his later novels came from his adventure with the Sixth Doctor.|$|E
25|$|By 1990 {{the revelation}} of Midnight Jackal lessened President Khan's {{influence}} in national politics, government and the military. Bhutto was thought by the president to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> and inexperienced figure in politics, though highly educated. But he miscalculated her capabilities; she emerged as a 'power player' in international politics. Bhutto's authoritative actions frustrated the president; he was not taken in confidence when decisions were made. By 1990 a power struggle between {{the prime minister and}} president ensued. Because of the semi-presidential system, Bhutto needed permission from Khan to impose new policies. Khan vetoed many, as he felt they contradicted his point of view. Bhutto, through her legislators, also attempted to shift to a parliamentary democracy from the semi-presidential system, but Khan always used his constitutional powers to veto Bhutto's attempts.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October, he {{transferred}} to the 18th Light Dragoons and {{it was during this}} period that he grew increasingly attracted to Kitty Pakenham, the daughter of Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford. She was described as being full of 'gaiety and charm'. In 1793, he sought her hand, but was turned down by her brother Thomas, Earl of Longford, who considered Wellesley to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man, in debt, with very poor prospects. An aspiring amateur musician, Wellesley, devastated by the rejection, burnt his violins in anger, and resolved to pursue a military career in earnest. He became a major by purchase in the 33rd Regiment in 1793. A few months later, in September, his brother lent him more money and with it he purchased a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 33rd.|$|E

25|$|It's {{tougher to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> writer today than when I {{was a young}} writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
25|$|Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale happily {{returns home}} from London to the idyllic {{southern}} village of Helstone after her cousin Edith marries Captain Lennox. She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw to learn to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> lady. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone {{as a matter of}} conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter. At the suggestion of Mr. Bell, his old friend from Oxford, he settles with his wife and daughter in Milton-Northern (where Mr. Bell was born and owns property). The industrial town in Darkshire (a textile-producing region) manufactures cotton and {{is in the middle of}} the Industrial Revolution; masters and workers are clashing in the first organised strikes.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Edenian race in the fictional other {{dimension}} called Outworld, the character is over ten thousand years old, although she appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman. Throughout the years, Kitana has risen to great importance, first as the loyal stepdaughter of Outworld's evil emperor Shao Kahn; then his enemy, tearing herself away from his grasp and freeing her home realm of Edenia; and then leading an army into Outworld to combat any chance of Kahn rising to power again. Kitana shared a subtle love interest with Earthrealm champion Liu Kang until his death, though they were briefly reunited prior to his resurrection. Despite her loyalty to Shao Kahn for most of her life, she has aligned herself on the good side after learning the truth about her past and her real family. A disfigured clone of Kitana, given the name Mileena, was introduced as Kitana's twin sister to become a prominent archrival in the original game series' timeline.|$|E

25|$|Boys {{continues}} {{the story of}} the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. He seems destined to follow in the spiritual footsteps of Ivan Karamazov; Dostoyevsky uses Kolya's beliefs especially in a conversation with Alyosha to poke fun at his Westernizer critics by putting their beliefs in what appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy who doesn't exactly know what he is talking about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha's maltreatment of a dog: Ilyusha had fed it bread in which there was a pin on Smerdyakov's suggestion. But thanks to Alyosha's intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.|$|E
500|$|In the 1946 colour version, Hergé added a cameo {{appearance}} from Thomson and Thompson, the two detectives that he {{had introduced}} in the fourth Tintin story, Cigars of the Pharaoh (1932–34), which was chronologically set after the Congolese adventure. Adding them to the first page, Hergé featured them in the backdrop, watching a crowd surrounding Tintin as he boards a train and commenting that it [...] "Seems to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> reporter going to Africa..." [...] In the same frame, Hergé inserted depictions of himself and his friend Edgar P. Jacobs (the book's colourist) into the crowd seeing Tintin off.|$|E

Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of [...] "the black dust towns of East Tennessee" [...] about which she sings in [...] "Miner's Refrain" [...] because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.|$|E
