40|$|Papers are {{presented}} on practical aspects of commercial STOL operations, a Vertical Attitude Takeoff and Landing (VATOL) program, powered-lift STOL ground effects, conceptual design studies of Navy Type A V/STOL aircraft, and a V/STOL shaft propulsion system analytical performance model. Also considered are {{the management of}} swirling flows with application to wind tunnel design and V/STOL testing, flight control testing of the VAK- 191 B, and surface fluctuating pressure measurements on a 1 / 4 -scale YC- 14 <b>boilerplate</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
40|$|Small-scale-model {{data have}} shown large static loads on the flap system behind the engines. The large-scale-model tests {{confirmed}} {{the magnitude of}} these loads and indicated that the relative loading of each flap element depends on the engine-wing-flap geometry. Flap response measurements indicated that the unsteady pressure loading excited the natural vibration modes of the flap system on this model. Since this was a <b>boilerplate</b> <b>model,</b> the only conclusion that can be drawn is {{that the possibility of}} large vibration loads must be considered for a flight-weight structure. The similarity of the unsteady pressure and flap response spectra for the wind-off and wind-on cases indicated that {{it may be possible to}} realistically test flight-weight flap structures on a static test stand rather than endure the extra costs and scheduling problems associated with large-scale wind-tunnel tests. There is a potential flap-temperature problem which if not resolved might preclude the use of materials such as aluminum and the composites in the flap structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} were to: obtain nozzle performance characteristics {{in and out}} of ground effects; demonstrate the compatibility of the nozzle with a turbofan engine; obtain pressure and temperature distributions {{on the surface of the}} D vented nozzle; and establish a correlation of the nozzle performance between small scale and large scale models. The test nozzle was a <b>boilerplate</b> <b>model</b> of the MCAIR D vented nozzle configured for operation with a General Electric YTF- 34 -F 5 turbofan engine. The nozzle was configured to provide: a thrust vectoring range of 0 to 115 deg; a yaw vectoring range of 0 to 10 deg; variable nozzle area control; and variable spacing between the core exit and nozzle entrance station. Compatibility between the YTF- 34 -T 5 turbofan engine and the D vented nozzle was demonstrated. Velocity coefficients of 0. 96 and greater were obtained for 90 deg of thrust vectoring. The nozzle walls remained cool during all test conditions...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{consisting}} of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many <b>boilerplate</b> <b>models</b> no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications {{to social and}} protein interaction networks.

5000|$|As of January 21, 1960, the Little Joe {{series of}} five actual and {{attempted}} flights had expended {{four of the}} six test boosters North American had made for NASA and five prototype capsules made in the Langley shops. The primary test objectives for these solid-fuel-boosted models were {{an integral part of the}} development flight program conducted within NASA by the Space Task Group, with Langley and Wallops support. Now only two Little Joe boosters remained for the qualification flight tests. North American had manufactured seven Little Joe airframes, but one of these had been retained at the plant in Downey, California, for static loading tests. STG ordered the refurbishment of this seventh airframe so as to have three Little Joe boosters for the qualification flight program. The success of Little Joe 1B in January 1960 meant that the next flight, the sixth, to be known as Little Joe 5, would be the first to fly a real Mercury capsule from the McDonnell production line. In passing from development flight tests with <b>boilerplate</b> <b>models</b> to qualification flight tests with the [...] "real McDonnell" [...] capsule, the Space Task Group moved further away from research into development and toward operations.|$|R
5000|$|The Apollo Command Module used {{in making}} the film was an actual [...] "boilerplate" [...] version of the [...] "Block I" [...] Apollo spacecraft; no Block I ever flew with a crew aboard, mainly due to the Apollo 1 fire exposing over a {{thousand}} defects. While the Block II series had a means of rapidly blowing the hatch open, the Block I did not (a {{major factor in the}} Apollo 1 fire), and the interior set was constructed using the <b>boilerplate</b> as a <b>model.</b> To blow the hatch in the movie, Buzz pulls on a handle attached to a hinge.|$|R
