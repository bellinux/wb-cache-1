50|$|After the American {{entry into}} World War I, the United States needed a medium-range heavy {{artillery}} piece {{that could be}} transported easily. The quick solution {{was to take the}} existing 8-inch coast artillery guns from the fixed mountings or from storage and mount them on a drop <b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> car. This was also done with a number of other weapons, including 10 in guns, 12 in guns, and 12-inch mortars. The 7 in guns, 8-inch guns, and 12-inch mortars used a common carriage, with a depressed center and two 4-wheel or 6-wheel bogies. The bogies were interchangeable for standard gauge or (with 12-wheel bogies) 60 cm gauge track. Outriggers and a rotating mount allowed all-around fire. This allowed the weapons to be used in coast defense against moving targets. A detailed description of the railway mounting is given in Railway Artillery, Vol. I by Lt. Col. H. W. Miller, USA. A total of 96 8-inch guns (reportedly including spare Navy Marks 1 through 4 as well as M1888 guns) were considered available for railway mounting, and 47 were ordered to be mounted on railcars. Twenty-four were produced before the Armistice, and three of these had been shipped to France by that time. These three were the only US Army railway guns shipped to France in World War I, although five US Navy 14"/50 caliber railway guns (356 mm) saw action.|$|E

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of disinfection in clinical areas by assessment of the wipe-rinse method to MRSA in the immediate patient environment, on both the <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> and the cleaning wipes. Methods: The environmental disinfection procedures of 8 MRSA-positive hospitalized patients in 2 orthopedic wards were evaluated. A total of 56 pre- and postdisinfection samples from the <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> as well as pre- and postuse wipes samples were collected. Results: The average MRSA loads on the <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> before and after disinfections were 4. 4 colony-forming units (cfu) /cm 2 and 0. 4 cfu/cm 2, respectively, the process reducing MRSA survival from a mean of - 0. 70 log to - 1. 65 log.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of antibiotic resistant bacteria {{is a serious}} public health issue affecting millions of people. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) is {{a leading cause of}} healthcare acquired infections today. Research has shown that patients infected or colonized with MRSA shed the bacteria into the environment, where the bacteria can survive {{for long periods of time}} and become potential sources of infection. Currently, infection prevention efforts focus on active surveillance, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment use and antimicrobial stewardship, with less attention given to environmental cleaning. Nevertheless, environmental cleaning is essential to remove infectious agents from environmental surfaces and prevent transmission. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of environmental cleaning programs in removing MRSA from environmental surfaces at an acute care hospital and a long-term care facility. Environmental swabs or sponge samples were collected from five locations (floor, television remote, call bell, bathroom doorknob and <b>bed</b> <b>rail)</b> pre- and post-terminal cleaning from the rooms of patients infected or colonized with MRSA. These swabs or sponges were then analyzed through culture isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the presence of MRSA. A total of 120 environmental samples were obtained from two medical facilities. Culture analysis followed by confirmatory PCR analysis for the mecA gene showed that 18 of the 120 samples (15 %) were positive for the presence of MRSA of which 16 were collected pre-cleaning (89 %), and 2 were collected post-cleaning (11 %). The location of the positive pre-cleaning samples included the floor (5), call bell (4), <b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> (4), bathroom doorknob (2) and TV remote (1), and the positive post-cleaning samples included the floor (1) and call bell (1).

40|$|Bedside {{safety rails}} are used {{extensively}} throughout hospitals and residential care environments {{as a safety}} device to protect people against the risk of falling out of bed. However, several adverse incidents involving body entrapment {{have been linked to}} their use, which have resulted in serious injury to the bed occupants and, in more extreme cases, fatalities. Internationally agreed standards (i. e. European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) standards) for the design and testing of bed rails have recently been developed and are targeted at improved safety requirements (European Committee for Standardisation 1997, 2000). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to: 1) determine whether the CEN test procedure for assessing <b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> strength and rigidity requirements is consistent with human force exertions to which bed rails may be exposed; 2) carry out loading tests on bed rails currently in use throughout the UK to determine whether they comply with the current safety recommendations proposed by the CEN standards. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the force exertions of 20 participants performing seven tasks (including activities of both bed occupants and care providers), which were considered representative of the forces to which bed rails could be exposed during normal use. Forces exerted by participants were measured using a force platform and distortions of the bed rails leading to potential entrapment zones were measured using linear displacement transducers. Static load tests were then conducted, in which incremental point loading was applied at the most adverse points on each of nine different bed rails (commonly used in UK nursing and residential care homes) in accordance with the test procedure detailed in the current CEN standards. Maximum static forces exerted by participants were found to range between 250 N and 350 N, which were within the 500 N force tolerance requirements set by the standards. Dynamic tasks involving ‘rolling aggressively’ against the <b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> produced the highest peak force of 722 N. None of the bed rails included in this study met the requirements of the CEN test procedures, principally due to horizontal lateral displacements being in excess of 50 mm for a 500 N applied force and/or the bed rails' inability to withstand inward horizontal forces of 500 N. Bed rails used with divan beds were often unable to withstand forces greater than 300 N due to turning moments exceeding the bed rail's restraining mechanism. Current CEN standards for assessing the strength and rigidity of bedside safety rails appear to be consistent with the human forces that might arise as a consequence of the normal movement and activities of a bed occupant or care provider. Although compliance with existing standards is not compulsory, findings from the tests carried out on the selection of bed rails in current use throughout the UK highlight the need for improvements in the design and manufacture of bed rails...|$|E

There were 67 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) among 600 patients using mechanical ventilators in 10 wards from March to July 2006. The incidence of VAP was 11. 2 % or 8. 9 / 1, 000 ventilator days with a 54. 5 % fatality rate. Among 19 of 22 A. baumannii VAP patients, 68. 4 % (13 / 19) had their environmental samples contaminated with A. baumannii and the most common contaminated sites were bed rails and endotracheal tube connectors (36. 8 % each). Multidrug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii were involved in 77. 3 % of A. baumannii-VAP. Molecular typing of 96 A. baumannii isolates was able to differentiate A. baumannii iso-lates into 7 types.

40|$|Abstract Background Intestinal {{colonization}} by Staphylococcus aureus among {{hospitalized patients}} {{has been associated}} with increased risk of staphylococcal infection and could potentially contribute to transmission. We hypothesized that S. aureus intestinal colonization is associated with increased frequency of S. aureus on patients' skin and nearby environmental surfaces. Methods Selected inpatients were cultured weekly for S. aureus from stool, nares, skin (groin and axilla), and environmental surfaces (<b>bed</b> <b>rail</b> and bedside table). Investigator's hands were cultured after contacting the patients' skin and the environmental surfaces. Results Of 71 subjects, 32 (45. 1 %) had negative nares and stool cultures, 23 (32. 4 %) had positive nares and stool cultures, 13 (18. 3 %) were nares carriers only, and 3 (4. 2 %) were stool carriers only. Of the 39 patients with S. aureus carriage, 30 (76. 9 %) had methicillin-resistant isolates. In comparison to nares colonization only, nares and intestinal colonization was associated with increased frequency of positive skin cultures (41 % versus 77 %; p = 0. 001) and trends toward increased environmental contamination (45 % versus 62 %; p = 0. 188) and acquisition on investigator's hands (36 % versus 60 %; p = 0. 057). Patients with negative nares and stool cultures had low frequency of S. aureus on skin and the environment (4. 8 % and 11. 3 %, respectively). Conclusion We found that hospitalized patients with S. aureus nares and/or stool carriage frequently had S. aureus on their skin and on nearby environmental surfaces. S. aureus intestinal colonization was associated with increased frequency of positive skin cultures, which could potentially facilitate staphylococcal infections and nosocomial transmission. </p...|$|E

Current methods to detect C. difficile spores on surfaces are not quantitative, lack sensitivity, and are protracted. We propose a novel rapid method to detect and quantify C. difficile contamination on surfaces.

Sponge swab contents were concentrated by vacuum filtration, and the filter membrane was plated onto selective agar. The efficacy of each technique for the recovery of C. difficile from sites in the clinical environment that are touched at a high frequency was evaluated. Contact plates recovered 19 to 32 % of the total contam-ination on test surfaces, whereas sponge swabs recovered 76 to 94 % of the total contamination, and contact plates failed to detect C. difficile contamination below a detection limit of 10 CFU/ 25 cm 2 (0. 4 CFU/cm 2). In use, contact plates failed to detect C. diffi-cile contamination (0 / 96 contact plates; 4 case wards), while sponge swabs recovered C. difficile from 29 % (87 / 301) of the sur-faces tested in the clinical environment.

Impaired cognitive function, a poor sense of orientation {{and a high}} intake of medicine, can {{lead to an increase}} in falls among older people. AIM: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the associations between falls and: fall risks, fractures, the use of physical restraints and the use of certain medications in somatic and dementia wards, respectively. METHOD: The study design is ecological, and aggregated data regarding falls, fall risk assessments, fractures, the use of physical restraints and medication were collected between 2000 and 2003. The Pearson correlation analysis and regression analyses were used to investigate associations between fall risks, medication, fractures, wheelchair-bound situations, <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> and falls. RESULTS: The total number of reported fall incidents was 2651; of these, 737 incidents were registered in dementia wards and 1914 in somatic wards. Dementia wards and somatic wards differed regarding falls and fractures, as it was only in dementia wards that falls were associated with fractures. There was also a significant correlation between falls and assessed risk of falling, the use of certain medication, and physical restraints such as wheelchairs and <b>bed</b> <b>rails</b> in dementia wards. Falls at somatic wards were associated with the use of sleeping pills with benzodiazepines. CONCLUSION: For dementia wards there were associations between falls and fractures, physical restraints and the use of certain medications.
