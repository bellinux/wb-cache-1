5|$|Martin Prince invites {{his classmates}} to his {{birthday}} party, but the event {{turns out to}} <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> boring, and to cap it off, things come {{to an abrupt end}} when everyone becomes ill with food poisoning, because Martin's mother, Martha Prince, was serving diseased oysters instead of cake. In the meantime, Principal Seymour Skinner and Edna Krabappel attend and have a conversation which leads to them discovering that they have romantic feelings for each other. They end up kissing in Martin's pink playhouse in an act witnessed by Bart Simpson, who did not get sick since he fed his oysters to Martin's cat, along with Lisa who feigns sickness so she could leave without excuse.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, need to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and {{be capable of}} escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

25|$|As Rebbe, Rabbi Aharon {{was said}} to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> {{charisma}}tic. Stories related by the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, claimed that some Chassidim of Rabbi Dovber went to visit Rabbi Aharon and were so taken by his charisma that they stayed despite their promises to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|Emotional abuse {{has been}} gaining more and more {{recognition}} {{in recent years as}} an incredibly common form of domestic violence (and therefore a human rights abuse) within the private home throughout developing nations such as India. Psychological abuse can erode a woman’s sense of self-worth and can <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> harmful to overall mental and physical wellbeing. Emotional/psychological abuse can include harassment; threats; verbal abuse such as name-calling, degradation and blaming; stalking; and isolation.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his predecessor, Hawke's {{authority}} {{within the}} Labor Party was absolute. This {{enabled him to}} persuade his MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes. Individual accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually {{the driving force behind}} individual reforms, he took on the role of achieving consensus and providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, proving to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating.|$|E

25|$|High full pitched balls {{that pass}} or would have {{passed on the}} full above waist height of the striker are deemed dangerously unfair, except for slow deliveries, where the rule is above {{shoulder}} height. The same sanctions apply to high full pitched balls as apply to fast short pitched balls. Such deliveries, which are called beamers, can <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> dangerous. Usually they only occur by mistake, when a ball slips in the bowler's hand {{at the point of}} delivery and bowlers usually immediately apologise to the batsman for their mistake. If they are bowled deliberately, no ball is immediately called, the bowler is removed and is reported to the authority to which he is responsible for further disciplinary action.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage {{something}} takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.|$|E

25|$|While {{the general}} {{bisexual}} {{population as a}} whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, entitled, Managing Heterosexism and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective, Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.|$|E
25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. She is a very shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the actors}} had {{basketball}} experience, such as Krasinski, who played for his high school team. Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin, actually succeeded in making 14 free-throw shots, of which several {{were included in the}} final footage. Steve Carell later said of his basketball skills, [...] "The thing about looking like you're bad at basketball is, it's like anything else, you have to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> good in order to look bad [...] but that's not the case with me and basketball. I just was bad." [...] However, Carell joked that he would [...] "kick ass" [...] at a hockey episode, a reference to his real-life hockey skills.|$|E

500|$|Following {{exposure}} with British {{magazines and}} newspapers and a successful performance on BBC Radio 1, Bloc Party received a contract offer from Parlophone. The band members declined the opportunity {{because they did not}} want to work for a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London indie label Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted Silent Alarm to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane things, because [...] "those are the sort of things that can <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> touching". The album was born out of [...] "a nagging youthful urgency" [...] and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken for the first time as a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.|$|E
500|$|The puzzle was {{simplified}} in The Shadow of the Templars 2009 [...] by, {{according to}} Cecil, adding a more logical solution. This {{version of the}} game includes a diary, in which the character takes notes; After completing the goat puzzle, George's diary reads: [...] "So the 'ghost of Lochmarne' {{is no more than}} a fierce Billy goat. For a moment I thought it was going to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> awkward to get past, but in the end it was surprisingly simple. Who would have known?", as a reference to the original puzzle's reputation. An easter egg involving a talking goat was included in The Shadow of the Templars sequel, [...] (1997). A goat puzzle was featured in , in the beginning and ending of 2014 second and final episode of the title, as part of the achieved $800,000 Kickstarter [...] "stretch goal".|$|E
500|$|Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen, {{together}} under the stage name Stargate, wrote and produced the song with additional writing by Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench and Makeba Riddick. The song was written in Bangladesh, Patchwerk and Silent Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia in 2008. Knowles worked with Amanda Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London. She stated that the song {{was one of the}} most personal on the album. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that Knowles' references to rapper Jay-Z are usually unclear and open to interpretation, yet her music, including [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "is the one place she can <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> expressive". Knowles and Ghost both liked Schubert's song and walked down the aisle to the song during their respective weddings. The marriages of the artists inspired them to write their own version of the recording. She further discussed the lyrics and inspiration: ...|$|E

500|$|Derrickson chose Nepal as a {{location}} to feature an [...] "Eastern city" [...] {{that would not}} be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason to}} shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{chose to}} shoot the film in the {{anamorphic}} format on 35 mm film after discussions about whether the film should be shot in high-definition digital video. Cinematographer Dan Mindel and Abrams agreed the choice gave the film a big-screen feel and the realistic, organic look they wanted for the film setting. Abrams and Mindel used lens flares throughout filming to create an optimistic atmosphere and a feeling that activity was taking place off-camera, making the Star Trek universe feel more real. [...] "There's something about those flares, especially in a movie that potentially could <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> sterile and CG and overly controlled. There's just something incredibly unpredictable and gorgeous about them." [...] Mindel would create more flares by shining a flashlight or pointing a mirror at the camera lens, or using two cameras simultaneously and therefore two lighting set-ups. Editor Mary Jo Markey later said in interview {{that he had not}} told her (or fellow editor Maryann Brandon) this, and initially contacted the film developers asking why the film seemed overexposed.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{met with}} Polachek's bandmate of Chairlift, Patrick Wimberly, who collaborated {{with her sister}} Solange Knowles {{at that time and}} went with her on tour. During the tour, Beyoncé {{expressed}} her admiration of Wimberly, adding that she would [...] "love to get in the studio some time". Wimberly later contacted Beyoncé's management, and Polachek and himself were later invited to a studio in Manhattan to work on Beyoncé self-titled fifth studio album. They stayed in the studio for a week and when the duo was asked to submit the tracks to Beyoncé's team, Polachek added one song with complete production and a missing verse she had written while being on tour in the United Kingdom. At that time, she felt that the song [...] "could be a good album track for Chairlift, but it would <b>be</b> <b>incredibly</b> sexy if Beyoncé did it". Polachek further elaborated about the differences between her version of [...] "No Angel" [...] and Beyoncé's rendition, saying, [...] "Her groove was different—my vocals were jumpier, and hers were more like panting. And in my version the synths detuned really quickly for a second; she did the same thing but with her voice. It sounds like the whole song melts." ...|$|E
