25|$|A {{calibration}} header is sent {{before the}} image. It {{consists of a}} 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, a 10ms break at 1200Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, followed by a digital VIS (vertical interval signaling) code, identifying the transmission mode used. The VIS consists of bits of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> 1200Hz, followed by 7 data bits (LSB first; 1100Hz for 1, 1300Hz for 0). An even parity bit follows, then a stop <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> 1200Hz. For example, the bits corresponding the decimal numbers 44 or 32 imply that the mode is Martin M1, whereas the number 60 represents Scottie S1.|$|E
25|$|When {{incorporated}} into an embedded system, serial flash requires fewer wires on the PCB than parallel flash memories, since it transmits and receives data one <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> a time. This may permit {{a reduction in}} board space, power consumption, and total system cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{registers}} are clocked in a stop/go fashion using {{a majority}} rule. Each register has an associated clocking <b>bit.</b> <b>At</b> each cycle, the clocking bit {{of all three}} registers is examined and the majority bit is determined. A register is clocked if the clocking bit agrees with the majority bit. Hence at each step {{at least two or}} three registers are clocked, and each register steps with probability 3/4.|$|E

25|$|The IEEE {{floating}} point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, fused multiply–add, square root, and {{floating point}} remainder {{will give the}} correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.|$|E
25|$|Compared to NOR flash, {{replacing}} single transistors with serial-linked groups adds {{an extra}} level of addressing. Whereas NORflash might address memory by page then word, NANDflash might address it by page, word and bit. Bit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications (such as hard disk emulation), which access only one <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> a time. Execute-in-place applications, {{on the other}} hand, require every bit in a word to be accessed simultaneously. This requires word-level addressing. In any case, both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either NOR or NANDflash.|$|E

Thus, for instance, the neighbors of vertex 0 consist of all odd-numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly the odd numbers. The neighbors of vertex 1 consist of vertex 0 (previously identified because 1 is odd) and all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 (because those are exactly the numbers with a nonzero <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> index 1), every {{one of which is}} greater than 1.|$|E

25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case {{trimmers}} are available. Die-based trimmers {{have an open}} top, and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual trimmers usually have a base that has a shellholder {{at one end and}} a cutting <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> the opposite end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.|$|E
500|$|Varian {{departed}} {{slightly from}} tradition. She started young horses under saddle {{at the age}} of three, beginning with a bridle and a snaffle bit because it sends clearer signals to a young horse, particularly one of sensitive disposition. [...] She then introduced the traditional hackamore, and, after a couple of months to transition between the hackamore and the snaffle, began teaching neck reining, which allows a horse to be ridden one-handed. After a year or two, when the horse became light in the hackamore, she introduced the young horse to the two-rein, using a light bosal with either a [...] "half-breed" [...] or a low-port curb bit. Once the horse understood the bit, the bosal was removed and the horse was ridden in just the curb bit for a while until ready to go into the full spade <b>bit,</b> <b>at</b> which point the horse went back into the two-rein when the spade is first introduced. She introduced horses to the spade <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> the age of seven or eight, if they had suitable conformation and temperament to carry it. When she selected and fully trained a spade bit horse for her own personal use, that particular horse stayed with her for life and was never sold.|$|E

Atom Heart Mother sounds like we didn't have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it." [...] Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said [...] "If somebody said to me now – right – here's a million pounds, {{go out and play}} Atom Heart Mother, I'd say you must be fucking joking." [...] Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone gave Atom Heart Mother a negative review, ultimately stating [...] "if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven't found them here." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1970, Pink Floyd {{released}} Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in France in January, but {{disagreements over}} the mix prompted {{the hiring of}} Ron Geesin {{to work out the}} sound issues. Geesin worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was troublesome. Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the choir hired to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his final official contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was [...] "A neat way of saying that he didn't... do anything". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were [...] "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again". Gilmour was equally dismissive of the album and once described it as [...] "a load of rubbish", stating: [...] "I think we were scraping the barrel a <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> that period". Pink Floyd's first number 1 album, Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It premièred at the Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little <b>bit</b> <b>at</b> the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character.

50|$|The {{authors of}} the attack, however, {{identified}} some useful characteristics of KTANTAN that held with a probability of 1.

(It was 8 <b>bits</b> <b>at</b> round 127 for KTANTAN32. It was 10 <b>bits</b> <b>at</b> round 123 and 47 <b>bits</b> <b>at</b> round 131 for KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, respectively). by only comparing the 8 bits of each intermediate value, the authors was able to orchestrate a MITM attack on the cipher, despite there being 20 rounds between the two subciphers.|$|R
