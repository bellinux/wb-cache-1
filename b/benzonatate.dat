50|$|<b>Benzonatate,</b> marketed {{under the}} trade names Tessalon and Tessalon Perles among others, is a non-narcotic oral cough suppressant, or antitussive, with effects that last from 6 to 8 hours. Since {{it is not}} an opioid, <b>benzonatate</b> is not as prone to abuse like some other cough {{medications}} such as codeine. <b>Benzonatate</b> was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1958.|$|E
50|$|Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a {{metabolite}} of the ester {{class of}} local anesthetics, which includes <b>benzonatate,</b> {{as well as}} procaine and tetracaine. Severe allergic reactions {{have been reported in}} patients who are allergic to PABA. Severe sensitivity reactions to <b>benzonatate</b> have resulted in respiratory side effects such as bronchospasm, laryngospasm and cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|Excessive {{absorption}} of <b>benzonatate</b> will occur if the gelcaps are chewed or allowed to dissolve in the mouth. This {{may lead to}} an overdose of the drug. Overdose of <b>benzonatate</b> may manifest as central nervous system side effects, such as mental confusion and hallucination, restlessness and tremors, followed in extreme cases by convulsions and death.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Benzonatate</b> is a butylamine, {{chemically}} {{related to}} other ester local anesthetics such as procaine and tetracaine.|$|E
50|$|Reported {{side effects}} include drowsiness, dizziness, and dysphagia. There {{are reports of}} death related to {{overdose}} of <b>benzonatate,</b> mostly in children.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzonatate</b> {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} local anesthetic, {{decreasing}} the sensitivity of stretch receptors in the lower airway and lung, thereby reducing the drive to cough after taking a deep breath.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} Griffith's {{statement}} to police regarding {{a history of}} domestic abuse, Kincannon responded, [...] "No clue. My wife says she only discussed stuff that happened since I'd been on the <b>benzonatate,</b> which hadn't been very long." ...|$|E
5000|$|Excessive {{absorption}} of <b>benzonatate</b> (a local anesthetic) {{in the oral}} mucosa {{will result in the}} rapid development of numbness of the mouth and throat. In extreme cases, the mouth and pharynx may become so numb that pulmonary aspiration may occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzonatate</b> is sold as {{yellow or}} blue 100 mg and 200 mg softgel capsules. Initial dose is one 100 mg perle (gelcap) by mouth, 3 times a day. Dosage may be {{increased}} as necessary, up {{to a maximum of}} 600 mg per day.|$|E
5000|$|An antitussive, <b>benzonatate</b> is {{employed}} to reduce coughing in various respiratory {{conditions such as}} bronchitis, emphysema, influenza, and pneumonia. [...] It should never be used to suppress a productive cough producing mucus that can be spit out, or in place of treatment of the actual cause of cough, such as asthma treatment.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} other commercially {{available}} cough treatments have not {{been shown to be}} effective in viral upper respiratory infections. These include in adults: antihistamines, antihistamine-decongestant combinations, <b>benzonatate,</b> and guaifenesin; and in children: antihistamines, decongestants for clearing up the nose, or combinations of these. Long term diphenhydramine use is associated with negative outcomes in older people.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the police}} report, Kincannon denied {{grabbing}} his wife's arm {{and threatening to}} kill himself. While he admitted to [...] "erratic behavior" [...] and to the statement that Griffith had asked {{to get out of}} the vehicle, he claimed she changed her mind when he pulled into the Chick-fil-A parking lot. In response to the allegations, Kincannon claimed his behavior was a side effect of <b>benzonatate,</b> which he was prescribed for an upper respiratory infection. He told the Charleston City Paper, [...] "I went completely crazy after taking it. I don’t even remember all of it. My wife called 911 because she was worried about me and my behavior was way out of character and erratic, and she was afraid for her safety and mine." ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To develop two multivariate {{calibration}} {{methods for}} the simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of a quaternary mixture composed of diphenhydramine HCl, <b>benzonatate,</b> guaifenesin and phenylephrine HCl in Bronchofree ™ capsules in {{the ratio of}} 2. 5 : 10 : 10 : 1, respectively. Methods: Novel artificial neural networks (ANNs) and concentration residual augmented classical least squares (CRACLS) methods were developed for the quantitative determination of the quaternary mixture. For proper analysis, a four-level, four-factor experimental design was established resulting in a training set of 16 mixtures containing different ratios of the four analytes. A validation set consisting of six mixtures was used to validate the prediction ability of the suggested models. Results: ANNs and CRACLS methods were successfully applied {{for the analysis of}} raw materials and capsules. For ANNs method, % recovery of diphenhydramine HCl, <b>benzonatate,</b> guaifenesin and phenylephrine HCl in the capsules was 102. 21 ± 1. 34, 100. 30 ± 1. 17, 99. 31 ± 2. 00 and 98. 50 ± 1. 27...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAcute cough due to viral upper {{respiratory}} tract infection (URI) {{is the most common}} form of cough and accounts for tremendous expenditure on prescription and non-prescription cough products worldwide. However, few agents have been shown in properly conducted clinical trials to be effective for cough due to URI. The present study evaluated the effect of <b>benzonatate</b> 200 mg (B), guaifenesin 600 mg (G), their combination (B+G), and placebo (P) on capsaicin-induced cough in 30 adult nonsmokers with acute URI. On 3 separate days within a 7 -day period, 1 h after ingesting randomly assigned study drug in a double-blind fashion, subjects underwent capsaicin cough challenge testing, which involved inhalation of incremental doubling concentrations of capsaicin until the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C 5) was attained. Each subject received 3 of 4 possible study drugs. G (p= 0. 01) but not B (p=NS) inhibited cough-reflex sensitivity (logC 5) relative to P. The combination of B+G suppressed capsaicin-induced cough to a greater degree than B alone (p< 0. 001) or G alone (p= 0. 008). The mechanism by which the combination of B+G causes a potentiation of antitussive effect remains to be elucidated. Our results suggest that B+G may be an effective therapy for acute cough due to the common cold (URI) ...|$|E
