25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} accused {{of trying to}} take Australia {{back to the days of}} the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E

In the same year, Yorke guest-edited a special climate change edition of Observer Magazine and wrote: [...] "Unlike pessimists such as James Lovelock, I don't <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all doomed...
