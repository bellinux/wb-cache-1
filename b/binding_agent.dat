5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident {{in the use of}} sandstone (rather than brick or laterite) as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Although, {{the use of}} oil as a <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> can {{be traced}} to the 12th century, {{innovations}} in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E

40|$|The water-stability of {{aggregates}} in many soils {{is shown}} to depend on organic materials. The organic <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> have been classified into (a) transient, mainly polysaccharides, (b), temporary, roots and fungal hyphae, and (c) persistent, resistant aromatic components associated with polyvalent metal cations, and strongly sorbed polymers. The effectiveness of various <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> at different stages in the structural organization of aggregates is described and forms {{the basis of a}} model which illustrates the architecture of an aggregate. Roots and hyphae stabilize macroaggregates, defined as > 250 mu m diameter; consequently, macroaggregation is controlled by soil management (i. e. crop rotations), as management influences the growth of plant roots, and the oxidation of organic carbon. The water-stability of microaggregates depends on the persistent organic <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> and appears to be a characteristic of the soil, independent of management. J. M. Tisdall, J. M.

25|$|Adding {{as little}} as 10-15% shell temper created an {{excellent}} pottery paste that was lighter, stronger and more able to withstand the drying process, and the clay's originally high plasticity was subdued. The calcium carbonate of the freshwater mussels also acts as a <b>binding</b> <b>agent</b> and created a stronger vessel. Thinner coils to make thinner walled vessel were a natural consequence. As the potter was probably also the cook, she was now able to construct a more effective cooking pot. Thinner walls allowed heat to transfer to the food more effectively. A round vessel bottom allows easy stirring of the contents, a more even dissipation of the cooking heat and also permits a more even dispersion of the shock of impacts reducing breakage.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the <b>binding</b> <b>agent.</b> Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.|$|E
500|$|The Group's {{aim was to}} find a {{replacement}} for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, sulfur and potassium nitrate with a <b>binding</b> <b>agent.</b> The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, corn starch, and ammonium nitrate bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at the March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that [...] "at least it wasn't a big hole", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of different binding mechanisms and associated biological <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> on aggregate stability is still unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of various aggregate <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> during the decomposition of cauliflower residues, wheat straw, cattle manure and poultry woody compost. We measured aggregate stability, hot-water extractable polysaccharide, C mineralization, fungal and microbial biomass dynamics in an amended silt loam soil, under controlled conditions. Soil aggregate stability was measured using three methods involving fast wetting, slow wetting and mechanical breakdown. Aggregate stability to slow wetting followed the same dynamics as C mineralization and was well correlated with polysaccharide content for cauliflower residues and wheat straw. This relationship is in agreement with the hypothesis that the rapid microbially induced improvement in aggregate stability that follows fresh organic residue additions at least partly involves labile polysaccharides. The transient increase in the two other types of stability was not directly related to C mineralization dynamics and seemed to be influenced by fungal hyphal length. Fungi would provide resistance to mechanical breakdown and slaking. The dynamic behaviour of biological <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> was only partly explained by the initial quality of the organic materials, as characterized by Van Soest proximal fractionation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} using {{different}} <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> {{in combination with}} hemp shives and fibres in Lime-Hemp Concrete (LHC) building material was examined. LHC is a light composite building material with building lime as <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> and hemp (Cannabis sativa) as a renewable raw material from agriculture. Contemporary LHC only uses the woody core part of the hemp, the shive. However, using both hemp shives and fibres may improve the mechanical strength, {{eliminating the need for}} a fibre separation process. The aim was to elucidate the feasibility of using the entire fragmented hemp stalk in an LHC, and to determine some important material properties such as compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, water sorption and frost resistance. LHC with varying inclusions of the lime-based binders were tested, as were five mixes using the <b>binding</b> <b>agents</b> hydrated lime, hydraulic lime, and cement. Specimens were cured for 12 weeks at room temperature and 40 days in a carbonation room (4. 5 vol% CO 2), and tested for mechanical properties, water sorption and frost resistance. Using both shives and fibres in LHC may be advantageous for countries such as Sweden where facilities for separating hemp from shives are not commercially available. (C) 2009 IAgrE.
