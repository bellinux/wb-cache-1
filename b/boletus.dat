5|$|<b>Boletus</b> pinophilus, {{commonly}} known as the pine bolete or pinewood king bolete, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus <b>Boletus</b> found throughout Europe. For many years, <b>Boletus</b> pinophilus was considered a subspecies or form of the porcini mushroom B.edulis. In 2008, B.pinophilus in western North America were reclassified as a new species, <b>Boletus</b> rex-veris. <b>Boletus</b> pinophilus is edible, and may be preserved and cooked.|$|E
5|$|In {{the genus}} <b>Boletus,</b> B.auripes is {{classified}} in section Appendiculati. Species {{in this section}} are characterized by having a dry cap with a surface texture ranging from smooth to somewhat , yellow flesh, a reticulate stem, and a mild taste. Other North American boletes in this section include <b>Boletus</b> speciosus and <b>Boletus</b> regius.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> auripes is mycorrhizal, {{and fruits}} singly, scattered, or in {{groups on the}} ground under {{broadleaf}} trees, especially oak and beech, {{but it has also}} been recorded associating with mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia). <b>Boletus</b> auripes typically forms fruit bodies between June and November.|$|E
5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} <b>Boletus</b> calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of <b>Boletus</b> and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as <b>Boletus</b> edulis.|$|E
5|$|Cèpe des pins ("pine tree cep"; <b>Boletus</b> pinophilus or <b>Boletus</b> pinicola) grows among pine trees. Rarer than B.edulis, {{it is less}} {{appreciated}} by gourmets than the two other kinds of porcini, but remains a mushroom rated above most others.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named <b>Boletus</b> puniceus by Harry D. Thiers in 1965, based on {{specimens}} {{he found in}} Napa County, California, on 23 November 1963. In 1975, Thiers changed the name to <b>Boletus</b> amygdalinus (a nomen nudum) as he discovered that the epithet had already been used for a different bolete found in Yunnan, China, published in 1948. The fungus was transferred to Suillellus in 2014 after molecular phylogenetics demonstrated that S.amygdalinus was in a lineage distinct from <b>Boletus.</b>|$|E
5|$|A choice edible species, <b>Boletus</b> aereus {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} in Southern Europe for its culinary qualities, {{and is considered}} by many to be gastronomically superior to <b>Boletus</b> edulis. In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species <b>Boletus</b> edulis, B.aereus, B.reticulatus (formerly known as B.aestivalis), and B.pinophilus have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed Fungo di Borgotaro. Here, these mushrooms have been collected and exported commercially for centuries. Throughout Spain, it is one of the wild edible fungi most commonly collected for the table, particularly in Aragon, where it is harvested for sale in markets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> luridus is {{the type}} species of <b>Boletus</b> section Luridi, {{originally}} circumscribed by Fries in 1838. This section includes species producing medium to large fruit bodies with thick, swollen stems, and minute pores that are coloured red, orange, or brown. However, the genus {{as a whole is}} strongly paraphyletic and has been partly fragmented as further studies have resolved relationships to a finer detail. Manfred Binder and David Hibbett showed B.luridus to be most closely related to a group containing B.torosus and B.luteocupreus, with B.vermiculosus and Pulveroboletus ravenelii as more distant relatives, based on molecular phylogenetics inferred from ribosomal DNA sequences. In a separate molecular study of ten frequently eaten European boletes, B.luridus clustered together with B.rhodoxanthus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that B. luridus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes are part of a dupainii clade (named for <b>Boletus</b> dupainii), well-removed from the core group of <b>Boletus</b> edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. For this reason, it is now considered a species of Suillellus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark reddish to orangish, later reddish brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the reddish coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. <b>Boletus</b> rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. <b>Boletus</b> flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a reddish stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it {{is found in the}} eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include <b>Boletus</b> flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. <b>Boletus</b> rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E
5|$|Cèpe d'été ("summer cep"; <b>Boletus</b> reticulatus), {{also less}} common and found earlier.|$|E
5|$|Found {{mainly in}} Central and Southern Europe {{as well as}} North Africa, <b>Boletus</b> aereus is rare in colder climates such as England, and {{classified}} as a vulnerable species in the Czech Republic. <b>Boletus</b> aereus can be locally abundant; {{it is the most}} common bolete in the woodlands of Madonie Regional Natural Park in northern Sicily. In contrast, it has been placed on a provisional Red List of endangered species of Montenegro. <b>Boletus</b> aereus has been reported from several other island ecosystems across the Mediterranean, such as Corsica, Cyprus, Lesvos, and Naxos.|$|E
5|$|In a {{molecular}} analysis of Boletaceae phylogeny, the brawny bolete was most {{closely related to}} <b>Boletus</b> luteocupreus; these two species formed a clade that was sister to B.luridus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that B.torosus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes {{were part of a}} dupainii clade (named for B.dupainii), well-removed from the core group of <b>Boletus</b> edulis (the type species of genus <b>Boletus)</b> and relatives within the Boletineae. This indicated that the brawny bolete and its relatives needed to be placed in a new genus. It was made the type species of the new genus Imperator, becoming Imperator torosus, in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically as <b>Boletus</b> viscosus by American mycologist Charles Frost in 1874. In 1885, Charles Horton Peck, who had found specimens in pine woods of Albany County, New York, {{explained that the}} species name was a taxonomic homonym (<b>Boletus</b> viscosus was already in use for another species named by Ventenat in 1863), and so renamed it to <b>Boletus</b> brevipes. Its current name was assigned by German Otto Kuntze in 1898. William Alphonso Murrill renamed it as Rostkovites brevipes in 1948; the genus Rostkovites is now considered to be synonymous with Suillus.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first named by Moses Ashley Curtis as <b>Boletus</b> ananas in 1848, based on {{specimens}} he found near the Santee River, in South Carolina. In 1909, William Murrill described the new genus Boletellus and made Boletellus ananas the type species. According to Murrill, the taxon <b>Boletus</b> isabellinus, described by Charles Horton Peck in 1897 from specimens collected in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, is a synonym of B.ananas; Peck described this species from undeveloped specimens. Wally Snell later doubted Murrill's conclusion in a 1933 publication; {{he considered the}} differences in the spore structure too great to consider the species conspecific with B.ananas, although he admitted it was impossible to come to any definitive conclusions until mature fruit bodies and spore prints were available for study. Rolf Singer and colleagues (1992) suggested the name Boletellus coccineus for Boletellus ananas. Singer created this name, however, in the mistaken belief that the earliest available name for the taxon was <b>Boletus</b> coccineus, proposed by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838. However, Fries’s name is an illegitimate later homonym (compare with <b>Boletus</b> coccineus, named by Bulliard in 1791), and Singer’s combination is actually based on Strobilomyces coccineus, named by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1888. The earliest available name for the species is therefore <b>Boletus</b> ananas M.A. Curtis 1848, the basionym of Boletellus ananas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> edulis is a {{food source}} for {{animals such as}} the banana slug (Ariolimax columbianus), the {{long-haired}} grass mouse, the red squirrel, and, as noted in one isolated report, the fox sparrow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> edulis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy {{had been set}} as January1, 1821, {{to coincide with the}} date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard's work preceded this date. It was thus written <b>Boletus</b> edulis Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' work, the Species Plantarum. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Early alternate names include <b>Boletus</b> solidus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray's Leccinum edule. Gray's transfer of the species to Leccinum was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> pinophilus occurs under conifers, mostly Pinus sylvestris, {{and has a}} reddish-brown cap. Microscopically, it can be {{separated}} by the more inflated, club- to spindle-shaped hyphal ends of the pileipellis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus <b>Boletus.</b> Section Luridi is characterized by boletes that immediately turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, and the occasional presence of toxins in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed by Smith and Thiers, {{the form of the}} dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species delimitation in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E
5|$|Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790 as <b>Boletus</b> piperatus, {{it is only}} distantly {{related to}} {{other members of the}} genus <b>Boletus</b> and was {{reclassified}} as Chalciporus piperatus by Frédéric Bataille in 1908. The genus Chalciporus was an early branching lineage in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with parasitic properties. Previously thought to be ectomycorrhizal (a symbiotic relationship that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), C.piperatus is now suspected of being parasitic on Amanita muscaria. The flesh of C.piperatus has a very peppery taste, and {{can be used as a}} condiment or flavouring.|$|E
5|$|Elias Magnus Fries and Christopher Theodor Hök first {{described}} this species as <b>Boletus</b> torosus in 1835, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. Modern molecular phylogenetics shows {{that it is only}} distantly related to <b>Boletus</b> edulis—the type species of Boletus—and it was duly placed in the new genus Imperator in 2015. Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though some people have eaten it without ill-effects.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. <b>Boletus</b> xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as <b>Boletus</b> purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano Alessio to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of <b>Boletus</b> rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (both now placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, and that this was the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E
5|$|Suillus spraguei has had {{a complex}} taxonomic history. Although the first {{specimen}} was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, a formal scientific description was not published until 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it <b>Boletus</b> spraguei. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species <b>Boletus</b> pictus. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they {{believed to be a}} new species—Boletus murraii—although this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their <b>Boletus</b> spraguei. Although Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming. However, in 1945 Singer reported that the name <b>Boletus</b> pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Boletus</b> pinophilus is edible, {{and may be}} used fresh, preserved, {{dried and}} cooked {{in a manner similar}} to that of other edible boletes. It is highly {{regarded}} and can be quite expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there. The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini <b>Boletus</b> edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{bay bolete}} was first named as <b>Boletus</b> castaneus ß badius (i.e. a {{subspecies}} of <b>Boletus</b> castaneus) by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries later renamed it as {{a variety of}} <b>Boletus</b> castaneus in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work Elenchus Fungorum. The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: Rostkovites by Petter Karsten in 1881; Viscipellis and Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and Suillus by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus Xerocomus, and many sources still list it thus. Review of Xerocomus strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in Xerocomus, and hence it was left in <b>Boletus</b> until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that Imleria badia is related to B.pallidus and B.glabellus; the three species form a clade known informally as the badius clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the Tylopilus, porcini (= <b>Boletus</b> sensu stricto) and Strobilomyces clades, {{as well as two}} other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus (the taxa designated as Xerocomus species in this clade are not Xerocomus species and require new taxonomic designations) and Xerocomellus.|$|E
5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as <b>Boletus</b> edulis, <b>Boletus</b> reticulatus and <b>Boletus</b> aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 in) tall by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
5|$|Western North America {{has several}} species {{closely related to}} B.edulis. The white king bolete (<b>Boletus</b> barrowsii), found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (and {{possibly}} elsewhere), is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. It is lighter in colour than B.edulis, having a cream-coloured cap with pink tones; often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine, it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find its flavour as good as if not better than B.edulis. The California king bolete (<b>Boletus</b> edulis var. grandedulis) can reach massive proportions, and is distinguished from B.edulis by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish. The cap colour appears {{to be affected by}} the amount of light received during its development, and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy, to dark-brown, red-brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light. The queen bolete (<b>Boletus</b> regineus), formerly considered a variety of B.aereus, is also a choice edible. It is generally smaller than B.edulis, and unlike that species, is typically found in mixed forests. The spring king bolete (<b>Boletus</b> rex-veris), formerly considered a variety of B.edulis or B.pinophilus, is found throughout western North America. In contrast to B.edulis, B.rex-veris tends to fruit in clusters, and, as its common name suggests, appears in the spring.|$|E
5|$|William Murrill in 1909 {{placed the}} {{species in the}} genus Suillellus, while Sanshi Imai {{transferred}} it to Tubiporus in 1968. Tubiporus has since been synonymized with <b>Boletus.</b> In 1945, Rolf Singer described a bolete he found in Florida; although he originally {{described it as a}} subspecies of B.frostii, he later considered the differences between the taxa significant enough to warrant publishing <b>Boletus</b> floridanus as a unique species. Following recent molecular studies that outlined a new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. <b>Boletus</b> edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. <b>Boletus</b> coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
5|$|B. edulis is {{the type}} species of the genus <b>Boletus.</b> In Rolf Singer's {{classification}} of the Agaricales mushrooms, {{it is also the}} type species of section <b>Boletus,</b> a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by several characteristics: a mild-tasting, white flesh that does not change colour when exposed to air; a smooth to distinctly raised, netted pattern over at least the uppermost portion of the stem; a yellow-brown or olive-brown spore print; white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish, which initially appear to be stuffed with cotton; and cystidia that are not strongly coloured. Molecular analysis published in 1997 established that the bolete mushrooms are all derived from a common ancestor, and established the Boletales as an order separate from the Agaricales.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> caucasicus, {{found in}} {{southern}} Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, {{in contrast to}} the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S.luridus. Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which have been reported to be as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed <b>Boletus</b> barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> edulis occurs {{later in}} the season during lower temperatures, mostly under Picea. It has a paler viscid cap, and a paler stipe with an acute white reticulation. Microscopically, it has gelatinised hyphal ends in the pileipellis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled <b>Boletus</b> pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> pinophilus {{is known}} to be a bioaccumulator of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and selenium. To reduce exposure, {{authorities}} recommend avoiding mushrooms from polluted areas such as those near mines, smelters, roadways, incinerators and disposal sites. Furthermore, pores should be removed as they contain the highest concentrations of pollutants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark {{yellowish}} brown rather than hyaline when viewed with a light microscope. Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boletus</b> reticulatus is {{very similar}} to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} during the summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a more elaborate and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.|$|E
