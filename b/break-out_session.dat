40|$|Members of the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Round Table (Food RT) are {{committed}} to helping consumers and other stakeholders to make informed choices by providing them with accurate and understandable information on relevant product characteristics, including environmental performance. In {{the framework of the}} Food RT, Working Group 1 (WG 1) is currently developing the ENVIFOOD Protocol for assessing the environmental issues of food and drink products due to the proliferation of standards and guidance documents on this subject. The main purpose of the Protocol is the development of a common framework facilitating that environmental assessments are scientifically reliable and consistent in supporting informed choice. In particular, this will support environmental assessments conducted in the context of business-to-business as well as business-to-consumer communication, and the identification of environmental improvement options. WG 1 elaborated a Road Map for the development and dissemination of the Protocol. Major tasks in this document by the end of 2011 are: detailed analysis of data and methodological aspects; Protocol drafting; public consultation and revision. The detailed analysis has been recently completed. As the Protocol is expected to be built on the existing science for the environmental assessment of food and drink products, rather than inventing a new methodology from scratch, this analysis has scanned relevant: •	General and sector-specific methodologies and guidance documents on the environmental assessment of food and drink; •	Datasets related to food and drink products. Moving from the key findings of the detailed analysis to the actual Protocol development, the principal aim of this workshop was to identify specific methodological approaches to be recommended and incorporated in the Protocol. The workshop was structured as follows: •	An introductory plenary session to underline the workshop expectations and illustrate the key findings of the detailed analysis on the existing and upcoming methodologies for assessing the environmental performance of food and drink products; •	Three break-out sessions to analyse those methodological approaches where consensus is needed; •	A closing plenary session for letting <b>break-out</b> <b>session</b> chairs reporting back to the plenary the agreement achieved in each individual <b>break-out</b> <b>session</b> and confirm such approaches. Contributions to the two-days workshop have been summarised in this technical report. Contents are presented in this document by following the same chronological order as in the final agenda of the workshop (see section 2).

This review {{is based on a}} <b>break-out</b> <b>session</b> with experts from academia and industry which considered tasks that tap working memory in animals. The specific focus of session was on tasks measuring goal maintenance, memory capacity, and interference control. Of the tasks nominated for goal maintenance, the most developed paradigms were operant delayed-non-matching-to-position tasks, and touch-screen variants of these may hold particular promise. For memory capacity, the task recommended for further development was the span task, although it is recognized that more work on its neural substrates is required. For interference control, versions of the n-back task were felt to resemble the deficits found in schizophrenia, although additional development of these tasks is also required...|$|E
40|$|Social {{scientists}} {{no longer}} have to travel far and wide for data on social life, as it is now available at our fingertips on the web. However, many of the techniques normally used in traditional research such as participant-observation and the writing of field notes, need to be adapted quite a bit for use in this new media. Rather than data being expensive and precious, the dilemma becomes how to choose from so much information and how to store and analyze it in meaningful ways that remain acceptable within more traditional fields of study. In this interactive workshop, we will start by introducing our previous work on IT occupational culture, the stereotypes of geeks and nerds, and the potential implications of these stereotypes in the recruiting of people to information technology careers. Taking the topic of geeks and nerds in the IT culture as the topic for our web research, we will describe our experiences on conducting web research by archiving websites using the Mozilla Firefox scrapbook Add-on tool. We will talk about the tool and its features and briefly provide examples of previous research explorations. Then, we will present examples of our research journey on our topic using the scrapbook tool collecting and analyzing data from several websites (commercial sites, blogs, videos) as an experiment to see what we can learn about the culture of geeks and nerds by viewing different types of websites. Finally, as the heart of the workshop, we will have a collective activity of brainstorming, applying, and comparing techniques for webpage analysis, using the topic of geeks and nerds in the IT culture as subject material for discussion. We plan to form multidisciplinary groups from the audience and facilitate a half-hour <b>break-out</b> <b>session</b> to allow the smaller groups to share ideas and summarize their initial findings. The groups will then reunite for a large-group exchange about archiving and analysis of websites about a certain theme. The organizers of this workshop embody a multi-disciplinary approach in all of our work and look forward to the opportunity to forge diverse groups to help analyze the websites from different perspectives and inspire new thinking about possible methods for website analysis...|$|E

The seminar strove to build a unified view across the loosely-coupled system components responsible for the various stages of database query processing. Participants were chosen for their experience with database query processing and, where possible, their prior work in academic research or in product development towards robustness in database query processing. In order to pave the way to motivate, measure, and protect future advances in robust query processing, seminar 10381 focused on developing tests for measuring the robustness of query processing. In these proceedings, we first review the seminar topics, goals, and results, then present abstracts or notes of some of the seminar <b>break-out</b> <b>sessions.</b> We also include, as an appendix, the robust query processing reading list that was collected and distributed to participants before the seminar began, as well as summaries of a few of those papers that were contributed by some participants...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to identify the}} challenges facing development within the agri-food sector of Sub-Saharan Africa, specifically in Malawi. On-site interviews were conducted to identify challenges faced by commodity associations and co-operatives, as well as small-scale food and beverage processors during a three-week assignment in Malawi. Actual processing facilities were examined, as were the equipment used and procedures followed. Results of the project were communicated to leaders from international aid organizations, government departments, industry, and academia during a two-day workshop. Additional information was provided through <b>break-out</b> <b>sessions</b> and group discussions within the workshop framework. Of more than forty individual challenges identified, the most serious involved financial constraints. In nations heavily reliant {{on the use of}} chemical fertilizers, financial assistance for such basic agricultural inputs was considered to be critical. The lack of suitable equipment coupled with insufficient supplies of high quality raw materials was a major concern. Inadequate education and training, plus poorly developed local technologies also contributed to the abundance of barriers. Food processing activities were often found to be labour-intensive and time-consuming with resultant low yields and poor economic returns. Identification of these challenges and assistance in overcoming them is essential for future capacity building, value addition, and creation of successful, sustainable businesses...|$|R
