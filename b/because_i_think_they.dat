60|$|But I should say, in conclusion, {{that the}} earnest and {{continued}} {{desire of the}} Government, and much devoted labor, are given to make the military hospitals here {{as good as they}} can be, considering all things. I find no expense spared, and great anxiety manifested in the highest quarters, to do well by the national sick. I meet with first-class surgeons in charge of many of the hospitals, and often the ward surgeons, medical cadets, and head nurses, are fully faithful and competent. Dr. Bliss, head of Armory-square, and Dr. Baxter, head of Campbell, seem to me to try to do their best, and to be excellent in their posts. Dr. Bowen, one of the ward surgeons of Armory, I have known to fight as hard for many a poor fellow's life under his charge as a lioness would fight for her young. I mention such cases <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> deserve it, on public grounds.|$|E

60|$|I have related these circumstances, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are {{connected}} with causes {{that have a}} great influence {{on the success of}} American navigation. On passing several of the British ships to-day, I observed that their officers were below, or at least out of sight; and in one instance, a vessel of a very fair mould, and with every appearance of a good sailer, actually lay with some of her light sails aback, long enough to permit us to come up with and pass her. The Hudson probably went with this wind some fifteen or twenty miles farther than this loiterer; while I much question if she could have gone as far, had the latter been well attended to. The secret {{is to be found in}} the fact, that so large a portion of American ship-masters are also ship-owners, as to have erected a standard of activity and vigilance, below which few are permitted to fall. These men work for themselves, and, like all their countrymen, are looking out for something more than a mere support.|$|E
60|$|In {{the series}} of books I edit for my sister I confine myself to those that have I believe some special value to Ireland, now or in the future. I have asked Mr. Pound for these {{beautiful}} plays <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will help me to explain a certain possibility of the Irish dramatic movement. I am writing these words with my imagination stirred by {{a visit to the}} studio of Mr. Dulac, the distinguished illustrator of the Arabian Nights. I saw there the mask and head-dress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of Cuchulain, and who wearing this noble half-Greek half-Asiatic face will appear perhaps like an image seen in revery by some Orphic worshipper. I hope to have attained the distance from life which can make credible strange events, elaborate words. I have written a little play that can be played in a room for so little money that forty or fifty readers of poetry can pay the price. There will be no scenery, for three musicians, whose seeming sun-burned faces will I hope suggest that they have wandered from village to village in some country of our dreams, can describe place and weather, and at moments action, and accompany it all by drum and gong or flute and dulcimer. Instead of the players working themselves into a violence of passion indecorous in our sitting-room, the music, the beauty of form and voice all come to climax in pantomimic dance.|$|E
60|$|I TELL {{these things}} about my boy, {{not so much}} because they were {{peculiar}} to him as <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are, many of them, common to all boys. One tiresome fact about boys is that they are so much alike; or used to be. They did not wish to be so, but they could not help it. They did not even know they were alike; and my boy used to suffer in ways that he believed no boy had ever suffered before; but as he grew older he found that boys had been suffering {{in exactly the same way}} from the beginning of time. In the world you will find a great many grown-up boys, with gray beards and grandchildren, who think that they have been different their whole lives through from other people, and are the victims of destiny. That is because with all their growing they have never grown to be men, but have remained a sort of cry-babies. The first thing you have to learn here below is that in essentials you are just like every one else, and that you are different from others only in what is not so much worth while. If you have anything in common with your fellow-creatures, it is something that God gave you; if you have anything that seems quite your own, it is from your silly self, and is a sort of perversion of what came to you from the Creator who made you out of himself, and had nothing else to make any one out of. There is not really any difference between you and your fellow-creatures; but only a seeming difference that flatters and cheats you with a sense of your strangeness, and makes you think you are a remarkable fellow.|$|E

50|$|Cohen {{says the}} film was {{significantly}} trimmed in post production:We did lose a few funny scenes that I wanted to keep. When I showed New World my original cut, they felt strongly that the film should move a lot faster. I realized that I’d made a picture {{that was a little}} too dense and sophisticated, so we increased the pacing. I know that along with some of the commercials, we did lose a romantic scene between Moriarty and Andrea that took place in a hotel room. It was perhaps a wise decision to cut some of those scenes out, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>they</b> played well in the totality of the film. The story needed to drive forward at certain points and not be slowed down with extraneous material, although it can be painful cutting scenes out that you like.|$|R
2500|$|On 30 August 1961, Diana was baptised at St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham. She {{had three}} siblings: Sarah, Jane, and Charles.

The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was {{reportedly}} sent to Harley Street clinics in London to {{determine the cause of}} the [...] "problem". The experience was described as [...] "humiliating" [...] by Diana's younger brother, Charles: [...] "It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> ever got over it." [...] Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate. The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward as a child.|$|R

5000|$|In July 1950, {{the record}} of the {{committee}} hearing was printed, and Lodge was outraged to find that 35 pages were not included. Lodge noted that his objections to the conduct of the hearing and his misgivings about the inadequacy of vetting suspected traitors were missing, and that the edited version read as if all committee members agreed that McCarthy was at fault {{and that there was no}} Communist infiltration of the State Department. Lodge stated [...] "I shall not attempt to characterize these methods of leaving out of the printed text parts of the testimony and proceedings... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> speak for themselves."

[...] Fulbright’s statement was reported as a three-column spread {{on the front page of}} the East German Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland. The West German reception of his statement was extremely negative. A cable from US Embassy Bonn reported that “rarely has a statement by a prominent American official aroused so much consternation, chagrin and anger.” Willy Brandt’s Press Secretary Egon Bahr is quoted as saying: “We privately called him Fulbricht” (after Walter Ulbricht, who was the East German head of state at that time).|$|E

Karel Engliš was an important Czech economist. Although he came from poor circumstances, he worked his way {{up to the top of}} the society in the period of the First republic. He was born on August 17, 1880 in Hrabyň, a small village near Opava. After graduating from Opava' s grammar school he continued his studies at The Faculty of Law at Charles University. During his studies he had to support himself. It was probably the difficult conditions for his studies (actually as well as for the initiation of his "adult" life) which made him a very hard working and persistent person, who followed perseveringly his goal regardless of personal sacrifice. A large number of important roles, which he was successfully performing, is the testimony of it: Minister of Finance, a governor of ČNB, a dean and rector of the Masaryk' s uni versi ty in Brno. His teaching acti vi ties and scientific work at Prague's and Brno's universities frame an important part of [...] ...|$|R
