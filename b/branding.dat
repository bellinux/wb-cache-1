For <b>brand</b> quality, inferior radical innovations exert more negative impacts {{on the quality of}} pioneer <b>brands</b> than on the quality of follower <b>brands.</b> However, inferior incremental innovations exert identical negative impacts on the quality of both pioneer and follower <b>brands.</b> For <b>brand</b> innovability, both inferior radical and incremental innovations exert more negative impacts on the innovability of pioneer <b>brands</b> than on the innovability of follower <b>brands.</b> In comparison, <b>brand</b> innovability is less susceptible than <b>brand</b> quality to inferior innovation information. The findings suggest that it is more justified to evaluate innovative <b>brands</b> with <b>brand</b> innovability, instead of <b>brand</b> quality, for two reasons. Firstly, <b>brand</b> innovability is more realistic than <b>brand</b> quality because <b>brand</b> innovability is more relevant than <b>brand</b> quality to profits. Secondly, <b>brand</b> innovability is inclusive of <b>brand</b> innovativeness, which ameliorates adverse effects when innovative extensions are inferior. The threat of inferior innovative extensions is less horrible than expectation if the adverse effects on the innovative <b>brands</b> are assessed with <b>brand</b> innovability, instead of <b>brand</b> quality. However, being innovative is like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it helps generating more profits.
