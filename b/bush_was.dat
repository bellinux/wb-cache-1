5|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> criticized internationally and {{targeted}} by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy.

5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> greeted enthusiastically.

A shirt-sleeved statue of <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E

Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged that <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> favorably treated due to his father's political standing {{as a member of the}} House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance.

5000|$|A bushing, {{also known}} as a <b>bush,</b> <b>is</b> an {{independent}} plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; this is {{the most common form of}} a plain bearing. Common designs include solid (sleeve and flanged), split, and clenched bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> only a [...] "sleeve" [...] of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that a solid sleeved <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> solid all the way around, a split bushing has a cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to a split bushing but with a [...] (or [...] ) across the cut. A flanged <b>bushing</b> <b>is</b> a sleeve <b>bushing</b> with a flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the <b>bushing</b> when it <b>is</b> installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.|$|R
