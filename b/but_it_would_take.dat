5|$|While {{living in}} exile in Switzerland, after being forced to flee Nazi-occupied Austria, Salten wrote a sequel to Bambi that follows the birth and lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. The young fawns {{interact}} with various deer, and are educated and watched over by Bambi and Faline as they grow. They also {{learn more about the}} ways of man, including both hunters and the gamekeeper seeking to protect the deer. Due to Salten's exiled status — he had lost his Austrian publisher Paul Zsolnay Verlag — the English translation of the novel was published first, in the United States in 1939 by Bobbs-Merrill, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> a year before the sequel was published in the original German language in Switzerland by his new publisher.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian {{national}} contingent {{was organized}} in traditional formations {{dating back to}} the earlier medieval times, with chorągiew (banner) unit, commanded by a rotmistrz and composed of smaller poczet (lance) retinues, each composed of one towarzysz and a varying number of aides. The size of a chorągiew could vary from as little as 60 to as many as 300 men. Two or more choragwie (through rarely more than a dozen, and never more than about forty) formed a regiment (pułk) unit, a type of a unit similar to the medieval battle or modern division or corps. Its senior commander was known as pułkownik (colonel). The foreign contingent was organized into regiments, often numbering around 500-1,000, and divided into companies. King John III Sobieski made an attempt in the 1670s to replace the national-foreign contingent divisions with a single structure, dividing units into infantry, cavalry and dragoons, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> many decades before those reforms bore fruit.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command, returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, {{as well as the}} harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.|$|E

25|$|A second banking {{commission}} {{was created in}} November 1934, the Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit, to inquire into {{the creation of a}} central bank among other things. The majority report of August 1938 recommended {{for the creation of a}} central bank with enhanced powers and functions. This resulted in the creation of the Central Bank of Ireland, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> three decades before the bank would have all the rights and functions associated with a central bank.|$|E
25|$|United States v. Wheeler {{identified}} a major omission in federal criminal law (the {{lack of a}} federal kidnapping statute), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> a major national tragedy to rectify the problem. In most common law jurisdictions, kidnapping had been outlawed by the courts, not by statute, but the Supreme Court had held in United States v. Hudson and Goodwin that the Constitution prohibited common law crimes. It was only after the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, which ended {{in the death of}} 21-month-old Charles Lindbergh, Jr., that Congress passed the Federal Kidnapping Act, which prohibited kidnapping.|$|E

25|$|Sagan's {{contribution}} to the 1969 symposium was {{an attack on the}} belief that UFOs are piloted by extraterrestrial beings: Applying several logical assumptions (see Drake equation), Sagan calculated the possible number of advanced civilizations capable of interstellar travel to be about one million. He projected that any civilization wishing to check on all the others on a regular basis of, say, once a year would have to launch 10,000 spacecraft annually.

25|$|Construction soon began, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> until 1909 for {{the bridge}} to be {{completed}} due to delays from the collapse of an incomplete span during a windstorm, and from labor unrest, which included an attempt to dynamite one span. The bridge opened for public use on March 30, 1909, having cost about $18 million and 50 lives. There was a ten-cent toll to drive over the bridge. The bridge's ceremonial grand opening was held on June 12, 1909. At the time, {{it was the fourth}} longest bridge in the world. The grand opening included a fireworks display. The bridge was then known as the Blackwell's Island Bridge, from an earlier name for Roosevelt Island.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the {{fighting}} had begun, the OAS met in an urgent session and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged {{on the night of}} July 18; it took full effect only on July 20. El Salvador continued until July 29 to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> more than a decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.|$|E

[...] Later, Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) tells Michael that Truck, heavily inebriated, was decapitated in a truck accident. Michael summons the staff to a primitive grief counseling session involving a collapsible Hoberman sphere ball, in which Michael tells members of the staff to give stories of deceased love ones. This leads to the staff telling stories about losing loved ones based on death scenes in movies (Million Dollar Baby, The Lion King, and Weekend at Bernie's) with Ryan Howard (B. J.

500|$|Charles Darwin read Sir John's 1809 pamphlet, and was {{impressed}} with a passage that elaborated on how [...] "the weak and the unhealthy do not live to propagate their infirmities". These writings, along with Darwin's correspondence via their mutual friend William Yarrell, aided Darwin in the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin's seminal work On the Origin of Species, first published in 1859, cited Sir John's experiments in pigeon breeding, and recalled [...] "That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that 'he would produce any given feather in three years, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> him six years to obtain head and beak.'" [...] Darwin also cited Sir John extensively regarding the Sebright bantam, as well as pigeon and dog breeding, in his 1868 work Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication, his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, and his book on Natural Selection (which was not published in his lifetime).|$|E

500|$|The Astonishing has {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album holds an average score of 80, based on six reviews. Critics were especially complimentary of the band's willingness {{to write a}} long, unconventional album, with AllMusic commenting, [...] "Dream Theater have invested in the 'album' concept (and in listeners' attention spans) even as the music biz doubles down {{on the notion that}} long-players are merely envelopes to hold singles." [...] Rolling Stone echoed these sentiments, concluding, [...] "The results won't please every Dream Theater partisan, nor will they convert the skeptical. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> a hard heart to deny Petrucci, co-composer and keyboardist Jordan Rudess and their mates credit for the boldness of their aspirations and the assurance with which they achieve them." [...] Loudwire was also supportive of the band's unique approach, but warned that it might make the album polarizing for fans.|$|E
500|$|Burnham {{was already}} a celebrated scout when he first befriended Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War, but the {{backgrounds}} of these two scouts was as strange a contrast as {{it is possible to}} imagine. From his youth on the open plains, Burnham's earliest playmates were Sioux Indian boys and their ambitions pointed to excelling in the lore and arts of the trail and together they dreamed of some day becoming great scouts. [...] When Burnham was a teenager he supported himself by hunting game and making long rides for Western Union through the California deserts, his early mentors were wise old scouts of the American West, and by 19 he was a seasoned scout chasing and being chased by Apache. The British scout he would later befriend and serve with in Matabeleland, Baden-Powell, was born in London and had graduated from Charterhouse, one of England's most famous public schools. Baden-Powell developed an ambition to become a scout at an early age. He passed an exam that gave him an immediate commission into the British Army when he was 19, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> several years before he was engaged in any active service. When the two men met in 1896, Baden-Powell was an army intelligence officer and a brilliant outdoorsman who had organized a small scouting section in his regiment, written a book called Reconnaissance and Scouting (1884) and served in India, Afghanistan, Natal and Ashanti. Burnham, meanwhile, was General Carrington's Chief of Scouts.|$|E

Babylonian astronomers studied the rising times of the signs and calculated tables of ascensions for their latitude, [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> better time measurements by the Egyptians and the introduction of the concept of ascendant, around the 2nd century B.C., to give astrological houses their first recognisable structure and meaning, from the perspective of Classical Western astrology.|$|E

2500|$|When the Ottoman Empire {{was broken}} {{up in the}} {{aftermath}} of the war, the question of shareholding in TPC became a major issue at the 1920 San Remo conference, where the future of all non-Turkish and Arab-majority areas of the former Ottoman Empire were mostly decided. A rising demand for petroleum during the war had demonstrated to the big powers the importance of having their own sources of oil. Since one of the original partners of TPC had been German, the French demanded this share as the spoils of war. This was agreed by the San Remo Oil Agreement, much to the annoyance of the Americans who felt excluded from Middle Eastern oil and demanded an [...] "open door".
