5000|$|With the {{capacity}} of the reservoir increased from , two new pipelines were constructed, to improve the transfer of water from the Ouse. The Ely Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme was licensed to allow [...] per day to be transferred, but the pumps at the Kennett pumping station could not deliver this volume, and the maximum permitted discharge into the river at Kirtling Green was [...] per day. As part of the upgrade, three additional pumps were installed at Kennett. Around 9.6 mi of new underground pipeline was constructed from Kirtling Green in Suffolk, {{along the banks of the}} Stour to Wixoe, where the water discharges into the river. Most is 4 ft in diameter, but this reduces to 3.3 ft for the final 2.1 mi, where the gradient is steeper. It can deliver an additional [...] per day into the river system. Further down the river, a new pumping station was constructed at Wormingford, to remove the water from the river and pump it to Abberton. The pumping station pumps the water for approximately 1.2 mi to a <b>break</b> <b>tank,</b> from where it can flow by gravity to the reservoir. Most of the two pipelines were installed using cut and cover techniques, but the southern pipeline passes under the River Colne and beneath the A12 road and the East Coast railway to the west of Colchester. Twin shafts, 23 ft in diameter and 66 ft deep were excavated, and 490 ft of 5 ft diameter bored tunnel passed under both the road and the railway. The pipeline was then laid through the tunnel and grouted in. The entire project was completed in 2014.|$|E
40|$|The pectic enzyme, Pectinmethylesterase (PE) and Polygalacturonase I and II (PGI and PGII), in {{the tomato}} fruit {{released}} after crushing during tomato processing reduce the viscosity of tomato paste by {{breaking down the}} insoluble pectin in the cell wall. To achieve higher viscosity tomato paste, the cold break (60 - 95 °C) processes {{can be used to}} inactivate the pectic enzyme and to achieve higher viscosity tomato paste. The study of tomato solids and PG enzyme activity showed that the levels of insoluble solids, total solids, pectin, and °Brix in Ferry Morse tomatoes were independent of fruit ripeness. The amount of PG enzymes was high in orange and dark red tomatoes and the activity of PG enzymes increased as a function of ripeness, from green to dark red. In the dark red tomato, the inactivation of PG enzyme activity was required to retain the level of pectin. Cold break temperatures below 60 °C can not inactivate the PG enzyme activity. The PG enzymes started to be denatured when the hot break temperature was above 65 °C and be completely destroyed when the break temperature was above 80 °C. A mathematical model of the break process was formulated and Matlab programme was used to predict the effect of break temperatures on the pectin and PG enzyme concentration of the tomato pulp in the <b>break</b> <b>tank</b> for any inputs of feed rate (the flow rate to the <b>break</b> <b>tank),</b> feed ripeness, and residence time. The model was used to demonstrate the understanding and the optimisation of break process performance. Longer residence time of dark red tomato pulp in the <b>break</b> <b>tank</b> can decrease pectin fraction residual and increase enzyme inactivation in the tank temperature range 40 to 60 °C. The pectin fraction remaining increased when the tank temperature was above 60 °C because of the inactivation of PG enzymes. At 80 °C there was no effect of residence time, the pectin fraction residual increased and reached 90 % and enzyme fraction residual decreased to 10 %. The effect of mixed tomato ripeness between the ripe fruit (orange and dark red) with the unripe fruit (green, breaker, and turning), the level of PG enzymes in the <b>break</b> <b>tank</b> decreased and affected on the higher pectin fraction remaining. Lower break temperature can be therefore used in this process to inactivate the low amount of PG enzyme and to achieve the same extent of pectin hydrolysis. The interruption of the feed coming into the <b>break</b> <b>tank</b> during tomato processing can increase the pectin fraction remaining and the enzyme fraction remaining in a new steady state when the feed was turned on...|$|E

The article {{presents}} the results of the experimental research on the placement of the cone of substitute sediment {{at the bottom of the}} laboratory whirlpool tank with capacity of V= 2 hl and diameter D= 640 mm. The subject of the research was the influence of the whirl-pool tilt angle on the process of forming the cone of break. Different tilt angles of the tank's inlet were also taken into account and, for each characteristic states of forming the cone of break were registered. The research led to finding a tilt angle beneficial in terms of movement of the cone of substitute sediment in comparison to cycling in a tank without any tilt.
