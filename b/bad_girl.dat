500|$|The {{tour was}} also notable for {{giving rise to}} the term [...] "new Madonna", a {{stronger}} and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe. Considine felt that [...] "the important thing Madonna did on the tour was to demonstrate how female sexuality can {{be a source of}} strength. Traditionally in pop culture, there are two roles that a woman can play—the good girl and the <b>bad</b> <b>girl,</b> and the <b>bad</b> <b>girl</b> is never taken seriously. But Madonna shows up the trappings of a <b>bad</b> <b>girl,</b> and demanded to be taken up seriously because she just doesn't roll over. I got more sense of the strength and power that was under her image all along." [...] Another important fact noted in the tour by scholars is the extensive use of multimedia technique to its maximum potential. Says Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, that [...] "Madonna transformed the concept of a concert tour being focused on the songs. She turned her Who's That Girl? tour into a ubiquitous multimedia blitz technique by including songs, dancing, choreography, videos, big screens, backdrops—not to mention the subtle preaching and messages—that made singing a secondary quality for concert goers.
