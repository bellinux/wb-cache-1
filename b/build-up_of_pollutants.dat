The term {{atmospheric}} haze {{is a condition}} of reduced visibility, caused {{by the presence of}} fine particulate matter in the atmosphere, which can originate from natural or anthropogenic sources. The "Brown Haze" is a phenomenon that is associated with Cape Town and can be described as brown coloured smog. It occurs over the winter months, mainly May to September, due to the strong temperature inversions and windless conditions that can occur during these months. These conditions lead to the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> emitted into the atmosphere. The Cape Town Brown Haze Phase Two study was used to obtain a detailed analysis of the atmosphere in a programme of lateral and vertical profiles through the Brown Haze. The field campaign took place from the 29 th July 2003 to the 26 th August 2003 around the Cape Town metropolitan region...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{is one of}} the {{prominent}} sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and road surfaces are the most critical platform for stormwater pollution. <b>Build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> on road surfaces was the focus of this research study. The study found that PAHs build-up on road surfaces primarily originate from traffic activities, specifically gasoline powered vehicles. Other sources such as diesel vehicles, industrial oil combustion and incineration were also found to contribute to the PAH build-up. Additionally, the study explored the linkages between concentrations of PAHs and traffic characteristics such as traffic volume, vehicle mix and traffic flow. While traffic congestion was found to be positively correlated with 6 - ring and 5 - ring PAHs in road build-up, it was negatively correlated with 3 -ring and 4 ring PAHs. The absence of positive correlation between 3 -ring and 4 -ring PAHs and traffic parameters is attributed to the propensity of these relatively volatile PAHs to undergo re-suspension and evaporation. The outcomes of this study are expected to contribute effective transport and land use planning for the prevention of PAH pollution in the urban environment...|$|E

In the study discussed in this paper, the outcomes of a detailed experiment investigation into build-up processes of heavy metals and volatile organics are presented. It was found that traffic parameters such as average daily traffic, volume over capacity ratio and surface texture depth had similar strong correlations with the build-up of heavy metals and volatile organics. Multicriteria decision analyses revealed that the 1 - 74 um particulate fraction of total suspended solids (TSS) could be regarded as a surrogate indicator for particulate heavy metals in build-up and this same fraction of total organic carbon could be regarded as a surrogate indicator for particulate volatile organics build-up. In terms of pollutants affinity, TSS was found to be the predominant parameter for particulate heavy metals build-up and total dissolved solids was found to be the predominant parameter for he potential dissolved particulate fraction in heavy metals build-up. It was also found that land use did not {{play a significant role in}} the build-up of traffic generated heavy metals and volatile organics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{international}} ESCOMPTE campaign, {{which took}} place in summer 2001 in the most highly polluted French region, was devoted to validate air pollution prediction models. Surface and remote sensing instruments (Lidar, Radar and Sodar) were deployed over the Marseille area, along the Mediterranean coast, in order to investigate the fine structure of the sea-breeze circulation and its relationship with the pollutant concentrations. The geographical situation of the Marseille region combines a complex coastline and relief which both lead to a peculiar behaviour of the sea-breeze circulation. Several local sea breezes, perpendicular to the nearest coastline, settled in during the morning. In the afternoons, when the thermal gradient between the continental and marine surface grows up, a southerly or a westerly sea breeze may dominate. Their respective importance is then a function of time, space and altitude. Furthermore, an oscillation of the westerly sea breeze with a period of about 3 h is also highlighted. We show that these dynamical characteristics have profound influences on the atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) development and on pollutant concentrations. In fact, the direction and intensity of the sea-breeze determine the route and the transit time of the stable marine air flow over the continental surface. Thus, the ABL depth may exhibit several collapses correlated with the westerly sea-breeze pulsation. The ozone and aerosol concentrations are also related to the dynamical features. In the suburbs and parts of the city under pulsed sea breezes, a higher ABL depth and higher ozone concentrations are observed. In the city centre, this relationship between pulsed sea-breeze intensity and ozone concentration is different, emphasising the importance of the transit time and also the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the marine air mass along the route. Finally, the variations of aerosol concentration are also described according to the breeze direction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} a 15 -month long study (September 1996 –November 1997) {{on water}} soluble components (Na+, NH 4 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Cl−, NO 3 −, and SO 42 −) in atmospheric aerosols conducted at a remote Himalayan site and a rural Middle-Mountain site in Nepal. Most {{of the species}} sampled behave similarly in terms of seasonal and short-term variations. The aerosol concentrations were low {{during the second half}} of the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons and gradually increased during the winter season. Aerosol concentrations in some samples were up to 20 times higher during the pre-monsoon and early-monsoon seasons than they were in post-monsoon. The seasonal variations are clearly related to variations in atmospheric circulation. The high concentrations during the pre-monsoon season are attributed to regional scale valley wind systems and the maximum concentrations at both sites coincide with maxima in the local wind speed record. Occasional shifts in the large-scale circulation resulted in dramatic fluctuations in aerosol concentrations during the pre-monsoon and early monsoon seasons. In the middle of May the large-scale circulation changed from westerly to south-easterly monsoon in the Himalaya. The summer monsoon circulation brought considerable amounts of pollution to the sites from southeast. Precipitation played an important role in short-term (few samples, e. g., during the late winter at the Himalayan site) to longer-term (several samples, e. g., after mid-June at both sites) reduction in the aerosol concentrations, while the lack of precipitation in the pre-monsoon and early monsoon supported a gradual <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the atmosphere. During the pre-monsoon and early monsoon, when concentrations were elevated at both sites, they were often higher at the remote Himalayan site than at the middle mountain site. A pollution layer in the monsoon circulation due to dry convective rise of pollutants at distant sources and horizontal upper air transport by monsoon flow could have caused these elevated concentrations...|$|E

The apparatus has been evaluated for a number of SVOCs including PAHs, phthalates, organophosphate esters and alkylphenol) with as including FW-Is, phthalates, organophosphate esters and alkylphenol) with a broad range of volatility (from naphthalene to pyrene). The breakthrough measurement study performed in the worst conditions (30 0 e and 7 CJllo relative humidity) demonstrated that the adsorbent Tenax TA was appropriate to quantitatively collect even the least volatile compound naphthalene over a 24 hours sampling period. The analytical method was developed for 16 R, 6 CB*is, 5 phthalates, 2 organophosphate esters, 3 alkylphenols and 5 pesticides (2 organophosphorous, 1 carbam te, 1 pyrethro'id and 1 organochlorine). Its applicability for R measurements was verified with a standard reference material (SRM 1649 a, NIS 1) and by comparison of indoor air filter strips analysed by the Tn method and a conventional solvent extraction method. The 10 method was shown to be quantifiable for R up to benzo(a) pyrene but less effective for less volatile At due to their incomplete desorption. A side by side comparison between the developed sampler and a low volume Filter/PUF sampler clearly demonstrate that the developed method was much more efficient than the low volume PUF sampler for the measurement of gaseous low molecular weight compounds (Mw S 178 g. mol- 1). Regarding the particulate phase, measured concentrations from both samplers were highly correlated with the exceptions of the heavy R (IP, DahA and BghiP). These results suggest that sampling artifact were limited or {{similar to those of the}} low volume sampler. The precision of the method was evaluated by the relative standard deviation from co-located measurements in an indoor environment (n= 6). A number of target. compounds were detected including R, CH, phthalates, organophosphate esters and phenol. The relative standard deviation was generally less than 1 CJllo indicating good reprodUcibility. A small demonstration study consisting of twenty four hours indoor and personal measurements was carried during six days. The results obtained in this demonstration study were in agreement with most previous studies reporting indoor heavy At concentrations lower or similar than outdoor R concentrations and light R concentrations higher indoors than in outdoor environments.

Lastly, under combined traffic scenario, moderate traffic with average daily traffic ranging from 2300 to 5900 and average congestion of 0. 47 was found to dominate SVOC and NVOC build-up on roads...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{growing concern}} for {{environmental}} problems underlines {{the importance of}} correctly predicting the fate of pollutants released into the environment. In the case of VOCs, this is a complex task due to {{the large number of}} VOCs with different reactivity's present in ambient air (Atkinson, 1990). In Cape Town and the Vaal Triangle brown haze layers develops in ambient air during windless days in the wintertime. This leads to the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> emitted into the atmosphere. The haze is usually most intense in the early mornings, gradually dispersing during the day. The aim of the study was the identification, quantification and comparison of VOCs in Cape Town and the Vaal Triangle. Different sampling techniques have been used during intensive field campaigns in Cape Town and the Vaal Triangle. Three different sampling techniques were used, namely: 6 litre TO canisters, CarbotrapTM 300 tubes and 75 mm Carboxen-PDMS SPME fibres. Samples were also taken at different altitudes in the lower troposphere, because the pollution layers are formed at different altitudes. Background corrections were also carried out. A Supelco (Cat no: 41900 -U) calibration standard, was used as external standard. Samples were analysed by a Hewlett Packard Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) and Micromass Autospec-TOF mass spectrometer (MS) according to the EPA TO- 14 a compendium method. The samples were concentrated on a Perkin-Elmer Turbo matrix thermal desorber. A temperature program was used and VOCs not present in the Supelco standard were identified using the MS data system library (NIST). SMPE was only used as a qualitative comparison to the other techniques. A large number of VOCs were identified and quantified at ground level and at different altitudes in ambient air in both Cape Town and in the Vaal Triangle region. The aim was identifying and quantifying manmade emissions. The total VOC profile may differ from these since oxygenated species have not been focussed on. In the Cape Town study more unsaturated VOCs and longer chain HCs were detected during the night than during the day. The number of ketones present also seemed to be higher during the day. In the city centre and Khayelitsha a wide range of halogenated hydrocarbons was detected at ground level. Chlorinated HCs do not take part in photochemical reactions and the concentrations of these VOCs did not to change very much in the day and night samples. It appeared that the concentration of the VOCs at different altitudes in some cases differ significantly. This correlated with the brown haze that forms visible layers and it seemed that the concentration of VOCs in layers differ. The VOCs found at ground level were in most cases related to petroleum products while the VOCs detected at higher altitudes are compounds that remained in the atmosphere and can be transferred from their source over great distances, or photochemical products. In the Vaal Triangle study a very wide variety of VOCs that included a large range of halogenated VOCs were detected. The north-east wind prevailing on the day of sampling diluted the VOCs sampled in the Vaal Triangle. The comparison of the two study regions showed that in both regions the toluene had the highest concentrations of all the measured VOCs. The reported daytime benzene concentrations at Goodwood, Table View and the city centre and the nighttime levels in Khayelitsha exceeded 1. 6 ppb (5 pg. m- 3). The low benzene concentration levels in the Vaal Triangle are mainly due to the wind diluting pollution at the time of sampling. A wider variety of VOCs were detected in the Vaal Triangle than in Cape Town. Pollutants detected in the Vaal Triangle had very low concentrations, mostly even below the detection limits. This was due to the strong wind that is typical for August in the Vaal Triangle. BVOCs were detected in both regions. In both areas the influence of photochemical processes is evident and secondary products of photochemical reactions were found. A large range of halogenated VOCs was found in the ground level samples in the Vaal Triangle and at higher altitudes in the Cape region. Halogenated VOCs were also detected in the city centre in Cape Town and in Khayelitsha. In both regions a large range of complex benzene derivates were found. The comparison of the values obtained using canisters and the CarbotrapTM 300 tubes showed differences that cannot be explained unambiguously. VOCs sampled with SPME correlated with the above-mentioned techniques but the identification of the unknown compounds was much easier in samples taken with the SPME than with the other techniques used. SPME proved to be a handy "screening" tool for the identification of VOCs. A comparison of the two different regions investigated gave insight into the concentrations and the fate of VOCs on a regional and global scale in South Africa. It followed from the results reported in this study that VOC emissions in Cape Town and in the Vaal Triangle would most definitely {{play a significant role in}} the formation of photochemical smog.

40|$|Urban {{traffic and}} climate change are two {{phenomena}} that {{have the potential to}} degrade urban water quality by influencing the <b>build-up</b> and wash-off <b>of</b> <b>pollutants,</b> respectively.

40|$|Land, surface waters, {{and ground}} water worldwide, are {{increasingly}} affected by contaminations from industrial, re-search experiments, military, and agricultural activities either due to ignorance, lack of vision, carelessness, or {{high cost of}} waste disposal and treatment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{proposal}} {{is to provide a}} meaningful alert plan for the South Coast Air Basin that could also be useful in other basins. The key element of the proposal is the calling of a significant number (10 - 20 per year) of alerts on the days when air pollution levels are predicted to be most severe. During these alerts, definite and enforceable restrictions on use of motor vehicles would be in effect to sharply reduce and/or eliminate pollution from this source. In addition, alert conditions would restrict certain types of industrial and commercial activity. Finally, better health warning information would be provided to allow the most sensitive fraction of the population to avoid exposure to conditions cannot tolerate. We begin the discussion defining measures of pollution severity based on both the average level and exposure time as a basis for deciding on what measures should be taken. The specific control measures are suggested based on the current distribution of the emissions from various sources. They would limit the emissions of the sources with the highest emission factors first, but progressively tighten the control as the severity of the pollution increases. A procedure for predicting when alerts will occur is described. This procedure will minimize the disruption involved in calling an alert by taking advantage of the natural diurnal cycle of human activities in the basin. It also recognizes that there is a time lag in the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> secondary <b>pollutants</b> (oxidant and NO_ 2) and that emissions <b>of</b> primary <b>pollutants</b> (hydrocarbons and NOx) must be restricted before the atmospheric reaction takes place. Finally, we give estimates of how often different levels of alert would typically be called, based on the suggested levels. The use of alerts as an incentive to adopt low emissions technology and/or adopt activities that reduce the per capita pollution, such as car pooling, will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been undertaken to improve the robustness of runoff quantity predictions for urban catchments. However, equally robust predictions for runoff quality {{have yet to be}} attained. Past studies addressing this issue have typically been confined to the use of simple conceptual or empirical models which forgo the tedious steps of providing a physical representation of the actual system to be modeled. Consequently, even if the modelling results for the test catchments are satisfactory, the reliability and applicability of these models for other catchments remain uncertain. It is deemed that by employing process-based, deterministic models, many of these uncertainties can be eliminated. A lack of understanding of the hydrological processes occurring during storm events and the absence of good calibration data, however, hamper the advancement of such models and limit their use in the field. This research proposes that the development of a hydrologic model based on the kinematic wave equations linked to an advection-dispersion model that simulates pollutant detachment and transport will improve both runoff quantity and quality simulations and enhance the robustness of the predictions. At the very worst, a model of this type could still highlight the underlying issues that inhibit models from reproducing the recorded historical hydrographs and pollutographs. In actual fact, this approach has already been applied by various modellers to simulate the entrainment <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from urban catchments. Also, the paradigm shift to using the Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) approach in designing urban stormwater systems has prompted the need to differentiate the various sources <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> in urban catchments such as roads, roofs and other impervious surfaces. The primary objective of the study reported herein is to model runoff quantity and quality from small urban catchments, facilitated by the procurement of the necessary field data to calibrate and validate the model via implementation of a comprehensive field exercise based in Sydney. From a water quality perspective, trace metals were selected as the foci. The study outcomes include the formulation of a linkage of models capable of providing accurate and reliable runoff quantity and quality predictions for the study catchments by taking into consideration: - The different availability <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> from urban catchments, i. e. roads vs. roofs; - The <b>build-up</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> on the distinct urban surfaces and their spatial distribution; - The contribution of rainwater to urban runoff pollution; - The partitioning <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> according to particulate bound and dissolved phases; - The respective role of rainfall and runoff in the detachment and entrainment of pollutants; - The influence of particle properties such as particle size distribution and density on pollutant transport; and - The relationship associating particulate bound metals to suspended solids. The simulation results obtained using the proposed model were found to be suitable for modelling the detachment and transport <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> for small urban catchments. Interpretation of these results reveals several key findings which could help to rectify shortcomings of existing modelling approaches. Even though the robustness of the model presented here may not translate into a significant improvement in the overall robustness of model predictions, the physical basis on which this process-based model was developed nevertheless provides the flexibility necessary for implementation at alternative sites. It is also shown that the availability of reliable runoff data is essential for implementation of the model for other similar urban catchments. In conclusion, the proposed model in this study will serve as a worthy tool in future urban catchment management studies...|$|R
40|$|The eastern Mediterranean (EM) {{is one of}} {{the regions}} in the world where {{elevated}} concentrations of primary and secondary gaseous air pollutants have been reported frequently, mainly in summer. This review discusses published studies of the atmospheric dispersion and transport conditions characterizing this region during the summer, followed by a description of some essential studies dealing with the corresponding concentrations <b>of</b> air <b>pollutants</b> such as ozone, carbon monoxide, total reactive nitrogen, methane, and sulfate aerosols observed there. The interlaced relationship between the downward motion of the subsiding air aloft induced by global circulation systems affecting the EM and the depth of the Persian Trough, a low-pressure trough that extends from the Asian monsoon at the surface controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of the mixed boundary layer during summer, is discussed. The strength of the wind flow within the mixed layer and its depth affect much the amount <b>of</b> <b>pollutants</b> transported and determine the potential of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants off their origins in the EM. The reduced mixed layer and the accompanying weak westerlies, characterizing the summer in this region, led to reduced ventilation rates, preventing an effective dilution of the contaminants. Several studies pointing at specific local (e. g., ventilation rates) and regional peculiarities (long-range transport) enhancing the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> air <b>pollutant</b> concentrations are presented. Tropospheric ozone (O 3) concentrations observed in the summer over the EM are among the highest over the Northern Hemisphere. The three essential processes controlling its formation (i. e., long-range transport of polluted air masses, dynamic subsidence at mid-tropospheric levels, and stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange) are reviewed. Airborne campaigns and satellite-borne initiatives have indicated that the concentration values of reactive nitrogen identified as precursors in the formation of O 3 over the EM were found to be 2 to 10 times higher than in the hemispheric background troposphere. Several factors favor sulfate particulate abundance over the EM. Models, aircraft measurements, and satellite-derived data have clearly shown that sulfate has a maximum during spring and summer over the EM. The carbon monoxide (CO) seasonal cycle, as obtained from global background monitoring sites in the EM, is mostly controlled by the tropospheric concentration of the hydroxyl radical (OH) and therefore demonstrates high concentrations over winter months and the lowest concentrations during summer when photochemistry is active. Modeling {{studies have shown that the}} diurnal variations in CO concentration during the summer result from long-range CO transport from European anthropogenic sources, contributing 60 to 80  % of the boundary-layer CO over the EM. The values retrieved from satellite data enable us to derive the spatial distribution of methane (CH 4), identifying August as the month with the highest levels over the EM. The outcomes of a recent extensive examination of the distribution of methane over the tropospheric Mediterranean Basin, as part of the Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment (ChArMEx) program, using model simulations and satellite measurements, are coherent with other previous studies. Moreover, this methane study provides some insight into the role of the Asian monsoon anticyclone in controlling the variability <b>of</b> CH 4 <b>pollutant</b> within mid-to-upper tropospheric levels above the EM in summer...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of urban stormwater quality is of relevant importance for urban drainage, and mathematical models {{may be of}} great interest in this respect. To date, several detailed mathematical models are available to predict stormwater quantity–quality characteristics in urban drainage systems. However, only a few models take sewer sediments into account, considering their cohesive-like properties that influence the <b>build-up</b> process <b>of</b> the <b>pollutant</b> load. Furthermore, the model data requirements, especially for the quality aspects, are extensive, which limit their applicability and affect model results with large uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis provides a measure or index regarding the significance and {{the accuracy of the}} results obtained by mathematical modelling and is therefore of high interest. Nevertheless, only few studies have been carried out in the urban drainage field, and very few deal with water quality issues. One of the main reasons for this lack of research is the computational burden required by detailed models that preserve this analysis and generally require several Monte Carlo simulation runs. A possible to this problem may be the adoption of simplified parsimonious models that generally require shorter computational times. In this context, this paper presents a parsimonious conceptual model for the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>pollutant</b> load in-sewers. The model contains two modules: a hydrological and hydraulic module that calculates the hydrographs at the inlet and at the outlet of the sewer system, and a solid transfer module that calculates the pollutographs. The cohesive properties of sewer sediments were carefully considered. Further, the effectiveness of the innovative sewer sediment modelling approach has been verified by taking into account the uncertainty assessed according to the GLUE methodology.

40|$|Variability in the {{pollutant}} wash-off {{process is a}} concept which needs to be understood in-depth {{in order to better}} assess the outcomes of stormwater quality models, and thereby strengthen stormwater pollution mitigation strategies. Current knowledge about the wash-off process does not extend to a clear understanding of the influence of the initially available pollutant build-up on the variability <b>of</b> the <b>pollutant</b> wash-off load and composition. Consequently, pollutant wash-off process variability is poorly characterised in stormwater quality models, which can result in inaccurate stormwater quality predictions. Mathematical simulation of particulate wash-off from three urban road surfaces confirmed that the wash-off load of particle size fractions 150 µm after a storm event vary with the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> the respective particle size fractions available {{at the beginning of the}} storm event. Furthermore, pollutant load and composition associated with the initially available <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> 150 µm particles on wash-off process variability is significant only for relatively shorter duration storm events...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{models for}} {{predicting}} <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> solute on membrane surface were formulated in this paper. The experiments {{were conducted with}} secondary effluent, groundwater and simulated feed water in small-scale of RO with capacity of 2000 L/d. Feed water used in the experiments contained varying concentrations of sodium, calcium, combined sodium and calcium. In order to study the effect of sodium and calcium ions on membrane performance, experiments with ground water and secondary effluent wastewater were also performed. <b>Build-up</b> <b>of</b> salts on the membrane surface was calculated by measuring concentrations of sodium and calcium ions in feed water permeate and reject streams using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Multiple linear regression of natural logarithmic transformation was used to develop the model based on four main parameters that affect the <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> solute in a small scale of RO namely applied pressure, permeate flux, membrane resistance, and feed concentration. Experimental data obtained in a small scale RO unit were used to develop the empirical model. The predicted values <b>of</b> theoretical <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> sodium and calcium on membrane surface were found in agreement with experimental data. The deviation in the prediction <b>of</b> <b>build-up</b> <b>of</b> sodium and calcium {{were found to be}} 1. 4 to 10. 47 % and 1. 12 to 4. 46 %, respectively...|$|R
