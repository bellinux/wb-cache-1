40|$|The cause, symptom, disease cycle, {{influencing}} factors, {{effects and}} control of <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> are described. <b>Black</b> <b>dot</b> of potato, a disease caused by the fungus Colletotrichum coccodes, was recognized in Australia and Europe, then was observed and described in Canada in 1921. Since then this disease has spread to many potato production areas of the United States; its occurrence was first reported in Nebraska in 1988. In the past few years, <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> has been recognized on infected potato tissue from several areas of the state. The increased incidence of <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> in Nebraska may have been favored by high temperatures and heavy irrigation. <b>Black</b> <b>dot</b> often has been reported as a minor disease. Under favorable conditions, especially on poorly drained, sandy soils, it can result in significant yield losses {{in the field and}} loss of quality of infected tubers in storage...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend towards}} washed and packed {{potatoes}} for the fresh market {{has led to}} an increase in demand for tubers with a good visual appearance. As a consequence of this, blemish diseases, and <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> in particular, are increasingly becoming concerns for the industry (Lees & Hilton, 2003). In GB alone, it is estimated that the blemish diseases, silver scurf and <b>black</b> <b>dot,</b> reduce the value of the total annual crop by around 4. 5 m. <b>Black</b> <b>dot,</b> caused by the fungus Colletotrichum coccodes has become particularly important because the pathogen is widespread in GB soils and there are limited control options. Field and storage experiments were set up to investigate the interaction between soil inoculum levels for C. coccodes (between 40 and 500 pg DNA/g soil), crop duration and storage regime on <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> development throughout storage. There was an interaction between soil inoculum level and crop duration (measured as days from 50 % emergence to harvest) on <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> tuber severity at harvest. <b>Black</b> <b>dot</b> severity increased with lengthening crop duration, and the severity increased more rapidly at higher soil inoculum (P= 0. 005). Disease progress curves for <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> were used to determine the influence of storage treatments and crop duration on disease development in crops grown in field plots {{with a high level of}} inoculum. Post-harvest <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> was shown to be higher on tubers subjected to an extended-cure treatment than those which had minimal-curing in a maincrop variety that had been grown for more than 130 days from 50 % emergence to harvest (P= 0. 024). The integration of the results from the field and storage components of this three year trial into practical recommendations for the control of <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> will be discussed. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

40|$|As all {{underground}} {{parts of}} a potato plant can be infected with Colletotrichum coccodes it was speculated {{that it may be}} possible to predict <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> development on harvested tubers by assessing stems and stolons for the presence of the disease in the growing crop. In a 3 -year study stems and stolons were assessed for <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> in 123 potato crops and its incidence related to disease on the tubers at harvest. In cvs Estima and Maris Piper, if stems or stolons showed <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> symptoms as the onset of crop senescence then the disease was likely to be present on tubers at harvest. No relationship between <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> on stems and stolons in the growing crop and disease on tubers at harvest was found in the cv. Saxon. To explain these results a series of glasshouse and field experiments were performed to identify when symptoms of <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> developed on underground {{parts of a}} potato plant. Results showed that infection by C. coccodes could occur soon after these plant parts had formed. Visual symptoms did not appear on stems and stolons till just prior to foliage senescence and on tubers until after the start of foliage senescence. Further research considered whether a reduction in <b>black</b> <b>dot</b> symptoms on tubers is achievable through haulm destruction methods in the field. Results indicated that in a crop of cv. Maris Piper, where there was a high incidence of <b>black</b> <b>dot,</b> and no one technique gave a significant reduction in symptom developing on tubers. These inconclusive results are discussed.
