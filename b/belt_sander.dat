5000|$|Baseball {{cards and}} CD's were {{destroyed}} by placing them in a box filled with sand, then running over them with a <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> ruining both sides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{can vary}} {{in size from}} the small {{handheld}} unit shown in the illustration to units wide enough to sand a full 1.2 by 2.5 m (4-by-8 foot sheet) of plywood in a manufacturing plant. Some <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> can be as large as 1.2 × 0.7 m.Sanding wood produces {{a large amount of}} sawdust. Therefore, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> employed in woodworking are usually equipped with some type of dust collection system. It may be as simple as a cloth filter bag attached to a portable sander or a large vacuum system to suck dust particles away into a central collector.|$|R
50|$|Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{are used}} for {{removing}} non-ferrous metals, such as aluminum. Non-ferrous metals tend to clog grinding wheels, quickly making them useless for grinding soft metals. Because the small grooves in the sandpaper are opened up as they go around the arc of the drive wheel, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are less prone to clogging.|$|R

50|$|Porter-Cable is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} power tools. The company {{is known for}} introducing a number of noteworthy power tools, such as the first portable <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> helical-drive circular saw, and portable band saw. It is a subsidiary of Stanley Black & Decker.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, Chief Engineer Art Emmons {{invented the}} {{portable}} electric <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> called the Take-About Sander, {{and the company}} began to develop a niche in portable electric power tools. In 1929, Emmons invented the helical-drive circular saw, a compact, lightweight design that {{is still the most}} widely used circular saw design produced today.|$|E
50|$|The {{kill switch}} {{is also used}} on such things as band saws and static <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> pillar drills and lathes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> have a mechanism, often a {{spring-loaded}} idler drum, {{to apply}} the proper tension to the sanding belt, which can be released to allow for changing belts.|$|R
5000|$|Other coated {{abrasive}} forms include sanding cords, pads, belts, and discs. Variants {{are available for}} use by hand or as components for power tools such as sanders, die grinders and <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Belt grinder, {{which is}} usually used as a {{machining}} method to process metals and other materials, {{with the aid of}} coated abrasives. Analogous to a <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> (which itself is often used for wood but sometimes metal). Belt grinding is a versatile process suitable for all kind of applications, including finishing, deburring, and stock removal.|$|E
50|$|Belt sanders {{can have}} a very {{aggressive}} action on wood and are normally used only for the beginning stages of the sanding process, or used to rapidly remove material. Sometimes they are also used for removing paints or finishes from wood. Fitted with fine grit sand paper, a <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> {{can be used to}} achieve a completely smooth surface.|$|E
50|$|For {{more than}} two decades, Bertie's Inn in Reading, Pennsylvania has held a fundraiser called Bertie's Inn <b>Belt</b> <b>Sander</b> Race. Riders sit on and race {{hand-held}} belt sanders on a 40-foot-long plywood track. All team entry fees ($50), food sales and T-shirts sales are donated to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Their most recent race was July 16, 2016.|$|E
50|$|Skil {{products}} include circular saws, cordless drill/drivers, cordless screw drivers, cordless tackers, cordless sealant guns, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> random orbit sanders, multi-sanders, angle grinders, hammers, drills, mixers, jig saws, lasers {{and measuring}} tools, reciprocating saws, routers, and planers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{were one}} of the first power tools used in the growing field of power tool drag racing wherein a pair of stock or {{modified}} <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long extension cords. Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them, causing the sanders to race {{towards the end of the}} track spitting wood dust along the way. Stock sanders race down a 15 m track, while modified sanders race on a 25 m track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast or very slow, depending on the power of the motor. For example, some can go as fast as 8 km/h (5 mph) etc.|$|R
50|$|By early 1953, Porter-Cable manufacturing, {{a company}} in the {{business}} of producing portable power tools and <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> employed more than 400 people in their plant at 1714 North Salina Street, originally the H. A. Moyer carriage factory. The toolmaker bought the original factory from the Moyer family.|$|R
5000|$|RLF Brands {{continues}} to manufacture and market {{a variety of}} add-on tools that can be run by the [...] headstock. These tools include a bandsaw (little changed from the original 1957 version), wood shaper, jointer, <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> strip sander, scroll saw and thickness planer. Changes from one function to the other is usually less than 90 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Fancier {{versions}} use clips, teeth or clamps to {{hold the}} paper in place. Commercial versions can be constructed of various materials. They are usually sized to hold a quarter or half sheet of sandpaper. Some versions use the sandpaper belts intended for a power <b>belt</b> <b>sander.</b> Construction workers often use commercial one-piece sanding blocks consisting of a foam plastic block with an abrasive coating.|$|E
50|$|While at the house, Marybeth and Ben {{discover}} {{her brother}} and father's remains. Marcus, Shawn, Misty and Jenna hear a noise in a bush. Marcus goes to investigate and discovers {{that it was only}} a racoon. Victor then surprises the group and injures Jenna with a <b>belt</b> <b>sander.</b> Marybeth and Ben return and attack Victor. While the other survivors flee, Shawn tries fighting Victor, but instead is killed. Victor then kills Jenna.|$|E
50|$|As he had {{in other}} caucus states and among other largely white, rural electorates in the farm <b>belt,</b> <b>Sanders</b> won a large victory over Hillary Clinton in North Dakota. Sanders won in the cities of Fargo, Bismarck, and Grand Forks where he had campaigned heavily, and he also swept most other rural, {{conservative}} counties in the state. The caucus did not require participants to register before voting due to the state's small population.|$|R
50|$|If {{no power}} {{equipment}} is available, {{this can be}} done with files if the piece of steel has not yet been hardened. Grinding wheels, or small <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are usually what a beginner uses. Well equipped makers usually use a large industrial belt grinder, or a belt grinder made specifically for knife making. Pre-polish grinding on a heat treated blade can be done if the blade is kept cool, to preserve the temper of the steel. Some knife makers will use a coolant mist on the grinder to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Nathan, who has {{returned}} to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. Nathan relays this information to the remaining survivors, who realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident a wrench launched by a <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> hits him in the face, killing him.|$|E
50|$|Band Filing {{takes place}} on a machine similar to a <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> used like a band saw. Band files are {{sectioned}} {{so that they can}} be made from stiff material, as they need to be to effectively remove material yet still work in a constant feed. A band filing operation can be used to remove small amounts of material with good accuracy. The cutting teeth of the file are arranged closely on the file and are used as part of a finishing process.|$|E
50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> is a sander used {{in shaping}} and {{finishing}} wood and other materials. It {{consists of an}} electric motor that turns a pair of drums on which a continuous loop of sandpaper is mounted. Belt sanders may be handheld and moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the sanding belt. Stationary belt sanders are sometimes mounted on a work bench, in which case they are called bench sanders. Stationary belt sanders are often combined with a disc sander.|$|E
50|$|While {{hand-held}} {{power tools}} are extremely helpful, they also produce {{large amounts of}} noise and vibrations. Using power tools without hearing protection {{over a long period}} of time can put a person at risk for hearing loss. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that a person should not be exposed to noise at or above 85 dB, for the sake of hearing loss prevention. Most power tools, including drills, circular saws, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> and chainsaws, operate at sound levels above the 85 dB limit, some even reaching over 100 dB. NIOSH strongly recommends wearing hearing protection while using these kinds of power tools.|$|R
40|$|A low average power, pulsed, solid-state, 1. 06 -micron {{coherent}} {{laser radar}} (CLR) for range and velocity measurements of atmospheric and hard targets has been developed. The {{system has been}} operating at a field test site near Boulder, CO since September, 1988. Measurements have been taken on moving targets such as atmospheric aerosol particles, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> spinning disks, and various stationary targets. The field measurements have shown that this system exhibits excellent velocity measurement performance. A fast-tuning CW Nd:YAG oscillator has also been developed which has a frequency tuning range of greater than 30 GHz (which spans a target radial velocity range of over 16 km/s) and a tuning speed greater than 30 GHz/ms...|$|R
50|$|Ace of Cakes {{highlights}} the frantic activity encompassing {{the production of}} a substantial number of custom edible art cakes {{in a short period of}} time. The staff consists primarily of Duff Goldman's good friends who have varying personalities. They are frequently shown working long hours to build and decorate the cakes, yet are always making jokes to offset the alleged stress of hitting each deadline. Staff members sometimes drive the cakes to their final destinations, which can require road trips of several hundred miles. Goldman has an informal approach to running Charm City Cakes. He is known for using non-traditional cooking utensils such as blowtorches, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> and power saws, and more to construct his designs.|$|R
50|$|Other useful {{power tools}} are a <b>belt</b> <b>sander,</b> {{especially}} if using recycled timber or for finishing rough-sawn timber. A thicknesser/planer is only needed if building many boats or larger vessels, {{as it is}} usually cheaper to pay a joiner {{to do this for}} a small amount of timber. A bench saw is useful if you buy larger sectioned timber, which may be considerably cheaper and need to saw it to the correct size, but again a timber yard will do this for a small charge.|$|E
5000|$|Harkawik's work often {{contains}} an unacknowledged temporal component:"For instance, in Harkawik's installation Flesh & Flash (retrofitted) (all works 2010)--a single {{photograph of the}} artist's hand gripping a bulbous daikon, the index finger mangled (having once been injured by a <b>belt</b> <b>sander),</b> appeared for weeks to be the work's only component. However, on the final night of the show, Harkawik, adding paint to the photo's surface, introduced a latticelike wooden construction {{to the wall and}} a chair to the space, thoughtfully positioned for ideal viewing." ...|$|E
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} to plunge the sword quickly and {{vertically}} (edge first), for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways (warp). Because quenching in water tends to cause a sudden loss of surface carbon, the sword will usually be quenched before the edge is beveled and sharpened. After quenching and tempering, the blade was traditionally given a rough shape with a draw knife before sending to a polisher for sharpening, although in modern times an electric <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> is often used instead.|$|E
40|$|Aspen is {{notoriously}} difficult to age {{because of its}} light-colored wood and faint annual growth rings. Careful preparation and processing of aspen ring samples can overcome these problems, yield accurate age and growth estimates, and concisely date disturbance events present in the tree-ring record. Proper collection of aspen wood is essential in obtaining usable ring data. Mounting of increment cores and sawn disk samples to wood backings holds samples rigid for easy surfacing. Sequential use of planers, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders,</b> {{and an assortment of}} sanding material on the surface of aspen core and disk samples can enhance visibility of tree rings. Application of stain on samples will color the late wood a dark brown and enhance the rings’ visibility...|$|R

50|$|Band saw {{boxes are}} boxes {{made out of}} wood using only a bandsaw for cutting them out. The wood may be a solid block, a {{laminated}} block or a log from the woodpile. Whereas most boxes have straight sides and square corners, band saw boxes have virtually no restrictions as to shape. They can be oval, heart-shaped, lizard-shaped, or any shape the maker can think of. Other tools such as <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> and drum sanders {{can be used to}} shape and sand the box smooth. Relief cuts are always needed {{if you are going to}} make a bandsaw box. If you don't, the box always seems to fall apart. If the bandsaw has a little hitch in it the box usually snaps in two.|$|R
