40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} an approach for vulnerability {{analysis of a}} class of cyber-physical reconfiguration attacks called coordinated variable structure switching. In such an attack, an opponent who gains control over a target circuit <b>breaker,</b> <b>relay</b> or switch can apply a given switching sequence to destabilize the system even if the system is stable in static switch positions. Our analysis approach is illustrated through {{a case study of}} the Western Electricity Coordinating Council 3 -machine, 9 -bus system.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the general practice and {{lessons learned from}} Commercial-Grade Item dedication for nuclear safety-related system applications in Taiwan. The dedication process qualified the commercial off-the-shelf components to be applied as basic components. In past fifteen years, Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) has actively performed the dedication service to help local nuclear power plants solve their procurement problems of nuclear grade items, due to reduced availability of qualified suppliers and/or obsolete issues of qualified components. The Scope of dedication includes material, electrical and mechanical components located in mild and harsh environment. Thousands of components such as piping, fitting, <b>breaker,</b> <b>relay,</b> motor, and control device etc., have already been dedicated to and successfully used in local nuclear power plants. The Commercial-Grade Item dedication process is based on EPRI documentations. Besides, the technical evaluation and equipment qualification are included during the dedication process. The requirements for equipment qualification are described in IEEE standards. Although the codes and standards for dedication in Taiwan refer to those in USA, the challenges may happen due to different regulators, utility, manufacture’s quality culture, and personal responsibility. The key to successful dedication will be dependent on the well-defined component requirements and good project planning. This paper introduces the self-reliant experiences in dedication and economic benefit to local nuclear power plants...|$|E

Devices which may cause arcing include switches, circuit <b>breakers,</b> <b>relay</b> contacts, fuses and poor cable terminations. When an inductive circuit is switched off, the current cannot instantaneously jump to zero: a transient arc will be formed across the separating contacts. Switching devices susceptible to arcing are normally designed to contain and extinguish an arc, and snubber circuits can supply a path for transient currents, preventing arcing. If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc formed outside of a switching device, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. An arc flash describes an explosive electrical event that presents a hazard to people and equipment.|$|R

50|$|Control {{equipment}} was based around the 'Line Replaceable Unit' (LRU) ethos {{and consisted of}} 'trays' of circuit boards and equipment arranged in two cabinets. No.1 housed just the usual circuit <b>breakers,</b> <b>relays,</b> reversers and so forth. No.2 also housed standard equipment but included the complex electronic control circuits that ultimately were the un-doing of the class. Each tray could be slid {{in and out of}} the cabinet (with the locomotive switched off) with ease and each had a test connector. Specific testers were made that simply compared the electrical signals and stimuli on the test socket with the design values. If any were not as expected, the whole tray was replaced and the locomotive was good-to-go... at least that was the theory. The use of testers plugged into the test socket removed the need for engineering staff to be competent electronic engineers (as opposed to electrical engineers which they undoubtedly were), but often faults on one tray would only show themselves in combination with faults on other trays. This led to confusing diagnostics and locomotives were often failed for long periods pending in-depth exploration of a fault. Faulty trays were sent for repair. This early attempt was bold and fundamentally sound. Electronic circuit arrangements in modern locomotives use this approach almost unchanged. Unfortunately, powerful control and computational electronics were in their infancy in 1968. Had the resources of just ten years later been available, it is arguable that Class 74 would have been a success.|$|R

The reliability is determined by an internal collection grid topology and reliability of its electrical components, e. g. generators, transformers, cables, switch <b>breakers,</b> protective <b>relays,</b> and busbars. A wind farm reliability’s quantitative measure can be the probability distribution of combinations of operating and failed states of the farm’s wind turbines. The operating state of a wind turbine is its ability to generate power and to transfer it to an external power grid, which means the availability of the wind turbine and other equipment necessary for the power transfer to the external grid. This measure can be used for quantitative analysis of the impact of various wind farm topologies and the reliability of individual farm components on the farm reliability, and for determining the expected farm output power with consideration of the reliability. This knowledge may be useful in an analysis of power generation reliability in power systems. The paper presents probabilistic models that quantify the wind farm reliability taking into account the above-mentioned technical factors.
