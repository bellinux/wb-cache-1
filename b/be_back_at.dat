25|$|A {{condition}} with this task is that candidates {{are advised to}} arrive back at the boardroom, or designated finish line, by a certain time or receive a fine for lateness; in this instance, the candidates had to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the boardroom by 5:30pm on this task. Although {{there appeared to be}} considerable uncertainty over whether Impact's sub-team of Saira, Paul and Raj would arrive back in time, it was later revealed that they had done so comfortably ahead of the deadline, and had been told to wait outside for a while by the production crew in order to add a degree of suspense to the final edit.|$|E
25|$|Lehto {{was back}} for the San Marino Grand Prix and Andrea de Cesaris would be the second driver at Jordan. However, the weekend {{got off to a}} bad start as Rubens Barrichello had a major crash during {{practice}} and was knocked unconscious. Coming too fast into Variante Bassa, his car was launched into the air by the kerb. Less than a yard from that kerb was a tyre wall, which almost instantly stopped the car's forward motion. His car was flipped over and landed upside down. Barrichello had swallowed his tongue and his life was only saved by quick action from the medical team. He would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the circuit on the Saturday afternoon with a fractured nose, bandaged arm and cut lip. Barrichello has never been able to recall anything from the incident.|$|E

500|$|Feynman {{nominally}} held {{an appointment}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison {{as an assistant}} professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, [...] "It's great to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the only university that ever {{had the good sense to}} fire me." ...|$|E
500|$|Tal's {{return for}} the seventh season was {{announced}} at the 2011 Comic-Con. On the choice to bring Jo back for [...] "Defending Your Life", writer and co-executive producer Adam Glass explained, [...] "Knowing the history there, knowing the emotion that Dean would feel for her, we knew it'd be great. Jo's a favorite, too, {{so we wanted to}} see her back on the show." [...] Tal was happy to return to the show, saying, [...] "I didn't care that it took me over a season to come back. Just to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> all was a blessing." [...] Feeling that she herself had grown as a person since her appearance in the fifth season, Tal tried to mirror that in her performance. She noted, however, [...] "Obviously, [...] died. So there’s been some issues." [...] Singer called her work in the episode [...] "terrific." ...|$|E
500|$|Babe {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on 9 February 2017. In the episode, Babe {{tries to make}} amends with her family by taking care of Sylvie, but instead takes her to the canal and tells her that Stan {{is on the other}} side, before leaving her alone. Badland explained that Babe [...] "would not have actually killed" [...] Sylvie, but instead [...] "enticed her to do something and then walked away from it". When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. Badland explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. Badland believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> some point." [...] She added that, [...] "She's cursed the Carters, and you don't cross Aunt Babe and get away with it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{backstage}} encounter led to {{the group}} being asked to sing background sessions at recording studios in New York. Soon, the group were in demand in New York music circles for their background work for such artists as the Drifters, Ben E. King, Chuck Jackson, Dinah Washington, Ronnie [...] "the Hawk" [...] Hawkins, and Solomon Burke, among many others. Warwick remembered, in her A Biography, that after school, they would catch a bus from East Orange to the Port Authority Terminal, then take the subway to recording studios in Manhattan, perform their background gigs and <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> home in East Orange in time to do their school homework. Her background vocal work would continue while Warwick pursued her studies at Hartt.|$|E
2500|$|The RAF had the {{advantage}} of fighting over home territory. Pilots who bailed out of their downed aircraft could <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> their airfields within hours, while if low on fuel and/or ammunition they could be immediately rearmed. One RAF pilot interviewed in late 1940 had been shot down five times during the Battle of Britain, but was able to crash land in Britain or bail out each time. For Luftwaffe aircrews, a bailout over England meant capture – in the critical August period, almost exactly as many Luftwaffe pilots were taken prisoner as were killed – while parachuting into the English Channel often meant drowning or death from exposure. Morale began to suffer, and [...] ("Channel sickness") – a form of combat fatigue – began to appear among the German pilots. Their replacement problem became even worse than the British.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{really want}} to give you the lowdown on the SW re-formation but there's {{honestly}} not a lot to say. Legal issues prevented me from doing my own band on my own terms {{over the past couple of}} years but thankfully those problems are all resolved now. The kind of stuff happens sometimes. I won't deny that those problems - which were really just the culmination of many years of a lot of other b.s. - left a foul taste in my mouth about SW. But now that all the headaches are behind me I'm feeling great about it. I'm finally running my own band again and I'm really happy and excited to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> it. I've got a killer line-up [...] myself, Danny Vapid, Simon Lamb (the Ritalins), Justin Perkins (Yesterday's Kids) and Adam Cargin (Blueheels) (he's also the new Riverdales drummer) and we've got a great set list." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sutcliffe is {{especially}} noted for an innings of 80 not out against South Africa in Johannesburg on Boxing Day 1953. New Zealand's batsmen were routed by South African fast bowler Neil Adcock on a green wicket. Sutcliffe {{was hit in}} the head by Adcock and, having left the field to receive hospital treatment, returned to the crease swathed in bandages. He took on the bowling, hitting a number of sixes, until the ninth wicket fell. The New Zealand fast bowler Bob Blair, next man in, was understood to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the team hotel distraught as his fiancee had been killed in the Tangiwai disaster two days earlier. Sutcliffe started to walk off only to see Blair walk out. Despite the presence of 23,000 fans, silence enveloped the ground. 33 runs were added in 10 minutes before Blair was out. New Zealand lost the Test match by a considerable margin. Notwithstanding this, the noted New Zealand cricket writer Dick Brittenden said: [...] "It was a great and glorious victory, a story every New Zealand boy should learn at his mother's knee".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to environmental and health costs at home, China's dependence on coal {{is cause for}} concern on a global scale. Due {{in large part to}} the emissions caused by burning coal, China is now the number one producer of carbon dioxide, responsible for a full quarter of the world's CO2 output. According to a recent study, [...] "even if American emissions were to suddenly disappear tomorrow, world emissions would <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the same level within four years as a result of China’s growth alone." [...] The country has taken steps towards battling climate change by pledging to cut its carbon intensity (the amount of CO2 produced per dollar of economic output) by about 40 per cent by 2020, compared to 2005 levels. Reuters reports that [...] "emissions and coal consumption will continue to rise through the 2020s, even though at a slower rate, barring a major intervention including a shift to cleaner burning gas from coal" [...] - in other words, [...] "meeting the carbon intensity target will require a significant change in trajectory for carbon emissions and coal consumption." [...] To that end, China has announced a plan to invest 2.3 trillion yuan ($376 billion) through 2015 in energy saving and carbon emission-reduction projects.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on 20 July 2017 that Benjamin had reprised the role for a [...] "surprise" [...] appearance {{and is expected}} to be onscreen until August. Lisa returns to care for Louise after she is seriously injured, arriving at the hospital in the closing moments of the episode. McFadden will also return to the serial in the episodes following Lisa's return and a show insider commented, [...] "When that hospital door starts to open, [...] be on tenterhooks to see who has rushed to help Louise. When {{it turns out to be}} Lisa, rather than Phil, there will be gasps of shock. It’s such a brilliant surprise." [...] The show released no official confirmation on the reports, although Lisa returned in the episode broadcast in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017. It was subsequently confirmed that Lisa would be returning for a [...] "brief stint" [...] and would share scenes with Phil following his return. On her return, Benjamin commented, [...] "It was great to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> EastEnders as it has been such a long time since I had been there.

2500|$|King Edward entered {{service on}} Monday 1 July 1901, with a daily sailing leaving the Glasgow and South Western Railway's Prince's Pier, Greenock, at an advertised time of 8.40 a.m., visiting Dunoon and Rothesay before calling at the G's Fairlie Pier railway station at 10.20 a.m. then sailing across the Firth to Lochranza {{and on to}} arrive at Campbeltown at 12.20. For a small {{additional}} cost, horse-drawn coach trips from Campbeltown to Machrihanish offered a [...] "Daily Excursion to the Shores of the Atlantic". On the return voyage, the ship left Campbeltown at 3 p.m. and passengers could catch a train at the railway pier to arrive back at 6.18 p.m. at St Enoch railway station, Glasgow. The G also offered an Isle of Arran tour, taking PS Juno from Prince's Pier via the Kyles of Bute to Brodick, then travelling by coach to Lochranza to catch King Edward for the return voyage, or a similar arrangement in reverse order. In July 1901 a novel evening cruise was introduced, with trains leaving Glasgow at 6.5 p.m. and meeting King Edward at Greenock for a cruise of about two hours [...] "with music on board", after which a train returned, to <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 10.25 p.m. in Glasgow. The ship proved very popular, attracting passengers by the novelty of turbine sailing aided by splendid summer weather and additional traffic from the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901, and the season was extended {{to the end of}} September, then the ship was laid up for the winter.|$|E
