40|$|Many {{professionals}} {{commented on}} a question I recently raised at the LinkedIn {{group of the}} International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA). The question was, ”Is this a call for extinction of business analysts?" What triggered this question was an Interview at CIO. com, where {{the author of a}} new usability/design book said, “We want you to replace <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> with designers. " Those commenting on the discussion generally thought that the statement simply reflected a lack of understanding of software engineering. And what did I think? Just the opposite of what the author suggested – <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> (BA) should replace usability/design specialists for the task of designing process-centric User Interface (UI) architecture. The key phrase here is “process-centric, ” which emphasizes the need to do it in a non-traditional way. And my recommendation is only for project teams that develop business applications. This Article basically shows why the <b>Business</b> <b>Analyst’s</b> role and <b>skills</b> set should be extended beyond traditional boundaries. It also provides evidence of success of this approach. Business Software is Different from Consumer Softwar...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> {{in recent years}} has brought about the need for a proper articulation of the <b>Business</b> <b>Analyst’s</b> role. Despite the growth of the business analysis field, and its value, academic research on the practices, competencies and capabilities of a <b>business</b> <b>analyst</b> is still limited. Drawing on the Resource-Based View of the firm theory and the concept of practice, this study proposes a business analysis capability model. A positivist qualitative research methodology has been conducted using a directed content-based analysis approach. This research analysed 300 <b>business</b> <b>analyst</b> online job advertisements in order to identify the practices, competencies and capabilities of <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> as perceived by employers based in South Africa (SA) and the United Kingdom (UK). The findings suggest that, both in SA and the UK, <b>analysts</b> with systems <b>skills,</b> practices, competencies and capabilities are preferred by employers over those with business skills. The results of the study suggest that South African employers demand additional skills, practices and competencies from a <b>business</b> <b>analyst</b> than are required by employers based in the UK. This suggests that SA based <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> are capable of competing for employment in the UK without the need for them to acquire additional skills. This research makes conceptual contributions to academia, and also offers managerial contributions to practice...|$|R

40|$|The <b>business</b> <b>analyst</b> {{role was}} {{established}} in response to concerns about a 'gap' between technical IT staff and users.

However research suggests that while <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> may facilitate the relationship between technical staff and business users, boundaries may still occur between <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> and user groups on one hand, and <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> and IT staff on the other. Nonetheless, these boundaries present opportunities for all the participant groups to learn by developing new understandings, knowledge and practices, thus enabling them to more effectively interact with their constituents.

40|$|As a {{relatively}} new occupation, <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> are grappling with many aspects of their career as they come into their own. One such aspect is the heavily contested debate on professionalising the occupation {{and the implications of}} that for <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts.</b> The implications of professionalising vary, ranging from centralised control that requires <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> to hold credentials before practicing, to creating market shelters that facilitate economic scarcity of the occupational skill sets. The difference between the perception of professionalism as an occupation and professionalism as an organisational management tool has an impact on understanding what drives Business Analysts' perceptions of the professionalisation of the occupation. This study presents an investigation into the perceptions of what constitutes a 'profession'; whether <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> should become professional; the associated advantages and disadvantages to professionalising; and how <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> should pursue professionalisation. The study was qualitative and exploratory: 16 in-depth interviews were performed exploring the perceptions of <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> and other stakeholders regarding professionalisation. Interviews were conducted with analysts who had recently graduated, certified as professional, intending to certify, not intending to certify and those with no formal occupational training. Interviews with Human Resource practitioners, both internal and external to organisations, as well experts in recruiting professionals were conducted. The data was analysed by performing content analysis on the interviews and identifying predominant themes and identifying the frequency of these themes. <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> clearly identified the desire to professionalise themselves by forming a collaborative community which is typical of modern liberal professions employing knowledge workers. The need for <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> to professionalise was corroborated by human resource practitioners. The major driving forces for the desire to professionalise is improved quality of delivery to stakeholders and improved knowledge sharing within the professional community. <b>Business</b> <b>Analysts</b> identified the trust relationship between themselves and business stakeholders as paramount to supporting a professional model. A model identifying forces driving occupations to professionalise and opposing forces that resist the change was developed.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Although {{business}} analysis {{has been around}} for a number of years, it is still seen as an emerging field. There are various efforts underway to formalise the {{business analysis}} practice. For example, the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA®) is widely accepted as setting the standards for the business analysis practice as well as raising the profile of the role. The IIBA first published their Business Analysis Body of Knowledge guide (BABOK®) in 2006 and extensively revised it in 2009. The IIBA offer two certifications based on this guide. Besides the IIBA certifications, there are also other business analysis and requirements engineering certifications available to South Africans. However, these are not all that well known locally and collectively the number of certified <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> is very low. The success rate of software projects to date has been relatively poor to say the least. Business analysis is a critical component to the success of software development. One would expect that <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> would welcome the opportunity to be certified in their profession and contribute to increasing the overall project success rate. However, in South Africa the low number of IIBA certified <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> suggests otherwise. There also appears to be very little pressure or even encouragement from employers of <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> to pursue certification. Besides improving software project success, there is growing opinion and literature asserting the view that <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> will be playing an ever-increasing strategic role from what should be a professional function. To enable this strategic role, <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> are required to have the necessary experience, skill and ideally certification. This research report sought to uncover the reasons behind so few <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> taking up certification. Over and above the reasons for the low uptake, this research report also aimed to assess the <b>business</b> <b>analyst’s</b> and the employer’s attitude towards certification and the business analysis profession. Collectively this led to a high-level assessment of the maturity of business analysis from a practitioner’s point of view. As part of this research report, a survey was conducted amongst practicing <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> across industries within South Africa. Additional research was undertaken with a select number of senior leaders and executives in business to understand the organisational view of business analysis certification...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE:  Robustness {{analysis}} {{is a technique}} that can be performed to help ensure the correctness, completeness and consistency of use case and domain models. Robustness analysis also helps {{bridge the gap between}} the analysis and design phases by providing a guided approach to identify a first-guess set of objects that will realize scenarios described in use cases. It is necessary to perform robustness analysis in the early phases of the development lifecycle in order to reap its benefits. In particular, robustness analysis needs to be performed by <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> during the requirements phase {{to improve the quality of}} their models as well as help provide a seamless transition to the design phase. However, a core skill that is required to develop robustness diagrams is knowledge of OO concepts which <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> normally do not have. To overcome this limitation, <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> acquire brief knowledge of OO concepts via a small learning curve in order to develop and reap the benefits of creating robustness diagrams. However, is this brief knowledge of OO concepts attained through a small learning curve enough to allow <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> to develop quality robustness diagrams? DESIGN: In this paper we present a controlled student-based experiment to empirically evaluate the requirement of in-depth OO knowledge to produce quality robustness diagrams. FINDINGS: The results show that <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> can indeed produce quality robustness diagrams without in-depth OO knowledge. ORIGINALITY: The results of this experiment will aid in embracing the technique of robustness analysis amongst <b>business</b> <b>analysts</b> in order to overall improve the software development process. </p...|$|R
