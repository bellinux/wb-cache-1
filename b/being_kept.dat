Sohrab helps Amir out of the house, where he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Henry Tufton died in 1849, and castle {{ownership}} fell to Hothfields.

Without sufficient funds, the castle quickly fell into marked decay.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by other prisoners. The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former lord chief justice Lord Woolf from {{earlier in the year}} where he described prisoners <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> in intolerable conditions–as bad as {{at the time of the}} riots.

5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} tame {{frigatebirds}} <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific.

5|$|As well as <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> as pets, {{cats are}} also used in the {{international}} fur and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets and stuffed toys; and shoes, gloves and musical instruments respectively (about 24 cats are {{needed to make a}} cat fur coat). This use has now been outlawed in the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. In the Western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction began {{principal}} {{photography in}} Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico in May, 2006 after filming locations {{had to be}} changed from the Australian Outback to Mexico, causing production dates to be pushed back repeatedly from November 2005 to May 2006. Numerous sets were designed by production designer Eugenio Caballero including Umbrella's underground laboratory, the Las Vegas Strip, the New York-New York Hotel & Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Realto Ponte, Luxor Hotel and the replica of the Spencer Mansion. The film entered post-production in late July 2006 with details about production <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> secret and with the film's special effects being covered by Tatopoulos Studios and Mr. X Inc., whom both worked on the 2006 film Silent Hill.|$|E

The named director of the NSS comes and goes with each change of power in the presidency, but it is the deputy director that oversees the organization. Baek San's motivations for many of his actions are mysterious, occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests. Due to the very existence of the organization <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> secret, he enjoys a state of personal protection that few others do.|$|E
5|$|The Paul Sacher Foundation, in {{association}} with Boosey and Hawkes, announced in May 2013, as part of The Rites centenary celebrations, their intention to publish the 1913 autograph score, as used in early performances. After <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> in Russia for decades, the autograph score was acquired by Boosey and Hawkes in 1947. The firm presented the score to Stravinsky in 1962, on his 80th birthday. After the composer's death in 1971 the manuscript was acquired by the Paul Sacher Foundation. As well as the autograph score, they have published the manuscript piano four-hands score.|$|E

5|$|The abbey's next organ {{was built}} in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol, to a {{specification}} of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals. This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter & St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> for incorporation in the new abbey organ.|$|E
5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find Snow White {{seemingly}} dead, <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her {{out of sight in}} the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} built train car interiors for {{the quarantine}} car where {{the patient was}} <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> and the sleeper cars, and floated the train sets on inner tubes to create the feeling of movement. Seven different cameras were used by director Rob Bowman when filming the train car explosion. Forty-five gallons of gasoline and 120 black-powder bombs {{were used for the}} effect. The car used had been obtained cheaply from a Vancouver-based rail company, and had been considered scrap due to being bent. After the explosion was recorded, a bell from the train was recovered some distance from the site by the physical effects supervisor Dave Gauthier, who had it polished and engraved with a message for Bowman.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, Major Ellis {{explains}} their Supreme Being as {{the result}} of European influence! A priori this appears highly improbable. That a belief should sweep over all these specks in impenetrable forest, from the coast-tribes in contact with Europeans, and that this belief should, though the most recent, be infinitely the least powerful, cannot be regarded as a plausible hypothesis. Moreover, on Major Ellis's theory the Supreme Beings of races which but recently came {{for the first time in}} contact with Europeans, Supreme <b>Beings</b> <b>kept</b> jealously apart from European ken, and revered in the secrecy of ancient mysteries, must also, by parity of reason, be the result of European influence. Unfortunately, Major Ellis gives no evidence for his statements about the past history of Tshi religion. Authorities he must have, and references would be welcome.|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

The two agents soon learn that they are doomed to failure from the start, as the U.S. government is attempting to cover up the existence of American POWs still <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|After <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor's corpse was transported in {{a lavish}} {{procession}} to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock {{just north of}} the Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1653, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what later {{came to be known as}} the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiaoling (孝陵) mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, <b>being</b> <b>kept</b> up to date by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
