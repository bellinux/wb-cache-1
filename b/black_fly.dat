5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> Simulium annulus is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|That even a dead ala is bad {{is seen in}} {{the legend}} {{explaining}} the origin of the Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, tells how a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they fly out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for the flies to swarm, the wall shattered.|$|E
25|$|Kings Gap Hollow Run is a spring-fed {{stream that}} {{periodically}} dries up and reveals a stony bottom. However, {{in the spring}} when the water flow is at its peak, this stony bottom is home for many aquatic animals. Pick a stone out of the stream and observe the larva of the <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> as they cling to the stone and filter food from the water. Although the adult <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> is considered a pest, the presence of its larva in the stream is an indicator of good water quality.|$|E
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>flies</b> (Diptera : Simuliidae) {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied almost worldwide (Hamada & Grillet, 2001). This is because blackflies {{are among the}} best-known aquatic insects and globally distributed (Adler et al., 2004). <b>Black</b> <b>flies</b> in Malaysia are less known and research about this aquatic insect is still scarce especially in Borneo region. Most of the earlier studies on <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> in Sabah were related to taxonomy (Takaoka, 2001). However, studies on ecology {{and the role of}} <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> as bio-indicator has so far not been well reported yet. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the relationship of water quality against the abundance of <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> pupa (Simuliidae). Regression test shows that relationship between dissolve oxygen (r 2 = 0. 57, p= 0. 02), total dissolve substance (TDS) (r 2 = 0. 18,p= 0. 04) and conductivity (r 2 = 0. 14, p= 0. 04) appeared significant to the abundance of <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> pupae.

As seen from the human results, the <b>Black</b> <b>Flying</b> fox only shared the Trytophan surplus results. The House Mouse and <b>Black</b> <b>Flying</b> Fox were both used because they shared 64% and 79% similarity in the c9orf135 genome respectively.

25|$|From 1936 to 1958, Browne {{dedicated}} {{himself to}} the mission hospital at Yakusu, Belgian Congo. At Yakusu, he performed {{a wide range of}} roles from treating disease outbreaks and researching diseases to performing operations to midwifery. Patients {{with a wide variety of}} ailments arrived from surrounding areas daily to seek care. He frequently handled outbreaks of smallpox, polio, tuberculosis, malaria, yaws and typhoid and made major breakthroughs in the treatment of leprosy and Onchocerciasis. Browne, who would later concentrate his studies on leprosy, was the one of the first doctors to use Dapsone in the treatment of leprosy. He made a major epidemiological breakthrough related to Onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness, when he discovered it was caused by a <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> that bred on crabs. After having the crabs caught and exterminated and the streams cleaned, 98% of the <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> population had disappeared. Despite being based in Yakusu, Browne embarked on frequent expeditions to surrounding dispensaries and mission stations, travelling by car, motor boat, canoe or on foot. The doctors of Yakusu were often called to surrounding areas to provide medical care to acutely ill or injured patients.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> larva and the {{diversity}} of the other aquatic life found in the stream indicate good water quality, but the stream is vulnerable. Chemical tests reveal low pH and alkalinity levels due to the geology and vegetation of the area. Low levels of alkalinity indicate the stream has a limited capacity to [...] "buffer" [...] any acid that may enter in the form of acid rain or snow. Without this ability to neutralize additional acid, the pH level can drop. A low pH level means a high acid content. When the acid content becomes too high, the stream no longer supports life.|$|E

Individual groups are divided according to the type of area into smaller subgroups. The zoogeographical analysis has shown big similarity with <b>Black</b> <b>Flies</b> zoogeography in Siberia and Far East (in percentage of individual zoogeographic groups).

The dragon-fly had eaten as many as he wanted, and was sitting quite still and sleepy, for it was very hot and bright. The gnats (who did not care the least for their poor brothers' death) danced a foot over his head quite happily, and a large <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> settled within an inch of his nose, and began washing his own face and combing his hair with his paws: but the dragon-fly never stirred, and kept on chatting to Tom about the times when he lived under the water.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Symon, the {{official}} guardian and guide, {{was a young}} man, prematurely gray, with a grave mouth which contrasted curiously with a very small, dark mustache with waxed points, that seemed somehow, separate from it, as if a <b>black</b> <b>fly</b> had settled on his face. He spoke with the accent of Oxford and the permanent official, but in as dead a fashion as the most indifferent hired guide. They descended a dark stone staircase, at the floor of which Symon pressed a button and a door opened on a dark room, or, rather, a room which had an instant before been dark. For almost as the heavy iron door swung open an almost blinding blaze of electric lights filled the whole interior. The fitful enthusiasm of Stinks at once caught fire, and he eagerly asked if the lights and the door worked together.|$|E

60|$|As I sat {{waiting for}} my companion, he {{would seem to be}} gone a long time, and I had ample {{opportunity}} to make observations on the forest. I now first began to be seriously molested by the <b>black</b> <b>fly,</b> a very small but perfectly formed fly of that color, about one tenth of an inch long, which I felt, and then saw, in swarms about me, as I sat by a wider and more than usually doubtful fork in this dark forest path. Remembering that I had a wash in my knapsack, prepared by a thoughtful hand in Bangor, I made haste to apply it to my face and hands, and was glad to find it effectual, {{as long as it was}} fresh, or for twenty minutes, not only against black flies, but all the insects that molested us. They would not alight on the part thus defended. It was composed of sweet oil and oil of turpentine, with a little oil of spearmint, and camphor. However, I finally concluded that the remedy was worse than the disease, it was so disagreeable and inconvenient to have your face and hands covered with such a mixture.|$|E
6000|$|For {{six hours}} we rode {{the breadth of}} the Harawwah Valley: it was covered with wild vegetation, and surface-drains, that carry off the surplus of the hills {{enclosing}} it. In some places the torrent beds had cut twenty feet into the soil. The banks were fringed with milk-bush and Asclepias, the Armo-creeper, a variety of thorns, and especially the yellow-berried Jujube: here numberless birds followed bright-winged butterflies, and the [...] "Shaykhs of the Blind," [...] as the people call the <b>black</b> <b>fly,</b> settled in swarms upon our hands and faces as we rode by. The higher ground was overgrown with a kind of cactus, which here becomes a tree, forming shady avenues. Its quadrangular fleshy branches of emerald green, sometimes forty feet high, support upon their summits large round bunches of a bright crimson berry: when the plantation is close, domes of extreme beauty appear scattered over the surface of the country. This [...] "Hassadin" [...] abounds in burning milk, and the Somal look downwards when passing under its branches: the elephant is said to love it, and in many places the trees were torn to pieces by hungry trunks. The nearest approaches to game were the last year's earths; likely places, however, shady trees and green thorns near water, were by no means uncommon. When we reached the valley's southern wall, Beuh informed us that we might ride all day, if we pleased, with the same result. At Zayla I had been informed that elephants are [...] "thick as sand" [...] in Harawwah: even the Gudabirsi, when at a distance, declared that they fed there like sheep, and, after our failure, swore that they killed thirty but last year. The animals were probably in the high Harirah Valley, and would be driven downwards by the cold at a later period: some future Gordon Cumming may therefore succeed where the Hajj Abdullah notably failed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} extraction methodology for the proposed DNA from the ethanol preserved <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> (Simuliidae: Diptera). Methods: This study addressed a simple and effective protocol for extraction of DNA from <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> stored in the ethanol. The sizes of larval and adult <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 5 mm and 3 to 7 mm, respectively. To demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} proposed methodology, the DNA was extracted from the ethanol preserved sample of <b>black</b> <b>flies</b> using the commercial kids. The extracted DNA was further validated in the PCR amplification using internal transcribed spacer- 1 rDNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit II rDNA target primers. Results: Interestingly, a minor modification in the proposed methodology yielded a good DNA concentration in comparison with the commercial kids. The extracted DNA sample using the proposed methodology was successfully validated in the PCR amplification using internal transcribed spacer- 1 rDNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit II rDNA genes. Conclusions: The proposed DNA extraction procedure yielded good concentration of DNA from the ethanol preserved <b>black</b> <b>flies.</b> The added advantage is that the procedure is suitable for a range of insect species preserved in the ethanol obtained from the various field conditions...|$|R
