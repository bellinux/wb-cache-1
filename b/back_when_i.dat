Barkley called the sums he had requested from agents as being [...] "chump change", {{and went on to}} say, [...] "Why can't an agent lend me some money and I'll pay him <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> graduate?" [...] According to Barkley, he paid back all of the money he had borrowed after signing his first NBA contract.|$|E
500|$|After {{revealing}} their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank's {{attempt at}} reconciliation {{and left him}} to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, the duo {{went to the}} Ardent {{studios in}} Memphis, Tennessee to record their sixth album, <b>Back</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Knew It All. Once again, they worked with Blake Chancey as producer. This album's title track, co-written by Trent Willmon, was the duo's fastest-climbing single. Both it and followup [...] "Roll with Me", which {{included}} a backing vocal from Five for Fighting, went to number 1. [...] "One in Every Crowd", co-written by Montgomery with Kim Tribble and former Trick Pony bassist Ira Dean, was issued in January 2009 as the third single. By {{the middle of the}} year, this song peaked at number 5. The fourth single, the number 23 [...] "Long Line of Losers", was co-written and previously recorded by Kevin Fowler. Toby Keith, with whom Montgomery Gentry toured in mid-2008, contributed a guest vocal on the Terri Clark co-write [...] "I Pick My Parties", and Lillie Mae Rische of Jypsi made an appearance on [...] "God Knows Who I Am". Thom Jurek wrote of this album, [...] "The hardcore fans will love it, but this isn't the album that will win over many new ones." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, {{but then}} made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a {{photographer}} for the Daily Racing Form, captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later {{used as the basis}} for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: [...] "I let my horse drop <b>back,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them." [...] Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with [...] furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by [...] lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.|$|E

Ten more of their songs reached the top 10 on the country charts, including the number 3 hit [...] "Gone", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. Tattoos & Scars, My Town, and You Do Your Thing are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the American Music Awards. Both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association named them Duo of the Year in 2000, an award for {{which they have been}} nominated by both associations in every year since.

2500|$|In reaction, on August 22, 1964, {{the singer}} posted a letter as an {{advertisement}} in Billboard Magazine, calling {{the record industry}} cowardly.

Just one question: WHY???" [...] He concludes the letter, [...] "Ira Hayes is strong medicine... So is Rochester, Harlem, Birmingham and Vietnam." [...] Cash kept promoting the song himself and used his influence on radio disc jockeys he knew eventually to make the song climb to number three on the country charts, while the album rose to number two on the album charts.|$|E

MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E

Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer says, [...] "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> walked by. You know what my real crime was? I put the truth in writing.

2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that I felt as though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. <b>Back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

2500|$|Later in October, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as Glóin. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Richard {{is one of the most}} exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands." [...] McTavish was quoted on his casting, [...] "I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable." [...] Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on , resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, [...] "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli." [...] On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, [...] "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [...] on these movies." [...] Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. On his casting Callen stated, [...] "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. [...] Given that Óin is almost 200years old I can presume only that it was the age." [...] On being cast in the role, Hunter said, [...] "Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way <b>back</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'" ...|$|E
