2500|$|While often {{described}} as a black conservative, he prefers not to be labeled, having stated, [...] "I prefer not to have labels, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> 'libertarian' would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement {{on a number of}} things". He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.|$|E

[...] "My dear Amy," [...] he answered, smiling as if he were uttering a piece of gallantry, [...] "I don't know anything about your convictions, <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> they interfere with mine it would be much simpler to banish YOU." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes! that is {{the usual}} sentiment; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> half <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> it is a commonplace, invented to cover our embarrassment under such circumstances; for, after all, [...] "an old friend" [...] so {{situated}} is a person whom {{we have not seen}} for many years, and most probably not cared to see.' ...|$|R

5000|$|When {{asked in}} June 2011 whether Google should {{step in to}} prevent the {{definition}} appearing so prominently under searches for his name, Santorum said they should intervene only if they would normally do so {{in this kind of}} circumstance. In September 2011 Santorum asked Google to intervene by altering the indexing of the content, saying, [...] "If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that {{have an impact on the}} country...To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that's</b> not true."

60|$|The {{most notable}} absence {{observable}} in the billiard-room, was {{the absence of}} the river man. If he was there he had taken in his sign, he was in disguise. I saw there none of the swell airs and graces, and ostentatious displays of money, and pompous squanderings of it, which used to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in the bygone days, in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis. In those times, the principal saloons were always populous with river men; given fifty players present, thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from the river. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> the ranks were thin now, and the steamboatmen no longer an aristocracy. Why, in my time they used to call the 'barkeep' Bill, or Joe, or Tom, and slap him on the shoulder; I watched for that. But none of these people did it. Manifestly a glory that once was had dissolved and vanished away in these twenty-one years.|$|R
60|$|At {{the mouth}} of the tunnel she met Oliver, as {{probably}} she had arranged to do, and after he had reported progress to her, wandered away with him as usual, each of them carrying a lamp, into some recess of the buried city. I followed them at a distance, not from curiosity, or because I wished {{to see more of the}} wonders of that city whereof I was heartily sick, <b>but</b> because <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> they were being spied upon.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is a difference. The {{first two}} are honest and {{reliable}} but not brilliant men. Sedgwick is obviously more capable than either, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> self-interest is his strongest motive. I knew {{a major in}} his regiment. He might use this appointment to force himself into prominence." ...|$|E
60|$|The sole of a coon's foot is padded {{thick with}} fat and gristle, {{so that it}} must feel like landing on springs when he jumps; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> he also knows the {{squirrel}} trick of flattening his body and tail against the air so as to fall lightly.|$|E
60|$|Wood. Sure {{this is not}} {{the phrase}} of your family! I thought to have found a sanctified sister; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> now, madam, <b>that</b> if your mother kept a pension in your father's time, there might be some gentleman-lodger in the house; for I humbly {{conceive}} you are of the half-strain at least.|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} {{had declared}} before this that I had not a particle of sentiment, in rather absolute terms, to my astonishment; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> he meant <b>that</b> my legs did not ache just then, though I am not wholly {{a stranger to}} that sentiment. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> did not intend this for a sentimental journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{surprise}} me, Messires," [...] said Crevecoeur, [...] "yet you {{surprise me}} {{less than you}} might have expected, for, when I was last at Plessis les Tours, the all trusted Cardinal Balue, offended with his master, and Burgundian at heart, did hint {{to me that he}} could so work upon Louis's peculiar foibles as to lead him to place himself in such a position with regard to Burgundy that the Duke might have the terms of peace of his own making. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> so old a fox as Louis could have been induced to come into the trap of his own accord. What said the Burgundian counsellors?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, father, don't get so hot about it; I won't offend again. Besides, I'm quite {{content to}} take a very low place so long as you give mother her right position. We won't {{disagree}} about that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> we differ considerably about the other matter you mentioned." ...|$|E
60|$|Dolphin seems a {{singularly}} attractive name. It {{always made}} me think of the deep blue sea, of old tars, and tall-sparred, white-sailed brigs. It is the name of a fish beloved of all sailors. I do not know why, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> it is because the dolphin haunts ships and is an omen of good luck, and probably the most exquisitely colored fish in the ocean.|$|E
60|$|This {{seems to}} be the parent-form of our {{improved}} English Pouters. I kept a pair, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> they were not pure birds. They are smaller than English pouters, and less well developed in all their characters. Neumeister (5/7. 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht' Weimar 1837 pl. 11 and 12.) says that the wings are crossed over the tail, and do not reach to its extremity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{issues of}} {{prostitution}} and child pornography were {{not far from}} critics' thoughts. In his New York Times review Vincent Canby wrote: [...] "Mr. Malle, the French director ... has made some controversial films in his time <b>but</b> none, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>that</b> is likely to upset convention quite as much as this one - and mostly for the wrong reasons. Though the setting is a whorehouse, and the lens through which we see everything is Violet, who ... herself becomes one of Nell's chief attractions, Pretty Baby is neither about child prostitution nor is it pornographic." [...] Canby ended his review with the claim that Pretty Baby is [...] "... the most imaginative, most intelligent, and most original film {{of the year to}} date." ...|$|R

A Greek got his civilisation by talking and looking, and in some measure a Parisian may still do it. But we, who live remote from history and monuments, we must read or we must barbarise. Once we were softened, if not polished, by religion; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the pulpit counts for much less now in civilising." ...|$|E

"I don't {{know whether}} he was jealous of Tomassov, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{he might have been}} a little annoyed at him as at a sort of walking absurdity of the sentimental order. But these men of the world are impenetrable, and {{outwardly}} he condescended to recognize Tomassov's existence even more distinctly than was strictly necessary. Once or twice he had offered him some useful worldly advice with perfect tact and delicacy. Tomassov was completely conquered by that evidence of kindness under the cold polish of the best society.|$|E

"It has. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> my {{experience}} of life {{has not been}} so much varied as yours, Pedro, for it has been chiefly among civilised communities until now. Still, I have observed {{that it is only}} those who swim with the current of public opinion, and jostle nobody, who manage to keep friends with everybody. When a man ventures to think for himself,--as he ought to do,--and take action, he is sure to have enemies as well as friends,--supposing, of course, that {{he is a man of}} any power or influence." ...|$|E

[...] "Yes, it has been already a great force, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> begin to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the time is coming when it must include more or fail.

6000|$|In 1818, {{he told me}} {{that his}} medical {{attendant}} was apprehensive of his becoming dropsical, and had prescribed him a glass of port wine after his dinner. His usual drink before this had been water. In the October of the following year he wrote to me that [...] "he had been assailed by two of the most formidable enemies of the human frame; and had been almost demolished by a fit of apoplexy, and a fit of the stone: the blow from the former," [...] he adds, [...] "was so violent, that my physician despaired of my revival; but, by the mercy of Heaven, I am so far revived, that I can again enjoy a social and literary intercourse with my friends; and even dabble again in rhyme; <b>but,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>that</b> my rhymes, like the Homilies of Gil Blas' Archbishop, may savour of apoplexy, I think it right to keep them in utter privacy." ...|$|R
60|$|These clever people {{sometimes}} overreach themselves. How she suggested it to me, I cannot pretend to have discovered. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> did certainly <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she had led Philip, {{while they were}} together downstairs, into saying to her what he had already said to Miss Jillgall. I was so angry that I tried to pump my excellent friend, {{as she had been}} trying to pump me--a vulgar expression, but vulgar writing is such a convenient way of writing sometimes. My first attempt to entrap the Masseuse failed completely. She coolly changed the subject.|$|R
60|$|But we {{have said}} enough about {{the head of the}} new paradise. Mrs. Godwin is {{described}} as being in several ways a terror; and even when her soul was in repose she wore green spectacles. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> her main unattractiveness was born {{of the fact that she}} wrote the letters that are out in the appendix-basket in the back yard--letters which are an outrage and wholly untrustworthy, for they say some kind things about poor Harriet and tell some disagreeable truths about her husband; and these things make the fabulist grit his teeth a good deal.|$|E
60|$|Trifolium procumbens.--On one {{occasion}} covered-up plants seemed to yield as many seeds as the uncovered. On a second occasion sixty uncovered flower-heads yielded 9.1 grains weight of seeds, whilst sixty heads on protected plants yielded {{no less than}} 17.7 grains; so that these latter plants were much more productive; but this result I suppose was accidental. I have often watched this plant, and have never seen the flowers visited by insects; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the flowers of this species, and more especially of Trifolium minus, are frequented by small nocturnal moths which, as I hear from Mr. Bond, haunt the smaller clovers.|$|E
60|$|Potassium, Bromide of.--Half-minims of a {{solution}} of one part to 437 of water {{were placed on the}} discs of six leaves; after 22 hrs. one had its blade and many tentacles inflected, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> an insect might have alighted on it and then escaped; the five other leaves were in no way affected. I tested three of these leaves with bits of meat, and after 24 hrs. they became splendidly inflected. Three leaves were also immersed for 21 hrs. in 30 minims of {{a solution}} of one part to 875 of water; but they were not at all affected, excepting that the glands looked rather pale.|$|E
6000|$|Up to {{this time}} I {{have not been}} able to bring myself to the point [...] of giving a vote in favour of your bills. I am grieved to have to [...] say this. As to the Land bill, if it comes to a second reading, I [...] fear I must vote against it. It may be that my hostility to the [...] rebel party, looking at their conduct since your {{government}} was [...] formed six years ago, disables me from taking an impartial view of [...] this great question. If I could believe them loyal, if they were [...] honourable and truthful men, I could yield them much; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> [...] <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> your policy of surrender to them will only place more [...] power in their hands, to war with greater effect against the unity [...] of the three kingdoms with no increase of good to the Irish [...] people.|$|R
60|$|On my {{way back}} to my own part of the house, I was {{encountered}} by Mr. Franklin. He wanted to know if I had seen anything of his cousin Rachel. I had seen nothing of her. Could I tell him where his cousin Godfrey was? <b>I</b> didn't know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> began to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> cousin Godfrey might not be far away from cousin Rachel. Mr. Franklin's suspicions apparently took the same turn. He tugged hard at his beard, and went and shut himself up in the library with a bang of the door that had a world of meaning in it.|$|R
60|$|Making this protestation, I refuse all revolutionary tribunals, {{where men}} have been put to death {{for no other reason}} than that they had {{obtained}} favors from the crown. I claim, not the letter, but the spirit of the old English law,--that is, to be tried by my peers. I decline his Grace's jurisdiction as a judge. I challenge the Duke of Bedford as a juror to pass upon the value of my services. Whatever his natural parts may be, I cannot recognize in his few and idle years the competence to judge of my long and laborious life. If I can help it, he shall not be on the inquest of my quantum meruit. Poor rich man! he can hardly know anything of public industry in its exertions, or can estimate its compensations when its work is done. I have no doubt of his Grace's readiness in all the calculations of vulgar arithmetic; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shrewdly <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> he is little studied in the theory of moral proportions, and has never learned the rule of three in the arithmetic of policy and state.|$|R
