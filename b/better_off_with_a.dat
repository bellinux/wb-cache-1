A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of resilience in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E

We assume that a manager can invest influencing the firm's quality, then he reports this quality to investors. Whenever truthful reporting is not an equilibrium, the manager has incentives to overinvest relative to shareholders. Therefore, the potential for market manipulation is the key in understanding investment policy; it is the desire to manipulate prices that leads to inefficient investment. Also, more manipulation occurs when the manager is in control, so prices are less informative. Finally, we show that the manager is <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> exogenous reporting policy. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examine the}} {{implications}} of lowering electricity sector CO 2 emissions in PJM through a Low Carbon Capacity Standard (LCCS) instead of a renewables portfolio standard (RPS). An LCCS would create a requirement for load-serving entities to procure new low carbon capacity (GW). The LCCS would provide a greater balance of energy and capacity supply than a renewable portfolio standard, which requires only the supply of energy (and excludes non-renewable low carbon generators). Approximately 25 GW of PJM generation capacity is scheduled to retire by 2019 and the RPSs currently in place in PJM will supply only 5 GW of Equivalent Load Carrying Capability (ELLC). An LCCS, providing {{the same amount of}} low carbon energy, would supply 13 to 16 GW of ELCC. We estimate the required reduction of capacity prices required to cover the investment cost premium low carbon capacity would require from consumers. For example, if the energy from an LCCS costs on average $ 20 /MWh more than energy from an RPS, the annual premium would be approximately $ 2. 2 B. In order for consumers to be <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> LCCS in this example, capacity prices would have to decrease by $ 40 /MW-day. We find that if an LCCS were adopted, coal fired power plants with carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) would likely have the lowest cost per MW of capacity of all low carbon technologies, based on net Cost of New Entry (CONE) estimates...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} impact of a {{third-party}} product ecolabel (i. e. green label) on competition and the environment, and the firms' strategies during the negotiation of the minimum environmental requirements underlying a product's eligibility for the ecolabel. The introduction includes some empirical observation about the development of the European ecolabel. The second part presents the model. We assume Cournot competition in a homogenous industry made up of multi-product firms each selling the whole range of product-variants, from green to brown. Green consumers "trust" the ecolabel. We derive demand, supply, prices and profits at the equilibrium before and after ecolabel. We first assume that firms do not innovate on their products. We then introduce environmental innovation into the model. The third part analyses {{the impact of}} the ecolabel on competition (firms' profits) and the environment (green innovation and market shares). The conclusion contrasts the results with the ones obtained {{in the case of a}} heterogeneous industry - i. e., an industry made up of mono-product firms each selling a product having an environmental profile different than that of the other firms' products- and draws policy considerations. The paper expands the literature on product ecolabelling by considering imperfect competition, giving thus the possibility for the firms to undertake green innovations affecting non marginal costs, and by taking into account the type of industry concerned by the ecolabel. We find that firms in a homogenous industry are <b>better</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ecolabel than without and might even be willing to adopt environmentally effective criteria if the green demand is important and innovation costs are low. This contrasts with results obtained in a previous paper for a heterogeneous industry, in which part of the firms will always lose from the implementation of an environmentally effective ecolabel and oppose its development. Cross-industry comparison suggests that regulators should start developing ecolabelling programs with homogenous industry in which innovation costs are likely to be negligible as compared to the costs of production...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple small-country model {{to explain why}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) prohibits export subsidies but allows import tariffs. Governments choose protection rates (import tariffs/export subsidies) to maximize a weighted sum of social welfare and lobbying contributions. While transportation costs decrease due to the progress of trade liberalization and lower transportation costs, import-competing sectors decline but export industries grow. In the growing export industries, the surplus generated by protection is eroded by new entrants. Therefore, the rent that governments gain from protecting the export sectors by using export subsidies is small. On the other hand, in the import-competing sectors, capital is sunk and no new entrants erode the protection rent. Therefore, governments can get large political contributions from protecting these import-competing sectors. This paper shows that under fast capital mobility, governments <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high bargaining power are <b>better</b> <b>off</b> than <b>with</b> <b>a</b> trade agreement that allows import tariffs but prohibits export subsidies...|$|R
