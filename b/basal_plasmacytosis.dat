40|$|<b>Basal</b> <b>plasmacytosis</b> is an early-onset {{and highly}} {{predictive}} feature of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), but may have several restrictions in routine histology. Considering evidences about cooperation between eosinophils and plasma cells in IBD pathogenesis, we investigated immunostain of these two cells as a marker of disease. 343 samplings from 83 patients (52 IBD, 31 non-IBD colitis) were evaluated. The sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies against plasma cells (CD 138 and MUM 1), and eosinophils (CD 193). Eosinophilia-associated <b>basal</b> <b>plasmacytosis</b> (EBP) was related with the histologic diagnosis of IBD (90. 3 % IBD and 35. 4 % non-IBD colitides, p < 0. 005, sensitivity 90. 4 %). A strong relation was detected between the occurrence of EBP and (i) the achieving of a complete endoscopic mapping; (ii) {{the presence of other}} characteristic lesions of IBD in single segmental sampling, although EBP was evident in more than 40 % of samples without other IBD-related lesions. EBP is a sensitive histologic feature of IBD, especially at the first endoscopic sampling, {{even in the absence of}} the other characteristic histologic lesions, and may help in formulating a more precise diagnosis in this setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Histopathologic {{evaluation}} of colonoscopic mucosal biopsy {{remains one of}} the earliest modalities of investigation in patients clinically suspected of ulcerative colitis. Pathologists should be aware of classical histomorphological features to avoid misdiagnosis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate histopathologic features as well as to determine possible atypical presentation. Materials and Methods: Forty newly diagnosed cases of ulcerative colitis were included in the study. Colonoscopic biopsies taken from rectum as well as various areas of colon and ileum depending upon clinical extent of involvement were submitted for histopathological evaluation. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made by correlating clinical, endoscopic and histopathologic findings. Results: Out of 47 cases suspected of ulcerative colitis, histopathologic features were consistent with Ulcerative colitis in 40 cases. Almost all cases (97. 5 %) showed diffuse active colitis. Cryptitis (100 %), crypt abscesses (75 %) and <b>basal</b> <b>plasmacytosis</b> (85 %) along with crypt architectural abnormalities (75 %) and goblet cell depletion (70 %) were classical histological changes associated with ulcerative colitis in active phase.   Atypical presentations noticed were focal active colitis (2. 5 %), backwash ileitis (2. 5 %), rectal sparing (2. 5 %) and skip areas (5 %). Conclusion: Accurate diagnosis of ulcerative colitis requires elaborate knowledge of histopathologic features along with awareness of possible atypical presentation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Crohn’s disease (CD) and {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) {{are the two}} major relapsing conditions of inflammatory bowel diseases. Case Report: A case of Crohn’s disease with orofacial manifestations in a 10 year old girl is described. She had suffered from fever, dysphagia, arthralgia, painful recurrent ulcers of the oral mucosa and swelling of the lower lip lasting over 6 weeks. Clinical examination and the punch biopsy from the buccal mucosa revealed major recurrent aphthous ulcerations. A partial regression and significant relief of lesions were achieved {{two weeks after the}} treatment, but the patient suffered from abdominal pain, irregular bowel movements, arthritis, multiple hyperplastic and swollen mucosal folds, after 3 months. The patient was referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed pyloric ulcer formation. Abdominal ultrasound showed increased thickening of the ileal wall with multiple enlarged lympadenopathies in the periileal region. Colonoscopy images showed deep ulcers with surrounding erythema. The histopathological examination of biopsies from the terminal ileum and the colon showed <b>basal</b> <b>plasmacytosis,</b> minimal crypt distortions and aphthous ulcerations. The diagnosis of Orofacial Crohn’s disease was made. Exclusive enteral nutrition for 8 weeks, followed by azathiopurine treatment was started with an excellent clinical response on abdominal and oral symptoms. Conclusion: Diagnosis of the disease by dentists and other clinicians through the evaluation of oral clinical findings is very rare. Mucocutaneous and granulomatous lesions of the oral cavity should alert the clinician to pursue an underlying systemic cause. Early communication with a gastroenterologist can help early diagnosis of Crohn’s disease for better patient management and prognosis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mucosal {{healing and}} {{histological}} remission are different targets {{for patients with}} ulcerative colitis, but both rely on an invasive endoscopic procedure. This study aimed to assess faecal calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin as biomarkers for disease activity in asymptomatic ulcerative colitis patients. METHODS: This was a multicentric cross-sectional study including 371 patients, who were classified according to their endoscopic and histological scores. These results were evaluated alongside the faecal levels of both biomarkers. RESULTS: Macroscopic lesions [i. e. endoscopic Mayo score ≥ 1] were present in 28 % of the patients, and 9 % had active disease according to fht Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity. Moreover, 21 % presented with histological inflammation according to the Geboes index, whereas 15 % and 5 % presented with focal and diffuse <b>basal</b> <b>plasmacytosis,</b> respectively. The faecal levels of calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin were statistically higher for patients with endoscopic lesions and histological activity. A receiver operating characteristic-based analysis revealed that both biomarkers were able to indicate mucosal healing and histological remission with an acceptable probability, and cut-off levels of 150 - 250 μg/g for faecal calprotectin and 12 μg/g for neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin were proposed. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal calprotectin and neutrophil gelatinase B-associated lipocalin levels are a valuable addition for assessment of disease activity in asymptomatic ulcerative colitis patients. Biological levels of the analysed biomarkers below the proposed thresholds can rule out the presence of macroscopic and microscopic lesions with a probability of 75 - 93 %. However, caution should be applied whenever interpreting positive results, as these biomarkers present consistently low positive predictive values. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|As clinicians {{we would}} all agree that the goal for ourpatients is to induce remission, which is usually defined as symptom resolution. Restoring continence and absence of rectal {{bleeding}} would be signs that the mucosa is at most minimally inflamed if not healed. However, there have not been any data to confirm that symptomatic improvement alters {{the natural history of}} the disease, nor decreases the lifetime risk for surgery. Because we understand the potential complications of this disease, it should not be enough that we “settle ” for symptom resolution, but aim instead to decrease the risk of complications and alter the natural history of the disease. Until recently, mucosal healing endpoints have not been included in clinical trials. Clinical endpoints lead to high placebo responses, potentially diluting the effect of the ther-apy, even in large multinational trials. The hard endpoint of endoscopic mucosal healing reduces the number needed to power a study for treatment effect. The relevant questions during this discussion are: 1) What is endoscopic healing? 2) How often can we achieve this in ulcerative colitis (UC) ? 3) Does mucosal healing change disease outcomes? and 4) Does mucosal healing lower the rate of complications? The history of mucosal healing starts in 2001 when Bitton et al 1 reported on clinical, biological, and histologic parameters that would predict time to clinical relapse. One of the only factors that was statistically significant was <b>basal</b> <b>plasmacytosis</b> on rectal biopsy. The hazard ratio (HR) for predicting clinical relapse was 4. 5 and the authors concluded that this factor may help identify patients with inactive UC who will require optimal maintenance therapy. An accepted definition of endoscopic healing has yet to be developed and validated. Everyone would agree that return to normal vascular pattern, the absence of friability, or ulcer-ations fits the bill, but what about some mild erythema or granularity? If there is no friability (however you want to measure it), should that suffice? Mucosal healing was define...|$|E
