[...] Furthermore, Richard M. Gale argued that premise three, the [...] "possibility premise", <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> He stated that one only has the epistemic right to accept the premise if one understands the nested modal operators, and that if one understands them within the system S5—without which the argument fails—then one understands that [...] "possibly necessarily" [...] is in essence the same as [...] "necessarily". Thus the premise <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> because the conclusion is embedded within it.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an account of <b>the</b> {{fallacious}}ness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> without thereby indicting as fallacious all otherwise acceptable deductively valid reasoning. The solution that we suggest exploits the intuition that all good arguments are weakly circular. <b>The</b> fallaciousness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is not that the reasoning is circular simpliciter. Rather, <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is a fallacy because the conclusion relies on an undischarged assumption that the audience cannot accept without further argumentation. In the face of such an argument the arguer might just as well have merely asserted the conclusion. 1. Goal and thesis of the essay Goal: To provide an account of <b>the</b> fallacy of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> that both recognizes the circularity that is inherently present in any good argument (specifically a deductively valid argument), yet does not characterize all good arguments (specifically deductively valid arguments) as <b>question</b> <b>begging.</b> Thesis: <b>Begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is an informal fallacy in that an argument and a context (hence the informality) must have the following characteristic: the conclusion depends upon an assumption that is not accepted by the audience without further argumentation. 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this paper}} is to make it clear how and why <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> should be seen as a pragmatic fallacy which can only be {{properly}} evaluated in a context of dialogue. Included in the paper is a review of the contemporary literature on <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> that shows <b>the</b> gradual emergence over the past twenty years or so of the dialectical conception of this fallacy. A second aim of the paper is to investigate a number of general problems raised by the pragmatic framework. In this paper, it is shown that the methods required to analyze and evaluate criticisms of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> are practical, and come under the heading of logical pragmatics, which is concerned with the use of propositions by an arguer to convince, persuade, or refute an-other arguer in a context of dialogue. However, certain parts of these methods also have to do with logical semantics, which is concerned with relationships between the truth and falsehood of propositions, and with logical reasoning, which is concerned with diagramming the structure of sequences of arguments. To begin with, it is clear that <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is not a fallacy that can, at least straightforwardly, be modelled in a deductive logic of propositions. For the circular argument form, `A, therefore A', is deductively valid. The recent literature on <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> out-lined in Section 1 below, has concentrated on examining syllogisms and other familiar forms of deductively valid argument, in an attempt to get a grasp of just what is wrong with question-begging arguments. These articles are shown in the account below to have posed the prob-lem: What is the context of argument in which <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> makes sense as a fallacy? Subsequently, one stream of the literature followed the lead of Ham-blin (1970, 1971), who advocated the formal game of dialogue as the right sort of context to model <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> as a fallacy. But this literature became problematic when it was discovered that circular sequences of argumentation could be constructed in formal games o...|$|R

40|$|What’s {{wrong with}} <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question?</b> Some {{philosophers}} believe that question-begging arguments are inevitably fallacious {{and that their}} fallaciousness stems from a shared “formal” deficiency. In contrast, some philosophers, like Richard Robinson (1971) deny that <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is fallacious at all. And others characterize <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> as an “informal” fallacy of reasoning {{that can only be}} understood with the aid of epistemic (as opposed to syntactic and semantic) notions. Roy Sorensen (1996) joins this last camp by offering a powerful argument against both Robinson’s skepticism and fully formal approaches to the phenomenon. According to Sorensen’s view, question-begging is fallacious because it compromises the rationality of the question-beggar’s position. Though his argument forces Robinson into a peculiar dialectical position, it does little to elucidate the reasons why Robinson’s position is unstable and it fails to embody Sorensen’s own conception of rationally persuasive argumentation. I utilize this conception to show how Robinson is left with no easily identifiable grounds on which to deny <b>the</b> fallaciousness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> By advancing <b>the</b> dialectic between Sorensen and Robinson, I aim to show that our argumentative practices must take the perspectives of others seriously, whether or not those perspectives are rational...|$|R
