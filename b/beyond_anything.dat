5|$|With no way {{of knowing}} where the boy had been taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, {{supported}} by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode as an example of papal tyranny.|$|E
5|$|John {{was deeply}} {{suspicious}} of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king. Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up {{as a model of}} utter loyalty. The most infamous case, which went <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> considered acceptable at the time, was that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to £26,666 at the time), his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths. De Braose died in exile in 1211, and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218. John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.|$|E

25|$|Authentic human {{happiness}} for Plotinus {{consists of}} the true human identifying with that {{which is the best}} in the universe. Because happiness is <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that eudaimonia (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.|$|E

25|$|The use {{and making}} of icons entered Kievan Rus' {{following}} its conversion to Orthodox Christianity from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 988 AD. As a general rule, these icons strictly followed models and formulas hallowed by usage, {{some of which}} had originated in Constantinople. As time passed, the Russians—notably Andrei Rublev and Dionisius—widened the vocabulary of iconic types and styles far <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> found elsewhere. The personal, improvisatory and creative traditions of Western European religious art are largely lacking in Russia before the seventeenth century, when Simon Ushakov's painting became strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from Protestant as well as Catholic Europe.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough {{points out}} that because of natural forces, the Earth's {{temperature}} has been fluctuating for millions of years, long before humans arrived. However, it is the additional carbon dioxide, leading {{to an increase in}} the greenhouse effect, which must also be taken into account. When fossil fuels are burnt, such as coal, fuel oil or natural gas, the carbon emissions combine with oxygen to further thicken the Earth's atmospheric 'blanket' and thus warm the planet. An analysis of ice cores can provide information from thousands of years ago. Comparisons of carbon dioxide levels show that those of today are far <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> seen in the past.

Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral.

25|$|The Williams FW15C was an {{extremely}} dominant car, with active suspension and traction control systems <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> available to the other teams. Prost won on his debut for the team in South Africa and, like Mansell, dominated the weekend, taking pole position and finishing a minute ahead of Senna, who was second. The next Grand Prix in Brazil saw Prost collide with Christian Fittipaldi's Minardi in the rain on lap 29, while Hill went on to his first podium finish: second, 16 seconds behind Senna. Prost won three of the next four Grands Prix for Williams, Senna winning the other race. Prost and Hill later scored a 1–2 in France: the only 1–2 of the season for Williams. Prost won the next two Grands Prix at Silverstone and Hockenheim. Hill proved competitive especially {{in the second half}} of the season. Mechanical problems cost Hill leads in Britain and Germany, but he went on to win the next three Grands Prix at Hungary, Belgium and Italy which moved him to second in the standings, as well as giving him a chance of taking the Drivers' title. After Italy, Williams would not win a Grand Prix for the rest of the season, as a young Michael Schumacher won the following race in Portugal, and Senna took Japan and Australia to overtake Hill in the points. Williams retained their constructors' title, 84 points ahead of second-placed McLaren. Prost clinched the Drivers' Championship in Portugal and finished the season 26 points ahead of second-placed Senna.|$|E

After his visit to Louisiana, President Bush declared only Terrebonne Parish as a disaster area, but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration. FEMA initially opened five field offices throughout Louisiana. These centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid. After Franklin mayor Sam Jones and Congressman Billy Tauzin criticized FEMA for failing to open a field office in Franklin, FEMA promised to do so. [...] In {{the first few days}} following the storm, Louisiana National Guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees, roofing shingles, and torn aluminum siding.

500|$|Motion {{describes}} the Coleman poems as [...] "a world of comfortless jealousies, breathless bike-rides and deathless crushes", mixing elements from writers and poets such as Angela Brazil, Richmal Crompton, John Betjeman and W.H. Auden. Larkin's own attitude to these poems appears equivocal. He expresses pleasure that his friend Bruce Montgomery liked them, especially [...] "The School in August". However, to Amis he writes: [...] "I think all wrong-thinking {{people ought to}} like them. I used to write them whenever I'd seen any particularly ripe schoolgirl... Writing about grown women is less perverse and therefore less satisfying". Booth finds the poems the most impressive of all the Coleman works, in their evidence of Larkin's early ability to create striking and moving images from conventional school story clichés. They are an early demonstration of Larkin's talent for finding depths in ordinariness, an ability that characterised many of his later poems. Booth draws specific attention to the elegiac quality of the final lines of [...] "The School in August": [...] "And even swimming groups can fade / Games mistresses turn grey". In Booth's view the Coleman poems {{are among the best}} Larkin wrote in the 1940s, well <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> in his first published selection The North Ship (1945).|$|E
500|$|Musically, Impossible Princess is a {{departure}} from Minogue's previous sound, encompassing various elements from the dance genre, and adopts a more [...] "experimental" [...] approach. Music publications like AllMusic, the Daily Vault and Slant Magazine identified the record {{as part of the}} techno and Britpop revolution that spanned between mid-to-late 1990s. Some reviewers, such as Nick Levine at Digital Spy and Marcel Anders from Orkus, labelled Impossible Princess a straightforward dance record, though Anders noted some tracks were heavily [...] "guitar-driven". Moreover, Pop Cultured editor Bence Illés wrote that it is a [...] "very dark trip hop album", that was influenced by drum and bass, trance, and even elements of jazz and alternative rock. Chris True, writing for AllMusic, believed that Minogue's transition to more mature dance-oriented music moved outside of her typical sound, which [...] "seemed to be the domain of teenage girls." [...] The vocal production on the record is diverse; it features segments of spoken word and rapping, alongside shouting and singing. Slants Sal Cinquemani compared Minogue's vocals to those of American singer Madonna by saying that they never [...] "venture outside her comfort zone", but noticed that Impossible Princess [...] "finds Minogue stretching herself way <b>beyond</b> <b>anything</b> she had done before—or anything she's done since." ...|$|E
