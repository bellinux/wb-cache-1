5|$|Shinanos launch on 8 October 1944, with Captain Toshio Abe in command, was {{marred by}} what some {{considered}} an ill-omened accident. During the floating-out procedure, one of the caissons {{at the end of}} the dock unexpectedly lifted as the water rose to the level of the harbor (no one had checked to ensure that all the caissons were properly <b>ballasted</b> with seawater). The sudden inrush of water into the graving dock pushed the carrier into the forward end, damaging the bow structure below the waterline and requiring repairs in drydock. These were completed by 26 October.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to develop a}} <b>ballast</b> quality evaluation computer model based on the relations among the <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics and <b>ballast</b> performance. ^ Much effort has been given in the past to seek suitable criteria for <b>ballast</b> material selection considering <b>ballast</b> performance and maintenance costs. But the selection of <b>ballast</b> material has appeared to be based on limited information without full regard to the effect of <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics on the ability of <b>ballast</b> to fulfill its functions in track. This will result in some misjudgments in the <b>ballast</b> material selection. ^ The developed model can quantify the <b>ballast</b> suitability with a <b>ballast</b> quality index which has taken the basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics and the main <b>ballast</b> field functions into consideration. The basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics included are shape, angularity, surface texture, gradation, and specific gravity. The main <b>ballast</b> field functions for track are providing resistance forces, resiliency, void storage, drainage, and facilitating maintenance. The <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics are numerically related to the <b>ballast</b> field functions based on available data from field and laboratory tests on granular materials and some assumptions. Weighting factors are used to represent the relative importance of the basic <b>ballast</b> particle characteristics to each <b>ballast</b> function and then the relative importance of the main <b>ballast</b> functions to the overall <b>ballast</b> field performance. ^ The developed model is evaluated using the <b>ballast</b> field data related to the track performance. The verification results show that the developed <b>ballast</b> quality index can reflect the <b>ballast</b> quality. ...|$|R
5000|$|For a {{lighting}} <b>ballast,</b> the ANSI <b>ballast</b> {{factor is}} used in North America to compare the light output (in lumens) of a lamp operated on a <b>ballast</b> compared to the lamp operating on an ANSI reference <b>ballast.</b> Reference <b>ballast</b> operates the lamp at its ANSI specified nominal power rating.

With fluorescent lamps, <b>ballast</b> factor can vary from the reference value of 1.0.|$|R
50|$|Conversion bulbs are {{manufactured}} so {{they work with}} either a MH or HPS <b>ballast.</b> A grower can run an HPS conversion bulb on a MH <b>ballast,</b> or a MH conversion bulb on a HPS <b>ballast.</b> The difference between the <b>ballasts</b> is an HPS <b>ballast</b> has an igniter which ignites the sodium in an HPS bulb, while a MH <b>ballast</b> does not. Because of this, all electrical <b>ballasts</b> can fire MH bulbs, but only a Switchable or HPS <b>ballast</b> can fire an HPS bulb without a conversion bulb. Usually a metal halide conversion bulb {{will be used in}} an HPS <b>ballast</b> since the MH conversion bulbs are more common.|$|R

Driver Jacques Laffite was among those {{to claim that the}} cars were fitted with heavily <b>ballasted</b> bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E
5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main derrick and boat equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment. Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was <b>ballasted</b> differently than she had been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|E
25|$|Some bottles are <b>ballasted</b> {{with dry}} sand {{so that they}} float {{vertically}} {{at or near the}} ocean surface, and are less influenced by winds and breaking waves than other bottles that are purposely not <b>ballasted.</b> Wooden blocks float higher in the water and thus are more influenced by wind—a design specially suited for simulating travel paths of plastic waste that is less dense than glass containers.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ballast</b> {{cleaning}} removes this worn <b>ballast,</b> screens it {{and replaces}} the [...] "dirty" [...] worn <b>ballast</b> with fresh <b>ballast.</b> The advantage of <b>ballast</b> cleaning {{is that it}} can be done by an on-track machine without removing the rail and sleepers, and it is therefore cheaper than a total excavation.|$|R
50|$|After {{the track}} renewal train completes the tasks, the <b>ballast</b> {{will be put}} back on the track. For track renewal trains {{that do not have}} <b>ballast</b> {{excavating}} machines included, workers will use a shoulder <b>ballast</b> cutter machine that takes excess <b>ballast</b> that has been pushed out during the track renewal process, into a screening and cleaning machine. The reusable <b>ballast</b> will be put back to the new track together with the new <b>ballast</b> materials. For track renewal trains that do not include track copying or leveling, a <b>ballast</b> tamper will be used to make final adjustments to the track to the correct specification. A <b>ballast</b> regulator will then be used to make the final shape of the <b>ballast.</b>|$|R
25|$|Slab track {{can also}} {{generate}} significantly more noise pollution and cause more vibration than traditional <b>ballasted</b> track. While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant factor is that slab track typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar to <b>ballasted</b> track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to vibrate over a greater length.|$|E

25|$|Earlier, {{household}} {{clothes dryers}} sometimes incorporated a germicidal lamp {{in series with}} an ordinary incandescent lamp; the incandescent lamp operated as the ballast for the germicidal lamp. A commonly used light in the home in the 1960s in 220–240V countries was a circleline tube <b>ballasted</b> by an under-run regular mains filament lamp. Self <b>ballasted</b> mercury-vapor lamps incorporate ordinary tungsten filaments within the overall envelope of the lamp to act as the ballast, and it supplements the otherwise lacking red area of the light spectrum produced.|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{abundance}} and size was characterized in <b>ballast</b> and port water along the West and East coasts of Canada {{and on the}} Great Lakes during 2007 and 2008. <b>Ballast</b> water unexchanged at sea showed higher bacterial abundance than <b>ballast</b> water exchanged. On average, bacterial abundance in receiving port water was three-to-four-fold higher than that in <b>ballast</b> water. During 2007, bacterial community structure, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, showed that the bacterial communities did not differ among <b>ballast</b> waters which had experienced different <b>ballast</b> operations. However, bacterial communities differed between <b>ballast</b> and port water, which implies {{that there is a}} potentially environmental risk from <b>ballast</b> water-distributed bacteria into Canadian harbors.

50|$|The <b>ballast</b> bed is then cleared in {{preparation}} of laying new concrete sleepers. In case {{there is a}} need to lower the <b>ballast</b> bed, the <b>ballast</b> excavating process will be done. This process is integrated into the track renewal train in some models. Excess <b>ballast</b> in that case will be moved out through the conveyor belt to the <b>ballast</b> storage area. Those old <b>ballast</b> materials will be screened and cleaned to be reused. The unusable <b>ballast</b> will kept in a separate storage to be discarded.|$|R
5|$|<b>Ballast</b> Point got {{its name}} from the {{practice}} of ships discarding their <b>ballast</b> there on arriving in San Diego Bay and taking on <b>ballast</b> as they left for the open ocean.

25|$|These systems {{offer the}} {{advantage}} of superior stability and almost complete absence of deformation. Ballastless track systems incur significantly lower maintenance costs compared to <b>ballasted</b> track. Due {{to the absence of}} any ballast, damage by flying ballast is eliminated, something that occurs at speeds in excess of 250km/h (150mph). It is also useful in renovating existing railroad tunnels. Because slab track allows shallower construction than <b>ballasted</b> track, it may provide the extra overhead clearance necessary for converting a line to overhead electrification, or allow the passage of trains with a greater loading gauge.|$|E

Therefore, they are either <b>ballasted</b> after dressing the diver by fastening weights to the lower parts of the helmet assembly, so the weight is carried on the shoulders when out of the water, or the helmet may be held down by a jocking strap and the harness weights provide the ballast.|$|E

40|$|The human-mediated {{transfer}} of harmful organisms via shipping, especially via <b>ballast</b> water transport, has raised considerable attention {{especially in the}} last decade due to the negative associated impacts. <b>Ballast</b> water sampling is important to assess the compliance with <b>ballast</b> water management requirements (i. e. compliance monitoring). The complexity of <b>ballast</b> water sampling is a result of organism diversity and behaviour which may require different sampling strategies, as well as ship design implications including availability of <b>ballast</b> water sampling points.

25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary <b>ballast</b> to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic <b>ballast,</b> commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic <b>ballasts</b> achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation.

40|$|AbstractHigh {{pressure}} sodium lamp {{is widely}} used for street and public lighting in many countries including Egypt. It is traditionally connected to the AC mains through electromagnetic <b>ballast.</b> Electronic <b>ballast</b> for high pressure sodium lamp has reached a matured technological state and it is outperforming electromagnetic <b>ballast</b> in almost all operational aspects. Differentiating both <b>ballasts</b> from a technical perspective has been presented in great detail by the authors in a previous paper. Due to the current critical shortage of electrical energy supply in Egypt; top executives seek alternatives to mitigate the crisis of electricity shortage. Among these alternatives is a national plan to replace magnetic <b>ballasts</b> with electronic <b>ballasts</b> for public lighting applications. Replacing conventional electromagnetic <b>ballast</b> with electronic <b>ballast</b> is associated with high capital investment due to high cost of such devices. The objective {{of this study is}} to outlay a systematic approach to define the threshold price of electronic <b>ballast</b> which assures the economical feasibility of such plan. In doing this, the economical aspects of replacing electromagnetic <b>ballasts</b> with electronic <b>ballast</b> on a national scale in Egypt are analyzed and presented...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ballast</b> {{consisting}} of large sized aggregate particles with uniform size distribution {{is an essential}} component of the track substructure, to facilitate load distribution and drainage. As freight tonnage accumulates with traffic, <b>ballast</b> will accumulate an increasing percentage of fines due to either aggregate breakdown or outside contamination such as subgrade soil intrusion and coal dust collection. According to the classical text by Selig and Waters [1], <b>ballast</b> degradation from traffic involves up to 76 % of all fouling cases; voids will be occupied by fines from the bottom of <b>ballast</b> layer gradually causing <b>ballast</b> clogging and losing its drainage ability. When moisture is trapped within <b>ballast,</b> especially fouled <b>ballast,</b> <b>ballast</b> layer stability is compromised. In the recent studies at the University of Illinois, the focus has been to evaluate behavior of fouled <b>ballast</b> due to aggregate degradation using large scale triaxial testing. To investigate the effects of moisture on degraded <b>ballast,</b> fouled <b>ballast</b> was generated in the laboratory through controlled Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests intended to mimic aggregate abrasion and breakdown and generate fouled <b>ballast</b> at compositions similar to those observed in the field due to repeated train loadings. Triaxial shear strength tests were performed on the fouled <b>ballast</b> at different moisture contents. Important findings of this preliminary study on characterizing wet fouled <b>ballast</b> are presented in this paper. Moisture was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the fouled <b>ballast</b> strength behavior. Adding a small amount of 3 % moisture (by weight of particles smaller than 3 / 8 in. size or smaller than 9. 5 mm) caused test specimens to indicate approximately 50 % decrease in shear strength of the dry fouled <b>ballast.</b> Wet fouled <b>ballast</b> samples peaked at significantly lower maximum deviator stress values at relatively smaller axial strains and remained at these low levels as the axial strain was increased...|$|R
25|$|A {{combination}} of <b>ballasted</b> and slab track are used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional {{area of the}} tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.|$|E
25|$|Building a {{slab track}} is more {{expensive}} than building traditional <b>ballasted</b> track, which has slowed its introduction outside of high-speed rail lines. Slab track is also difficult to modify {{after it has been}} installed, and the curing time of concrete makes it difficult to convert an existing, busy railway line to a ballastless set-up.|$|E
25|$|A diver <b>ballasted</b> by {{following}} this procedure will be negatively buoyant {{during most of}} the dive unless the buoyancy compensator is used, to an extent which depends on the amount of breathing gas carried. The buoyancy compensator is partially inflated when needed to support this negative buoyancy, and as breathing gas is used up during the dive, the volume of the buoyancy compensator will be reduced, by venting as required.|$|E

Removing and cleaning the <b>ballast</b> from the shoulder is often sufficient, if shoulder <b>ballast</b> is removed to the correct depth. While this job was historically done by manual labour, this process is now, like many other railway maintenance tasks, a mechanised one, with a chain of specially-designed railroad cars handling the task. One wagon cuts the <b>ballast</b> and passes it via a conveyor belt to a cleaning machine, then the cleaning wagon washes the <b>ballast,</b> and deposits the dirt and <b>ballast</b> into other wagons for disposal and re-use, respectively. Such machines can clean up to [...] of <b>ballast</b> in an hour.|$|R
40|$|The thesis firstly {{includes}} {{a study of}} the structure and requirements of a general <b>ballast</b> system. Based on this knowledge a <b>ballast</b> system suiting the needs of the WindFlip concept was designed through using the risk-based design methodology (RBD). The presented <b>ballast</b> system has one sub-system for <b>ballasting</b> during rotation of WindFlip from horizontal to vertical position and back again (called main <b>ballast</b> system). Another sub-system (called the secondary <b>ballast</b> system) is used during transit without payload and during onloading of payload (one Hywind floating offshore wind turbine). The latter system is connected to an eductor circuit for stripping the <b>ballast</b> tanks. The main <b>ballast</b> system <b>ballasts</b> by flooding the <b>ballast</b> tanks. The tank is ventilated so it can flood freely, ventilation is closed when the tank is completely full. As WindFlip does not have a pressure hull, pressure is increased in empty <b>ballast</b> tanks when being submerged to compensate for increased hydrostatic pressure. During deballasting ventilation is used to relieve pressure gradually. Water in the <b>ballast</b> tanks is purged out by compressed air. The main <b>ballast</b> system has two main pipelines which are branched into feeder lines going into each tank. There are two valves connected to the feeder line leading into each tank; a butterfly valve and a pressure reduction valve (PRV). The butterfly valve is used for ventilation and the PRV for the compressed air. The function of the two main lines may be switched (from vent to compressed air and vice versa), and there is an interconnection between the two also securing redundancy. The main <b>ballast</b> system reaches out to 102 <b>ballast</b> tanks. The secondary <b>ballast</b> system reaches out to 27 <b>ballast</b> tanks. The layout of this system is quite similar to common <b>ballast</b> systems. The main difference is that it only has one <b>ballast</b> pump, which is allowed for unmanned barges according to DNV. An eductor system is included in the secondary <b>ballast</b> system for stripping the <b>ballast</b> tanks. This system may however not be mandatory, this should be discussed further with the classing society. A <b>ballast</b> treatment plant is not included in the design as WindFlip mostly will operate locally. There is however a possibility for conducting <b>ballast</b> exchange with the sequential method during continental travel. A Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) was performed in order to find the unreliability of the system. The most interesting result was that a failure during rotation is expected once every third year. The FTA was compared to the use of Bayesian networks (BN). The report shows that BN can replace the FTA and that BN is a more flexible method. </p...|$|R
