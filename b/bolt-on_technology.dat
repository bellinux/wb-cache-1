40|$|The {{cryogenic}} CO 2 capture (CCC) process {{appears to}} consume 30 % or more less energy and money than other major competing carbon capture processes. The process cools CO 2 -laden flue gas to desublimation temperatures (- 100 to- 135 °C), separates solid CO 2 that forms from the flue {{gas from the}} light gases, uses the cold products to cool incoming gases in a recuperative heat exchanger, compresses the solid/liquid CO 2 to final pressures (100 - 200 atm), and delivers a compressed CO 2 stream separated from an atmospheric pressure light-gas stream. The overall energy and economic costs appear {{to be at least}} 30 % lower than most competing processes that involve air separation units (ASUs), solvents, or similar technologies. In addition, the CCC process enjoys several ancillary benefits, including (a) it is a minimally invasive <b>bolt-on</b> <b>technology,</b> (b) it provides highly efficient removal of most pollutants (Hg, SOx, NO 2, HCl, etc.), (c) possible energy storage capacity, and (d) potential water savings. This paper outlines the process details and economic and energy comparisons relative to other well-documented alternatives...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} mass {{manufacturing}} electrode structures suitable for contacting nanoscale elements lies {{primarily in the}} difficulty of fabricating a nanometre-scale gap between two electrodes in a well controlled, highly parallel manner. In ULSI circuit production, the gate and substrate in MOSFETs are routinely fabricated with a precise vertical spacing of 3 nm between them. In this work, we have investigated a number of highly parallel methods for the generation of nanogaps, including reconfiguration of the ubiquitous MOS device structure. The silicon dioxide layer that provides vertical separation and electrical insulation between two regions of silicon (the crystalline substrate and the poly-crystalline gate) gives a leakage current of 1 nA - 2 at 1 V for an oxide thickness of 2 nm [1]. This will enable objects the size of single molecules that are held across this layer to be detected electrically if they provide currents on the nanoampere scale, assuming a parasitic area for leakage between gate and substrate of order 1 µm 2. In the future this kind of device {{has the potential to}} provide a <b>bolt-on</b> <b>technology</b> for the fabrication of ULSI circuits in which conventional CMOS devices are directly hybridised with functional nanoscale elements...|$|E
40|$|Advancements in {{characterisation}} {{techniques in}} the field of heterogeneous catalysis have been explored, in particular the powerful in situ perturbation method, Flux Response Technology (FRT). The adaptation of FRT as a novel in situ perturbation technique in gas sorption measurements continues to yield consistent results with literature values. This is made possible because FRT measures miniscule changes in transient flows in the order of 10 - 2 μl/min for gaseous processes involving a change in volume (dV/dt). These changes are measured directly by a very sensitive differential pressure transducer (DPT) in a pneumatic system analogous to an electrical Wheatstone bridge assembly, whereby gas molecules replace electrons and capillaries function as resistors. By showing the successful incorporation of the measurements of adsorption capacities and diffusivity coefficients in the same experimental window, FRT’s use as a <b>bolt-on</b> <b>technology</b> for the rapid screening of catalyst material has been highlighted. The technique possesses a distinct advantage in requiring no prior calibrations to the system, enabling the analysis of a broad spectrum of materials and gases. The FRT technique also features a unique ability in being able to act as a dual flowrate and composition detector through the use of carefully calculated delay lines to separate changes in flowrate caused by perturbations of concentration and changes in composition. The FRT technique provides a quick, simple, accurate, and inexpensive method of characterising material properties in situ in heterogeneous catalysis. Several studies into the dynamics of gas sorption processes utilising FRT measurements on adsorbents were undertaken in the completion of this PhD. The diffusivity parameters of propane in varying alumina/CeZrOx washcoats of Cordierite monoliths were investigated under isothermal conditions. A novel method of analysing FRT derived response profiles with the Zero Length Column (ZLC) model was established and reported on. The diffusion coefficients obtained were consistent with previously reported macroscopic data and compared well when evaluating the structural differences of the washcoats of each sample (Granato et al., 2010). The dynamics of ammonia sorption on commercially available zeolites with varying SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios was analysed to investigate the total acidity of these zeolites. The dynamics of carbon dioxide sorption were also investigated to analyse the total basicity of the same zeolite samples. Process optimisations were conducted to obtain an ultra fast isotherm measurement technique for the analysis of nitrogen sorption on aluminium oxides with varying surface areas at 77 K. Finally, insights into the development of a dynamic parallel performance testing (DPPT) FRT setup were undertaken to directly compare the activities of catalytic material operating side by side.
