5|$|The French victory {{had come}} at a heavy cost: more than 160 men were killed and 300 wounded and all three French ships had been {{severely}} damaged. Among the dead were the captains of both Formidable and Indomptable, although Linois was unhurt. The Spanish had suffered eleven men killed and five gunboats had been destroyed. The batteries and town had also been badly damaged in the fighting. British losses were also heavy, with more than 130 killed and more than 230 wounded, most of which had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> Hannibal and Pompée. In addition {{to the loss of}} Hannibal, Pompée was severely damaged and the remainder of the British squadron all required urgent repairs.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return and tell them to turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>On</b> November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 1918, the Armistice took effect; {{according}} to its terms, eleven battleships and five battlecruisers were to be interned in Scapa Flow {{for the duration of}} negotiations for the peace treaty. Posen was not among the ships interned, and she was instead decommissioned on 16 December. The ships in Scapa Flow were scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the Allies. As a result, Posen and the other battleships that remained in Germany were seized as replacements for the ships that had <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b> <b>On</b> 5 November, Posen was stricken from the German navy list to be handed over to Great Britain. The ship was transferred on 13 May 1920; on 1 November 1920, she was driven ashore at Hawkcraig, Fife, Scotland. The British subsequently sold Posen to ship-breakers in the Netherlands. She was broken up in Dordrecht in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball with a first down at its 30-yard line. The Hokie drive fizzled, as had most of the offense in the third quarter, after DeShazo was sacked for a big loss on third down. Indiana returned the Tech punt to its 43-yard line, and Indiana brought in its backup quarterback, Chris Dittoe, to lead the offense. After being sacked on his first play, Dittoe completed a pass to near midfield, making up the yardage that had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> the sack. Despite that gain, Indiana couldn't make up the yardage lost to the sack {{and appeared to be}} ready to punt the ball. Instead, the Hoosiers faked the punt and threw a pass to an undefended Indiana player who dropped the ball. Following the turnover, Virginia Tech's offense started work at the Indiana 49-yard line. After being stopped short on two rushes, DeShazo completed a 42-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, who raced down the field and into the end zone. The extra point was good, and with 9:37 remaining in the game, Tech took a 3513 lead.|$|E

25|$|Britannia sailed on 23 January 1831 with Ross, master, and {{destination}} New Guinea. She was at Mahe on 8 October having sustained damage.

She {{was reported to have}} <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> the Comoro Islands with 900 barrels, but the report proved incorrect. She returned to Britain on 25 March 1834.|$|E
25|$|One source {{states that}} Comet was {{lost at sea}} in 1816. Lloyd's List has {{no mention of the}} loss of a Comet in 1816. It does list two as being lost in 1815.

25|$|Butterworth {{successfully}} {{returned to}} England on 3 February 1795, with Sharpe, master. She was carrying 85 tuns of whale oil and 17500 seal skins. She then made several more whaling voyages. Lloyd's List reported that Butterworth, Folger, master, had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> 13 July 1802 off St. Jago, while outbound to the Southern Fisheries. One man was drowned, {{but the rest}} of the crew were saved and returned to Portsmouth.|$|E
25|$|During their meeting, {{the deputy}} {{leader of the}} expedition, Xu Jing, spontaneously blurted out that on his descent from the First Step, he {{recalled}} having spotted a dead climber lying on his back, feet facing uphill, in a hollow or slot in the rock. Since no one other than Mallory and Irvine had ever <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> {{the north side of}} Everest before 1960, and Mallory had been found much lower down, it was almost a certainty that Xu had discovered Irvine. However, the sighting was brief, and Xu was in desperate straits during the descent, and while he clearly remembered seeing the body, he was unclear about where it was.|$|E
25|$|Losses grew in {{the face}} of a more {{aggressive}} enemy flying newer aircraft. One of their last missions was to protect Junkers Ju 52 ambulance planes filled with wounded veterans from swarms of attacking Soviet interceptors. The last major action was on 17 January 1943: 25 C.200s strafed enemy troops in the Millerovo area. The aviation of the ARMIR was withdrawn on 18 January, bringing 30 C.200 and nine C.202 fighters back to Italy and leaving 15 unserviceable aircraft behind. A total of 66 Italian aircraft had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> Eastern Front – against, according to official figures, 88 victories claimed during 17 months of action in that theatre.|$|E

25|$|Rolla was a French brig {{launched}} in 1801 or 1803 (records differ), {{that came into}} British hands in 1804. She became a privateer and then a slaver, but before she took any slaves the French Navy captured her. The British Royal Navy recaptured her and took her into service as HMS Rolla. She served in Sir Home Riggs Popham's attack on Buenos Aires. She returned to Britain in December 1807 and was laid up. The Admiralty sold her in 1810 and she became a merchant vessel. She is last listed in 1826, and may have <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> the coast of Brazil in 1825.|$|E
25|$|De Leyva, who {{had been}} seriously injured by a capstan, pitched camp {{on the shore of}} the bay for nine days, until news came of another ship of the fleet, the galleass Girona, which had {{anchored}} in Killybegs harbour while two other ships had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> attempting to enter the harbour. With the assistance of an Irish chieftain, MacSweeney Bannagh, Girona was repaired and set sail in mid-October with 1,300 men on board, including de Leyva. Lough Foyle was cleared, but then a gale struck and Girona was driven ashore at Dunluce in modern County Antrim. There were nine survivors, who were sent on to Scotland by Sorley Boy MacDonnell; 260 bodies were washed ashore.|$|E
25|$|The air echelon did not {{accompany}} the sea movement and was quartered at Fort McDowell, California, until 6 April, when it moved by train to Patterson Field, Ohio, to continue B-26 training. On 8–7 May, the 69th and 70th BS flew new B-26Bs to California for movement to Hawaii, while the 71st and 405th began receiving B-25 Mitchell bombers for training. The 71st moved to MacDill AAB where it exchanged its experienced B-26 crews {{for those of}} the 21st Bomb Group (a unit converting to B-26s), which were entirely newly graduated pilots from Shafter Field Pilot Training Class 42-E. The 405th flew to Barksdale Field, Louisiana, to exchange crews with the 17th Bomb Group, which was converting to B-26s because {{a large portion of}} its B-25s had <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> <b>on</b> the Doolittle Raid. These novice pilots and crews became the core of the group's combat crews for the next 15 months.|$|E
