5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry <b>Blackwood.</b> At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. <b>Blackwood</b> also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blackwood</b> rapidly gained on {{the ship}} {{of the line and}} by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and {{beginning}} a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship. Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, Penelope was too fast, and <b>Blackwood</b> handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decrés' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship.|$|E

40|$|<b>Blackwood’s</b> Magazine effected, as the {{magazine}} itself put it, “a {{new era in}} periodical literature” upon its launch in October 1817. Central to discussions of <b>Blackwood’s</b> impact on the republic of letters has been {{the magazine}}’s political standpoint, particularly what {{is perceived to be}} a reactionary outburst against the reformist Leigh Hunt and the “Cockney School” of writers grouped around his Examiner newspaper. Hunt’s innovatory journalism at The Examiner and elsewhere offered a new kind of miscellaneity which proved successful in appealing to a newly enlarged reading audience. It was a model which influenced <b>Blackwood’s</b> directly. <b>Blackwood’s</b> did indeed focus obsessively on Hunt. But this article proposes that that focus should be recognized as a perverse form of tribute, a recognition of Hunt’s determining influence on the formal development of a new breed of magazines...|$|R

He was followed as president of the academy by his nephew John Watson Gordon (1788–1864), who also studied with Raeburn. He painted portraits of leading cultural figures James Hogg and Lady Nairne as part of a series of portraits commissioned by William <b>Blackwood.</b> From the 1840s his work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, {{as can be seen in}} his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847).|$|E
