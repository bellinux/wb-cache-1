5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as <b>bisphenol</b> A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

40|$|Trabalho Final de Mestrado Integrado, Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2014 In recent years, Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{presented itself}} {{as one of}} the analytical methodologies with most potential, with SERS leading the way. The use of metal nanoparticles promotes an immense increase in the intensity obtained and allows a substantial reduction in the limit of quantification, raising SERS to the same level as reference methods such as HPLC. In this work, we want to demonstrate the powerful applications of SERS by attempting the development of an analytical method for the detection and quantification of important molecules in daily-life samples. <b>Bisphenols</b> are small estrogen-like molecules present in a broad variety of consumer goods such as plastics, tin cans, thermal papers and many others. And with their toxicity profile not yet fully established but pointing to genotoxic danger, {{it is very important to}} develop a simple, fast and very sensitive method for their detection. In this work it was developed a SERS method capable of detect and quantify three different <b>bisphenols,</b> either alone and in mixtures, while drawing calibration curves with correlations up to 0, 99. It was also possible to perform analysis in different matrices with simple changes in the sample preparation procedure, increasing the versatility of the method. Those results progressed into the analysis of real samples and it was possible to detect the presence of <b>bisphenols</b> in thermal paper and store's tickets. It was, then, possible to develop a green, very fast and very sensitive method for detection of <b>bisphenols,</b> capable of matching the renowned methods of reference, hoping it will help shedding some spotlight on SERS's wonderful advantages...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bisphenols</b> {{constitute}} {{a family of}} compounds, which includes many substances that have as a common chemical structure two phenolic rings joined together through a bridging carbon. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether several events triggered by 17 β-estradiol (E 2) in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells were also observed in response to various bisphenol-A (BPA) analogues. We studied the expression of estrogen controlled genes by measuring the induction of pS 2 (mRNA and protein) and progesterone receptor (PgR) {{as well as the}} expression of a luciferase reporter gene transfected into MVLN cells. These data were compared to the cell proliferation potency and effectiveness as the latest expression of estrogen controlled functions. <b>Bisphenols</b> showed an agonistic effect in all our assays, suggesting that these compounds may act through all the response pathways triggered by the natural hormone. We found differences between the assays in the potency of <b>bisphenols,</b> defined as the minimum concentration required to produce a maximal effect. In the cell proliferation assay, all tested compounds needed a lower concentration than in the other assays to give maximal response. Our results suggest that the polarity and nature of the substituent in the central carbon determines the estrogenic potency. Presence of two propyl chains at the central carbon appears to confer the greatest potency in both gene and protein expression assays. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{capability}} of the flame retardants tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA) to activate peroxysome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha, beta, and gamma and estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta has been recently investigated, but the activity of their biotransformation products and of their lower molecular weight analogues formed in the environment remains unexplored. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between the degree of halogenation of BPA analogues and their affinity and activity towards human PPAR gamma and ERs and to characterize active metabolites of major marketed halogenated <b>bisphenols.</b> The biological activity of all compounds was studied using reporter cell lines expressing these nuclear receptors (NRs). We used NR-based affinity columns to rapidly evaluate the binding affinity of halogenated <b>bisphenols</b> for PPAR gamma and ERs and to trap active metabolites of TBBPA and TCBPA formed in HepG 2 cells. The agonistic potential of BPA analogs highly depends on their halogenation degree: the bulkier halogenated BPA analogs, the greater their capability to activate PPAR gamma. In addition, PPAR gamma-based affinity column, HGELN-PPAR gamma reporter cell line and crystallographic analysis clearly demonstrate that the sulfation pathway, usually considered as a detoxification process, leads for TBBPA and TCBPA, to the formation of sulfate conjugates which possess a residual PPAR gamma-binding activity. Our results highlight the effectiveness NR-based affinity columns to trap and characterize biologically active compounds from complex matrices.
