6000|$|The Kipps' furniture, {{except for}} certain chromo {{lithographs}} of Kipps' incidental choice that struck a quiet note amidst the wall paper, had been tactfully forced by an expert salesman, {{and it was}} in a style of mediocre elegance. There was a sideboard of carved oak that had only one fault, it reminded Kipps at times of wood-carving, and its panel of <b>bevelled</b> <b>glass</b> now reflected the back of his head. On its shelf were two books from Parsons' Library, each with a [...] "place" [...] marked by a slip of paper; neither of the Kippses could have told you the title of either book they read, much less the author's name. There was an ebonised overmantel set with phials and pots of brilliant colour, each duplicated by looking-glass, and bearing also a pair of Chinese jars made in Birmingham, a wedding present from Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Pornick, and several sumptuous Japanese fans. And there was a Turkey carpet of great richness. In addition to these modern exploits of Messrs. Bunt and Bubble, there were two inactive tall clocks, whose extreme dilapidation appealed to the connoisseur; a terrestrial and a celestial globe, the latter deeply indented; a number of good old iron moulded and dusty books, and a stuffed owl wanting one (easily replaceable) glass eye, obtained by the exertions of Uncle Kipps. The table equipage was as much as possible like Mrs. Bindon Botting's, only more costly, and in addition there were green and crimson wine glasses--though the Kippses never drank wine.|$|E

5000|$|In {{domestic}} architecture, after World War I, {{the focus}} on the decoration of the front door became less common, and the front windows became the location of leadlighting. Many houses of the 1920s and 30s have Mock Tudor elements, including gables decorated with pseudo half-timbering and leadlight casement windows in diamond panes {{at the front of the}} house. This architectural style is commonly found in Public Houses of the time, and also in school buildings. With the [...] "bungalow" [...] style of architecture becoming increasingly popular, sash windows were also often made with leadlighting, often incorporating sections of glass very much larger than in traditional diapered windows. This trend continued until World War II, the style evolving from Art Nouveau to Art Deco, which both employed a great variety of glass, including cathedral glass and opalescent glass, as well as <b>bevelled</b> <b>glass.</b> From 1940 until about 1980 domestic leadlighting was less common.|$|E

[...] The Los Angeles Times reported on its opulence as follows:"It is the interior which is to reincarnate man and beast in the fire department.

5000|$|The second {{batch of}} trains, 38 three-car sets and 5 spare motor cars, used Swiss Oerlikon {{equipment}} and was generally {{similar to the}} Siemens powered stock. The four traction motors were rated at [...] and these trains seated 33 first and 130 third class passengers. The third class accommodation {{was a mixture of}} longitudinal seating and seats arranged in facing bays in pairs {{on either side of the}} gangway. The first class accommodation (downgraded to third class at the beginning of the Second World War), occupied two of the three saloons into which the intermediate car was divided, on being for smokers and the centre saloon for non-smokers. The saloons were separated by swing doors with frosted <b>glass</b> or <b>bevelled</b> plain <b>glass</b> glazing, the latter having an etched LNWR script decorative monogram. The first class seating was in facing pairs arranged 2+1 on either side of the gangway, and the general ambience was Edwardian-luxurious, with mahogany panelling. Above the seats were glazed frames which displayed photographs of landscapes and towns served by the London and North Western Railway; these were retained to the end.|$|R
50|$|Klaus Moje {{was born}} in 1936 in Germany to a family of glass workers who {{specialised}} in providing <b>bevelled</b> and decorated <b>glass</b> for things such as mirrors and shelving. Moje became a journeyman glass cutter and worked in his family's shop until he received a scholarship to study glass art in Rheinbach and then in Hadamar. After a brief time as a German folk singer, Moje opened a stained glass studio with Isgard Moje-Wohlgemuth. Moje made his first entry into the glass art world with carved and polished glass sculptures. Although these pieces garnered him {{quite a bit of}} attention, he abandoned the cut glass work when he discovered a caché of colourful glass canes that were used to make buttons for the garment industry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{centrally}} positioned entrance off Adelaide Street has {{a pair of}} painted, panelled timber doors opening {{directly from}} the street into a tiny entrance vestibule. This has a varnished, panelled timber ceiling and highly glazed early ceramic tiles lining the walls to door height. A fine varnished timber screen and double-leaf door with <b>bevelled</b> <b>glass</b> panels and carved timber wreaths separates the vestibule from the central foyer. Both sets of entrance doors have metal handles in Art Nouveau designs. Early marble steps lead up to a central foyer with later stone and tile flooring. Wide openings, one off {{each side of the}} foyer, have detailed timber architraves. The opening to the left leads up a couple of steps to the 1918 brick section; the opening at the right leads down a couple of steps, through a stone wall (formerly the south-west exterior wall of the [...] building) to the earlier structure. The different floor levels reflect the slope of the land down toward the north-east corner of the site. At the end of the front foyer is the central public staircase, which accesses all three floors of the building. This has a well-detailed and crafted varnished timber balustrade with substantial timber newels.|$|E
40|$|In 1933 it {{was decided}} by the University to {{construct}} a separate building for the library which was then still located in the Old Arts building. With a contribution of £ 10 000 from mining geologist Dr Hans Merensky, construction started in 1937. General Jan Smuts laid the cornerstone on 11 October 1937 and on 15 April 1938 the building was officially opened. “This country has given me so much that I am {{only too happy to}} be allowed to help it to develop {{and to be able to}} give back to it a fraction of what it has given to me [...] . ” - Hans Merensky, at the opening of the Merensky Library. In designing the building, architect Gerhard Moerdyk was influenced by various styles, including Art Deco, Neo-Classicism, Arts and Crafts, as well as local styles such as Cape Dutch and Regency. Moerdyk himself described the building as a study in Persian style, with influences from Africa including the Zimbabwe and ancient Egyptian ruins. He used local materials and incorporated symbols of African origin. The prominent zigzag pattern, for example, is taken from the Zimbabwe ruins and represents water and fertility, the crocodile as a water figure and the bird as a symbol of space, symbolizing the freedom and creativity of the author. The curving of the walls symbolises an open book. The green <b>bevelled</b> <b>glass</b> windows were imported from Italy and helped to minimise heat from the sun and also protected paper against ultraviolet light. The design of the building is a source of controversy and speculation with some claiming that Moerdyk used it as a practice run for the design of the Voortrekker Monument, as there are many similarities between the two buildings. Today this national monument serves as the Edoardo Villa museum and also houses amongst others, a Mimi Coertse, Marita Napier and the largest South African sheet music collections. 4 coloured digital photos the Old Merensky using a KODAK Easyshare Z 710 Zoom Digital Camera.

February 2013. The {{purpose of}} this study is to determine: (1) The {{development}} of glass crafts in "DD Glass" Belukan, Pajang, Laweyan, Surakarta. (2) Barriers or constraints in the production process of glass crafts in "DD Glass" Belukan, Pajang, Laweyan, Surakarta. This study uses descriptive qualitative research that produces descriptive data. Strategy study is a single case study stuck. The research was conducted in the village Belukan, Pajang, Laweyan, Surakarta. Sources of data in this study came from (1) informant, Mr. Abdur as the owner and founder of craft glass "DD Glass", and the glass artisans in "DD Glass". (2) The glass craft and events of the "DD Glass" Belukan village, Village Pajang, District Laweyan, Surakarta municipality. (3) Document the various physical objects such as glass handicraft work "DD Glass" that already exist. Data collection techniques is by direct observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The sampling technique used was intended sample (purposive sampling). The validity of data using triangulation of data and review of informants. Data analysis using flow models of analysis (flow models) with three components, namely data reduction, data presentation and conclusion. Based on these results it can be concluded that the development of glass handicraft "DD Glass", includes: (1) glass crafts HR "DD Glass" in terms of quantity increases, the first 4 are now being 10 craftsmen. (2) Tools and materials remain the same, no progress due to purchase more sophisticated equipment and modern very expensive and not affordable by the "DD Glass", only if the defective appliance repair and replacement of new equipment if the equipment used is really not worth taking. (3) Design glass crafts "DD Glass" is not so noticeable development because of the design used in the past to the present, only now there is just a little addition and subtraction of a pre-existing design. (4) The process of making glass crafts "DD Glass" remains the same, only in terms of skills, abilities and experience increase. Barriers/constraints in the production process of glass crafts "DD Glass", namely: (1) In <b>bevel</b> <b>glass</b> has not been able to buy a sophisticated and modern equipment. (2) In glass engraving designs must be approved by the consumer, cutting process more difficult on the curved section. (3) In the stained glass designs must be approved by the consumer and the incorporation of glass using lead/brass rails should really blend with the strong, so that the resulting glass crafts that are not funny, strong and durable. (4) In glass painting designs must be approved by the consumer and in the staining requires an extra neatness does not seem to be falling apart...|$|R
40|$|Planar {{refractive}} index profiles with rapid variations, formed in glass, are measured with interferometry. This involves forming a <b>bevel</b> in the <b>glass</b> and orientating the fringe pattern {{to be normal}} to the bevel edge. The index profile is determined by differentiation of the phase function of the fringe pattern. The differentiation has been performed using the total variation regularization method {{in order to preserve}} rapid changes in the derivative. This new approach avoids the necessity of filtering, in order to reduce noise, in the direction perpendicular to the bevel, which would otherwise smooth out the rapid index changes. The method is assessed using a model {{refractive index}} profile that contains an index gradient of 0. 24 μm− 1 and is then applied practically to measure the refractive index profile of electrically poled BK 7 glass. The new approach allows the sharp transition in the index between poled and unpoled glass to be observed as well as the accumulation of potassium ions beyond the poled glass region...|$|R
5000|$|Philip and his wife, Sarah Thompson, of Whitchurch Township, moved {{originally}} {{into the}} old Cummer farmhouse, a -storey brick Georgian style dwelling. This house, built about 1840, was located between Parkview and Norton Avenues and faced west to Yonge Street. When Philip McKenzie died, John ran the farm and specialized in Holstein cattle until the local economy for farmers began to deteriorate. John then decided to subdivide the farm, and in 1912, registered the [...] "Empress Subdivision" [...] that was to become the heart of modern east Willowdale as the area was transformed from a rural village to a suburban community.In 1913, John and his wife, Eva, chose a large lot on the rise of land just east of Yonge Street on Parkview Avenue as the site for their new home. Built in a style which {{has been described as}} Queen Anne Revival, Arts and Crafts, and Edwardian, this red brick house contains 12 rooms and 3 bathrooms. The front of the house is profiled by a grand L-shaped, wrap-around verandah with stylized Doric columns. A large attached coach house was converted to accommodate automobiles and has a recreation room above. Significant interior features include the centre hall plan, a vestibule door and sidelights with <b>bevelled</b> leaded <b>glass,</b> a large leaded art glass window which lights the landing of the main staircase, two sunrooms, panelled doors and wainscotting, strip hardwood flooring and radiators. From their farm, the McKenzies retained the 1907 brick milk house, and built a stable in 1915 and a coach house in 1918.|$|R
6000|$|... § XIX. The depth {{at which}} the glass should be placed, in windows without traceries, will {{generally}} be fixed by the forms of their <b>bevelling,</b> the <b>glass</b> occupying the narrowest interval; but when its position is not thus fixed, as in many London houses, {{it is to be}} remembered that the deeper the glass is set (the wall being of given thickness), the more light will enter, and the clearer the prospect will be to a person sitting quietly in the centre of the room; on the contrary, the farther out the glass is set, the more convenient the window will be for a person rising and looking out of it. The one, therefore, is an arrangement for the idle and curious, who care only {{about what is going on}} upon the earth: the other for those who are willing to remain at rest, so that they have free admission of the light of Heaven. This might be noted as a curious expressional reason for the necessity (of which no man of ordinary feeling would doubt for a moment) of a deep recess in the window, on the outside, to all good or architectural effect: still, as there is no reason why people should be made idle by having it in their power to look out of window, and as the slight increase of light or clearness of view in the centre of a room is more than balanced by the loss of space, and the greater chill of the nearer glass and outside air, we can, I fear, allege no other structural reason for the picturesque external recess, than the expediency of a certain degree of protection, for the glass, from the brightest glare of sunshine, and heaviest rush of rain.|$|R
