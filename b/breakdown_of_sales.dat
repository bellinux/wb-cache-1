40|$|We {{construct}} a prediction model for testing {{the hypothesis that}} firms with employees earning extramarginal wages [...] perhaps owing to long-term implicit contracts-were {{more likely to experience}} hostile tender offers from 1979 - 1989. Firms on the Compustat (active) file in 1979 comprise the domain from which targets were identified. The 1980 Census of Population is used to estimate wage equations by two-digit (SIC) industry and extract both industry wage premia as well as age-earnings profiles and age distributions of employees by industry. Firm-level estimates of employee characteristics are then constructed using the Compustat <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> firm <b>sales</b> by industry segment. Finally, event probabilities are estimated using logit and multinomial logit models. Variables related to proxies for the magnitude of extramarginal wages payments, plus other firm characteristics such as the extent of diversification across industries, are found to raise the likelihood of being a hostile takeover target, relative to other corporate control events. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Accommodation and <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> {{accommodation}} {{are important}} elements of information processing in nerve fibers, as they determine how nerve fibers react to natural slowly changing stimuli or electrical stimulation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, and that <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
