5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid <b>biosynthesis</b> begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid <b>biosynthesis,</b> which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E

For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular <b>biosynthesis.</b> This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|Stilbene synthase (STS) and {{chalcone}} synthase (CHS) are plant-specific polyketide synthases {{that play}} key {{roles in the}} stilbenoid and flavonoid <b>biosyntheses,</b> respectively. We have recently isolated from Pinus densiflora three STS cDNAs (PDSTS 1, PDSTS 2, and PDSTS 3) and one CHS cDNA (PDCHSX). We then heterologously expressed these cDNAs in Escherichia coli and characterized their properties. An unusual STS isozyme, PDSTS 3, lacks the common C-terminal extension of STS because of a frame-shift mutation and shows the highest pinosylvin-forming activity among the STSs tested. Pinosylvin was {{shown to be a}} potent inhibitor of PDCHSX (Ki = 6 μM) as well as PDSTS 2 (Ki = 13 μM), which presumably maintains the balance between the stilbenoid and flavonoid <b>biosyntheses.</b> PDSTS 3 was insensitive to product inhibition. We identified PDSTS 3 in the pine seedlings as well as full-length STS.

25|$|In mammals, {{transketolase}} {{connects the}} pentose phosphate pathway to glycolysis, feeding excess sugar phosphates {{into the main}} carbohydrate metabolic pathways. Its presence {{is necessary for the}} production of NADPH, especially in tissues actively engaged in <b>biosyntheses,</b> such as fatty acid synthesis by the liver and mammary glands, and for steroid synthesis by the liver and adrenal glands. Thiamine diphosphate is an essential cofactor, along with calcium.|$|R

In radical SAM enzymes, the cluster binds and reduces S-adenosylmethionine to generate a radical, which is involved in many <b>biosyntheses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance.

It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two major}} factors that lead to {{deficiency}} of CoQ10 in humans: reduced <b>biosynthesis,</b> and increased use by the body. <b>Biosynthesis</b> is {{the major source of}} CoQ10. <b>Biosynthesis</b> requires at least 12 genes, and mutations in many of them cause CoQ deficiency. CoQ10 levels also may be affected by other genetic defects (such as mutations of mitochondrial DNA, ETFDH, APTX, FXN, and BRAF, genes that are not directly related to the CoQ10 biosynthetic process). The role of statins in deficiencies is controversial. Some chronic disease conditions (cancer, heart disease, etc.) also are thought to reduce the <b>biosynthesis</b> of and increase the demand for CoQ10 in the body, but there are no definite data to support these claims.|$|E

40|$|A {{biochemical}} method {{was employed to}} study the responses of RABBIT SKIN to ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, SQUALANE, and DECANE. Skin samples excised with a Castroviejo keratotome were separated into lipid, TCA-soluble, RNA and DNA fractions after incubation with 40 •tCi Na 2 H 32 PO 4 at 37 øC for 1 hr. BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES in the epidermis with time were evaluated {{in terms of the}} changes in total phosphorus contents, specific activity and incorporated amount per unit DNA of each fraction. The results showed that decane damaged the skin so severely that the <b>biosyntheses</b> of lipids, RNA and DNA were reduced markedly for the first three days after application, but increased rapidly after that due to the repair. The effect of squalane was found to be weaker than that of isopropyl myristate, though both oils induced the stimulation of <b>biosyntheses</b> in the epidermis. The magnitude of the biochemical effects of the three oils on the skin was increased in the order of squalane, isopropyl myristate and decane, which was consistent with the results of macroscopic and histological observations. From the profiles of the effects it is postulated that the repairing processes are controlled by some feedback mechanisms...|$|R
