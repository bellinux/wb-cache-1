It had developed an advanced monetary economy by 1,000 CE. China had a free peasantry who were no longer subsistence farmers, and could sell their produce and actively participate in the market. According to Adam Smith, writing in the 18th century, China had long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated, most industrious, most urbanized, and most prosperous countries in the world. It enjoyed a technological advantage and had a monopoly in cast iron production, piston <b>bellows,</b> <b>suspension</b> bridge construction, printing, and the compass. However, it seemed to have long since stopped progressing. Marco Polo, who visited China in the 13th century, describes its cultivation, industry, and populousness almost in the same terms as travelers would in the 18th century.|$|E

The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines, Carpathians and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic invasions, and Russia spent a couple of centuries under the Mongol-Tatar yoke. Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.|$|E

In weatherseals, TPV {{is used as a}} lightweight alternative to thermoset rubber materials in semi-dynamic and static parts, while in underhood and under-car applications it is well-suited for air ducts, tubing, molded seals, grommets, <b>suspension</b> <b>bellows,</b> cable jacketing, plugs, bumpers and many other parts. This is due to its sealing performance and resistance to extreme temperatures, chemical exposure and harsh environments.|$|R

Four project reports serve as examples to characterize the typical approaches the institute is offering in more detail: H. Oppermann discusses in his contribution "Improvement of the accuracy of analytical life prediction for metal components considering loading sequence effects" the influence of the order of load events on the fatigue process. As a result, characteristic functions - depending on the shape of specimen and load - are derived and integrated into an existing procedure for life prediction. Subject of the paper "Static and dynamic behavior of elastomer components under large deformations" by U. -J. GÃ¶rke are various phenomena which are typical for elastomers, th e experimental identification of material parameters for appropriate material models and their implementation in finite element codes. A life prediction method is briefly outlined based on a combination of experimental results of test specimens under oscillating loads and finite element calculations. G. Fischer and V. Grubisic deal with a procedure to derive artificial load sequences based on service measurements of commercial vehicles. These loads are used in a test rig to simulate realistic stresses and strains in the air <b>bellow</b> of pneumatic <b>suspension</b> systems. Finally, H. Kaufmann and C. M. Sonsino in a contribution "Accuracy of life prediction of a steering knuckle based on a local stress concept" discuss divergent results of numerical life time predictions of a real steering knuckle under operational loading, using several state-of-the-art procedures based on results from specimens testing. None of the 6 investigated methods led to a sufficient quality of the prediction, so that t he authors recommend to apply those methods only for predimensioning purposes and to carry out experiments, if heavy oversizing has to be avoided...|$|R
