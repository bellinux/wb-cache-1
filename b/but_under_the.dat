5|$|Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington {{suggests}} that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur {{some time before}} 1000CE; <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town {{was transformed into a}} Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Prime Minister Menzies {{recommended}} that Playford be bestowed with {{a form of}} honours.

5|$|On December 2, 1896, Earp was {{a last-minute}} choice as referee for a boxing match that the {{promoters}} {{billed as the}} heavyweight championship of the world. Bob Fitzsimmons was set to fight Tom Sharkey {{that night at the}} Mechanics' Pavilion in San Francisco. Earp had refereed 30 or so matches in earlier days, though not under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> older and more liberal London Prize Ring Rules. The fight may have been the most anticipated fight on American soil that year. Fitzsimmons was favored to win, and the public and even civic officials placed bets on the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Saladin {{launched}} his last offensive against Mosul in late 1185, hoping {{for an easy}} victory over a presumably demoralized Mas'ud, but failed due to the city's unexpectedly stiff resistance and a serious illness which caused Saladin to withdraw to Harran. Upon Abbasid encouragement, Saladin and Mas'ud negotiated a treaty in March 1186 that left the Zengids in control of Mosul, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> obligation to supply the Ayyubids with military support when requested.|$|E

5|$|The Lexington-class {{aircraft}} carriers were {{a pair of}} {{aircraft carriers}} built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1920s.

The Treaty, however, allowed two of the unfinished ships to be converted to carriers. They were the first operational aircraft carriers in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II {{in a series of}} annual exercises.|$|E

Again, no substantial efforts were seen by any of Europe's major leaders of the time. This forced the Pope himself to lead a crusade.

5|$|Hershey lost 2–1 in {{overtime}} against Binghamton on October 21. The game {{would have gone}} to a shootout, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> first usage of the AHL's new video replay system at Giant Center, a Senators goal that had been overturned with 6.5 seconds left {{in overtime}} was restored. The Bears were held to a single goal in a second straight game in a 3–1 loss to Connecticut Whale on October 26, but the next day saw their first home win and first shutout victory of the season. They defeated the Albany Devils 3–0 and Holtby, who had been sidelined since the previous week by an upper body injury, made 35 saves. Forward T.J. Syner was recalled from the ECHL's Reading Royals and made his Hershey debut in that game. The Bears finished the month with a 3–2 victory against the Penguins on October 28, marking their first winning streak of the season. Orlov would miss the next four games due to an upper body injury, not returning until November 11.|$|E
5|$|In 1202 the new Bishop of Worcester Mauger {{attempted}} to investigate Norreis's conduct, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> leadership of Thomas of Marlborough the monastic community {{refused to allow}} the bishop to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from episcopal visitation and oversight. According to Thomas, Norreis offered to renounce the abbey's claim to exemption in return for money, but the bishop refused. Norries then fled the monastery, while the monks continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated, a sentence that Norreis was spared. Between early September and mid-October the dispute was heard by three ecclesiastical tribunals, Mauger was supported by Eustace, Bishop of Ely, and Giles de Braose, Bishop of Hereford. The monks and Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting Mauger. As well as these two cases, there was a dispute between the monks and the bishop over the ownership of some properties. The monks and Norreis then obtained the right for their case to be heard by papal judge-delegates, but Mauger objected {{to the fact that}} the appointed judges were all Benedictine monks, and travelled to Rome to appeal.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, the British Secret Intelligence Service Chief of Air Intelligence, Wing Commander F. W. Winterbotham, {{developed}} {{aerial photograph}} techniques {{in collaboration with}} the French. The task was to gather a record of German targets. By the summer, 1939, RAF Bomber Command's No. 2 Group RAF was carrying out this role. However, various problems with standard equipment {{led to the formation of}} specialist formations for this duty. One of the first squadrons to act as a PR (Photographic reconnaissance) unit was No. 212 Squadron RAF, which saw service in the campaigns in Western Europe, in May and June 1940 under Fighter Command's control. However, at the end of that campaign, the Admiralty pressed its case for the need for coastal and sea reconnaissance. With operations now over, owing to the evacuation of northern Europe by the Allies, these reconnaissance operations were given to Coastal Command on 18 June 1940. This included the Interpretation Unit, which analysed photographic evidence. The organisation was called the PRU (Photographic Reconnaissance Unit). It was administered by No. 16 Group RAF, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> operational control of Coastal Command.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's {{political}} fortunes, {{and those}} of the Liberals, revived. Thorpe's personal standing was enhanced when, on 14 March 1973, he married Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose former husband was a first cousin to the Queen. After a series of by-election victories and local government gains, an electoral breakthrough for the party looked plausible when Heath called a general election in February 1974. In that election, with more than six million votes (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals achieved by far their best election result since the Second World War, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> first-past-the-post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats. However, as neither major party won an overall majority, these seats gave Thorpe (whose personal majority in North Devon increased to 11,072) significant leverage. He was briefly in coalition discussions with Heath, who was prepared to give cabinet posts to Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied that there was any serious prospect of agreement, and in March 1974 Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. In the second 1974 general election, in October, Wilson achieved a narrow majority; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 million votes and 13 MPs.|$|E
5|$|Since 1863, Verne {{had been}} under {{contract}} with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who published each of his novels, beginning with Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and continuing {{through the rest of}} his books to form the novel sequence Hetzel called the Voyages Extraordinaires. The arrangement gave Verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> terms of the contract Verne's profits barely earned him a living wage. Verne's fortunes changed markedly in 1874, when the stage adaptation of his novel Around the World in Eighty Days was a smash hit, running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making Verne wealthy as well as famous as a playwright. Adapted with the collaboration of the showman d'Ennery, the play invented and codified the pièce de grand spectacle, an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in Paris throughout {{the last quarter of the}} nineteenth century. Verne and d'Ennery went on to adapt two other Verne novels, The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff, as similarly spectacular plays.|$|E

5|$|The Order {{remained}} in collateral {{branches of the}} family of the Dukes of Jülich and Berg until 1521, when the male line holding the two duchies and the county of Ravensberg became extinct. A daughter, Maria von Geldern, remained to inherit the duchies and the county, <b>but,</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Salic law practiced in the northwestern German states, women could only hold property through a husband or guardian. Consequently, the territories passed to her husband—who was also her distant relative—John III, Duke of Cleves and Mark. The couple had three daughters, one of whom, Ann of Cleves, married Henry VIII of England in 1540, and one son, Wilhelm, who subsequently inherited the duchies and the administration of the Order. The duchies included most of the present-day North Rhine-Westphalia that lay outside the ecclesiastical territories of the Electorate of Cologne and Münster. Wilhelm was known as Wilhelm the Rich.|$|E

The club's youth teams have participated in the Milk Cup and Dallas Cup. The club operates scholarships covering all levels of education. In conjunction with IT Tallaght, they offer third level education to players and have introduced a scholarship scheme that facilitates primary school students through the Junior Certificate cycle.|$|E
