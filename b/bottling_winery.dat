50|$|The typical dosage is 1/4 tsp (1.23 milliliters) {{potassium}} metabisulfite per six-gallon bucket of must (yielding roughly 75 ppm of SO2) prior to fermentation; then 1/2 tsp per six-gallon bucket (150 ppm of SO2) at <b>bottling.</b> Most commercial <b>wineries</b> {{do not add}} more than 30ppm at bottling.|$|R
50|$|Pinot Noir - {{the second}} varietal for which Trisaetum {{is best known}} is Pinot Noir. In all, the <b>winery</b> <b>bottles</b> eight {{different}} Pinot Noirs. The 2008 vintage was named a top selection by both Wine Spectator and Wine Advocate. Beginning in 2011, the winery will also make a vineyard designate Pinot Noir from the Dundee Hills AVA.|$|R
50|$|Firestone Vineyard {{was founded}} {{by members of the}} Firestone family in 1972, as Santa Barbara County’s first estate winery. The winery was {{designed}} by Richard Keith & Associates, architects. The winery is located {{in the heart of the}} rural Santa Ynez Valley near the town of Los Olivos in Santa Barbara County. It includes a barrel cellar, fermentation cellar, crush pad, tasting room and bottling line for full production from the vine to the <b>bottle.</b> The <b>winery</b> is surrounded by 500 acre of estate vineyards. In early 2007, Firestone Vineyard opened a companion winery in Paso Robles, with a focus on small lots of Bordeaux varietals from select local vineyards.|$|R
50|$|Riesling - {{from its}} inception, the winery {{has made a}} strong {{commitment}} to Riesling with four different blocks of Riesling planted in its two estate vineyards. Today, the <b>winery</b> <b>bottles</b> six different Rieslings each year. Trisaetum's 2007, 2008, and 2009 Rieslings were each awarded Editors Choice designations by the Wine Enthusiast Magazine with respective scores of 93, 94, and 93 points on Wine Enthusiast's 100-point scale.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Nevada City Winery produced 5,000 {{cases of}} wines in 1885 from local grapes. In 1990, its production {{was estimated at}} 8,000 cases per year, while in 1998, its production was estimated at 9,000 cases. The <b>winery</b> <b>bottles</b> regional varietals such as syrah and zinfandel. In 1990, it was reported to bottle Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Gewürztraminer, Petite Sirah, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Zinfandel, as well as sparkling wines. Its labels include names such as Alpenglow, Douce Noir, and Rough and Ready Red.|$|R
2500|$|While {{studying}} {{chemical engineering}} at the University of Paris, he met Edmond James de Rothschild, who sent him to Ottoman-ruled Palestine to establish a glass factory which would supply <b>bottles</b> for Rothschild's <b>wineries.</b> Dizengoff opened the factory in [...] Tantura in 1892, but it proved unsuccessful due to impurities in the sand, and Dizengoff soon returned to Kishinev. There he met Theodor Herzl and became his ardent follower, despite having been strongly opposed to the British Uganda Scheme promoted by Herzl at the Sixth Zionist Congress.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} Napa Valley wineries, Sutter Home {{was shut down}} during Prohibition. The winery {{remained}} abandoned until 1948, when it was purchased by John and Mario Trinchero, immigrant brothers from New York City whose family had {{been active in the}} Italian wine business. The Trincheros refurbished the winery and began producing Napa Valley wines, initially scraping by making generic jug wines. For years they operated “mom-and-pop” style, selling to their Napa Valley neighbors, who filled their barrels and <b>bottles</b> at the <b>winery’s</b> back door.|$|R

50|$|The high sugar {{level in}} the must leads to a slower-than-normal fermentation. It may take months to {{complete}} the fermentation (compared to days or weeks for regular wines) and special strains of yeasts should be used. Because of the lower yield of grape musts {{and the difficulty of}} processing, ice wines are significantly more expensive than table wines. They are often sold in half-bottle volume (375 ml) or the even smaller 200ml <b>bottle.</b> New World <b>wineries</b> in particular sometimes bottle 200 ml and 50 ml gift packages.|$|R
50|$|Holy Sepulchre Cemetery is a {{cemetery}} in Hayward, California. It is a Catholic cemetery {{run by the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Oakland, which also operates the Holy Angels Funeral and Cremation Center at the same location.. It was the first Catholic Church-owned cemetery in the U.S. Vineyards planted in 2006 provide grapes for sacramental wine used by the Oakland Diocese. The wine is <b>bottled</b> at Rockwall <b>Winery</b> in Alameda, which also sources grapes from Holy Cross Cemetery in Antioch, and St. Joseph's Cemetery in San Pablo. The cemetery vineyards {{are believed to be}} the only such vineyards in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Benovia Winery is a family-owned {{producer}} of Pinot noir, Chardonnay, and Zinfandel wines in Santa Rosa, California. Founded in 2005 by Joe Anderson and Mary Dewane, Benovia Winery farms three estate vineyards, including the venerable Cohn Vineyard, which total 71.67 acre and {{are located in}} the Russian River Valley AVA and Sonoma County. To supplement the fruit it harvests each year, Benovia purchases additional grapes from the vintner Martinelli. Benovia's winemaker, Mike Sullivan, is also co-owner and general manager of the winery. Benovia wines are produced and <b>bottled</b> at the <b>winery's</b> winemaking facilities in the Russian River Valley AVA. Annual production is approximately 4,000 cases. Benovia wines are sold direct to customers, as well as distributed to restaurants for resale.|$|R
5000|$|The ullage {{level of}} a wine bottle is {{sometimes}} described as the [...] "fill level". This describes {{the space between the}} wine and the bottom of the cork. During the <b>bottling</b> process, most <b>wineries</b> strive to have an initial ullage level of between 0.2-0.4 inches (5-10mm). As a cork is not a completely airtight sealant, some wine is lost through the process of evaporation and diffusion. As a wine ages in the bottle, the amount of ullage will continue to increase unless a wine is opened, topped up and recorked. If the wine is stored on its side, in contact with the cork, some wine will also be lost by absorption into the cork with longer corks having the potential to absorb more wine (and thus create more ullage) than shorter corks.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Tanner {{started working}} {{as on the}} {{bottling}} department, putting wine labels on <b>bottles,</b> at Konocti <b>Winery</b> in Kelseyville. When the winery learned that she had studied chemistry she became a lab technician. She worked there for one year and worked with Andre Tchelistcheff. She was suggested by Tchelistcheff for a job at Firestone Winery. She joined Firestone in 1981 as a winemaker. At Firestone {{she was able to}} improve her skills at wine tasting and in 1984 she started her on consulting firm. Her first client was making wine for The Hitching Post. She {{was one of the first}} winemakers to use Pinot grapes from Bien Nacido Vineyard. In late 2010 she retired from the wine industry. In 2012, Tanner was named winemaker for Sierra Madre Vineyard. At Sierra Madre, she makes Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Pinot blanc wines.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the environmental emissions associated with the production of a typical white wine produced in Sardinia, with particular reference to CO 2 emissions. The main objective is to determine the main environmental impacts of the overall production process and to identify what steps have the greatest level of criticity. MethodsAn attributional and partial Life Cycle Assessment analysis was used with GaBi software. ResultsThe analysis shows that the main problems were the production and combustion of diesel in the viticulture phase, above all during the vine planting phase, and the production of glass bottles in the phase of wine <b>bottling</b> within the <b>winery</b> processes. Conclusions and recommendationsTo overcome these critical points, some suggestions come from the most recent literature, such as the use of biofuels in the first case and the use of lighter bottles in the second. More in-depth analysis is needed to compare these alternatives in order to assess the effective reduction of environmental emissions...|$|R

40|$|Lean {{manufacturing}} and Six Sigma are both {{considered part of}} the business excellence. These techniques have already been implemented successfully in several areas of business in the last decades. In particular, they have been implemented in manufacturing companies due to their improvement on costs reduction, delivery on time and quality product, always thinking in a continual improvement. This work was focused on the bottling process of a wine-making company where these management strategies are not so developed as manufacturing companies. Thanks to Mezzacorona winery there was the possibility to visit and develop a study of the bottling lines, based on data collected and provided by the winery. In order to develop a proposal implementation strategy based on this new philosophy to the company, the bottling lines of the winery were studied from the Lean Six Sigma view. The DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) was the methodology used for the identification of compatible Lean techniques and strategies for the reduction of defects and rejected <b>bottles</b> in the <b>winery.</b> The Lean Six Sigma implementation proposed was supported by an extensive literature of most of the techniques involved in both management philosophies. Afterwards, there was an introductory research of some applications in different phases of the wine-making sector. This overview theory and applications were the pillar for the comprehension of the winery methods. These were explained for developing the best proper proposal strategy. Therefore, the proposal involves all the areas involved with the bottling lines. Thus, the efforts of this work were focused on the minimization of the line wastes such as time, overprocessing, overproduction or defects. As a result, it provided solutions for equipment configurations, standardizing work, collection of data, capability and control of processes and other little changes to achieve the best results...|$|R
40|$|Wine is {{subjected}} to many sources of microbial contamination throughout the wine making process, including {{but not limited to}} fermentation, barrel maturation, <b>bottling,</b> etc. In <b>wineries,</b> sanitation protocols should consider not only the type of microorganisms that need to be challenged, but also the type of surface {{that is going to be}} sanitized, since contact surfaces need to be treated differently according to physical and chemical properties. In the past, chlorinated compounds were used as sanitizers in wine industry, however we now know that they can be involved in the formation of trichloroanisoles (TCA), resulting in wine defects. Chlorine dioxide unlike other chlorinated compounds does not form TCA, or at least at very low levels. However, this research concluded its poor efficacy to sanitize wine barrels, likely due to the organic nature of the barrels. Alternative sanitizers in wine industry also include: sulfur dioxide, peroxyacetic acid, hot water, steam, ozone, etc. On the other hand, Velcorin ® (Dimethyl dicarbonate or DMDC) is currently used as a wine sterilant, however, due to its high disinfection effectiveness against yeast, we investigated its potential as a sanitizer for wine contact surfaces. None of the sanitizers mentioned here have been evaluated under strict controlled and/or standardized conditions (concentration, time, kind of surface, etc.) against common wine spoilage microorganisms. This is of utmost importance for wine industry, since instituted changes should be implemented for the improvement of winery sanitation practices. We evaluated the majority of these sanitizers under both in vitro and in vivo conditions in order to validate their effective parameters. Other sanitizers were only evaluated for their in vitro or in vivo effectiveness, due to regulatory restrictions for the currently unapproved applications. Of all the sanitizers evaluated, steam treatment for 10 minutes and peroxyacetic acid at 200 mg/L for one week exposure were the most effective. During this research, an important observation was made, that Brettanomyces bruxellensis displays unique colony morphology when isolated from different sources. This wine spoilage yeast is known to cause off aromas in wines and the varying colony morphology may suggest varying susceptibilities to sanitizers, depending on morphology type. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
