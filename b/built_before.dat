5|$|Due to such {{regulations}} and law codes, no church was ever {{constructed in the}} history of the Republic of Turkey. All churches in existence today were <b>built</b> <b>before</b> the establishment of the Republic in 1923. A permit for the construction of a Syriac church was granted in December 2012, however, it was refused by the Assyrian community since the land used to be a Latin cemetery.|$|E
5|$|He {{also built}} the Temple of Caesar, the Baths of Agrippa, and the Forum of Augustus with its Temple of Mars Ultor. Other {{projects}} were either encouraged by him, {{such as the}} Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippa's construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him {{in the name of}} others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, Theatre of Marcellus). Even his Mausoleum of Augustus was <b>built</b> <b>before</b> his death to house members of his family.|$|E

The ambition {{to run in the}} Formula Two championship was planned to be financially fuelled by a Liechtenstein driver, Manfred Schurti. These plans only resulted in one of Royale's F2 cars being <b>built</b> <b>before</b> the project was scrapped and Bob King, the head of Royale, left the company.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 is the {{flagship}} of Cunard Line. The ship was constructed for eventual {{replacement of the}} aging Queen Elizabeth 2, the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner <b>built</b> <b>before</b> the construction of Queen Mary 2. Queen Mary 2 had the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) title conferred on her, as a gesture to Cunard's history, by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route.|$|E
5|$|The Evstafi {{class were}} {{a pair of}} pre-dreadnought battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy <b>built</b> <b>before</b> World War I for the Black Sea Fleet.

5|$|The {{earliest}} occupation at La Blanca was {{concentrated in}} the South Group and dates to the Early Classic Period. However, major occupation of the site appears to have begun in the Late Classic Period. Public spaces were covered with white stucco and the first architecture was erected at the site.

5|$|A {{road from}} US 82 to MS 1 was {{constructed}} during 1940, and opened in 1941. The road was unsigned, and was already paved in concrete. It was designated as MS 454 by 1953. By 1999, US 278 became concurrent with US 82 through MS 454's western terminus. A bypass around Greenville has been planned in the 1990s, and construction began in 2008. It was partially <b>built</b> <b>before</b> funding stopped. A bridge for MS 454's future alignment has been built, with no roads connecting to it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} <b>built</b> <b>before</b> it can be re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling {{back to the first}} after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E

5|$|Between 1774 and 1797 {{a series}} of {{enclosures}} {{took place in the}} Brue valley between the Poldens and Wedmore. In 1794 the annual floods filled the whole of the Brue valley. Work by the Commissioners of Sewers led to the 1801 Brue Drainage Act which enabled sections at Highbridge and Cripp's Bridge to be straightened, and new feeder channels such as the North and South Drains to be constructed. In 1803 the clyse at Highbridge, which had been <b>built</b> <b>before</b> 1485, was replaced and moved further downstream.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were <b>built</b> <b>before</b> 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads <b>built</b> <b>before</b> this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel <b>built</b> <b>before</b> 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the building of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
5|$|Old Baltimore Pike is a {{road in the}} U.S. {{state of}} Delaware. The road, known as New Castle County Road 26, runs from Maryland Route 281 (MD 281) at the Maryland state line south of Newark, Delaware and {{continues}} east to Christiana, ending near Delaware Route 1 (DE 1). The road is paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95, Delaware Turnpike) {{to the north and}} U.S. Route 40 (US 40, Pulaski Highway) to the south. The Old Baltimore Pike was <b>built</b> <b>before</b> 1720 and connected Elkton, Maryland to Christiana. It was a turnpike called the Elk and Christiana Turnpike between 1817 and 1838. In the past it served as a major connection between Philadelphia and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Since about 1900, the Black Canyon {{and nearby}} Boulder Canyon had been {{investigated}} for their potential {{to support a}} dam that would control floods, provide irrigation water and produce hydroelectric power. In 1928, Congress authorized the project. The winning bid to build the dam was submitted by a consortium called Six Companies, Inc., which began construction on the dam in early 1931. Such a large concrete structure had never been <b>built</b> <b>before,</b> {{and some of the}} techniques were unproven. The torrid summer weather and lack of facilities near the site also presented difficulties. Nevertheless, Six Companies turned over the dam to the federal government on March 1, 1936, more than two years ahead of schedule.|$|E

5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development was slow and the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were <b>built</b> <b>before</b> it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The Old Baltimore Pike was <b>built</b> <b>before</b> 1720. The {{road was}} known as the Great Road and ran between Head of Elk (now Elkton, Maryland) and Christiana Bridge. It was later known as the Christiana-Elkton Turnpike before {{becoming}} Old Baltimore Pike. This path served as a major connection between Philadelphia and Baltimore in addition to providing access between the shipping area of Christiana Bridge and agricultural areas in northern Delaware, northern Maryland, and southeastern Pennsylvania. In 1723, Welsh Tract settlers pushed for the road to be improved. This road was part of the Washington–Rochambeau Revolutionary Route that was used by the French army during their march from Newport, Rhode Island to Yorktown during the Revolutionary War, passing through the area in September 1781.|$|E
5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the {{draw-down}} continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls in the postwar period. The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient Quarto, which had been <b>built</b> <b>before</b> Nino Bixio, remained in service for another decade.|$|E
