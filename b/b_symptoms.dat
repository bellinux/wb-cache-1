40|$|Primary non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} of {{the liver}} is a very rare malignancy. In this case report, we describe a case of primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) in a 60 -year-old man who presented with lump and pain in the abdomen of 2 months′ duration. The patient had altered liver function, normal serum alfa fetoprotein level (AFP), normal hemogram and bone marrow. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed an ill-defined hypodense mass with specks of calcification involving the liver, suggestive of primary malignant mass of liver. Diagnosis of PHL was established on the cytology smear and confirmed by immunohistochemistry on tissue biopsy. This case demonstrates that PHL {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis of space-occupying liver lesions {{in the presence of a}} normal level of AFP. Fine needle aspiration cytology is a faster and safer diagnostic modality even in such a rare case.

40|$|The {{mobility}} of boron (B), a commonly deficient micronutrient in cotton, {{has been shown}} to be low in the plant phloem. Nevertheless, studies have indicated that cotton cultivars can respond differently to B application. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to compare B absorption and mobility in cotton cultivars grown in nutrient solution. Treatments consisted of three cotton cultivars (FMT 701, DP 604 BG and FMX 993), and five B rates (0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 10. 0, and 20. 0 µmol L- 1). Plant growth and development were monitored for four weeks from the appearance of the first square. The time of onset and severity of <b>B</b> deficiency <b>symptoms</b> varied among cotton cultivars. Initial B uptake of cv. DP 604 BG was lower than of the other cultivars, but a greater amount of available B in the nutrient solution was required to prevent deficiency symptoms in this cultivar.

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} whether brief exposure to information has {{any effect on}} stigmatizing attitudes towards older people with dementia, and how people responded to this medical diagnosis. Methods: 494 adults {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups differentiated by experimental conditions. Group A (control) responded to questions on stigma directly. Group <b>B</b> (<b>symptom)</b> read two vignettes that described the symptoms of two fictitious individuals with dementia, before answering questions on stigma. Group C (label) read the same vignettes which ended with a statement that the person was recently diagnosed with dementia by a physician. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, together with other pre-existing between-subjects factors. Results: Brief exposure to information about dementia led to a statistically significant reduction in stigma (Groups B, C < A), regardless of whether the diagnostic label of "dementia" was included or not. Moreover, lower stigma was reported by persons who knew a relative or friend with dementia, who were younger and more educated, and who thought dementia was treatable. Conclusions: As stigmatizing attitudes toward dementia are still a hindrance to early help-seeking in Asian communities, the findings suggest that community education may play a useful role in alleviating this barrier to early detection and intervention.

50|$|Prior to 1996 MCD {{carried a}} poor {{prognosis}} of about 2 years, due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which may arise {{as a result}} of proliferation of infected cells. The timing of diagnosis, with particular attention to the difficulty of determining the cause of <b>B</b> <b>symptoms</b> without a CT scan and lymph node biopsy, may {{have a significant impact on}} the prognosis and risk of death.

50|$|MCD {{clinical}} features range from waxing and waning mild {{enlargement of the}} lymph nodes with <b>B</b> <b>symptoms</b> to more severe cases involving intense inflammation, widespread enlargement of lymph nodes enlargement of the liver and spleen, vascular leak syndrome with anasarca, fluid collections in the space around the lungs, and fluid collection in the abdomen's peritoneal space, organ failure, and even death. The most common 'B Symptoms' of MCD are high fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Acute episodes can display significant clinical overlap with acute viral illnesses, autoimmune diseases, hematologic malignancies, and even sepsis. Laboratory findings commonly include low red blood cell count, low or high platelet counts, low albumin, high gamma globulin levels, elevated C-reactive protein levels, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibrinogen; positive anti-nuclear antibody, anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies, and anti-platelet antibodies; and protein spilling into the urine, and polyclonal marrow plasmacytosis.

40|$|Canola (Brassica napus L.) and {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.), {{two important}} oilseed crops, {{are sensitive to}} low boron (<b>B)</b> supply. <b>Symptoms</b> of <b>B</b> deficiency are often more severe during the reproductive stage, {{but it is not}} known if this is due to a decreased external B supply with time or an increased sensitivity to low B during this stage. Canola and sunflower were grown for 75 days after transplanting (DAT) in two solution culture experiments using Amberlite (IRA- 743) B-specific resin to maintain constant B concentration in solution over the range 0. 6 - 53 muM. Initially, the vegetative growth of both crops was good in all treatments. With the onset of the reproductive stage, however, severe <b>B</b> deficiency <b>symptoms</b> developed and growth of canola and sunflower was reduced with {{less than or equal to}} 0. 9 and less than or equal to 0. 7 muM B, respectively.
