50|$|In timber framing {{a single}} floor is a floor framed with single set of joists. A double floor is {{generally}} used for longer spans and joists, called bridging <b>beams</b> <b>or</b> <b>joists,</b> {{are supported by}} other beams called binding beams: the two layers of timbers providing the name double floor. In a double floor there may be two sets of joists, one for the floor above {{and one for the}} ceiling below.|$|E
50|$|Home Farm at the Beamish Museum, County Durham, {{contains}} an early 19th-century, semi-octagonal gin gang with sandstone or millstone grit walls and slate roof. The renovated internal roof structure {{is based on}} a traditional space frame truss with its primary plane in line with the tie <b>beam</b> (<b>or</b> <b>joist),</b> and with members fixed between king post and rafters to support the semi-octagonal plan of the roof. There is one main transverse oak tie beam on which the king post of the main truss is based. The king post is in tension to prevent sagging of the horizontal tie beam, so neither the king post nor the tie beam are resting on the mill below. The roof construction is not structurally dependent on the horse mill, or connected with it.|$|R
50|$|In {{architecture}} and in structural engineering, a joist {{is one of}} a series of horizontal members supporting a ceiling <b>or</b> floor. <b>Joists</b> are supported by foundations, wall framing, <b>or</b> <b>beams.</b> <b>Joists</b> are often laid out in repetitive patterns, much like the ribs of a human body. The intent of the use of this type of framing is to span over an open space below the members. When incorporated into a floor framing system, the joists also serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal diaphragm. Joists are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.|$|R
50|$|Track {{lighting}} {{is a method}} of lighting where light fixtures are attached anywhere on a continuous track device which contains electrical conductors. This {{is in contrast to}} directly routing electrical wiring to individual light positions. Tracks can either be mounted to ceilings or walls, lengthwise down <b>beams,</b> <b>or</b> crosswise across rafters <b>or</b> <b>joists.</b> They can also be hung with rods from especially high places like vaulted ceilings.|$|R
50|$|A jetty is {{an upper}} floor {{that depends on}} a {{cantilever}} system in which a horizontal beam, the jetty bressummer, supports the wall above and projects forward beyond the floor below (a technique also called oversailing). The bressummer (or breastsummer) itself rests {{on the ends of}} a row of jetty <b>beams</b> <b>or</b> <b>joists</b> which are supported by jetty plates. Jetty joists in their turn were slotted sideways into the diagonal dragon beams at angle of 45° by means of mortise and tenon joints.|$|E
50|$|Floors may be {{built on}} <b>beams</b> <b>or</b> <b>joists</b> or use {{structures}} like prefabricated hollow core slabs. The subfloor builds on those and attaches by various means particular to the support structure but the support and subfloor together always provides {{the strength of a}} floor one can sense underfoot. Nowadays, subfloors are generally made from at least two layers of moisture resistant ('AC' grade, one side finished and sanded flat) plywood or composite sheeting, jointly also termed Underlayments on floor joists of 2x8, 2x10, or 2x12's (dimensional lumber) spaced generally on 16 in centers, in the United States and Canada. Some flooring components used solely on concrete slabs consist of a dimpled rubberized or plastic layer much like bubble wrap that provide little tiny pillars for the 1/2 in sheet material above. These are manufactured in 2 x 2 ft squares and the edges fit together like a mortise and tenon joint. Like a floor on joists not on concrete, a second sheeting underlayment layer is added with staggered joints to disperse forces that would open a joint under the stress of live loads like a person walking.|$|E

5000|$|In light-frame construction, a trimmer is a timber <b>or</b> metal <b>beam</b> (<b>joist)</b> used {{to create}} an opening around a stairwell, skylight, chimney, and the like.

25|$|There should {{normally}} {{be a fairly}} wide gap between {{the floor and the}} wall to allow for expansion and to allow air to circulate. This is often covered by a skirting board or molding, to make the gap less apparent. It is because the floor is free-standing, rather than connected to walls <b>or</b> <b>joists,</b> that it is also referred to as a floating floor.|$|R

They can be laid out perpendicular to studs <b>or</b> <b>joists</b> and nailed to them, or set vertically against an existing wall surface. The spacing between the strips {{depends on the}} type of finishing material. Wider spacing is typically used behind the heavy boards that support ceramic tiles. Closely spaced strips are needed for thin panelling or plaster. The use of strips with plaster, however, is called either lath and plaster or wattle and daub.|$|R
50|$|Lateral bracing can {{increase}} the capacity of beams. It can be provided by roof <b>joists</b> <b>or</b> <b>beam</b> web stiffeners.

50|$|Because flitch beams are {{significantly}} stronger than wood alone they require less depth than a wood-only beam {{of the same}} strength, are much lighter than a steel beam of the same size, and can still be nailed {{to the rest of}} a wooden structure.

They function as beams to provide support over large spans, such as removed support walls and garage door openings, places where dimensional lumber is insufficient, and also in areas where a heavy load is bearing from a floor, wall or roof above on a somewhat short span where dimensional lumber is impractical. This type of lumber is compromised if it is altered by holes or notches anywhere within the span or at the ends, but nails can be driven into it wherever necessary to anchor the <b>beam</b> <b>or</b> to add hangers for I-joists <b>or</b> dimensional lumber <b>joists</b> that terminate at an LVL beam.|$|R

After the Wang- Harvey set is proved to form a unique complete orthogonal pure mode basis within the contexts of both Euler and Timoshenko <b>beam</b> <b>or</b> plate theories, it is used to partition a mixed mode. Stealthy interactions are found between the Wang-Harvey pure mode I modes and mode II modes in Euler <b>beam</b> <b>or</b> plate theory, which alter the partitions of a mixed mode.
