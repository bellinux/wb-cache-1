40|$|Upper ocean {{responses}} to typhoons {{in the northwestern}} Pacific are studied using historical temperature data obtained from a <b>buoy</b> <b>station</b> (St. 21004, 29 °N- 135 °E) of the Japan Meteorological Agency during 1982 - 2000 and a three-dimensional primitive equation model (the Princeton Ocean Model; POM). In the data period, 25 typhoons which passed through locations, approximately around ~ 200 km to the right or left of the <b>buoy</b> <b>station</b> are analyzed. The typhoons cooled the sea surface by 1. 6 - 4. 3 °C. In particular, several intense, slowly moving typhoons (≤ 4 ms_) showed special-common features of temperature variations; they too much cooled the sea surface water by 3 - 4 °C {{with the passage of}} the typhoons; even after the typhoons, SST cooling states continue long for about 20 days, and the SST minimums reach 1 - 2 days after the typhoon passages; temperatures in the subsurface layers (50 m, 100 m) rapidly increased against the SST decrease 2 - 3 days before the passage of typhoons; near-inertial oscillations frequently occur after the typhoons, especially with amplitudes larger in the subsurface layers than that in the surface. Numerical simulation of an intense, slowly moving Typhoon Abby (August 1983) well reproduces these observed features and shows that the subsurface temperature response beneath a mixed layer to which vertical turbulent mixing is largely extended, crucially depends on a basin-scale stretching or shrinking of water column, directly concerned with isostatic effect (inverse barometric effect), i. e., a significant cooling in the central region of the typhoon due to the stretching (isostatic effect; upwelling), whereas a weak warming in the distant region out of the typhoon due to the shrinking (downwelling). The model shows that the subsurface time-variations of temperature may be roughly expressed by a linear thermal equation, describing the vertical movement of the water column. A striking feature in the model is an existence of a cyclonic eddy (CE) formed in the rear of the typhoon, even though it has not been observed yet. The model postulates that the CE plays largely important role in flow and temperature fields, tracking along the typhoon. A recent conceptual model with vertical mode expansions (Masuda and Hong, 2011) will give a clearly theoretical explanation of the CE as well as temperature response to a typhoon...|$|E

40|$|Coastal bridges {{are exposed}} to severe wave, current and wind forces during a hurricane. Most coastal bridges are not {{designed}} to resist wave loads in such extreme situations, {{and there are no}} existing analytical methods to calculate wave loads on coastal highway bridges. This study focuses on developing a new scheme to estimate the extreme wave loads on bridges for designing purpose. In order to do this, a 2 D wave velocity potential model (2 D Model) is set up for the deterministic analysis of wave force on bridge decks. 2 D Model is a linear wave model, which has the capability of calculating wave velocity potential components in time domain based on wave parameters such as wave height, wave period and water depth, and complex structural geometries. 2 D Model has Laplace equation as general equation. The free surface boundary, incoming and outgoing wave boundary conditions are linearized, decomposed first, and then solved by the finite difference method. Maximum wave forces results calculated by the linear 2 D Model are compared with results from CFD software Flow 3 D that is using Navier Stokes theory up to the 5 th order; and 2 D Model is validated by comparing results with experiment data. A case study is conducted for calculating extreme wave forces on I- 10 Bridge across Escambia Bay, Florida during Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. SWAN model is adapted to investigate the parameters of wave heights and wave periods around bridge sites.

40|$|The Rias Baixas, located to the Northwest of Spain, {{along the}} {{northern}} boundary of the NW Africa upwelling system, {{is one of the}} most important areas of production of seafood in the world. In this area, thousands of commercial mussel platforms produced significant economic benefits for the region. Episodes of oceanic upwelling regulate the dynamics of movement of the Galician estuaries due to its North-South orientation and the summer winds of Northern component. Some species of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are able to produce a toxic substance under specific environmental conditions. This substance is known as domoic acid (DA), and it is the responsible for the Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP), which affects several marine animals and climbs up in the food web causing severe human diseases. In order to avoid this toxicity, shellfish farms are closed temporally, forcing aquaculture and shellfish companies to interrupt its activity carrying out large economic losses. The increasing frequency and intensity of Proliferations harmful algal (HABs) in the area causes great economic losses so the development of systems of forecast should be of great interest for mussel production. The aim of this study is to expose the capability of physical oceanographic data to predict Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms and to link these different oceanographic conditions with chlorophyll a images and cell numbers of Pseudo-nitzschia spp [...] Chlorophyll α images are obtained by means of color algorithms (processed with neural networks) using data from sensors of color as the MERIS (González et al., 2011), while the number of cells of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. are estimated using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (González et al., 2014). The trade-off between these two methods (color algorithms and SVMs) results in an improvement of monitoring and management programs. The study was developed under the framework project Purga de Mar, which pretends to build up a prediction system for Harmful Algae Blooms allowing to take preventive measures in the Rias Baixas before toxicity appears. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to get this prediction, which are a net of sensors of environmental variables located in the study area, and data gathered using color sensor from satellite. These two methods (color algorithms and vector machines support) have been developed in order to evaluate the predictive power improved. The waters of the Rias Baixas are optically complex (case 2 waters), for what have been necessary color algorithms based on neural networks for the calculation of the chlorophyll α. using images from the MERIS sensor. Thus, 15 high resolution images (300 m) covering 670 Km× 670 Km each over the study area were used. Cloudiness and availability were the reasons to use those ones. 228 chlorophyll measures were associated with 15 satellite images with a delay between in situ measures and satellite images of 30 minutes to 4 hours. The first step to create the algorithm is to apply an atmospheric correction and to mask the coast line, clouds, land and invalid pixels using the BEAM software. Two databases of in situ data were used to train neural networks. The first one, the INTECMAR database has chlorophyll a data recorded between 0 and 5 m depth from 2002 to 2004. The second one has chlorophyll α data recorded between 0 and 4 m depth during years 2006, 2007 and 2008. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) cluster algorithm was applied to MERIS reflectance to establish water clusters in order to determine the scope of the developed NNs. The number of clusters (3 clusters) was established as a function of the maximum degree of separation between them. Once the algorithm was developed, each data point was assigned to the cluster according to the maximum value for the membership function. Cluster# 2 reflectance values were higher at lower wavelengths than cluster# 1, while cluster# 3 reflectance values were higher throughout the entire spectrum. Only one of the clusters, cluster # 1, was representative and useful for training Neural Networks. Before estimating chlorophyll a with the algorithm, pixels of clusters# 2 and 3 must be masked. These maps processed with color algorithms can be useful to study oceanographic processes which in turn could be linked to HABs events in the area. In the other side, to predict Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms with SVMs, 1471 registers of meteorological, water quality and cell count data were used. This information was compiled by INTECMAR between 1992 and 2000 in different stations located in the inner and in the outer part of the Rias. SVMs have been used as binary classifiers in presence/absence and bloom/ no bloom models. The dataset was divided in two sets: the training set (80 % of data) and the test set (20 % data). Training consists on a quadratic optimization method with constraints (using LIBSVM libraries). The model just needs two entrance parameters: cost (C) and ɣ of RBF Kernel (Gaussian radial basis function). Different models were created to select the most accurate one models of presence/absence were developed in order to distinguish samples with low abundance (〖 10 〗^ 5 cells/L). Another model B/NB was carried out with only presence samples. Models were developed using four combinations of variables. The model using all the variables showed the best result with overall accuracy value (78. 57) and Kappa value (0. 77) over the test set. Used variables were upwelling index in the last 4 days, temperature, salinity, previous week bloom, previous two week bloom, day of the year and Ria code. All these parameters were linear- scaled before being trained. There are two reasons to choose these parameters: their good fitting and the local predictive models available from the regional meteorological agency (Meteogalicia). Several studies have demonstrated the relationship between upwelling conditions and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms. Through the study of images of chlorophyll a, phytoplankton blooms can be detected, and these can be related to ‘patches’ of Pseudo-nitzschia spp [...] In order to assess the link between oceanographic conditions, chlorophyll maps, phytoplankton blooms and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. recounts, a study was carried out in the Rias Bias during the upwelling cycle in July 2008 (González et al., 2012). Color algorithms were applied to MERIS images in order to deliver chlorophyll maps. Surface temperatures were obtained from MODIS SST maps from the same dates that MERIS and wind measurements observed at a Seawatch <b>buoy</b> <b>station</b> sited in Cabo Silleiro were used to estimate upwelling index. MERIS images obtained during an upwelling event with concentrations up to 5 mg/m^ 3 were mapped. SST maps showed temperature between 16 - 17 ºC and temperature recorded by the buoy decreased about 1 ºC. Similarly, another study with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. measurements was carried out in The Rias Baixas during 2007 - 2009 in order to assess the relationship between phytoplankton blooms, chlorophyll maps and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. ‘patches’ (Spyrakos et al., 2012). In this project MERIS maps show zones with high chlorophyll a levels where the highest Pseudo-nizschia spp. concentrations were recorded. This project manifests the importance of both tools (color algorithms and SVMs) to predict Pseudo-nitzschia spp. blooms. Estimation of chlorophyll linked to oceanographic features can be helpful in tracking ‘patches’ of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. since remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring, detecting phytoplankton blooms and their spatial distribution. SVMs have improved the capability to predict HABs since they use variables that can be operationally monitored in short or long term depending on the capability prediction (Meteogalicia or Puertos del Estado). Synergy between these two techniques has been proved to be a great tool in order to achieve an understanding of the dynamics of blooms and in order to get a better approach to bloom probability. Early detection systems have been proved to be the best tool in managing this kind of disasters. With the goal of improving Bloom prediction and detection, an oceanic modeling system was required to allow real-time forecasting Pseudo-nizschia spp. In order to improve forecasting systems include several lines of action in the future: the use of systems of automatic data located in the areas of production of mussels, the use of variables related to nutrients and data of detected domoic acid in the samples and the use of HF sensor data for a greater understanding of the surface dynamics of the estuary...|$|E

The system consists of the following components: - A master module S located 4 m above ground {{at the bottom of the}} hydrological string ("Hydra", carrying, apart from S, other dedicated devices for measurement of water parameters). - Three battery powered transponders M i (upgraded to six in the mean time) placed at a distance o [...] ...|$|R

Later uses included harvesting the island's timber, as a fishing station, as a residence for the keepers of Boston Light, and as a rabbit run. Once {{the home of the}} Lovells Island Range Lights, the island was a <b>buoy</b> tending <b>station</b> in the early 20th century and was fortified before and during World War I, with remains of Fort Standish, active 1902-1946, still visible.|$|R
40|$|A coastal air-ocean coupled system (CAOCS) that {{includes}} the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) as the oceanic component and the Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU/NCAR) Mesoscale Model Fifth Generation (MM 5) as the atmospheric component was developed for the East Asian Marginal Seas (EAMS) â a littoral environment that is a common operating area for the United States Navy (USN). CAOCS output verified against surface wind data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and sea surface temperature (SST) /Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data collected from <b>buoy</b> <b>stations.</b> CAOCS output clearly shows the significance of atmospheric and oceanic mesoscale features and their associated airsea interaction processes such as coastal upwelling, Ekman transport, and enhancement of upward vertical motion during cyclogenesis. These mesoscale features and air-sea interaction processes occur during periods prior to summer monsoon onset as well as during time periods following summer monsoon onset. The study provides support that CAOCS does perform well in forecasting EAMS surface current circulation, SST/SSS structure, surface wind stress, and low- level atmospheric structure. Some weaknesses of CAOCS were identified that will aid in future improvement of the model. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
40|$|The local {{equilibrium}} {{between the}} wind and wind waves, which is defined by a range of the coefficient of the 3 / 2 -power law between the non-dimensional significant wave height and period, is statistically investigated by using wind and wave data obtained at four ocean data <b>buoy</b> <b>stations</b> in the seas near Japan. The friction velocity is calculated from the wind speed measured at one height together with the significant wave period by using formulas of the wave dependent drag coefficient proposed by Toba et al. (1990). The data for small waves or for weak winds indicate that the waves do not satisfy the criterion for the local equilibrium, because they may be affected by changing winds or remotely generated swells. In the seas near Japan, the data which satisfy the local equilibrium are about 6 % through a year. Otherwise swells are dominant in most situations. Changing winds also cause deviations from the local equilibrium. The degree of satisfaction of the local equilibrium can be classified by ranges of the significant wave height. As the significant wave height exceeds 4 m, the local equilibrium is more frequently satisfied. 1...|$|R
