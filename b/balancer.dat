There were also Spanish dancers, a ventriloquist with his character Garlu, magicians, a clown band, a stilt-walking clown, a unicyclist, a balloon-sculpting clown, and two juggling chimney sweeps. A sword <b>balancer</b> was stationed inside the Mediterranean Building.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game <b>balancer.</b> Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
25|$|Freedman's {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Calgary had involved {{the development of a}} process migration subsystem for networks of Sun Microsystems computers. From 1992 - 1994, the company commercialized that work, developing the company's Load <b>Balancer</b> product, which was a versatile system for distributing batch jobs across the increasingly larger networks of computers emerging at that time. Freedman hired Theo de Raadt as FSA's first employee. De Raadt's programming and architecture competence have since been proven in his OpenBSD operating system project, but at the time FSA Corporation was his first job since graduating from the University of Calgary. In January, 1994, the Load <b>Balancer</b> product line was sold to Unison Tymlabs, which needed a UNIX-based product line ahead of its IPO. Unison has since been absorbed via acquisition by IBM, and the load <b>balancer</b> product line is now sold by IBM.|$|E

25|$|Rock {{balancing}} can be {{a performance}} art, a spectacle, or a devotion, depending upon the interpretation by its audience. Essentially, it involves placing some combination of rock or stone in arrangements which require patience and sensitivity to generate, and which appear to be physically impossible while actually being only highly improbable. The rock <b>balancer</b> may work for free or for pay, as an individual or in a group, and their intents and the audiences' interpretations may vary given the situation or the venue.|$|E
25|$|The WRT54GS {{is nearly}} {{identical}} to the WRT54G except for additional RAM, flash memory, and SpeedBooster software. Versions 1 to 3 of this router have 8MB of flash memory. Since most third parties' firmware only use up to 4MB flash, a JFFS2-based read/write filesystem can be created and used on the remaining 4MB free flash. This allows for greater flexibility of configurations and scripting, enabling this small router to both load-balance multiple ADSL lines (multi-homed) or to be run as a hardware layer-2 load <b>balancer</b> (with appropriate third party firmware).|$|E

25|$|In early 1995, Paul Scripko {{joined the}} company as its first VP of Sales. He and Freedman had met at Unison Tymlabs, where he had assumed {{responsibility}} for sales of FSA's Load <b>Balancer</b> product line after its acquisition in 1994. Scripko professionalized FSA's sales machine, and the company immediately began to derive higher revenues from larger customers. Also around this time, Benjamin Freedman (brother of Dan Freedman) began to work part-time as the company's VP of Marketing. Gary Neill was brought on board by Dan Freedman as a management consultant in the Fall of 1995, and remained with the company until its acquisition by McAfee in 1996.|$|E
25|$|FSA Corporation (formerly Freedman, Sharp, and Associates) {{developed}} UNIX and Windows system level {{software for}} security and distributed system {{administration in the}} 1990s. The company provided the underlying technology basis for software offerings by IBM, Symantec, and McAfee. FSA's best known products were its Load <b>Balancer</b> distributed workload management solution, its PowerBroker secure system administration solution for controlling and auditing the power of root on UNIX networks, and its CipherLink network encryption solution. The company was acquired by McAfee in 1996. The company was a testing ground for Theo de Raadt's ideas concerning open-source software, {{which led to the}} OpenBSD operating system. De Raadt was FSA's first non-founding employee.|$|E
25|$|The sale of Load <b>Balancer</b> {{left the}} company with staff and cash, but no product. Freedman had {{developed}} and marketed a 3-day UNIX security course in 1992, and had developed significant contacts within the banking, defense, and chip-making communities. These customers all had similar problems in managing large UNIX networks, specifically concerning the control and audit {{of the actions of}} the systems' administrators. The problem was that the root account used by systems administrators when reconfiguring parts of the system, was able to edit any of the audit trails created by the system. Freedman designed a new product, PowerBroker, that was similar in concept to today's sudo products, but which allowed centralized control and auditing of an entire network even down to the keystroke level, with the logs stored on a dedicated remote computer to which the system administrators typically did not have access. By vetting all access and logging through this remote machine, a secure log could be maintained. The system was ported to over 22 versions of UNIX to accommodate the newer, larger networks with hundreds or thousands of machines. Dean Huxley was responsible for most of the system-level programming on PowerBroker with Kevin Chmilar and Earle Lowe also contributing.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”One key {{adaptation}} mechanism often {{deployed in}} networking and computing systems is dynamic load balancing. The goal from employing dynamic load <b>balancers</b> {{is to ensure}} that the offered load would be judiciously distributed across resources to optimize the overall performance. To that end, this paper discovers and studies new instances of Reduction of Quality (RoQ) attacks that target the dynamic operation of load <b>balancers.</b> Our exposition is focused on a number of load balancing policies that are either employed in current commercial products or have been proposed in literature for future deployment. Through queuing theory analysis, numerical solutions, simulations and Internet experiments, we are able {{to assess the impact of}} RoQ attacks through the potency metric. We identify the key factors, such as feedback delay and averaging parameters, that expose the trade-offs between resilience and susceptibility to RoQ attacks. These factors could be used to harden load <b>balancers</b> against RoQ attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study adversarial exploits on the dynamic operation of load <b>balancers...</b>|$|R

From each <b>balancer</b> in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows, and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows. This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers, via water disturbances created by the cilia.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe power {{consumption}} of the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems is an increasing concern as large-scale systems grow in size and, consequently, consume more energy. In response to this challenge, we have develop and evaluate new energy-aware load <b>balancers</b> to reduce the average power demand and save energy of parallel systems when scientific applications with imbalanced load are executed. Our load <b>balancers</b> combine dynamic load balancing with DVFS techniques {{in order to reduce}} the clock frequency of underloaded computing cores which experience some residual imbalance even after tasks are remapped. The results show that our load <b>balancers</b> present power reductions of 7. 5 % in average with the fine-grained variant that performs per-core DVFS, and of 18. 75 % with the coarse-grained variant that performs per-chip DVFS over real applications...|$|R

50|$|Tires are {{balanced}} in factories and repair shops by two methods: static <b>balancers</b> and dynamic <b>balancers.</b> Tires with high unbalance forces are downgraded or rejected. When tires are fitted to wheels {{at the point}} of sale, they are measured again on a balancing machine, and correction weights are applied to counteract the combined effect of the tire and wheel unbalance. After sale, tires may be rebalanced if driver perceives excessive vibration. Balancing is {{not to be confused with}} wheel alignment.|$|R
50|$|Static balance can be {{measured}} by a static balancing machine where the tire is placed in its vertical axis on a non-rotating spindle tool. The spot on the tire with the greatest mass is acted upon by gravity to deflect the tooling downward. The amount of deflection indicates {{the magnitude of the}} unbalance. The angle of the deflection indicates the angular location of the unbalance. In tire manufacturing factories, static <b>balancers</b> operate by use of sensors mounted to the spindle assembly. In tire retail shops, static <b>balancers</b> are usually non-rotating bubble <b>balancers,</b> where the magnitude and angle of the unbalance is observed by looking at the center bubble in an oil-filled glass sighting gauge. While some very small shops which lack specialized machines still do this process, they have been largely replaced in larger shops with machines.|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{characterization}} of an Otx 2 and an Otx 5 orthologue in the urodele Pleurodeles waltl. These two genes, termed PwOtx 2 and PwOtx 5, share highly conserved expression domains with their gnathostome counterparts at tailbud stages, like the developing forebrain (PwOtx 2), or the embryonic eye and epiphysis (PwOtx 5). As in Xenopus laevis, both are also transcribed in the dorsal lip of the blastopore during gastrulation and in anterior parts of the neural plate during neurulation. In addition, PwOtx 5 displays a prominent expression in the developing <b>balancers</b> and the lateral non-neural ectoderm during neurulation, from which they derive. By contrast, PwOtx 2 expression remains undetectable in the <b>balancers</b> and their presumptive territory. These data suggest that PwOtx 5, but not PwOtx 2, {{may be involved in}} the differentiation and early specification of <b>balancers.</b> Comparisons of Otx 5 expression patterns in P. waltland X. laevis embryos suggest that, as previously shown for Otx 2, changes in the regulatory mechanisms controlling Otx 5 early expression in the non-neural ectoderm may occur frequently among amphibians.
