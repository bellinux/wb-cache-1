40|$|International audienceNanobiotechnology {{enables the}} {{emergence}} of entirely new classes of bioactive devices intended for targeted intracellular delivery for more efficacies and less toxicities. Among organic and inorganic approaches currently developed, controlled release from polymer matrices promises utmost clinical impact. Here, a unique nanotechnology strategy is used to entrap, protect, and stabilize therapeutic agents into polymer coatings acting as nanoreservoirs enrobing nanofibers of implantable membranes. Upon contact with cells, therapeutic agents become available through enzymatic degradation of the nanoreservoirs. As cells grow, divide, and infiltrate deeper into the porous membrane, they trigger slow and progressive release of therapeutic agents that, in turn, stimulate further cell proliferation. This constitutes the first instance of a smart living nanostructured hybrid membrane for regenerative medicine. The cell contact-dependent <b>bioerodable</b> nanoreservoirs described here will permit sustained release of drugs, genes, growth factors, etc., opening a general route {{to the design of}} sophisticated celltherapy implants capable of robust and durable regeneration of a broad variety of tissues...|$|E
40|$|Intractable cancer-related pain {{complicated}} by a neuropathic component due to nerve impingement is poorly alleviated even by escalating doses {{of a strong}} opioid analgesic. To address this unmet medical need, we developed sustained-release, <b>bioerodable,</b> hydromorphone (potent strong opioid) - and ketamine (analgesic adjuvant) -loaded microparticles for intrathecal (i. t.) coadministration. Drug-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles were prepared using a water-in-oil-in-water method with evaporation. Encapsulation efficiency of hydromorphone and ketamine in PLGA (50 : 50) microparticles was 26 % and 56 %, respectively. Microparticles had the desired size range (20 – 60 μm) and in vitro release was prolonged at ≥ 28 days. Microparticles were stable for ≥ 6 months when stored refrigerated protected from light in a desiccator. Desirably, i. t. injected fluorescent dye-labeled PLGA microparticles in rats remained in the lumbar region for ≥ 7 days. In a rat model of neuropathic pain, i. t. coinjection of hydromorphone- and ketamine-loaded microparticles (each 1 mg) produced analgesia for 8 h only. Possible explanations include inadequate release of ketamine and/or hydromorphone into the spinal fluid, and/or insufficient ketamine loading to prevent development of analgesic tolerance to the released hydromorphone. As sub-analgesic doses of i. t. ketamine at 24 – 48 h intervals restored analgesia on each occasion, insufficient ketamine loading appears problematic. We will investigate these issues in future work...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerves may be {{severely}} compromised {{as a consequence}} of mechanical trauma, especially when they present a total disruption of the nerve (neurotmesis). The difficulty that we meet during the surgical realignment of the proximal and distal nerve ends are: scar reaction around the nerve, the granulomatous reaction (result of micro-surgically suture), the blood or other material interposition along the regenerated nerve, a careful alignment of both nerve stumps and the tension at the coaptation site that could be created in a large gap. In order to obtain a perfect and functional alignment of neuronal fibres different techniques for bridging defects in peripheral nerve have been developed, in particular the implant of biodegradable polymeric guidance channels has shown considerable results. In this study preliminarily polyurethane-based nerve guide have been realised whit an extrusion system and then filled with specific cell adhesion biomolecules (gelatin and polylisine). This guides have been tested in vitro and in vivo. In particular during in-vivo experiments an accurate electromyography on the rat before the explant and histology of explanted tube were performed. These results have been compared with those obtained using polycaprolactone tubes, that is a <b>bioerodable</b> polymer approved by FDA and used in several commercial products. The results have shown a good regeneration either in vitro and in vivo with an appreciable restore of neural tissue function...|$|E

Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are generally used as first-line treatments {{for patients with}} center-involving DME, {{there is an important}} role for corticosteroids as well. Corticosteroids may be especially useful in pseudophakic patients poorly responsive to anti-VEGF therapies, in patients wishing {{to reduce the number of}} required injections, and in pregnant patients. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been used for many years but is not approved for this indication. An extended-release <b>bioerodable</b> dexamethasone delivery system and an extended-release nonbioerodable fluocinolone acetonide insert have both achieved regulatory approval for the treatment of DME. All intravitreal corticosteroids are associated with risks of cataract progression, elevation of intraocular pressure, and endophthalmitis. There is no current consensus regarding the use of corticosteroids, but they are valuable for selected patients with center-involving DME.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of controlled release drug delivery {{are important to}} the pharmaceutical industry. With a controlled release device, local administration of a drug is possible and release profiles can be created that remain within therapeutic limits for prolonged periods. Made from biodegradable and <b>bioerodable</b> polymers, unwanted side effects and the need of return trips for treatment diminish. However, a usable device must be free of organic solvents normally used to dissolve large drug molecules. Many of these solvents are toxic themselves. Therefore, steps must be taken to either remove residual solvent from the final device or limit their use during synthesis. Ideally, it is desirable to remove the organic solvents from the process entirely. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) {{has been used as a}} replacement for these solvents. Carbon dioxide is inexpensive, environmentally acceptable, and safe for use in human consumables. However, many drug molecules have very low solubility in scCO 2, resulting in extended polymer impregnation times. An organic co-solvent can be used to increase drug solubility, leading to a more efficient polymer impregnation. Using only a small amount of organic co-solvent, a single phase stream is possible that results in significantly increased solubility. This meets the original task of limiting organic solvents in the process and increases efficiency over scCO 2 alone. This study uses supercritical carbon dioxide with ethanol as a co-solvent. Ethanol increases the solubility of ????-estradiol in scCO 2 for impregnation into the glassy polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVPP). Experimental conditions cover a range of temperatures from 40 ????C to 50 ????C and pressure up to 2500 psi. The effect of polymer swelling time on the sorption process is also studied. A dual mode sorption model describes the sorption of drug into the glassy polymer, and a plug flow and stirred tank compartmental model predicts breakthrough profiles. The determined sorption parameters allow analysis of polymer conformation and suggest optimum impregnation conditions...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a {{progressively}} debilitating {{neurodegenerative disease}} {{that affects the}} central nervous system and leads to severe difficulties with body movements. PD occurs due to the selective degeneration of neurons in the region of the brain known as the substantia nigra pars compacta. To date PD remains an incurable disease. Currently prescribed drugs provide only symptomatic relief to patients. Furthermore, they have considerable side effects and are often ineffective in the later stages of the disease or need to be used in combination in order to be effective. The role of neuroprotectants as a preventative measure in PD therapy is consequently receiving {{a great deal of attention}} and is being subjected to extensive research. This study sought to develop a novel prolonged-release drug delivery device for providing site-specific administration of newly researched neuroprotective agents. Nicotine was employed as the model neuroprotectant to incorporate in a novel reinforced crosslinked multiple-unit multi-polymeric drug delivery device. The study was the first of its kind to develop and employ the alkaloid for this purpose in a formulated delivery system. The device was intended to be one that provided zero-order prolonged release of the drug over a period of 1 - 2 months. The device was formulated such that its design was in keeping with the potential for implantation into the substantia nigra pars compacta to provide site-specific drug delivery. In order to do so, polymers, with biocompatible and <b>bioerodable</b> characteristics were selected to incorporate the drug within a reinforced crosslinked matrix. The study elucidated the mechanism of crosslinking of ionotropically crosslinked alginate spheres (gelispheres) with a variety of crosslinking agents through an evaluation of physicomechanical properties of the crosslinked system. The presence of barium in the crosslinked matrices generated densely networked gelispheres which retained their robustness following exposure to hydrating media and displayed promising potential for 4 entrapping drug molecules and retarding their release. The system was reinforced employing hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). A Design of Experiments approach employing a Plackett-Burman screening design enabled optimisation of the proposed device in terms of reinforcing polymers (HEC and PAA) and crosslinking agents (barium and calcium). In order to further attenuate drug release rate the optimised crosslinked gelispheres were exposed to dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) which significantly decreased gelisphere matrix swelling and erosion following exposure to simulated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These gelispheres were thereafter incorporated into a compressed release-rate modulating polymeric discs. Zero-order drug release was observed for a period of 50 days in simulated CSF when the optimised gelispheres were incorporated into compressed poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) discs. Alternative approaches to modify drug release kinetics were also evaluated including the use of PLGA coatings on compressed hydroxypropylmethylcellulose-polyethylene oxide (HPMC-PEO) discs incorporating gelispheres and the use of crosslinked alginate-pectinate gelispheres as carrier systems to deliver PLGA-PLA (polylactic acid) microparticles incorporating drug. A Box-Behnken statistical design was employed to formulate and optimise the drug carrying PLGA-PLA microparticles. In both of the abovementioned cases we obtained sustained zeroorder drug release...|$|E
