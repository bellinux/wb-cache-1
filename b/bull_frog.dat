After <b>Bull</b> <b>Frog</b> Hollow Road, the route proceeds eastward through an area dominated by quarries. VT149 continues on, entering a more open area and passing only a few homes before ending at an intersection with VT30 in Blossom Corners, a small, largely unpopulated community within the town of Pawlet.|$|E

Locally available species such as Indian tree frog (Polypedates maculatus), common Indian toad (Bufo melanasticus), Indian <b>bull</b> <b>frog</b> (Rana tigirina), Indian cricket frog (Limnonectus limnocharis) and Indian pond frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) are exhibited at the Amphibian Centre. A water-recycling system has been introduced to keep the house clean, and plants have been planted inside each tank to add lushness.|$|E

60|$|After {{another day}} devoted {{to rest and}} recovery, the {{expedition}} proceeded upon its way. Some days later it went into camp in a pleasant part of the plain, and the savants sallied forth {{to see what they}} might find. Their reward was at hand. Professor <b>Bull</b> <b>Frog</b> discovered a strange tree, and called his comrades. They inspected it with profound interest. It was very tall and straight, and wholly devoid of bark, limbs, or foliage. By triangulation Lord Longlegs determined its altitude; Herr Spider measured its circumference at the base and computed the circumference at its top by a mathematical demonstration based upon the warrant furnished by the uniform degree of its taper upward. It was considered a very extraordinary find; and since it was a tree of a hitherto unknown species, Professor Woodlouse gave it a name of a learned sound, being none other than that of Professor <b>Bull</b> <b>Frog</b> translated into the ancient Mastodon language, for it had always been the custom with discoverers to perpetuate their names and honor themselves by this sort of connection with their discoveries.|$|E

Two or three scholars sprang forward, flung the low creature head over heels into a corner, and reinstated the patrician, smoothing his ruffled dignity with many soothing and regretful speeches.

6000|$|Night drew on apace, the {{sentinel}} crickets were posted, the Glow-Worm and Fire-Fly lamps were lighted, and {{the camp}} sank to silence and sleep. After {{breakfast in the}} morning, the expedition moved on. About noon a great avenue was reached, which had in it two endless parallel bars {{of some kind of}} hard black substance, raised the height of the tallest <b>Bull</b> <b>Frog</b> above the general level. The scientists climbed up on these and examined and tested them in various ways. They walked along them for a great distance, but found no end and no break in them. They could arrive at no decision. There was nothing in the records of science that mentioned anything of this kind. But at last the bald and venerable geographer, Professor Mud Turtle, a person who, born poor, and of a drudging low family, had, by his own native force raised himself to the headship of the geographers of his generation, said: ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{the creatures}} of the forest held a great {{convention}} and appointed a commission consisting of the most illustrious scientists among them to go forth, clear beyond the forest {{and out into the}} unknown and unexplored world, to verify the truth of the matters already taught in their schools and colleges and also to make discoveries. It was the most imposing enterprise of the kind the nation had ever embarked in. True, the government had once sent Dr. <b>Bull</b> <b>Frog,</b> with a picked crew, to hunt for a northwesterly passage through the swamp to the right-hand corner of the wood, and had since sent out many expeditions to hunt for Dr. Bull Frog; but they never could find him, and so government finally gave him up and ennobled his mother to show its gratitude for the services her son had rendered to science. And once government sent Sir Grass Hopper to hunt for the sources of the rill that emptied into the swamp; and afterward sent out many expeditions to hunt for Sir Grass, and at last they were successful--they found his body, but if he had discovered the sources meantime, he did not let on. So government acted handsomely by deceased, and many envied his funeral.|$|E

50|$|The Hawaiian stilt, {{like many}} of Hawaii's native endemic birds, is facing {{extensive}} conservation threats. In the past 250 years, many animals have been introduced to the Hawaiian islands by Europeans. Primary causes of historical population decline are loss and degradation of wetland habitat, and introduced predators such as rats, dogs, cats, and mongooses. Other causes included introduced plants and fish, <b>bull</b> <b>frogs,</b> disease, and environmental contaminants. Native predators include the pueo, black-crowned night heron and bullfrogs. The Hawaiian stilt was a popular game bird until waterbird hunting was banned in Hawaii in 1939.|$|R

The burglar felt a sad loneliness creeping over him. He tried whistling {{in an effort to}} shake off the depressing effects of this seeming solitude through which he moved; but there remained with him still the hallucination that he moved alone through a strange, new world peopled by invisible and unfamiliar forms--menacing shapes which lurked in waiting behind each tree and shrub.|$|R
