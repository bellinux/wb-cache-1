This solution is alternative to commercial projects of hybrid systems, which store energy in the hydro pneumatic accumulators or the super capacitors. Suggested solution includes designed system of active counterweight, which cooperates with working mechanism of machine. The hydraulic circuit of active counterweight is connected with the boom standard hydraulic system. The counterweight mechanism is homothetic to working mechanism of the excavator. The homothetic transformation applies to kinematical structure and positions of the centres of gravity. The homothetic transformation provides to static unloading of <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> by the connected counterweight cylinder. The possibility of energy saving by using movable counterweight was estimated during tests. The key parameters of hydraulic system, such as: cylinders velocity, working pressure, oil flow and another were measured on prepared research stand. The comparison of power consumption for standard and modification system during the same work cycles allowed confirms the correctness of the suggested concept for energy saving system. Energy saving ratios for modified hydraulic circuit was calculated for different velocity of <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> and payloads. The active counterweight system for low velocity cylinder of excavator mechanism is ready to application. The hydraulic circuit for higher value of <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> velocity requires resize a few elements for example suppl...|$|E

So a compact hydraulic excavator model was built by ADAMS software. The theoretical maximum tool force of excavator was analyzed. For bucket digging mode, the maximum tool force were analyzed for <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> seven positions during the whole working range and the effect of different factors were discussed. The practical maximum tool force was gained. The actual tool force variations were found through the analysis of simulation results. It provides the basis for design and improvement of excavator...|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{displacing}} boom is large-scale motion manipulator. During {{the long}} distance pouring the postures needs to frequently change. This makes the real-time dynamic analysis and health monitoring difficult. Virtual spring-damper {{method is adopted}} to establish the equivalent hydraulic actuator model. Besides <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> joint clearance is taken into account. Then transfer matrix method is used to build the multibody concrete placing boom model by dividing the system into two substructures. Next typical working conditions displacements and accelerations during the pouring process are studied. The results of the numerical method are correct and feasible compared with Recurdyn software and the experimental ones. So it provides reference to the real-time monitoring and structure design for such light weight large scale motion manipulators...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{complete}} dynamic calculation method, the layout, force, {{and strength of}} harvester <b>boom</b> <b>cylinders</b> were designed and calculated. Closed simulations for {{the determination of the}} dynamic responses of the harvester boom during luffing motion considering the cylinder drive system and luffing angle position control have been realized. Using the ADAMS mechanical system dynamics analysis software, six different arm poses were selected and simulated based on the cylinder as the analysis object. A flexible model of the harvester boom luffing motion has been established. The movement of the oil cylinder under different conditions were analyzed, and the main operation dimensions of the harvester boom and the force condition of the oil cylinder were obtained. The calculation results show that the dynamic responses of the boom are more sensitive to the luffing acceleration, in comparison with the luffing velocity. It is seen that this method is very effective and convenient for boom luffing simulation. It is also reasonable to see that the extension of the distance of the bottom of the boom is shortened by adjusting the initial state of the boom in the working process, which can also effectively reduce the workload of the boom—thus improving the mechanical efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} control of hydraulic {{front end loader}} while dealing with unknown external load disturbances {{is the focus of}} this paper. The simulation results obtained show that the type- 2 fuzzy controller is capable of minimizing the position error of a front end loader’s bucket under load variations. This kind of hydraulic system is highly nonlinear due to factors such as leakage and friction. There are uncertainties in this system due to temperature dependence of bulk modulus and fluid viscosity. Such uncertainties together with the load variations cause chattering of the bucket position. Simulation results show for positional error of <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> while varying the load in the bucket and also 50 to 150 % of variation in the nominal value of bulk modulus...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{excavator}} {{energy saving}} {{is important to}} relieve source shortage and protect environment. This paper mainly discusses the energy saving for the hybrid hydraulic excavator. By analyzing the excess energy of three hydraulic cylinders in the conventional hydraulic excavator, a new boom potential energy recovery system is proposed. The mathematical models of the main components including <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder,</b> hydraulic motor, and hydraulic accumulator are built. The natural frequency of the proposed energy recovery system {{is calculated based on}} the mathematical models. Meanwhile, the simulation models of the proposed system and a conventional energy recovery system are built by AMESim software. The results show that the proposed system is more effective than the conventional energy saving system. At last, the main components of the proposed energy recovery system including accumulator and hydraulic motor are analyzed for improving the energy recovery efficiency. The measures to improve the energy recovery efficiency of the proposed system are presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Force {{feedback}} sensors {{are useful}} for the planning of robotic digging trajectories. In particular, when combined with force-control algorithms it becomes possible to sense buried objects and to determine the weight of excavated materials. The proposed force sensor system makes use of hydraulic cylinder pressure and thereby measures machine force indirectly. Successful implementation of such an approach will {{eliminate the need for}} expensive, direct-force sensors. Measurements of pressures in candidate cylinders were compared with laboratory-measured stroke and force. To measure force in every position and during the motion of a backhoe, kinematic, static and dynamic inertial parameters of the bucket, arm and other links have to be considered. From these data a friction model of the hydraulic cylinders can be developed. The present work involves the determination of these friction parameters for an excavator arm using position measures of the bucket and <b>boom,</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressures and the attitude of the excavator boom. Combined, these represent the “dynamic tare ” of system. The work includes a practical approach to filtering regression matrix to do not measure accelerations. The methods allows one to carry out inertial parameters for a full machine, in order to verified design and drawning of costruction machine or to use as input for simulation of machine dynamics...|$|E
40|$|By {{far there}} {{is lack of}} {{research}} on different working conditions between rigid and flexible dynamics of truck mounted concrete pump booms. First a 3 D model has been established by using virtual prototyping technology of a 37 m long boom in Pro/Engineering software. Then the rigid body simulation model has been built. Next modal superimposition method is adopted to change the 4 rigid body booms into flexible ones. Kinematics law and dynamic characteristics of 4 common working conditions had been studied then. Next tip displacement and the first <b>boom</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> force of the 4 working conditions between rigid and flexible models have been researched. Furthermore the first natural frequencies of the structure have been calculated. The {{results show that the}} frequency of the horizontal condition has the lowest of all and the roof condition has the largest of all. Besides the cylinder forces of the flexible model are larger than the corresponding rigid ones because of the flexible boom vibration. Finally an experiment has been done on a boom test rig which proved that the established simulation model is reasonable and the frequency results are correct. All of these provide design reference to mechanical manipulator as well as reducing product development cost of such mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} Atlas Copco Craelius’ {{first step in}} {{incorporating}} numericalmethods in load case analysis during the development process. Atlas Copco needs toconstantly evolve and refine their methods in the design process to remain as thenumber one manufacturer of mining and construction equipment. Poor knowledge ofloads results either in structural failures or in oversized structures, both very costlyfor Atlas Copco. The main goal of this thesis {{is to examine the}} potential in MBS software by using it toidentify extreme load cases in one of Atlas Copco Craelius’ surface drill rigs, Mustang 5. The MBS-software ADAMS View is used to build a model of the Mustang 5 drill rigand evaluate simulation results. The rig model is subject to motions which representreal case scenarios. The feed positioning possibilities are examined thoroughly since it was expected that the positioning has impact on the load levels. 25 different feedpositioning are simulated. The main conclusion is that the load levels are highly dependent on the feedpositioning. For example, the load levels in the <b>boom</b> raising <b>cylinder</b> can increaseseven times, if the rig is operated with the most unfavorable positioning compared tothe recommended. It could also be concluded that not only one positioning isextreme in terms of loads; it depends on which part of the boom system is beingobserved. Thus, several positioning cases have to be taken into consideration in orderto optimize the design of parts in the boom system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the {{traditional}} {{design of the}} working equipment of the hydraulic excavator, its stress distribution was almost determined by adopting the static calculation method, and then its strength was ensured by selecting the safety factor, which is not fully considered because of the dynamic stresses resulting from shocks and vibrations in the operating process of the hydraulic excavator. Based on the finite element analysis software ANSYS, the 3 D models of the main components (boom and bucket rod) of the working equipment for certain type of hydraulic excavator were analyzed. The inherent frequency and the main vibration mode were analyzed by extracting the first 6 -th order modal. The research results show that {{with the increase of}} modal order, the vibrating mode form increased in complexity. The first and the second orders vibrating mode can be both a linear bending deformation or muster within a certain plane individually. From the beginning of the third order, the model deflection begins to become a mutual coupling complex vibrating type which showed multiple orders of bending and torsion deformation. The maximum deflection of boom is concentrated near the ear plate as well as the hinge point connected with <b>boom</b> and oil <b>cylinder.</b> On the other sides, the maximum deflection of bucket rod is concentrated on its middle part. i. e. between the hinge joints of rocker and the ear plate as well as near the rear supporting plate. Therefore, in order to ensure strength and working safety of the working equipment, it is necessary to improve the structure of the maximum deformation. The Modal analysis provides important modal parameters for the corresponding analysis of the boom and bucket rod of the working equipment in hydraulic excavator, and provides a basi...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{power systems}} have been {{extensively}} used in off highway applications like skid steer loaders, wheel loaders, excavators since many years. Work {{has been done by}} both industry and academia to improve efficiency, reduce noise and leakages in these systems. With increasing competition in the market, importance is now also given to operator comfort and machine productivity in off highway applications. ^ Mobile, off – highway vehicles like Skid-steer loaders are widely used in labour saving applications like loading earth into a truck, dig and move material on construction sites to, clean roads, clear snow from roads etc. To carry out these jobs in limited spaces, skid steer loaders need tight turning radius. For this reason, these machines have a short wheelbase which prevents the use of suspensions in these vehicles. The absence of a suspension system exposes the vehicle to ground vibrations of high magnitude and low frequency. Vibrations reduce operator comfort, productivity and life of components. This thesis will discuss control strategies for vibration damping of skid steer loader using the hydraulic <b>boom</b> <b>cylinder</b> as the active suspension element, which is equivalent to a spring–damper. Along with vibrations, the machine productivity is also hampered by material spillage which is caused by the tilting of the bucket due to the extension of the boom. This dissertation will discuss the development of a robust path-planning control algorithm which adapts to the position of the boom to maintain a level load to achieve bucket self-leveling. Another reason for reduced productivity in skid steer loaders is slow in site travel speeds. This dissertation also concentrates on reducing the in-job cycle time by developing a control strategy to smooth speed shift the drive motors keeping the pump flow constant. ^ To synthesize these proposed control algorithms, high fidelity hydraulic and mechanical models of the skid steer loader are created. Ultimately, the control algorithms derived in this dissertation help in improving operator comfort and machine productivity. ...|$|E
