40|$|BackgroundThe California Technology Assessment Forum is {{dedicated}} to assessment and public reporting of syntheses of available data on medical technologies. In this assessment, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was evaluated for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who {{are at high risk}} for complications. Methods and ResultsIn this assessment, 5 criteria were used: Regulatory approval, sufficient scientific evidence to allow conclusions on effectiveness, evidence that the technology improves net health outcomes, evidence that the technology is as beneficial as established methods, and availability of the technology outside investigational settings. In this assessment, all 5 criteria were judged to have been met. The primary benefit of TAVR is the ability to treat AS in patients who would otherwise be ineligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. It may also be useful for patients at high surgical risk by potentially reducing periprocedural complications and avoiding the morbidity and recovery from undergoing heart surgery. Potential harms include the need for conversion to an open procedure, perioperative death, myocardial infarction, stroke, <b>bleeding,</b> <b>valve</b> embolization, aortic regurgitation, heart block that requires a permanent pacemaker, renal failure, pulmonary failure, and major vascular complications such as cardiac perforation or arterial dissection. Potential long-term harms include death, stroke, valve failure or clotting, and endocarditis. As highlighted at the February 2012 California Technology Assessment Forum meeting, the dispersion of this technology to new centers across the United States must proceed with careful thought given to training and proctoring multidisciplinary teams to become new centers of excellence. ConclusionsTAVR is a potentially lifesaving procedure that may improve quality of life for patients at high risk for surgical AVR. However, attention needs to be paid to appropriate patient selection, their preoperative evaluation, surgical techniques, and postoperative care to preserve and improve on the results attained in the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve trial. Specialty societies are collaborating to ensure that this happens in a rational and comprehensive manner...|$|E

The valves allowed propellant to circulate in the propellant feed system lines to achieve proper operating temperature prior to engine start, and were engine controlled.

40|$|Active {{control of}} {{rotating}} stall and surge using <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> {{has been demonstrated}} on low and high speed compressors using high bandwidth actuators. In this paper we provide a method to reduce the bandwidth and rate requirements for control of rotating stall by combining an axisymmetric <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> with continuous air injection. The addition of the continuous air injection is modeled as a shift of both the stable and unstable parts of the compressor characteristic and serves to reduce the requirement of a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> used for rotating stall stabilization purpose.

Introduction Rotating stall and surge {{are two types of}} instabilities that occur in the axial flow compressor part of a gas-turbine engine.

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>valve.</b> The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R

40|$|Feedback {{stabilization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominant issues in modern control theory. The validity of linear control design is based on the assumption that the system is stabilizable. With rapid broadening of control applications to complex systems during the past two decades, the attainability of linear stabilizability sometimes has to compromise with system constraints and affordability of distributed actuation. The goal of this thesis is to tackle some of the problems in control of nonequilibrium behavior and to apply the theory to active control of fluid instabilities in gas turbine engines. We consider two of the simplest nontrivial scenarios in local smooth feedback stabilization: the steady-state case, when the linearly unstabilizable eigenvalue is zero; and the Hopf case, when the unstabilizable eigenvalues are a pair of pure imaginary numbers. Under certain nondegeneracy conditions, we give explicit algebraic conditions for stabilizability. And when the system is stabilizable, the stabilizing feedback can be explicitly constructed. The problem of local smooth feedback stabilization for systems with critical unstabilizable modes is closely related to bifurcation control. Under certain nondegeneracy conditions, a steady-state/Hopf bifurcation can be turned into a supercritical pitchfork/Hopf bifurcation if and only if the system is locally stabilizable at the bifurcation point. Algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which the criticality of a simple steady-state or Hopf bifurcation can be changed to supercritical by a smooth feedback. The effects of magnitude saturation, bandwidth, and rate limits are important issues in control engineering. We give qualitative estimates of the region of attraction to the stabilized bifurcating equilibrium/periodic orbits under these constraints. We apply the above theoretical results to the Moore-Greitzer model in active control of rotating stall and surge in gas turbine engines. Though linear stabilizability can be achieved using distributed actuation, it limits the practical usefulness due to considerations of affordability and reliability. On the other hand, simple but practically promising actuation schemes such as outlet <b>bleed</b> <b>valves,</b> a couple of air injectors, and magnetic bearings will make the system loss of linear stabilizability, thus the control design becomes a challenging task. The above mentioned results in bifurcation stabilization can be applied to these cases. We analyze the effects of magnitude and rate saturations in active stall and surge control using <b>bleed</b> <b>valves</b> and magnetic bearings using the Moore-Greitzer model. The analytical formulas for <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> actuation give good qualitative predictions when compared with experiments. Our conclusion is that these constraints are serious limiting factors in stall control and must be addressed in practical implementation to the aircraft engines...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{compressor}} instabilities in gas turbine engines has received much attention in recent ears. In particular, rotating stall and surge are major causes of problems ranging from component stress and lifespan reduction to engine explosion. In this thesis, modeling {{and control of}} rotating stall and surge using <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> and air injection is studied and validated on a low speed, single stage, axial compressor at Caltech. <b>Bleed</b> <b>valve</b> control of stall is achieved only when the compressor characteristic is actuated, due to the fast growth rate of the stall cell compared to the rate limit of the valve. Furthermore, experimental {{results show that the}} actuator rate requirement for stall control is reduced by a factor of fourteen via compressor characteristic actuation. Analytical expressions based on low order models (2 - 3 states) and a high fidelity simulation (37 states) tool are developed to estimate the minimum rate requirement of a <b>bleed</b> <b>valve</b> for control of stall. A comparison of the tools to experiments show a good qualitative agreement, with increasing quantitative accuracy as the complexity of the underlying model increases. Air injection control of stall and surge is also investigated. Simultaneous control of stall and surge is achieved using axisymmetric air injection. Three cases with different injector back pressure are studied. Surge control via binary air injection is achieved in all three cases. Simultaneous stall and surge control is achieved for two of the cases, but is not achieved for the lowest authority case. This is consistent with previous results for control of stall with axisymmetric air injection without a plenum attached. Non—axisymmetric air injection control of stall and surge is also studied. Three existing control algorithms found in literature are modeled and analyzed. A three—state model is obtained for each algorithm. For two cases, conditions for linear stability and bifurcation criticality on control of rotating stall are derived and expressed in terms of implementation—oriented variables such as number of injectors. For the third case, bifurcation criticality conditions are not obtained due to complexity, though linear stability property is derived. A theoretical comparison between the three algorithms is made, via the use of low—order models, to investigate pros and cons of the algorithms in the context of operability. The effects of static distortion on the compressor facility at Caltech is characterized experimentally. Results consistent with literature are obtained. Simulations via a high fidelity model (34 states) are also performed and show good qualitative as well as quantitative agreement to experiments.
