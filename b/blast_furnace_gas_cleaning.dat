40|$|The Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program (CCT Program) is a $ 7. 14 billion cost-shared industry/government {{technology}} development effort. The {{program is to}} demonstrate {{a new generation of}} advanced coal-based technologies, with the most promising technologies being moved into the domestic and international marketplace. Clean coal technologies being demonstrated under the CCT program are creating the technology base that allows the nation to meet its energy and environmental goals efficiently and reliably. The fact that most of the demonstrations are being conducted at commercial scale, in actual user environments, and under conditions typical of commercial operations allows the potential of the technologies to be evaluated in their intended commercial applications. The technologies are categorized into four market sectors: advanced electric power generation systems; environmental control devices; coal processing equipment for clean fuels; and industrial technologies. Sections of this report describe the following: Role of the Program; Program implementation; Funding and costs; The road to commercial realization; Results from completed projects; Results and accomplishments from ongoing projects; and Project fact sheets. Projects include fluidized-bed combustion, integrated gasification combined-cycle power plants, advanced combustion and heat engines, nitrogen oxide control technologies, sulfur dioxide control technologies, combined SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} technologies, coal preparation techniques, mild gasification, and indirect liquefaction. Industrial applications include injection systems for <b>blast</b> <b>furnaces,</b> coke oven <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems, power generation from coal/ore reduction, a cyclone combustor with S, N, and ash control, cement kiln flue gas scrubber, and pulse combustion for steam coal gasification...|$|R

To derive the influence mechanism of effects of the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speed within the pipeline on the dust deposition laws in the butterfly valve region, a 3 D model of the butterfly valve and its regional flow field is built with Pro/E software. Based on FLUENT module of ANSYS Workbench, along with standard k-ε turbulence model and DPM model, simulation analysis of moving trajectories of dust particles in butterfly valve region under 3 <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speeds is conducted. Results show that the deposition mass of dust particles decreases firstly, then increases with the enlargement of valve plate opening angle under the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speed of 8 m/s, while decreases with the enlargement of valve plate opening under the <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>gas</b> flow speeds of 12 m/s and 16 m/s.
