Đôn later claimed that Khánh would have executed Cẩn anyway, as Cẩn would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to. During the Ngô era, Khánh commanded the ARVN II Corps, which had operated in the Central Highlands under Cẩn's supervision. Despite having helped to arrest Cẩn, Lodge advised Khánh to be restrained in his handling of the case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty.|$|E
5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (Negotiable Instruments), and Article4 (<b>Bank</b> <b>Deposits</b> and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia was {{the country}} {{hardest hit by}} the Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997–98. From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the Indonesian Rupiah to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7% leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country. Efforts by the central bank to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for <b>bank</b> <b>deposits,</b> and set-up the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency to take over management of troubled banks {{in order to prevent}} the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998 which further worsened the contraction of the economy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} interest rate regulation, and subsequent deregulation, on the efficacy of monetary policy and rigidity of retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates in Hong Kong. Using an error-correction model, we find that interest rate deregulation increases the efficacy of monetary policy by improving the correlation between retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and market interest rates and increasing the degree of long-term pass-through for retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates. Our study also shows that the adjustments in retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates are asymmetric and rigid upwards during the regulated period, but tend to be rigid downwards during the deregulated period. The spreads between retail <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and market rates have also tightened sharply after the removal of interest rate controls.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the empirical behavior of conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> {{rates and the}} rate of return on retail Islamic profit-and-loss sharing (PLS) investment accounts in Malaysia and Turkey, using monthly data from January 1997 to August 2010. The analysis shows that conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and PLS returns exhibit long-run cointegration and the time-varying volatility of conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates and PLS returns is correlated and is statistically significant. The pairwise and multivariate causality tests show that conventional <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> rates Granger cause returns on PLS accounts. These findings have policy implications in terms of price stability and financial stability...|$|R

5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
5|$|The CIA {{began to}} {{investigate}} the disappearances of its agents, initially suspecting that bad tradecraft, a Soviet breach of Moscow Station or the CIA's communications, or a mole {{was responsible for the}} disaster. Suspicions fell on spy dust (METKA), a KGB compromise of CIA cables, or new Soviet surveillance tactics, but these probes proved unsuccessful. Ames' conspicuous spending drew the attention of the molehunters in late 1989, but he passed a polygraph test. However, the molehunt regained momentum in 1991 as it received more officers to work on the case. Attention focused on Ames and other suspects, and his finances were investigated once more in 1992; in August, the investigators linked Ames' <b>bank</b> <b>deposits</b> with his meetings with the Soviets. In March 1993, the molehunter unit concluded that there was a KGB mole within the CIA who had followed Howard, and the FBI began close surveillance of Ames, monitoring his office and home, and tracking his car. A June 25 search of his office found about 144 classified documents unrelated to his work; an analysis of his finances found an unexplained $1,326,310; and subsequent searches of Ames' trash and residence found further documents on CIA operations and agents, as well as Ames' own espionage for the KGB. On February 21, 1994, Ames and his wife, Rosario, were arrested by FBI agents: The duo pled guilty to espionage, and the Senate Intelligence Committee requested that the CIA's Inspector General review the case.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the Chinese idea that {{inspired}} the first <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance statute, New York’s Safety Fund law of 1829. It examines the origins of financial collective responsibility in China through to its use by the Imperial Household Department in the management of businesses monopolized {{for the benefit of the}} Qing court. Collective liability among members of the hong merchant guild of Canton, China for the foreign debts of guild members, enforced 1780 - 1842 (the “Canton Guaranty System”), was taken by New York as its example. The study examines the evolution and regulatory practice of the Canton Guaranty System (itself a component of the “Canton System”). The study examines the history of the New York Safety Fund and other American state guaranty funds through to the adoption of national <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance in the United States in 1933. The eighty year history of deposit insurance in t he United States, and the history of <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance as it has expanded worldwide, are briefly sketched. The study argues that the Canton experience, never previously examined, anticipates certain major problems with modern <b>bank</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance.
