2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Cuapa {{began on}} April 15, 1980, in San Francisco de Cuapa, Nicaragua. The Virgin Mary {{repeatedly}} appeared to Bernardo Martinez, a sacristan, {{and according to}} the visionary this began when he saw a strange light emanating from a statue of the Virgin Mary in the parish church. In May, when walking through the fields, he claimed that he saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, who encouraged him to pray the rosary and promote peace saying: [...] "Make Peace. Don't ask Our Lord for peace <b>because,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not make it, there will be no peace". At this time, Nicaragua was going through a civil war. The Sandinista government was facing armed opposition from the Contras. Bernardo Martinez claimed that the Blessed Virgin Mary ordered him to burn bad books, which was interpreted to mean Marxist books. The auxiliary Bishop of Managua complied with this request. Sandinista commentators responded by describing the apparition as [...] "Saint Mary of the Contras", [...] "Our Lady of Oliver North", and [...] "Our Lady of Cuapa". On November 13, 1982, the Bishop of Juigalpa released an official statement as Bishop of the area where the apparitions took place assuring the faithful of the authenticity of the events. In 2005, Silvio Sirias wrote a novel, Bernardo and the Virgin, based on these events.|$|E

Either these poor are of a race essentially different from ours, and unredeemable (which, however often implied, I have heard none yet openly say), or else by such care as we have ourselves received, we may make them continent and sober as ourselves--wise and dispassionate as we are--models arduous of imitation.

Many of the writers had improv training and at one point put together [...] "improv evenings" [...] at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre once a month. Writers on The Colbert Report were predominantly male and white; Colbert acknowledged this lack of diversity, but he contended he had hired writers based solely on the quality of their material and had never looked at the names on writing packets submitted for employment. Subjects considered too dark were not even considered for comedic material; for example, the show would poke fun at press coverage of a tragedy, rather than the tragedy itself. Issues discussed on the show were later reported on actual newscasts, in turn allowing the show to comment on its own impact, creating an echo chamber of sorts. This led Colbert to describe his show, [...] "at its purest expression, as a pebble that we throw into the puddle of the news, and then we report on our own ripples." ...|$|R

She had been working on the film, in which she appeared alongside 101 Dalmatians co-star Mark Williams, for almost 20 years, and aside from starring in it, she co-wrote the screenplay, and produced the film. Close expressed that it became more important for her to make this film to stimulate conversations about transgender issues, [...] "There came a point where I asked, 'Am I willing to live {{the rest of my life}} having given up on this?' And I said, 'No I won't.' Some people will change their point of view, and those who are either too old, or too blinkered, to accept the beauty of difference will just have to 'die off'." [...] In the film, Close played the title role of Albert Nobbs, a woman living her life as a man in 1800s Ireland after being sexually assaulted as a young girl. While the film itself received mixed reviews, Close and Janet McTeer received rave reviews for their performances. Close's performance was noted for being her most subtle and introverted performance yet and a departure from her other roles. She received Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and multiple critics nominations for her performance. Close was asked about the fact of not having an Oscar during the film's awards campaign, for which she answered: [...] "And I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper-ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not, and I have never understood that. <b>Because</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just <b>do</b> the simple math, the amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you're one of five.
