40|$|Accurate {{localization}} of breakdowns in vacuum {{could help}} {{shed light on}} breakdown related processes that are not yet fully understood. At the DC spark lab at CERN, an instrument called the Fixed Gap System (FGS) has been developed partially for this purpose. Among other things, the FGS has four <b>built-in</b> <b>antennas,</b> which are intended for breakdown localization. The capability of {{this aspect of the}} FGS was explored in this report. Specifically, the feasibility of using a method similar to that which is used in cavity Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) was investigated. The usable frequency range of the current experimental setup was also studied. Firstly, a modal analysis of the inner geometry of the FGS was done in HFSS. This showed that the two first modes to be expected in the spark gap quite differ from those of the ideal pillbox – both in field pattern and in frequency (4 and 6 GHz vs. 0. 2 and 3 GHz). Secondly, S-parameters of the system were measured. These showed that the coupling between antennas is weak below 13 GHz, which is due to the high cut-off frequency of the waveguides in which the antennas are located. The breakdown signal was also measured using an oscilloscope connected to the antennas. However, it was determined that the detected signal was picked up from outside of the system, rendering it useless for localization purposes. It was concluded that either a new approach has to be adopted or the current system must be modified...|$|R

The casing of the switchgear was initially used as the ground plane of the antenna sensor, which integrated the sensor into the high-voltage switchgear. The Koch snowflake patch was adopted as the radiation patch of the antenna to overcome the disadvantages of common microstrip antennas, and the feed position and the dielectric layer thickness were simulated in detail. Simulation {{results show that the}} antenna sensor possessed four resonant points with good impedance matching from 300 MHz to 1000 MHz, and it also presented good multi-frequency performance in the entire working frequency band.

Apple later introduced AirPort Extreme, an implementation of 802.11g.

In late 2006, Apple began shipping Macs with Broadcom Wi-Fi chips that also supported the Draft 802.11n standard, but this capability was disabled and Apple did not claim or advertise the hardware's capability until some time later when the draft had progressed further. At the January 2007 Macworld Expo, Apple announced that their computers would begin shipping with Draft 802.11n support. Systems shipped with this hidden capability can easily be unlocked through software, but due to the accounting requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, Apple cannot freely add features to already-sold hardware and so must nominally sell an upgrade.

40|$|RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) is an {{automatic}} identification technique. A fundamental RFID device, often know as an “RFID tag”, {{which is a}} tiny inexpensive chip with <b>built-in</b> <b>antenna,</b> can be attached on an item. By using radio waves, the tag’s presence and its data can be recognised by the RFID reader. RFID technology {{can be used in}} many applications to provide the fast and convenient services. As the tag broadcasts its radio signal to all the dimensions in various distances, this raises the security and privacy concerns such as sniffing and tracking when people carry RFID tagged items. This paper examines the public’s security and privacy awareness towards RFID technology. A total of 365 participants completed the survey. From an analysis of the results in was found that: 55 % of the participants thought that wireless technology is not secure to use although numbers of security mechanisms have already been employed and 75 % of them were worried about the fact that their privacy will be compromised (such as being monitored when they use their wireless devices). What was also found is that 36 % of the participants have heard RFID technology before, and compared this with past consumer survey from 2003, here with an increased 13 % in result, this indicates that there is still a strong need to educate people about the RFID technology to help them familiarise with the technology; furthermore, 67 % of the participants chose their personal privacy over the specialised services which would be provided by the RFID technology, this demonstrates that people were more concerned about their privacy over functionality...|$|E
40|$|GSM {{system is}} 330 mm, {{which is much}} larger than the size of the {{handsets}} currently in use. In other words, the frequency used is much lower given the size of the handset. One of the features of modern mobile phone systems is “low carrier frequency and broad bandwidth,” which makes a major obstacle in the way of antenna development. It is inevitable in general that the radiation characteristics of an antenna degrade as the antenna size reduces or the frequency becomes lower. In particular, “compact size ” and “broad bandwidth ” conflict with each other. Thus, how to downsize an antenna without degrading its bandwidth is the design policy of great interest when designing compact antennas. 2. 2 Complete <b>Built-in</b> <b>Antenna</b> As the handsets saturate in their proliferation and they diversify in functions, the design has emerged as a major element of driving the customers to buy. In contrast to whip antennas that protrude from the casing, built-in antennas that are installed within the casing for proper operation can give a high degree of freedom of design. Not only because of this, but also from the standpoints of reinforcing shock resistance, improvement of specific absorption rate (SAR) on the human body, reduction of manufacturing costs, etc., the requirement for complete built-in antennas for handsets is always growing. Currently planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) accounts for the mainstream of complete built-in antennas 1) ~ 3). PIFA is, like microstrip antenna, a magnetic current antenna featuring low profile necessitating no protrusion into the exterior space. But this type of antenna needs a sufficient volume to secure an appropriate bandwidth of operation, because it basically belongs to the group of narrow bandwidth antennas.
