40|$|International audienceBecause of the {{ever-increasing}} {{traffic and}} quality demands for both internet and television, satellite systems must aim at designs {{that use the}} satellite resources in {{the most efficient way}} possible. In the case of multibeam satellite systems, this is achieved by making optimal use of the plurality of beams in terms of frequency reuse, power allocation, and quality of the layout. That last point is the one addressed in this paper, the optimisation of the <b>beam</b> <b>layout</b> being a complex but crucial task for the resulting telecommunication system since it directly affects its performances and cost. In the case of broadband systems, the key data is the repartition of the traffic demand over the zone to be covered which is never rigorously uniform. Though, it is common for satellite system design tools to rely on this fairly unrealistic assumption to provide regular coverage which is therefore often suboptimal : inappropriate beamwidths, overprovisioned or unsatisfied user stations, unprofitable beams. Nonetheless, one strong advantage of the regular scheme is that it is known to be compatible with the single feed per beam antenna constraint of minimum angular distance for all the couples of beams coming from the same reflector. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a randomized multi-start heuristic to build a non-uniform layout, driven by the different telecommunication mission criteria and by the aforementioned antenna constraint that is dealt with by a graph recoloring procedure via local search and simulated annealing...|$|E

Specifically, starting from simplified yet realistic assumptions on the <b>beam</b> <b>layout,</b> the antenna footprint shape, and the coding /multiplexing/modulation and power control strategies, it is shown that the blind, adaptive, interference-mitigation receiver, selected as an appealing representative of the lot, can indeed boost the system quality of service in terms of outage probability.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a society}} where the demand for {{multimedia}} applications and data exchange is experiencing an unstoppable growth, multibeam systems {{have proven to be}} one of the most relevant solutions for satellite-based communication systems. Though already well represented among the geostationary satellites today, there are still several unresolved design optimization challenges for these complex systems that could lead to improved performances and to better system costs. The satellite platform, the repeater, and the antennas are examples of subsystems that should be designed jointly in order to reach an optimized technical solution that fulfills the service requirements. Traditionally, such complex tasks are addressed through a decomposition of the overall system design into a sequence of smaller decision problems. In this article, we propose to rely on operations research techniques to, on the one hand, take into account explicitly the in-terdependencies of these decomposed problems, and on the other hand, to handle the own constraints of each subsystem and their interactions. In this paper, the focus is laid on the optimization of the beam layouts of the multibeam satellites. Indeed, in addition to being a perfect example of the aforementioned importance of dealing with subsystem constraints, this problem appears early in the chain of design of a multibeam satellite system and is therefore critical for the quality of the telecommunication system: the weaknesses of a <b>beam</b> <b>layout</b> cannot be made up for later on in the system design. For this crucial optimization phase, the strength of the methodology we propose in this paper is to use mixed-integer linear programming to incorporate explicitly technological feasibility constraints of the subsystems involved, while preparing at best the subsequent design problems.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of freeform structures in contemporary architecture raises numerous challenging research problems, {{most of which}} are related to the actual fabrication and are a rich source of research topics in geometry and geometric computing. The talk will provide an overview of recent progress in this field, with a particular focus on discrete geometric structures. Most of these result from practical requirements on segmenting a freeform shape into planar panels and on the physical realization of supporting beams and nodes. A study of quadrilateral meshes with planar faces reveals beautiful relations to discrete differential geometry. In particular, we discuss meshes which discretize the network of principal curvature lines. Conical meshes are among these meshes; they possess conical offset meshes at a constant face/face distance, which in turn leads to a supporting <b>beam</b> <b>layout</b> with so-called torsion free nodes. This work can be generalized to a variety of multilayer structures and laid the ground for an adapted curvature theory for these meshes. There are also efforts on segmenting surfaces into planar hexagonal panels. Though these are less constrained than planar quadrilateral panels, this problem is still waiting for an elegant solution. Inspired by freeform designs in architecture which involve circles and spheres, we present a new kind of triangle mesh whose faces' in-circles form a packing, i. e., the in-circles of two triangles with a common edge have the same contact point on that edge. These "circle packing (CP) meshes" exhibit an aesthetic balance of shape and size of their faces. They are closely tied to sphere packings on surfaces and to various remarkable structures and patterns which are of interest in art, architecture, and design. CP meshes constitute a new link between architectural freeform design and computational conformal geometry. Recently, certain timber structures motivated us to study discrete patterns of geodesics on surfaces. This topic is closely related to the classical geometry of webs.

40|$|Recently {{mechanical}} engineering has extended from a component {{to a system}} oriented approach. The structural analysis of components is now completed by the whole mechanical system simulation using multibody system analysis. This evolution aims at capturing better the real loading conditions accounting for the component interaction and couplings in the system. Structural optimization is continuing along the same tracks. Recent works in structural optimization have tried to optimize components with respect to loadings conditions defined through dynamic loading coming from multibody system dynamic analysis. Generally, optimization techniques consider that the structural component is isolated {{from the rest of}} the mechanism and use simplified quasi-static load cases to mimic the complex loadings in service. In contrast, we have shown in previous works devoted to topology optimization that an optimization directly based on the dynamic response of the flexible multibody system leads to a more integrated approach. In order to overcome the limitations of some previous approaches, a more integrated optimization technique is proposed here, based on the nonlinear finite element approach for flexible multibody systems. The non linear finite element formalism accounts for both large rigid-body motions and elastic deflection of the structural components. In previous work, the optimal design of components was realized as an optimal truss / <b>beam</b> <b>layout.</b> The present communication investigates the optimal design of components considered as a continuum medium. We study first sizing optimal design of structural components and we later extend the method to optimal material distribution approach to address their lay out optimization. The continuum domain is discretized into finite elements. For sizing optimization, the design variables are wall-thickness and lumped element variables. For topology optimization the design variables are classically density-like parameters associated to a power law interpolation of effective material properties for intermediate densities, also known as Simply Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP). This study assesses the feasibility of this approach, which extends optimization techniques to continuum flexible bodies included in MBS. The numerical implementation is conducted in SAMCEF MECANO for the flexible MBS analysis and BOSS Quattro for the optimization shell. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved using a generalized-a time integration scheme while the sensitivity analysis of mechanical responses is based on a direct differentiation method or finite differences. For sizing and parametric optimization the paper investigates and compares several optimization approaches methods such as classical gradient-based methods (SQP, Augmented lagrangian), sequential convex programming methods (CONLIN, MMA), but also surrogate-based optimization method (with Neural Networks) combined with genetic algorithms. The formulation of the problem is also discussed, and its influence on the convergence history is illustrated. Optimal sizing, shape and topology optimization of a simple model of a robot are addressed. The optimization approach is illustrated on numerical applications of sizing optimization of robot arms during trajectory tracking and lightweight layout optimal design of automotive components...|$|E

Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) and Drift Tube Linac (DTL) versions were de-signed in the H 11 (0) - and in the H 21 (0) -mode. The Inter-digital H-type (IH) drift tube structure is efficient for an energy range from 0. 1 to 20 MeV/u, especially in combi-nation with the KONUS <b>beam</b> dynamics <b>layout.</b> At higher <b>beam</b> velocities higher frequencies must be applied for efficient operation, which can be achieved with the CH-structure (H 21 (1) -mode).

This opens the possibility to build superconducting (sc) cavities, which is advantageous for cw operation. In this paper we present two <b>beam</b> dynamics <b>layouts</b> for light ion accelerators with intense beams, using the KONUS beam dynamics design: a) For an International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) the acceleration of a 125 mA Deuterium beam from 2. 5 - 20 MeV/u is required in cw operation. A combi-nation of one rt IH-tank followed by a 175 MHz sc CH-DTL has been considered. b) Several proposals deal with the acceleration of proton beams with currents ranging from a few mA up to 100 mA. Here the sc CH-DTL could cover the medium energy part of the linac from several MeV/u input energies up to about 150 MeV/u. For a 350 / 700 MHz frequency combination a layout is pre-sented, which is oriented on the requirements to the linac of an Accelerator Driven System (ADS) for waste trans-mutation or/and energy production.

Form, structure and fabrication processes are closely linked, {{which makes the}} realization of complex architectural free-form structures even harder. Free-form transparent design today is mainly based on triangularly facetted forms or quadrilateral meshes supported by a structure composed of rectilinear bars, with strong shape restrictions. After {{a brief review of}} the history, we report on some very recent progress in this area. Beginning with a presentation of improved methods for triangle mesh design, we also discuss experiences in coupling triangular glass panels with continuous curved structures, seeking an optimised structural behaviour and simplified connections. Furthermore, we present how the results of research on planar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes lead the way to optimized <b>beam</b> <b>layouts</b> and the breakdown of free-form shapes using planar quadrilateral panels. PQ meshes are rooted in discrete differential geometry, an active area of mathematical research. Using recent projects as examples, we discuss how transparent free-form envelopes with a smooth visual appearance are achievable if the structure is designed to adhere to the limits of current glazing technology and the surfaces are reasonably simple (e. g. rotational, overall developable, or of a small scale). In section 6 we show how the latter restriction can be relaxed: the theoretical and computational methodology for PQ meshes can easily be extended to create nearly smooth approximations of free-form surfaces by single-curved panels. This has a strong impact on glass panelling design, since it avoids expensive double-curvature glass and exploits cold-bending technology.
