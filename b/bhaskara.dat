Other well-known Jain writers were Kalyanakirti (Jnanachandrabhyudaya, 1439), Santikirtimuni (Santinathacharite, 1440), Vijayanna (Dvadasanuprekshe, 1448), Bommarasa of Terakanambi (Sanatkumara Charite, 1485), Kotesvara (1500), Mangarasa III (Jayanripa Kavya), Santarasa (Yogaratnakara), Santikirti (Santinatha Purana, 1519), Doddayya (Chandraprabha Purana, 1550), Doddananka (Chandraprabha Purana, 1578) and Bahubali Pandita of Sringeri (Dharmanathapuranam, 1352).|$|E
5|$|Kalidas {{featured}} fifty songs composed {{and written}} by <b>Bhaskara</b> Das. Film historian S. Theodore Baskaran mentions in his 1996 book, The Eye of the Serpent: An Introduction to Tamil Cinema, {{that all of}} the songs were in Tamil. Birgit Meyer contradicted Baskaran in her 2009 book Aesthetic Formations, stating that the film had Telugu songs, a view that was supported by Sowmya Dechamma in Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit, a {{well-known}} poem (Mahakavya) in 18 cantos called Vikramankadeva Charita by Kashmiri poet Bilhana recounts in epic style {{the life and}} achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Someshvara II. The great Indian mathematician <b>Bhāskara</b> II (born c.1114) flourished during this time. From his own account in his famous work Siddhanta Siromani (c. 1150, comprising the Lilavati, Bijaganita on algebra, Goladhaya on the celestial globe and Grahaganita on planets) Bijjada Bida (modern Bijapur) was his native place.|$|E

5|$|Salva (1550), who was {{the court}} poet of a Konkan prince named Salvamalla, wrote a propagandist work called the Salva Bharata. This was a Jain version of the epic Mahabharata in sixteen parvas (divisions), {{intended}} {{to compete with the}} Vaishnava version of the epic written by Kumar Vyasa in the mid-15th century. Abhinava Vadi Vidyananda of Gerosoppa (1553) wrote Kavya Sara, a 1,143 verse anthology of extracts of subjects written about by earlier poets between 900 and 1430. The text closely resembles an anthology written by Hoysala poet Mallikarjuna (1245), with some additions to account for writings in the post Mallikarjuna era. A staunch Jain and a disputant, Vidyananda argued for the cause of his faith in the Vijayanagara court and other provincial courts. Nemanna (1559) wrote Jnana <b>Bhaskara</b> Charite on the importance of inner contemplation rather than rituals as the correct path towards emancipation.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the age of}} the shatpadi metre, {{although}} only the most skilled of poets, such as Chamarasa, Kumara Vyasa, Kanaka Dasa and <b>Bhaskara</b> used it to the best effect. Mentioned {{for the first time in}} Kannada literature by NagavarmaI in his Chhandombudhi (c.990) and successfully used by the 12th century Hoysala poet Raghavanka, this hexa-metre style suited for narrative poetry found immense popularity throughout the Vijayanagara period. The shataka metre (string of 100 verses) was put to best use by the Veerashaivas who produced most of the didactic writings in this metre, although the Jain poet Ratnakaravarni is the most famous exponent of it. The writings of Ratnakaravarni and Kanaka Dasa in sangatya metre are considered masterpieces from this period.|$|E
5|$|However, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's {{followers}} of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the Hiranyagarbha (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as Rajasuya, Vajapeya and Agnishtoma. An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend Parama Maheshwara (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as Veeranarayana showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had {{the sign of the}} Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name Latana (also known as Rashtrashyena, Manasa Vindyavasini) who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for {{followers of}} Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and <b>Bhaskara</b> (Surya, the sun god).|$|E

25|$|Mathematicians like Brahmagupta (in 628 AD) and <b>Bhaskara</b> I (in 629 AD) made {{contributions}} {{in this area}} as did other mathematicians who followed. In the 12th century <b>Bhaskara</b> II evaluated some of these formulas and critiqued them, identifying their limitations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bhāskara</b> II (1114 – c. 1185) was {{the leading}} {{mathematician}} of the 12th century. In Algebra, he gave the general solution of Pell's equation. He {{is the author of}} Lilavati and Vija-Ganita, which contain problems dealing with determinate and indeterminate linear and quadratic equations, and Pythagorean triples and he fails to distinguish between exact and approximate statements. Many of the problems in Lilavati and Vija-Ganita are derived from other Hindu sources, and so <b>Bhaskara</b> is at his best in dealing with indeterminate analysis.|$|E

25|$|In the 12th century, <b>Bhāskara</b> II {{lived in}} {{southern}} India and wrote extensively on all then known branches of mathematics. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives, the mean value theorem and the derivative of the sine function.

2500|$|In 370 BC, Plato's Parmenides {{may have}} {{contained}} an early {{example of an}} implicit inductive proof.

An opposite iterated technique, counting down rather than up, is found in the Sorites paradox, where it was argued that if 1,000,000 grains of sand formed a heap, and removing one grain from a heap left it a heap, then a single grain of sand (or even no grains) forms a heap.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bhāskara</b> II (1114–1185) was {{the head}} of the astronomical {{observatory}} at Ujjain, continuing the mathematical tradition of Brahmagupta.

He also calculated the time taken for the Earth to orbit the sun to 9 decimal places. The Buddhist University of Nalanda at the time offered formal courses in astronomical studies.|$|E
25|$|NTR {{returned}} to India immediately after his surgery, disputed the claims by <b>Bhaskara</b> Rao and demonstrated his strength by bringing all the MLAs supporting him, {{which was a}} majority in the 294 member assembly, to the Raj Bhavan (Governor's Office). Ramlal did not relent, as a result of which NTR relaunched his Chaitanya Ratham campaign, this time campaigning for the restoration of democracy by mobilizing the support of people and various anti-Congress political parties in the country including the Janata Party (JP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Left Front, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), and the National Conference (NC). During the one-month crisis, the MLAs supporting NTR were secured in a secret place to avoid horse-trading. Due to mobilization of several political parties and the people and due to press, Indira Gandhi, unwillingly removed Governor Ramlal and appointed a Congress veteran, Shankar Dayal Sharma, as the governor of Andhra Pradesh {{to pave the way for}} restoring NTR. Shankar Dayal Sharma removed <b>Bhaskara</b> Rao from power and restored NTR as the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in September 1984.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1984, NTR {{was removed}} from office by the then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Ramlal {{while he was in}} the USA to undergo open heart surgery. His finance minister, Nadendla <b>Bhaskara</b> Rao, a former Congressman who joined the TDP during its inception, was made the Chief Minister by Ramlal.

5000|$|The famous {{astronomer}} Sankara Narayana (the {{author of}} Sankara Narayaniyam, a commentary of <b>Bhaskara's</b> Laghu Bhaskariya) was {{member of the}} royal palace of Sthanu Ravi at Mahodayapuram. It was {{on the basis of}} Sankara Narayaniyam, the date accession of Sthanu Ravi was fixed at 844 AD. Ayyan Atikal Tiruvatikal, the Governor of Venadu (Quilon) under Sthanu Ravi, issued the famous the Terisappalli Copper Plate (849 AD). The inscription describes the gift of land to the Teresa Church near Quilon along with several rights and privileges to Christians led by Mar Sapir Iso.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also showed}} that when a planet is at its {{farthest}} from the earth, or at its closest, the equation of the centre (measure of how far a planet is from the position {{in which it is}} predicted to be, by assuming it is to move uniformly) vanishes. He therefore concluded that for some intermediate position the differential of the equation of the centre is equal to zero. In this result, there are traces of the general mean value theorem, {{one of the most important}} theorems in analysis, which today is usually derived from Rolle's theorem. The mean value theorem was later found by Parameshvara in the 15th century in the Lilavati Bhasya, a commentary on <b>Bhaskara's</b> Lilavati.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bhaskara's</b> {{probably}} most important mathematical contribution concerns {{the representation of}} numbers in a positional system. The first positional representations were known to Indian astronomers about 500 years ago. However, the numbers were not written in figures, but in words or allegories, and were organized in verses. For instance, the number 1 was given as moon, since it exists only once; the number 2 was represented by wings, twins, or eyes, since they always occur in pairs; the number 5 was given by the (5) senses. Similar to our current decimal system, these words were aligned such that each number assigns the factor {{of the power of}} ten corresponding to its position, only in reverse order: the higher powers were right from the lower ones.|$|R
