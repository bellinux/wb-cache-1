2500|$|EA first {{showed the}} game on August 14, in a non-playable beta build of the Xbox 360 version. They {{revealed}} their main design strategy had been [...] "Act like a mobster, think like a Don;" [...] they wanted to enhance the features from the first game, such as extortion methods and shooting, but also include an element whereby the player {{would be able to}} control their entire family on a larger scale. They also revealed Robert Duvall was reprising the role of Tom Hagen from the films and the first game, but, as in the first game, Al Pacino would not be appearing in voice or likeness in the role of Michael Corleone. A major concern for the developers was the behavior of the other families. Whereas in Godfather, the other families were relatively inactive, and simply waited for the player to attack them, in Godfather II, they are more proactive and will attack the player, and each other, on a regular basis. In the first game, once a player took over a business, they couldn't lose that business. However, in Godfather II, the other families are constantly trying to retake businesses from the player. The developers also explained the crime ring bonus system was built using an [...] "under-the-hood" [...] <b>battle</b> <b>card</b> model, whereby different perks are awarded for different rings owned, which determines how the families act. However, they emphasized the card game element only serves {{as the basis for the}} logic system that drives the behavior of the families, it is not actually a part of the game itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{featured}} grudge {{match at}} the event was Kevin Steen wrestling El Generico in a Fight Without Honor, an ROH speciality match with hardcore rules and no disqualifications. The stipulations for the match meant that if Steen lost, {{he would no longer}} wrestle in ROH while if Generico lost, he would have to remove his luchadore mask. Steen and Generico were a tag team dating back to early 2007, up until Final Battle 2009 when Steen, frustrated after losing a tag team match, low-blowed Generico and hit him over the head with a chair. The next week, Steve Corino published a video recording from Japan, where he was wrestling at the time, taking responsibility for Steen's actions, naming him a future World Champion and warning off Generico and Colt Cabana, who came out in defence of Generico at Final Battle. With Generico becoming reclusive and not seeking revenge, Cabana sought it on him behalf in a match at the Eighth Anniversary Show where Corino joined in an assault on Cabana. Generico came to Cabana's rescue but as he went to hit Corino, Steen stood in his way and Generico couldn't bring himself to hit his former partner, giving Steen the chance to punch Generico and lock in a crossface. Despite attacking Generico, Steen had refused to accept any challenge to step into the ring with his former partner, until he was forced into a match at April's iPPV The Big Bang!. In the tag team match, Generico continued to be unable to face his former partner. Cabana and Generico won by disqualification against Corino and Steen when Steen attacked Cabana with a chair repeatedly until Generico finally attacked his former partner and even attacked other wrestlers who attempted to restrain him. Generico challenged the two to a Chicago Street Fight later that month which they won after Cabana made Corino submit.Generico and Steen met in their first singles match at the June iPPV Death Before Dishonor VIII, with Generico demanding the match start as soon as the event began rather than waiting for later in the evening. Steen won their first encounter, while a rematch at Hate: Chapter II saw Generico win by disqualification after hitting Generico with a chair, but Generico gained revenge but putting Steen through a table. At the Glory By Honor IX iPPV, Cabana made Corino submit again in a Double Chain match but after the match Corino's son helped assault the team, finishing with Steen pulling Generico's mask off. Steen later announced he would sell the mask on eBay and on the 15 November episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling challenged Generico to a final match at Final Battle, with Generico's mask and Steen's ROH's contract on the line which Generico, wearing a new all-black mask, accepted. ROH president Cary Silkin later announced it would also be a Fight Without Honor. Three days before the event, ROH officials made the storyline announcement that due to the volatile nature of the rivalry, with Steen having attacked fans wearing Generico masks and much of the venues being used when the two had fought previously that the match would no longer be sanctioned by Ring of Honor and would take place after the official Final <b>Battle</b> <b>card</b> had finished with ROH taking no liability for the match.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Battle</b> <b>Cards</b> are {{collected}} {{in a number of}} ways throughout the game, and the player must organize them into a folder to use for battles. Every time the [...] "Custom Gauge" [...] fills during <b>battle,</b> <b>Cards</b> are called up at random and are selected to use against the enemies. Depending on their arrangement on the screen, certain Cards can be selected together to provide combinations, just like Battle Chips from Battle Network. There are three different classes of Cards ranked by their power and rarity (Standard, Mega, and Giga), and only a certain number of Cards from each class, or a certain number of a specific Card, can be placed into a folder. Other options allow players to set certain Cards as favorites so that by connecting to other players via Wi-Fi, they can use their favorite Cards in a random draw during battles. This implements an element of strategy into planning battles.|$|R
