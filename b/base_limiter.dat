40|$|AbstractFor {{plasma physics}} experiment, the baking of vacuum vessel (VV) {{as well as}} plasma facing {{components}} (PFC) of Steady-state Superconducting Tokamak (SST- 1) is very essential. SST- 1 vacuum vessel consists of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible sixteen sectors in which U-shaped baking channels are embedded on inner surfaces of each of them. Similarly, PFCs are comprised of modular graphite diverters and movable graphite <b>based</b> <b>limiters</b> and stainless steel (SS 304 L) tubes are brazed on the back plate of PFC for baking. Baking of SST- 1 vacuum vessel and plasma facing components are carried out using nitrogen gas heating and supply system. SST- 1 main vacuum vessel is baked at 150 °C by circulating hot nitrogen gas at 250 °C at 4. 5 bar gauge (g) pressure through these U-shaped channels. The plasma facing components (PFC) are baked at 250 °C or more in the similar fashion by passing hot nitrogen gas through these SS brazed tubes. Thermal analysis shows that the temperature of 150 °C at the vacuum vessel is achieved within ten hours if hot nitrogen gas is passed at the ramp rate of 50 °C/h while thermal shields are maintained at 85 K. It is also observed that the baking of either of them at a given temperature could be possible through radiation {{if one of them}} is maintained at desired temperature. The vacuum vessel at room temperature could be baked to 150 °C due to radiation from PFC after 40 hours when PFC alone is baked at 150 °C. The mass flow rate required to bake SST- 1 vacuum vessel at 150 °C is 1. 074 kg/s while that for raising PFCs temperature to 150 °C is 0. 57 kg/s.
