5|$|In February 2009, Manchester City Council {{announced}} that the sculpture would <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> and placed in storage. Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal. The core was sold for scrap in July 2012, while the 180 spikes remain in storage.|$|E
5|$|In a court hearing, Vaseegaran is {{sentenced to}} death for the {{casualties}} and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti <b>be</b> <b>dismantled.</b> Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana before dismantling itself.|$|E
5|$|The English Reformation inevitably {{affected}} St Helen's Church. EdwardVI's 1547 injunction {{decreed that}} all images in churches were to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> or destroyed, including stained glass, shrines, roods, statues and bells, and altars {{were to be}} replaced by wooden tables. Damage during the Civil War was minimal; there are pike marks on the stonework. The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a Royalist stronghold.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War, {{the second}} track <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> for war reparations and the section between Biesenhorst and Karow <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1947.|$|R
50|$|Six {{warehouses}} <b>were</b> <b>dismantled</b> and reassembled at the Springfield, Illinois airport. Numerous wood frame buildings <b>were</b> <b>dismantled</b> so that surplus lumber {{could be}} used for the veterans emergency housing program.|$|R
50|$|On 23 May 2006, {{the crane}} {{on top of}} the tower <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> by a smaller crane, which <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> by a smaller crane that could be taken down the service elevator.|$|R
5|$|The {{walls were}} largely {{maintained}} intact {{during most of}} the Ottoman period, until sections began to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries. Despite the subsequent lack of maintenance, many parts of the walls survived and are still standing today. A large-scale restoration program has been under way since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Acting on {{a report}} in January 2009, the city council {{recommended}} that B of the Bang should <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved {{the replacement of the}} steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Bolliger & Mabillard {{has built}} 112 roller {{coasters}} around the world. The Incredible Hulk and Dragon Challenge, both at Universal's Islands of Adventure, were closed in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Hulk was scrapped {{so it could}} be rebuilt completely in 2016 and Dragon Challenge will <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> so it can be replaced by an unknown coaster in 2019. Lightning at Kuwait Entertainment City is currently closed due to its park being closed for a refurbishment. Some have been relocated and renamed.|$|E
50|$|All armaments plants, {{including}} some {{that could have}} been converted to civilian operation, <b>were</b> <b>dismantled</b> or destroyed. A large proportion of operational civilian plants <b>were</b> <b>dismantled</b> and transported to the victorious nations, mainly France and Russia.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the southeastern}} corner guard tower has survived. To avoid disrupting rail {{service at the}} nearby main train station while the metro was being built, the metro was routed {{away from the city}} walls and the southeastern corner guard tower. Thus the tower survived, along with a section of the Inner city wall. The northeastern tower <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1920 and its {{platform}} in 1953. The northwestern tower was destroyed by Russian cannon fire in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. Its platform <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1969. The southwestern corner guard tower <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1930 {{because of a lack of}} funds for maintenance. Its platform <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1969.|$|R
25|$|Alert <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1875.|$|R
5|$|Construction of both Have Blue demonstrators used {{leftover}} tools {{from the}} C-5 program. Final assembly of HB1001 was originally scheduled {{to end in}} August 1977, before being ground tested until mid-October. The secret roll-out was envisaged to occur on 23October, after which the aircraft would <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> and flown to the test area. On 1September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed machinists went on a four-month strike. A group of managers instead took over the job of assembly, which was completed in six weeks, with ground tests beginning on 17October.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had to be used by the brigade had to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled.</b> Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E

5|$|In February 1940, {{when the}} {{agreement}} was concluded, Lützow was fitting-out in Bremen. Her main battery guns had been transferred to the German army and placed on railway mountings; they had to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> and returned to Bremen. The ship was then towed to Leningrad on 15 April by a private German towing company. The two navies agreed that Germany {{would be responsible for}} naval escort, which included destroyers and smaller vessels. Rear Admiral Otto Feige was placed in command of the operation. Feige then led an advisory commission assigned to assist the Soviet effort to complete the ship.|$|E
5|$|In Russia in 2012, a {{proposal}} from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, {{with the support}} of some members of the governing United Russia party, proposed the removal of all Lenin monuments, {{a proposal}} strongly opposed by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. In Ukraine, during and after the 2013–14 Euromaidan protests, thousands of Lenin statues were damaged or destroyed by protesters who viewed them as a symbol of Russian imperialism, and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> to comply with decommunisation laws.|$|E
5|$|Son of Beast is {{also known}} for two major, non-fatal accidents. In 2006, damage to the track caused one of the trains to stop abruptly. Another setback {{occurred}} in 2009, when a woman claimed to have suffered a head injury. The ride was closed indefinitely, with the only reference of its existence appearing on a tombstone outside the new Banshee coaster (showing a simple logo of the ride and the dates 2000-2009). On July 27, 2012, the closure was made permanent, as Kings Island announced that the roller coaster would <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> and removed from the park.|$|E
50|$|Vashon <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1930.|$|R
50|$|The {{catenary}} <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> {{again after}} the Second World War. Electric train operations ended on 31 March 1946 and all facilities <b>were</b> <b>dismantled</b> shortly afterwards to provide reparations to the Soviet Union. Electrical operations on the line recommenced on 29 May 1959.|$|R
25|$|Shoo Fly <b>was</b> <b>dismantled</b> in 1878.|$|R
5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} the mill in November 1979. The first priority {{was to make the}} mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled,</b> and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{opened in}} 1869 {{and served as}} an {{embarkation}} point for paddle steamer excursions for almost exactly 100 years. Two of the spans collapsed during stress testing in 1970 and demolition was proposed, but local fund raising and heritage grants allowed the pier to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> for restoration and reassembled. It reopened in 1989, and ten years later was awarded the Pier of the Year from the National Piers Society, and a Civic Trust Award. The pier now, once again, offers a landing stage for steamers and is a popular attraction for tourists and anglers.|$|E
5|$|Turgut Reis {{was laid}} up again on 30 October 1918, and was {{refitted}} at the Gölcük Naval Shipyard from 1924 to 1925. After returning to service, {{she served as}} a stationary training ship based at Gölcük. At the time, she retained only two of her originally six 28cm guns. She was decommissioned in 1933 and was thereafter used as a barracks ship for dockyard workers, a role she filled until 1950, {{when she began to}} be broken up at Gölcük. By 1953, the ship had been broken down into two sections, and these were sold to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled</b> abroad. Demolition work was finally completed between 1956 and 1957.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2007, the {{government}} declared it would postpone the demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the Conservancy Association were held. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, {{it was reported that}} after meeting {{the government}}, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first <b>be</b> <b>dismantled,</b> and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.|$|E
5|$|Sporting boycotts of South Africa {{were already}} under way by 1968, but the D'Oliveira {{controversy}} {{was the first to}} have a serious effect on South African cricket. The South African Cricket Board of Control announced its intention to remove racial barriers in South African cricket in 1969, and formally integrated the sport in 1976. Meanwhile, the boycott movement escalated sharply, leading to South Africa's near-complete isolation from international cricket from 1971, though the country continued to play international rugby into the 1980s, twice allowing mixed-race New Zealand rugby teams into the country during the 1970s. D'Oliveira played for England until 1972, and for Worcestershire until 1979. South Africa returned to international cricket in 1991, soon after apartheid began to <b>be</b> <b>dismantled.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will <b>be</b> <b>dismantled,</b> and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E
