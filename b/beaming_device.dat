40|$|Optical <b>beam</b> {{steering}} <b>devices,</b> which {{control the}} propagation direction of light, have diverse applications, including LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), optical wireless communication, optical imaging, and sensing. In all applications, {{there have been}} growing demands for smaller device size, faster scanning speed, and lower power consumption. Among various types of optical <b>beam</b> steering <b>devices,</b> phased-array InP optical <b>beam</b> steering <b>devices</b> have several advantages, such as compact size, fast steering speed above few hundred MHz, and integratability with laser diodes. On the other hand, InP/InGaAsP waveguide device in general suffers from a difficulty in extracting the light {{out of the plane}} efficiently, due to the relatively small refractive index difference between InP and InGaAsP. In this research, we aim to realize efficient and compact phased-array optical <b>beam</b> steering <b>devices</b> on InP. This work consists of two parts. We first design, fabricate, and demonstrate one-dimensional (1 D) optical <b>beam</b> steering <b>device</b> circuits on InP. Then, we develop a novel type of vertical optical coupler having a slanted mirror, which could be used to realize truly two-dimensional beam-steering. The 1 D optical <b>beam</b> steering <b>devices</b> are designed based on the concept of phased array, and its characteristics are calculated by using the beam-propagation method. The designed devices are fabricated by the standard III-V semiconductor optical device process. A far-field optical measurement setup is newly built to characterize the beam-steering function of the fabricated devices. We experimentally demonstrate large steering angle of ± 28 degree as well as low wavelength dependency over wide wavelength range from 1530 nm to 1570 nm. The vertical optical coupler, having a slanted mirror, is designed by using the eigenmode expansion method. The designed optical coupler is then fabricated by C 12 /Ar reactive-ion-etching process with the use of two newly developed Al stages. Using the fabricated structure, we demonstrate efficient vertical coupling with the fiber-to-fiber loss as low as 13. 3 dB. We expect that by integrating the demonstrated coupler structure with the above-mentioned optical <b>beam</b> steering <b>device</b> chip, we could realize wide ranges of vertically emitting beam-steering devices, including the two-dimensional (2 D) beam scanners. 報告番号:; 学位授与日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科・電気系工学専...|$|R
