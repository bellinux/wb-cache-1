50|$|The S1 Montecarlos and Scorpions {{suffered}} from overly <b>boosted</b> <b>brakes,</b> which caused the fronts {{to lock up}} easily in the wet. These were often criticised in reviews; for example Road & Track complained of 'severe front locking and 37% fade' and Motor that they found 'it disconcertingly easy to lock up the front wheels when approaching corners'.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{may be used}} to power, {{or provide}} {{assistance}} to mechanical devices. In hybrid and diesel engine motor vehicles, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the camshaft) is used to produce vacuum. In petrol engines, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the throttle plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to <b>boost</b> <b>braking</b> assistance or improve fuel consumption. This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components: vacuum servo booster for the hydraulic brakes, motors that move dampers in the ventilation system, throttle driver in the cruise control servomechanism, door locks or trunk releases.|$|R
5000|$|BAS Plus with Cross-Traffic Assist: {{can also}} come to the driver's aid {{when there is a}} risk of a {{collision}} with cross traffic at junctions. If this anticipatory system detects a hazardous situation of this type, it prompts the driver to start emergency braking by activating visual and acoustic warnings. If the driver presses the brake pedal too tentatively, BAS PLUS will step in by automatically <b>boosting</b> <b>brake</b> pressure for effective emergency braking, even applying the brakes at full power if necessary. Applying {{just the right amount of}} braking power for the situation at hand maximises the available braking distance for traffic behind. The Cross-Traffic Assist function is operative at speeds up to approx. 72 km/h, while BAS PLUS is able to aid the driver in longitudinal situations at any speed.|$|R
50|$|DISTRONIC PLUS with Steering Assist {{can help}} to keep the vehicle {{centered}} in its lane and track traffic in tailbacks automatically. For the first time, the Brake Assist system BAS PLUS with Junction Assist is able to detect crossing traffic and pedestrians too, and <b>boost</b> the <b>braking</b> power applied by the driver accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the brake}} pedal is applied, the {{movement}} pushes against a small spring which pushes against an air valve thus opening it to allow atmospheric pressure air to {{flow into the}} [...] "supply" [...] chamber of the booster. Once the pedal stops advancing forward, the air valve closes again and can open further to allow more air in for continued <b>boosted</b> <b>braking.</b> Since the pressure becomes higher in one chamber (or [...] "supply" [...] chamber), the diaphragm moves toward the lower pressure chamber (or [...] "vacuum" [...] chamber) with a force created by {{the area of the}} diaphragm and the differential pressure. This force, in addition to the driver's foot force, pushes on the master cylinder piston. When the pedal is allowed to return to rest, the air from the supply chamber escapes to the vacuum chamber and can then flow towards the source of vacuum.|$|R
2500|$|A tank-like vehicle {{called the}} Landmaster {{is used for}} two levels in the game, Macbeth and Titania. Like the Arwing, the Landmaster can <b>boost</b> and <b>brake</b> but it cannot somersault. It can perform a barrel roll, but since it lacks an Arwing's force field, the Landmaster's barrel roll does not reflect enemy fire. Instead, the barrel roll is used to quickly move across the screen. The Landmaster can also [...] a short while.|$|R

A simplehybrid electric vehicle configuration can be obtainedby fitting a starter-alternator unit to an internalcombustion engine (ICE) vehicle. In this wayconsiderable fuel savings and emission reductions canbe achieved, especially in urban driving, by employingstrategies such as start-stop, power <b>boost</b> orregenerative <b>braking.</b> This paper firstly presents therequirements and operating modes of a starteralternatorsystem {{followed by the}} presentation ofdynamic models for simulating the ICE crankingprocess and the generator operation of the system...|$|R
40|$|Iveco {{has started}} {{production}} of new advanced diesel engine Cursor 8 in 1998. In 1999 {{this was followed}} with the new Cursor 10 engine which reaches a maximum power of 316 kW with a displacement of 10, 3 dm 3 and continuous the strategy of developing high BMEP engines which Iveco began more than 10 years ago. This approach shows the benefits of reduced noise, weight and fuel consumption in trucks in comparison to engines having a larger cylinder capacity with the same power. Together with the engine, Iveco introduces an electronic control system with full authority on every operating condition, realising a true drive-by-wire mode of truck operation. The control of fuelling, <b>boosting,</b> <b>braking</b> and cold starting gives the driver full comfort and guarantees that the engine produces optimum performance under every circumstance. An advanced diagnostic system warns about deviations from acceptable operating conditions or fault occurrences. Advanced technologies have been extensively used in the new engine, like variable geometry turbocharger, high pressure unit injectors mechanically driven by an overhead camshaft, decompression brake, fibre filters and advanced casting technologies. It further features 4 valves per cylinder, wet liners and the gear train is arranged {{at the rear of}} the engine. The paper presents, besides the engine design features and performance achievements, the advanced methods employed during the development phase both in Iveco and by suppliers...|$|R

It makes up for this with an unlimited supply of torpedoes which not only damage enemies but also produce bright bursts of light, allowing the player {{to see in the}} ocean depths. [...] The torpedoes can also lock-on to enemies just as the charged up lasers can in the other vehicles. The submersible also has a shot-deflecting barrel roll in addition to <b>boost</b> and <b>brake</b> capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The Learjet 25 utilize {{wheel brakes}} {{as the primary}} method for {{reducing}} speed after landing. The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power <b>boost.</b> The <b>brake</b> valves are controlled via the rudder pedal toe brakes through mechanical linkages. Two shuttle valves in the pressure lines prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the brake system for emergency braking. An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.|$|R
25|$|Commercial {{versions}} {{were called}} Pro in Japan, and were available with either two or five seats (Pro T/F). The Pro {{had to make}} do without <b>brake</b> <b>boost</b> (until the 1985 facelift) and transistorized ignition (lowering power by two horsepower), and were also not available with the five speed manual transmission. The bare-bones Pro also had a manual choke.|$|R
5000|$|Regenerative braking: By {{drawing power}} from MG2 and {{depositing}} {{it into the}} battery pack, the HSD can simulate the deceleration of normal engine braking while saving the power for future <b>boost.</b> The regenerative <b>brakes</b> in an HSD system absorb {{a significant amount of}} the normal braking load, so the conventional brakes on HSD vehicles are undersized compared to brakes on a conventional car of similar mass.|$|R
5000|$|With a few exceptions, the {{gameplay}} in Star Fox 64 3D is {{very similar}} to that of the original version. The player controls Fox's Arwing fighter using the circle pad to steer, the shoulder buttons to bank left and right, and the four right-hand buttons to fire lasers and bombs, <b>boost</b> and <b>brake.</b> The D-Pad allows the player to perform somersaults and u-turns, which can also be performed with combinations of other controls, and to zoom in and out from the Arwing in [...] "All-Range Mode". The player can also enable [...] "Gyro Controls", using the 3DS' internal gyroscope sensor to control the Arwing. Character dialogue, messages and control information are displayed on the touch screen.|$|R
5000|$|The five {{star rating}} system for each race, {{the use of}} primary and {{secondary}} objectives introduced in Asphalt 6: Adrenaline and also used in Asphalt 7 have all been retained in Asphalt 8. Three stars are awarded for finishing in first place, two for second, and one for third. Achieving secondary objectives, such as performing a given number of stunts or knocking down opponents, awards the player with two additional stars. Obtaining stars in an event is cumulative - players who finished first in an event without completing the secondary objectives may replay the race and obtain a five-star rating even if the primary objectives aren't met. The core gameplay is slightly different, however. As the subtitle implies, the focus of Airborne is on jumping, with tracks featuring a lot more ramps than in previous games. In addition to performing standard jumps, the player can also perform flat spins (by drifting onto a ramp) and barrel rolls (by hitting curved ramps). All jumps earn nitro boost; the longer the airtime, the more boost earned. Destroying obstacles such as barriers and lamp posts or hitting traffic cars also earns nitros. Another new feature, which substitutes the [...] "Adrenaline mode" [...] in Asphalt 6 and 7, {{is the ability to}} perform a [...] "Perfect Nitro". When the player hits boost, a small red zone appears in the boost bar. If the player hits boost again when the boost meter is in the red zone, the car will accelerate even faster, with the boost lasting until the player runs out of <b>boost,</b> <b>brakes,</b> crashes or hits a ramp.|$|R
50|$|Albert Dewandre (Liege, Belgium), an {{engineer}} and business owner, was the inventor of servo-brake or brake booster system “Dewandre” in 1927. It is a <b>brake</b> <b>boosting</b> system that uses the depression caused by the suction in the intake manifold of an internal combustion engine to reduce {{the pressure on the}} brake pedal. The advantage of the Dewandre system is twofold: a softer push on the brake pedal, but also a notably shorter braking distance. His invention was manufactured and sold through the Robert Bosch company.|$|R
5000|$|... gradual braking: Regenerative brakes re-use {{the energy}} of braking, but cannot absorb energy as fast as {{conventional}} brakes. Gradual braking recovers energy for re-use, <b>boosting</b> mileage; hard <b>braking</b> wastes the energy as heat, just as for a conventional car. Use of the [...] "B" [...] (braking) selector on the transmission control is useful on long downhill runs to reduce heat and wear on the conventional brakes, {{but it does not}} recover additional energy. Use of [...] "B" [...] constantly is discouraged by Toyota as it may promote excessive wear on certain gears.|$|R
5000|$|Brake Assist detects {{circumstances}} in which emergency braking is required by measuring {{the speed with which}} the brake pedal is depressed. Some systems additionally take into account the rapidity of which the accelerator pedal is released, pre-tensioning the brakes when a [...] "panic release" [...] of the accelerator pedal is noted. When panic braking is detected, the Brake Assist system automatically develops maximum <b>brake</b> <b>boost</b> in order to mitigate a driver's tendency to brake without enough force. In doing so, Brake Assist has been shown to reduce stopping distance by a significant margin (up to 20% in some studies).|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{electrification}} {{has experienced}} a significant growth in recent years, and the electrification of the powertrain - namely hybridization - is considered the most viable solution seen by car manufacturers to achieve the challenging emission targets. Among the hybrid electrical powertrain topologies, the mild-hybrid configuration with the 48 V battery system offers the best ratio cost versus CO 2 improvements. In particular, the 48 V technology does not require electrical shock protection whilst allows to leverage a variety of fuel saving functions such as electrical <b>boost</b> and regenerative <b>braking.</b> The thesis {{is focused on the}} electromagnetic and thermal design of a Belt-driven Starter Generator, BSG, for 48 V mild-hybrid powertrains. In the BSG layout, the starter-generator replaces the conventional alternator with a low impact on the engine compartment layout, even if a redesign of the belt tensioner is required. It is noteworthy {{to keep in mind that}} the electrical machine shall provide high starting torque and wide constant power speed range, both in motor and generator mode. Furthermore, the application imposes the adoption of low cost materials and the electrical machine is located in a harsh environment. As a consequence, the design is challenging from the electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical point of view. The novelties of the research lie in the 48 V automotive applications, by describing the practical difficulties to fulfill the design specifications through a suitable material selection, the identification of the cooling system and the available technological solutions. The first section of the thesis reports results from a literature review on electrical machine for mild-hybrid application aiming to highlight different criteria for the selection of the electrical machine. In this context the advantages in terms of fault tolerance and stator current splitting of multiphase drives are investigated. Furthermore, in this section the required performances and the constraints imposed by the specific application are analyzed. Among the different motor technologies, a dual three-phase induction machine having two stator winding sets shifted by 60 electrical degrees is selected as a suitable candidate. The second part of the thesis reports electromagnetic and mechanical issues addressed during the design stage, with special focus on stator winding layout, pole number and rotor slot. The adopted six-phase machine uses a four-layer bar stator winding that has been demonstrated as a good solution to improve the slot fill factor and thermal behavior. In addition, the thesis reports a comparison supported by experimental tests between open and closed rotor slots solutions; the focus is to maximize the machine electromagnetic performance according to the mechanical limits imposed by the rotating speed. Finally, predicted and measured performance of the prototypes are reported and discussed for validation purposes. The third part of the thesis deals with the thermal assessment of the BSG with particular emphasis on accurate winding temperature prediction as well as the cooling system selection. Since the stator-winding region is very sensitive to thermal issues and is usually attributed as being the main heat source within the machine body, its thermal modeling is of major importance. In these regards, a simplified stator winding thermal model was developed for the temperature prediction during transient condition. Moreover, considering that the driving cycle is characterized by time variable loss distribution, an effective cooling system must be mandatorily adopted together with high temperature class insulation material. In this context, the development of heat extraction through forced convection is experimentally investigated on the BSG prototype. As a main outcome of this research activity, it has been demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed design solution with respect to electromagnetic and thermal requirements...|$|R
