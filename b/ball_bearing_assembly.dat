40|$|The PHOENICS code {{has been}} applied to {{simulate}} the flow of liquid oxygen through the number 4 <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> of the Space Shuttle Main Engine High-Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump. The Body-Fitted Coordinate system capability of PHOENICS was utilized to create a geometrically accurate model. Effects accounted for by the model include the rotation rate of the calculation domain, viscous heating in the liquid oxygen and two-phase effects due to LOX boiling. A separation program was used to account for conduction within a ball bearing element which was coupled with the PHOENICS flow and heat transfer analysis. Solutions have been obtained for the velocity and temperature fields within the LOX coolant and the temperature within the ball element. The predicted ball temperatures indicate that the coolant is boiling in the region near the ball surface...|$|E
40|$|This thesis summarises the design, {{development}} and installation of an automatic industrial in-line quality measuring and control system. The research project was initiated {{by a company}} manufacturing metallic balls for <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly.</b> The diameter tolerance of the components produced determines {{the value of the}} product and the market in which the company trades. Currently this company supplies the medium value market (automotive) and is striving to break into the higher value market (white goods). To do this, two aspects of the production system need be enhanced: 1. 	The frequency at which the product is sampled and 2. 	The level of precision measurement carried out during production. The project caters to both issues with the development of a closed-loop automated measurement system with machine control feedback. The overall objective of this project is to develop a prototype for a two-machine sampling operation and conduct tests and experiments to access the justification for company investment in an automatic sampling and measurement system. The thesis details the design and development of a component retrieval and transfer system, a component management system to normalize ball temperatures and feed the measurement device, an SPC based machine control system and the associated communication network. The design and proving of concepts, in a laboratory, is outlined. The building of the prototype, at the manufacturing plant, is described in detail; as is the rigorous testing and development of the prototype. Finally, the outcomes from this phase of the project are discussed and assessed and recommendations are made regarding the future development of the system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} assembly processes for single-row <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> There are {{two different types of}} assembly processes, which depend on ball numbers and <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> ring designs. In the case of deep groove <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> <b>assembly</b> is usually undertaken through slight deformation of the outer ring to increase clearance for insertion of the final ball. As a result, the outer ring takes an elliptical instead of a circular shape and requires deformation to be below a critical level to avoid fracture. Causal analysis of outer ring fracture during assembly is the main goal of the presented analysis, based on the expressions of the Theory of Elasticity for the thin ring exposed to bending, as well as Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The theoretical and numerical results have been verified by experimental testing...|$|R

The Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Evolution Strategy (ES) will be a reference for the examination and validation of the DE and the SA. The main purpose is to minimize the weight of an assembly system composed of a shaft and two <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Ball</b> <b>bearings</b> link system is used extensively in many machinery applications. Among mechanical systems, designers pay great attention to the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> link system because of its significant industrial importance.

40|$|To prevent hole {{collapse}} during lunar drilling operations, {{a casing}} has been devised of a graphite reinforced polyimide composite {{which will be}} able to withstand the lunar environment. Additionally, this casing will be inserted into the ground in segments two meters long which will penetrate the regolith simultaneously with the auger. The vertical action of the mobile platform will provide a downward force to the casing string through a special adaptor, giving the casing the needed impetus to sink the anticipated depth of ten meters. Casing segments will be connected with a simple snap arrangement. Excess casing will be cut off by a cylindrical cutting tool which will also transport the excess casing away from the hole. A footplate will be incorporated to grasp the auger rod string during rod segment additions or removals. The footplate grasping mechanism will consist of a set of vice-like arms, one end of each bearing threaded to a common power screw. The power screw will be threaded such that one end's thread pitch opposes that of the other end.

40|$|Thrust <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> {{lubricated}} {{with several}} different greases were tested on a modified Four-Ball Machine, where the Four-Ball arrangement {{was replaced by}} a <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly.</b> The friction torque and operating temperatures in a thrust <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> were measured during the tests. At the end of each test a grease sample was analyzed through ferrographic techniques in order to quantify and evaluate bearing wear. A rolling bearing friction torque model was used and the coefficient of friction in full film lubrication was determined for each grease, depending on the operating conditions. The experimental results obtained showed that grease formulation had a very significant influence on friction torque and operating temperature. The friction torque depends on the viscosity of the grease base oil, on its nature (mineral, ester, PAO, etc.), on the coefficient of friction in full film conditions, but also on the interaction between grease thickener and base oil, which affected contact replenishment and contact starvation, and thus influenced the friction torque...|$|R

40|$|The Z- 2 is a {{candidate}} for NASA's next generation spacesuit, designed for a range of possible missions with enhanced mobility for spacewalks both on planetary surfaces and in microgravity. Increased mobility was accomplished through innovations in shoulder and hip joints, using a number of new bearings to allow spacesuit wearers to dip, walk, and bend with ease; all important tasks for a planetary explorer collecting samples or traveling over rough terrain. The Advanced Spacesuit Development Team of NASA Johnson Space Center requested that the NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) perform a series failure simulation tests on three titanium <b>bearing</b> <b>assemblies,</b> an elemental part of the joint construction used in new spacesuit designs. This testing simulated two undetected failures within the bearings and as a result the objective of this test program was to evaluate whether a failed or failing bearing could result in ignition of the titanium race material due to friction. The first failure was an inner seal leak sufficient to pressurize the race with + 99 percent oxygen. The second failure was an improperly installed or mismatched ball port that created a protrusion in the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> race, partially obstructing the nominal rolling path of each <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> When the spacesuit bearings are assembled, <b>bearing</b> <b>balls</b> are loaded into the assembly via a ball port. The ball port is specific and unique to each <b>bearing</b> <b>assembly</b> (matched pair). The simulated mismatched ball port is a significant source of friction, which would be caused by an assembly error. To evaluate this risk, the bearings were cycled in a simulated worst-case scenario environment, with operational loads, and potential flaw conditions.
