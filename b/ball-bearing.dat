25|$|The batsman and bowler are {{spring loading}} {{equipment}} where {{the direction and}} speed of the ball, power, timing and positioning of the batsman's shot can be controlled. The ball is a small metal <b>ball-bearing.</b> The playing field is typically a large green sheet or carpet of cloth which is {{laid out on the}} table, and on which the game is played. The playing field has demarcations for the pitch, as well as zones of 1,2,3 and 4 runs. 10 fielders - besides the bowler - with ball-channeling mouths {{at the base of the}} miniature statuettes can be placed on the field.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} regarding the deflections of new construction of <b>ball-bearings</b> with 35 mm {{the dimension of}} the inner diameter, providing from the standard construction of the 6305 ballbearing. Different constructions were obtained using an algorithm, having another internal geometry, other dimensions of the rings and other number of balls, in the way to obtain higher static or dynamic performances / capacities.

The bearings have a pyramidal arrangement: the upper component, consisting of three ball-bearings arranged in a triangle, rests on a single <b>ball-bearing</b> below. The bearings have deliberate play in them which allows movement in response to the dynamic forces when records are tracked.|$|E
2500|$|A fidget spinner is a toy that {{consists}} of a <b>ball-bearing</b> {{in the center of}} a multi-lobed (typically two or three) flat structure made from metal or plastic designed to spin along its axis with little effort.

2500|$|The Roving Reds was a {{performing}} theatre group {{formed in}} Brisbane in 1933. Many of the performers, playwrights, musicians and production team were {{gathered from the}} unemployment camps set up in several parks around Brisbane. Crawford, otherwise known as 'Anarchy, the <b>Ball-Bearing</b> Bum', was the scriptwriter for the Roving Reds, {{as well as one}} of the founding members of the group. Most of the plays themes centred on the social and political problems associated the depression and war. The topic of Soviet Russia and their workers' state was also popular with the militant unemployed. The play, The Metro Ticket Trial was quite a popular production as the theme of the play was about the 'contemporary press attacks on all aspects of Soviet life'.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{specialized}} bicycle {{tools for}} use {{both in the}} shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a hand pump or CO2 Pump, tire levers, spare tubes, self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated <b>ball-bearing</b> [...] "cones". [...] and sometimes even a block of French chalk.), wrenches, hex keys, screwdrivers, and a chain tool. There are also cycling specific multi-tools that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.|$|E
6000|$|With {{all these}} anxieties I loved {{the school and}} could hardly be wrested from it even for a day. I bent to my books with eagerness, I joined a debating society, and I took a hand at all the games. The days went by on golden, noiseless, <b>ball-bearing</b> axles--and almost before I {{realized}} it, winter was upon the land. But oh! the luxury of that winter, with no snow drifts to climb, no corn-stalks to gather and no long walk to school. It was sweet to wake each morning in the shelter of our little house and know that another day of delightful schooling was ours. Our hands softened and lightened. Our walk became each day less of a [...] "galumping plod." [...] The companionship of bright and interesting young people, {{and the study of}} well-dressed men and women in attendance upon lectures and socials was a part of our instruction and had their refining effect upon us, graceless colts though we were.|$|E

It holds 14 <b>ball-bearings.</b> Each one uses 0.20 mm balls. These <b>ball-bearings</b> are inserted in a platine which is 1.2 mm think. Its frequency is 21,600 Alt/H, and its power reserve is 35 hours. It has 11 jewels. The calibre 1200 (and its automatic version 2000) were built from 1976 to 1979 in the factory that the company Bouchet-Lassale SA had built on 30, rue des Voisins in Geneva, Switzerland.
