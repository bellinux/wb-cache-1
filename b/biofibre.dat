40|$|Abstract Polyurethane {{samples were}} {{prepared}} from rubber seed oil monoglyceride (made by reacting rubber oil with glycerol) and diiosocyanates (hexanethylene and toluene diiosocyanates). Polyurethane composites {{were made by}} compression moulding using biofibres; sisal, jute and banana; in random and unidirectional orientations at different fibre lengths and loadings, as reinforcing elements. The composites were characterized in terms of tensile and flexural strengths and moduli, thermal stability and morphology of fractured surface. The values of the measured mechanical properties (tensile and flexural) of the composites were about 3 -fold higher than {{the properties of the}} unreinforced polyurethane samples, suggesting good reinforcement by the <b>biofibres.</b> The absence of fibre-pull-out on the scanning electron micrographs of the fractured surface provides evidence in support of good adhesion between the <b>biofibres</b> and the polyurethane matrix.

40|$|Fully {{biodegradable}} composites were developed, possessing prominent mechanical {{performance and}} reduced flammability {{at the same}} time. The manufactured composites consisted of PLA/TPS biopolymer matrices reinforced with chopped flax fibres. The flammability of the prepared biocomposites was reduced by a newly synthesized multifunctional additive system. Glycerol phosphate (GP), a plasticizer of starch with flame retardant potential, and a novel phosphorous-silane (PSil), applied as a surface treating agent of the reinforcing <b>biofibres,</b> were successfully combined {{in order to reduce}} the flammability of the prepared biocomposites.

30|$|This {{transient}} shear-thickening regime applies {{over the}} range 10 – 30  s− 1 after which shear thinning resumes from the newly enhanced viscosity. The net effect is thus one of shear thinning of viscosity by orders of ca. 100 over a range 0.1 – 1000  s− 1, but with a “hump” interruption of temporary shear thickening between 10 and 100  s− 1. This corresponds to the shear rates associated with fracture flow in reservoirs (van der Plas and Golombok 2016). We have previously shown that selective retardation effects in fractures are associated with this transient regime. This {{has been shown to}} be chemically tuneable in the case of viscoelastic surfactants—it is as yet not clear how this might be done for these <b>biofibres.</b> For now, we simply note the parallel with viscoelastic surfactants i.e., the occurrence of a transient regime of viscosity thickening which has previously been associated with viscoelasticity.|$|R
30|$|This {{relationship}} is of limited utility given {{the onset of}} the shear-thickening regime interruption due to viscoelasticity. We confine ourselves to the observation that the index n[*]=[*] 0.2 is lower for <b>biofibre</b> than for guar gum (n[*]=[*] 0.4). <b>Biofibre</b> is thus more shear thinning and has more potential for improved reservoir injectivity compared to cross-linked guar gum. This obviates the need for time-delayed cross-linkers because we can rely on the natural reduced viscosity at the high shear associated with injection to provide sufficient flow.|$|E
30|$|The {{viscosity}} of the <b>biofibre</b> {{was measured}} in a Couette cell at three different mass fractions in water: 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5  wt% along with the cross-linked guar gum reference (Fig.  2). The viscosity increases with mass fraction of <b>biofibre.</b> All three measured mass fractions show a shear-thinning trend which agrees with previous observations (see 2.1). However, for a mass fraction of 1.0  wt% and 1.5  wt%, a shear-thickening regime initiates at a shear rate of 10  s− 1. Dogon (2016) has shown that this effect is associated with viscoelastic effects. The relationship in Eqs. (1) and (2) breaks down at this point. This is a well-known effect in viscoelastic surfactants forming worm-like micelles (van Santvoort and Golombok 2018). However, {{as far as we}} are aware, {{this is the first time}} that it has been reported for micron-sized fibres. The application of shear (either by Couette or Darcy flow) begins to align the fibres, however, after a certain threshold they begin to intertangle and this has the effect of increasing the resistance to flow (=[*]viscosity). This effect reaches a maximum at which point mechanical stress breaks down the extended fibre network and the viscosity decreases again.|$|E

Developments in ATRP have been utilised to provide robust conditions for the grafting. SCLCP grafts with varied mesogenic units have been achieved. A new mixing protocol has been developed to allow for the polymerisations in the presence of homogenous substrates. Covalent attachment has been confirmed for both smectic and nematic SCLCPs to cellulose, with graft-from polymerisations evidenced for both types of mesogenic units. All graftings were confirmed by FT-IR, with special attention given to the carbonyl peak at ∼ 1730 cm- 1.

30|$|From {{the past}} two decades these <b>biofibres</b> are being used as filler {{material}} in the preparation of composites and have gained prodigious attention (Hubbe et al. 2008). In view of better utilization of renewable resources, {{there is a need to}} explore other renewable greener sources, which can be utilized in developing high strength light weight biocomposites for high-end applications. Pongamia pinnata seed hull is chosen for the present work to exploit its potential for cellulose fibres which could be utilized as reinforcement in biocomposites. In India and south East Asia, Pongamia pinnata (Karanja) seed is used for biodiesel production (Demirbas 2009). It is also a traditional medicinal plant with all parts having certain medicinal value (Yadav et al. 2004). Biofuel production using P. pinnata seeds has resulted in large-scale cultivation of these trees (Shwetha et al. 2014). The biofuel processing fallouts in significant amount of residual P. pinnata seed hull, in which cellulose percentage approximates to 40 % and is similar as in shelly wood (Nadeem et al. 2009). Thus these underused seed hulls can find potential application as a source for cellulose fibres.|$|R
30|$|Cellulose fibres were {{isolated}} from P. pinnata seed hull by sequential chlorination and alkaline {{process and the}} resultant microfibres were characterized by SEM, DLS, FTIR, NMR, TGA and XRD analyses. Cellulose microfibres were in diameter ranging from 6 to 8 μm and mean hydrodynamic diameter of 58.4  nm. NMR and FTIR analyses confirmed the removal of hemicellulose and lignin. Crystallinity of the fibres was increased by 72.79 % after the treatment with CI of 47 % for the isolated cellulose fibres. Thermal behaviour of the fibres had improved as evidenced by an increase of degradation temperature by 70  °C. Most potential observation to be considered was the degradation temperature of the isolated cellulose fibres being higher than 200  °C, which could broaden its application potential {{in the fields of}} biocomposite processing. A notable increase in crystallinity and the dimension similar to the cellulose fibres isolated from other resources by various chemical treatments was a significant feature of the resource and the isolation method adopted in the present study. Thus the present work substantiates the success of the sequential chlorination and alkaline extraction process solely contributing to obtain smaller diameter and crystalline cellulose microfibres from P. pinnata seed hull. These <b>biofibres</b> have potential application as filler, embroiling in the process of biodegradable composites to enhance their properties.|$|R

These results are compared to the viscosity in a falling ball rheometer as well as in pressure-driven flow through capillaries and conduits. The results indicate that viscosity can be tuned to automatically adjust to the desired flow conditions in the reservoir to provide optimal behaviour for each application.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} awareness of sustainable production in our society in recent decades {{has led to the}} search for new environmentally-friendly products. Natural fibres from flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), which are renewable and can be degraded biologically after their use, are an alternative that has been considered as a replacement for synthetic fibres in many industrial applications, for example, as reinforcement in composites, rubber and concrete. The objective of` this work was to carry out a thorough literature review on the production and use of flax for non-textile applications in general, and on aspects related to harvest and handling in particular. The report starts with a review of earlier Swedish research and development projects and then focuses on harvest and handling methods. Thereafter, quality aspects related to harvest and handling of flax, i. e. straw moisture contents and degree of retting, are reviewed. A summarising discussion and proposals for future research are presented in the last chapter. After the closure of the last flax long fibre processing plant in 1966, there has been no commercial production of flax fibres in Sweden. However, interest in using flax fibres in non-textile applications was stimulated in the late 1980 s, and a number of projects started in the 1990 s with the aim of restoring Swedish flax fibre production. Today, there are no flax processing plants in operation, but it is recommended that new research and development projects be directed towards the creation of a demand for <b>biofibres</b> before such plants are established. This would be a first step towards creating a future market for short natural fibres obtained from flax, and also from other fibre crops such as hemp. The harvest and handling operations constitute {{an important part of the}} total production costs, Computer simulation of these operations is recommended in order to find more cost-effective and reliable delivery systems, Such simulations should include quality aspects regarding the straw moisture content and the degree of retting, provided that reliable, quick and inexpensive methods to assess the degree of retting are developed, and that models describing the moisture content changes and the progress of retting are constructed...|$|R
3000|$|Moving towards {{proppant}} transport, the viscosities {{were also}} measured in a falling ball viscometer (Fig.  3). Entanglement of fibres is more at higher concentrations, increasing the resistance {{for the ball}} to fall through. The viscosity increases by a factor 10 over the <b>biofibre</b> mass fraction range—much higher than suggested by Eqs. (1) and (2). (The falling ball viscosity for the cross-linked guar gum reference was almost two orders higher than for biofibre— 720  mPa s). Note that the falling ball has a diameter of 15  mm—an order of magnitude higher than the size of typical proppant particles. The falling ball viscometer is not associated with a specific shear rate, {{as opposed to the}} Couette cell. For Newtonian fluids, identical viscosities are of course obtained.

As such, biotechnology {{is vital to the}} continued improvement of existing forest products and the development of aspects of a viable bioeconomy. Such a bioeconomy will be based on differentiated value-added crops and animal breeds for food, feed and health.

30|$|Viscoelastic {{surfactants}} {{are somewhat}} {{sensitive to the}} presence of oil and rather challenging to tune for an unknown fracture size. Moreover, environmental objections to application (such {{as in the case of}} shale gas) can best be overcome if the viscosifiers are “natural” products derived without too much processing from plant materials, etc. (Thakur and Thakur 2015) In this paper, we describe a natural material which displays these desired properties. It is a natural cellulose <b>biofibre</b> product which has previously been used for turbulent drag enhancement properties. We demonstrate a natural viscoelasticity which enhances the behaviour over and above current additives used for overcoming permeability variation and proppant placement problems. The material is non-Newtonian—but not just in the time- and shear-dependent manners discussed above—it also has a significant viscoelastic component. This requires careful interpretation of the three-different classic viscosity determination methods with consideration of their applicability to the processes associated with the oil problem (laminar pressure-driven flow) and fracture gas reservoir (combined laminar pressure driven flow and entrained particle flow). In “Background” we discuss previous work on the effect of fibrous solutions on viscosity as well as specifying the viscosity requirements for the oil and gas problem. “Methods” describes the experimental measurements. “Results and discussion” contains our results and discussion and is followed by a conclusion summarizing the main results.|$|E
40|$|Flax shives are {{a source}} of {{abundant}} biomass from renewable sources. They are considered to be environmentally benign and have a high-energy content for heating and generation of electricity, but only after being processed into pellets. Pelleting of the shives was done by using the single-pelleter and pilot-scale mill. The effect of grinding with screens of 2. 4, 3. 2, and 6. 4 mm on unit density and durability was conducted with a completely randomized design using shives from <b>Biofibre</b> Industries Inc., Canora, SK. The central composite face-centered design with 3 levels of lower grade canola meal used as a binder (18, 21, and 24 %), moisture content (8, 11, and 14 % (w. b)), and hammer mill screen size (3. 2, 4. 8, and 6. 4 mm) was used {{to determine the effects of}} these three factors on the properties of fuel pellets made from shives obtained from Biolin Research Inc., Saskatoon, SK. The initial moisture content of coarse flax shives from both sources was about 10. 5 % wet basis (w. b.). The moisture content of flax shive grinds ranged from 9. 6 to 10. 5 % (w. b.) after grinding, using the smaller screens for the <b>Biofibre</b> material, while the moisture content ranged from 7. 9 to 8. 6 % (w. b.) for shives from Biolin. Also, smaller screen size reduced the geometric mean particle size for shives from both sources. The use of the smaller hammer mill screen resulted in an increase in both bulk and particle density of shives. There was a decrease in coefficient of the internal friction of shives from 0. 20 to 0. 14 and an increase in a cohesion of shives from 2. 18 to 3. 83 kPa when the screen size decreased from 6. 4 to 3. 2 mm. The flax shives contained cellulose (53. 27 %), hemicelluloses (13. 62 %), and lignin (20. 53 %) at a moisture content of 7. 9 % (w. b). Specific heat capacity of flax shives changed from 1. 5 to 2. 7 kJ/ (kg °C) when the moisture content was increased from 8 to 14 % (w. b.) and temperature from 15 to 80 °C. The shives had the combustion energy of 17. 67 MJ/kg at a moisture content of 8. 1 % (w. b.). The smallest screen size (2. 4 mm) resulted in the highest unit density (1010 kg/m 3) and the highest durability (88 %) in the pellets produced by the single-pelleting equipment. The change in length of pellets produced by the pilot-scale mill increased as canola meal increased from 18 to 24 % at the highest moisture content (%). The pellets were more stable at the highest moisture content when the lowest canola meal used. The addition of 18 % canola meal and grinds from a screen size of 6. 4 mm produced the highest unit density in the pellets at all moisture levels. The highest bulk density (682 kg/m 3) was obtained from shive mixtures with 18 % canola meal and a moisture content of 8 %. The highest hardness and durability were found for the shive pellets that were produced with 18 % canola meal at a moisture content of 14 % (w. b). Pellets that were produced at a moisture content of 14 % (w. b) resulted in the lowest percentage of moisture absorption. The inclusion of the canola meal in the shive mixture resulted in an increase in the combustion energy of the pellets because of the fat content in the binder. The two levels of canola meal for shive pellets had essentially the same level of emissions. However, there were significant differences between shive pellets and commercial wood pellets in the level of the emissions. Lower amounts of methane (1. 29 ppm) and oxygen (164. 3 ppt) were found for flax shive pellets than of methane (1. 63 ppm) and oxygen (176. 6 ppt) in commercial wood pellets. In short, pelleting of flax shives into fuel pellets improved the handling characteristics, increased bulk density and energy content. Fuel pellets made from flax shives had less emission of methane and oxygen from combustion when compared to commercial wood pellets...|$|E
40|$|Oat hull is an abundantly {{available}} form {{of biomass}} in Canada, which is mostly used as low-value feed material. With high fibre content, {{it can be}} used in the production of industrial products by providing opportunity as an additive in the replacement of petroleum-based products. Moreover, bio-based plastics/ biodegradable polymers are gaining popularity, as reinforced matrices into natural fibres to produce biodegradable composites. Therefore, the objectives of this investigation were to develop biocomposite materials from cellulose and lignin which were post-hydrolysis products of oat hull using biodegradable polymers (polylactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL)) and to compare the physical and mechanical properties of formulated biocomposites with polypropylene (PP) biocomposites so that a low-cost and eco-friendly biomaterial can be produced. Further, the effect of an impact modifier was investigated to improve the impact properties of such biocomposites. The oat hull biomass was cleaned and chemically pretreated to produce different kinds of fibres by dilute acid hydrolysis followed by delignification at different temperature conditions. The fibres resulting from pretreatment processes were AHB (acid-catalyzed hydrolysis by-product), CRB- 30 and CRB- 65 (cellulose-rich <b>biofibre).</b> Chemical analysis of fibres showed a reduction in hemi-cellulose and lignin content, with increased cellulose content. Formulations with rates of at 15 % and 30 % AHB or CRB fibres of the total mass of biocomposites were tested. The effect of impact modifier at 15 % inclusion rate was also investigated with polylactic acid- and polycaprolactone-based composites. A twin screw extruder and a compression molding machine were respectively used for compounding the formulations and product molding/fabrication. The performance of the composites in all formulations was finally assessed by measuring their physical and mechanical properties such as density, color measurement, water absorption, tensile strength, flexural strength and tensile-impact energy. Fibre loading from 15 % to 30 % significantly affected the density and water absorption of the manufactured composites. The density of composites increased with addition of fibres; water absorption also increased with fibre addition in all formulations. Color analysis showed that products appeared darker in color because of addition of fibres. The results for the mechanical properties of PLA-based composites indicated that tensile and flexural strength of biocomposites generally decreased when compared to those of virgin polymers, while Young’s modulus and flexural modulus increased with corresponding increase in fibre content from 15 % to 30 %. On the other hand, PCL-based biocomposites with 30 % fibre loading offered higher flexural strength than that of composites loaded with 15 % fibres; similarly, tensile modulus and flexural modulus increased with an increase in fibre content. The most significant result is that tensile-impact strength of PLA- and PCL-based composites increased with addition of an impact modifier. Therefore, eco-friendly composites were successfully developed from an oat hull biomass by-product in combination with biodegradable polymers...|$|E
