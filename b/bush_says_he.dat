5000|$|Bush {{has often}} been invited to speak to audiences overseas. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> has {{courtesy}} visits with world leaders but {{has no plans to}} wade into foreign policy. [...] "Oftentimes because of my father's goodwill, and because of the president being who he is, people might extend an invitation, and it's enjoyable for me," [...] Bush said. [...] "Some of these folks are family friends." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{transcript}} {{begins with}} <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> wants {{to pursue a}} second resolution quickly, {{two or three days}} after the meeting. Aznar prefers three days later so the General Affairs and External Relations Council can meet beforehand. Bush envisions a resolution similar to one passed during the Kosovo conflict, and [...] "he wants it written so that it does not contain obligatory elements, that does not mention the use of force, and that states that Saddam Hussein has been unable to fulfill his obligations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There was a tree {{growing in}} the <b>bush</b> there,” <b>says</b> <b>he,</b> “and it seems these devils came to get the leaves of it. So {{the people of the}} isle cut down the tree {{wherever}} it was found, and the devils came no more.” ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> is [...] "an unwavering supporter" [...] of Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [...] In a speech, Bush {{said his}} brother, former President George W. Bush, was his main adviser on policy with the Middle East. Bush later {{clarified}} {{that he was}} referring to policy on Israel, rather than on the Middle East as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> {{wants to}} {{increase}} the number of people permitted to immigrate to the U.S. based on their skills, while decreasing the number who immigrate because of family relationships. He compared President Obama's executive orders creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) programs to the decrees of [...] "a Latin American dictator," [...] stating that he favors changes through legislation and not by executive order. Bush vowed to revoke those executive orders.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a tree {{growing in}} the <b>bush</b> there," [...] <b>says</b> <b>he,</b> [...] "and it seems these devils came to get the leaves of it. So {{the people of the}} isle cut down the tree {{wherever}} it was found, and the devils came no more." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the parking}} lot, Andy has not shown {{up for the}} duel, instead leaving a {{deliberately}} verbose note hanging in the <b>bushes</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> has given up. As Dwight reads it, Andy sneaks up behind him in his Toyota Prius, a hybrid car that remains completely silent when driven below five miles per hour due to the electric motor. Impressed by Andy's deviousness, {{the rest of the}} office does not warn Dwight, saying that Andy [...] "deserves the win". Andy pins Dwight between the car and the large bushes in the parking lot. Jim races out to check that Andy and Dwight are not seriously injured, but they snap at him to go away. The two bicker back and forth about Angela. However, the fight goes out of Dwight when he learns Andy has had sex with Angela, because she told him that {{he was the only one}} she had had sex with. Crestfallen, Dwight and Andy both admit defeat and return to the office, where Andy calls to cancel his wedding cake, and Dwight throws away a bobblehead doll Angela previously bought him as a gift. A saddened Angela realizes she has lost both men.|$|R
6000|$|This {{astonishing}} stranger {{appeared to}} be tearing at something {{on the side of}} his face. There appeared streaks of blood there. He flung out his arms as if in despair, leapt in the air like a frantic creature, ran violently ten or twelve yards, and then fell and rolled on the ground and over and out of sight of the boy. The lad was down the steps and through the hedge in a trice--happily with the garden shears still in hand. As he came crashing through the gorse <b>bushes,</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> was half minded to turn back, fearing he had to deal with a lunatic, but the possession of the shears reassured him. [...] "I could 'ave jabbed his eyes," [...] he explained, [...] "anyhow." [...] Directly Mr. Carrington caught sight of him, his demeanour became at once that of a sane but desperate man. He struggled to his feet, stumbled, stood up, and came to meet the boy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{content is}} entwined with the Cuban Revolution and is written from a Cuban perspective. For example, EcuReds article about United States {{said it had}} {{historically}} taken [...] "by force territory and natural resources from other nations, to put {{at the service of}} its businesses and monopolies", and the George W. <b>Bush</b> article <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> continues with a family tradition of corruption, government deceit and intrigue. The name is an acronym from the Spanish phrase [...] ("Cuban Encyclopedia online").|$|R
50|$|Bush was {{the first}} {{reporter}} to interview U.S. Olympic Swimmer Ryan Lochte after the athlete claimed he was robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bush's due diligence as an interviewer was scrutinized after critics claimed Bush did not ask questions that would have shown Lochte’s story was fabricated. When details of Lochte's story began to fall apart, Matt Lauer re-interviewed the swimmer {{in a move that}} was seen as a snub to Bush. Bush garnered attention once again after he and Al Roker got into an argument during Olympic coverage on Today after Lochte was exposed. <b>Bush</b> defended Lochte, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> lied about “some” details whereas Roker characterized Lochte's statement as a lie.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 and 2004, Pilger {{strongly}} criticised {{the policies}} of United States President George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> had exploited the 9/11 terrorist attacks in his 2003 invasion of Iraq and later occupation. Pilger in 2004 criticised then British Prime Minister Tony Blair as equally responsible for the invasion and the bungled occupation of Iraq. In 2004, as the Iraq insurgency increased, Pilger wrote that the anti-war movement should support [...] "Iraq's anti-occupation resistance:""We cannot afford to be choosy. While we abhor and condemn the continuing loss of innocent life in Iraq, {{we have no choice}} now but to support the resistance, for if the resistance fails, the [...] "Bush gang" [...] will attack another country."His support for the Iraqi insurgency was criticised at the time. Australian commentator Andrew Bolt who described Pilger as an [...] "apologist for terrorists". Oliver Kamm, writing for The Times in 2006, commented: [...] "By reputation the exemplar of radical conscience, Pilger {{turns out to be the}} voice of brutishness" [...] because of his support for opposing forces in Iraq. Kamm has also accused Pilger of [...] "historical revisionism" [...] in his writings about Slobodan Milošević and NATO's actions during the Kosovo War in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Wood {{was born}} in Parbold, Lancashire {{and grew up in}} a musical family; while still a teenager, he was {{encouraged}} by the composer Alan <b>Bush.</b> <b>He</b> <b>says</b> that his [...] "earliest enthusiasm was Bach... and that's {{been at the center of}} everything ever since." [...] After military service in Egypt, he studied History at New College, Oxford, where he dedicated much of his time to music and writing compositions for the theatre. In 1954, he moved to London to study composition privately with William Lloyd Webber, Anthony Milner, Iain Hamilton, and Mátyás Seiber. He also started a parallel career as a music teacher by finding work in schools, including Morley College, and as a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Music.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he lights}} his pipe, while I drive {{away at a}} gallop. The next morning he drops around to our cottage, where my aunt was {{fiddling}} with her flowers and truck in the front yard. He bends himself and bows and makes compliments as he could do, when so disposed, and begs a rose <b>bush</b> from her, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> had turned up a little land back of his cabin, and wanted to plant something on it by way of usefulness and ornament. So my aunt, flattered, pulls up one of her biggest by the roots and gives it to him. Afterward I see it growing where he planted it, {{in a place where}} the grass had been cleared off and the dirt levelled. But neither George nor me ever spoke of it to each other again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bush {{continues}} {{to talk and}} moves to discussing post-invasion Iraq. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> expects Hussein's generals to put up resistances by blowing up infrastructure, especially oil wells. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that invading forces will seize the oil wells very early on to prevent this. Meanwhile, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> Saudi Arabia will produce extra oil to cover any disruption in the oil market. Bush thinks they can [...] "win without destruction," [...] and that Iraq has good foundations including a strong bureaucracy and civil society. Bush envisions Iraq government by a federation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "Saddam Hussein won’t {{change and}} he’ll {{continue}} to play games. The {{time has come to}} get rid of him." [...] <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that they will proceed with the invasion even if the resolution is vetoed, but he believes {{they will be able to}} get the second resolution passed. Bush mentions that the coalition forces will be ready to invade in two weeks (second week of March 2003), and they expect to be in Baghdad by the end of March.|$|R
500|$|Colbert {{spoke in}} the persona of the {{character}} he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of a conservative pundit in the fashion of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He began by satirizing mass surveillance, joking [...] "If anybody needs anything else at their tables, just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers. Someone from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail." [...] While many of his jokes were directed at President Bush, he also lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, but several segments were lifted—largely unchanged—from The Colbert Report, including parts of the [...] "truthiness" [...] monologue from the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from [...] "the gut" [...] rather than the brain and denounced books as [...] "all fact, no heart". Colbert framed {{this part of the}} speech as though he were agreeing with <b>Bush's</b> philosophies, <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> and <b>Bush</b> are [...] "not brainiacs on the nerd patrol", implicitly criticizing the way Bush positioned himself as an anti-intellectual.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2006, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, sent {{a similar}} letter to former US President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> aslim taslam.|$|R
5000|$|A {{painting}} by W.H.D. Koerner, lent to Bush, shows a horseman charging up a rugged mountain trail, followed by others. In the book, <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> this scene [...] "epitomizes our mission": ...|$|R
5000|$|January 21, 2003: <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> of Saddam [...] "He has {{weapons of}} mass {{destruction}} -- the world's deadliest weapons -- which pose a direct threat to the United States, our citizens and our friends and allies." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{transcript}} {{ends with}} <b>Bush</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "The more the Europeans attack me, the stronger I {{am in the}} United States." [...] Aznar replies, [...] "We must make your strength compatible with the esteem of the Europeans." ...|$|R
5000|$|October 14, 2002: President <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> of Saddam [...] "This is a {{man that}} we know has had {{connections}} with al Qaeda. This {{is a man}} who, in my judgment, would like to use al Qaeda as a forward army." ...|$|R
5000|$|Additional {{samples of}} <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "God bless America! cheering", [...] "Wait... Watch and learn.", and [...] "I believe in freedom", and Joseph McCarthy saying [...] "I'm not setting myself above any law", {{appear on the}} {{extended}} dance mix from the single release.|$|R
25|$|On 31 December the US pledge was {{increased}} tenfold to US$350 million, with President <b>Bush</b> <b>saying</b> that that amount would probably increase further. President Bush also signed a decree ordering flags to be flown at half-mast {{during the first}} week of the new year.|$|R
5000|$|Aznar {{returns the}} {{conversation}} to the resolution. Aznar wants the resolution to mention that Hussein has lost his chance. Bush replies that he cares little {{about the content of}} the message, and Aznar responds that the Spanish will send the Americans some text for the resolution. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> {{they do not have a}} set text--only the requirement that Saddam be disarmed. Aznar says that his text will be written to draw more international support, and Bush consents. Aznar then discusses his upcoming meeting with President of France Jacques Chirac on February 26, shortly after the resolution is announced. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> that Chirac thinks of himself as [...] "Mr Arab," [...] and that the two have a rivalry over the Arab world.|$|R
5000|$|The PFA Voters' Fund {{spent more}} than $20 million on {{television}} ad campaigns, including one called [...] "Ashley's Story" [...] which featured a 15-year-old Ohio girl (who lost her mother on September 11) hugging President <b>Bush</b> and <b>saying,</b> [...] "All <b>he</b> {{wants to do is}} make sure I'm safe." ...|$|R
5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} John <b>Bush</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "McRae brings back the spirit (and {{some of the}} phrasing) of Sarah Vaughan while still {{sounding}} very much like herself. This very well-conceived tribute is a classic of its kind and a perfect swan song for Carmen McRae".|$|R
50|$|I {{think that}} when President <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> all options are on the table, the destabilization of Iran's ethnic provinces is one of them. Don't forget, Mr Mahmudali Chehregani, one of the pan-Turkist leaders {{agitating}} for a separatist Azeri agenda, was in Washington last year by invitation of the Defense Department.|$|R
5000|$|He dismisses as rhetoric {{claims by}} U.S. President George W. Bush that the attacks {{occurred}} because Islamic extremists [...] "hate freedom", saying: [...] "If <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> we hate freedom, let him {{tell us why}} we didn't attack Sweden, for example. It is known that freedom-haters don't have defiant spirits {{like those of the}} 19—may God have mercy on them".|$|R
2500|$|Cornwell {{has spoken}} {{negatively}} {{of the presidency}} of George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I was supportive of young George W. Bush because I liked his family. I {{thought he was going}} to be another Big George. Boy, was I ever wrong. It's not a democracy so much as a theocracy, and those are not the principles this country was founded on." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} for Allmusic, Nathan <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Throughout the set, Slim {{is happy to}} lend the {{spotlight}} to his sidemen, working the 88s behind Eddie Chamblee's tenor solo on 'I Am the Blues' and Billy Butler's guitar on 'Ballin' the Jack.' Even in these situations however, the pianist is dazzling and his commentary always worth paying attention to." ...|$|R
25|$|On July 31, the Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) {{rejected}} <b>Bush's</b> transfer request, <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> {{could not}} be reassigned to an Air Reserve Squadron because of his obligated service. Bricken, asked about the matter in 2000, said that Bush {{made no effort to}} participate as a Guardsman with the 9921st.|$|R
50|$|Aznar asks {{if there}} is a chance that Hussein will go into exile. Bush {{responds}} that it is a possibility, and another that Hussein may even be assassinated. <b>Bush</b> <b>says</b> Hussein expects to be able to not be prosecuted in exile but that it is expected that more of Hussein's hidden crimes will be discovered, and he would then be judged in international court in The Hague.|$|R
5000|$|On May 21, 2006, while {{promoting}} {{the release of}} the album Taking the Long Way, Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President <b>Bush,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever. ... If people are going to ask me to apologize based on who I am ... I don't {{know what to do about}} that. I can't change who I am." ...|$|R
