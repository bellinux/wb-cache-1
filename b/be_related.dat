This superphylum may <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to the origin of eukaryotes.

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia might <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought to <b>be</b> <b>related</b> {{to the presence of}} insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|Anoplotherium is an extinct mammal {{from the}} Eocene to Oligocene epochs, first found near Paris. Hawkins's models draw on Owen's {{speculation}} about its camel-like appearance.

5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought to <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E

5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may <b>be</b> <b>related</b> to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
