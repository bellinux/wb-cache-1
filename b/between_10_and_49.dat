40|$|The federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) {{utilizes}} {{data and}} analysis from the Census Bureau to produce its designations of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). First, the OMB uses urbanized areas – {{defined by the}} Census Bureau as urban areas with 50, 000 or more residents – {{to serve as the}} population core for a metropolitan statistical area. The county in which the urbanized area resides now becomes the core county of the specific metropolitan statistical area. Next, the OMB uses labor force commuting data to incorporate surrounding counties which are highly integrated with the core county.

40|$|Indoor {{location}} systems cannot rely on {{technologies such}} as GPS (Global Positioning System) to determine {{the position of a}} mobile terminal, because its signals are blocked by obstacles such as walls, ceilings, roofs, etc. In such environments. The use of alternative techniques, {{such as the use of}} wireless networks, should be considered. The location estimation is made by measuring and analysing one of the parameters of the wireless signal, usually the received power. One of the techniques used to estimate the locations using wireless networks is fingerprinting. This technique comprises two phases: in the first phase data is collected from the scenario and stored in a database; the second phase consists in determining the location of the mobile node by comparing the data collected from the wireless transceiver with the data previously stored in the database. In this paper an approach for localisation using fingerprinting based on Fuzzy Logic and pattern searching is presented.

40|$|Catastrophizing about sleeplessness is a {{cognitive}} process associated with sleep disturbance in adults. This study aimed to (1) examine whether children catastrophize {{about the consequences}} of not sleeping; (2) define the topics that children catastrophize about; (3) assess whether there is a link between catastrophizing and sleep disturbance in children; and (4) examine whether an association between catastrophizing and sleep in children is mediated by anxiety and depression symptoms. Children completed the sleep self-report and a catastrophizing interview. Testing took place in two inner-city schools in London, UK and participants comprised 123 children aged <b>between</b> 8 <b>and</b> <b>10</b> years (<b>49</b> % male). Thirty-four (28 %) participants reported concerns in response to the catastrophizing questionnaire. The main topics being catastrophized were concerns about sleep, physiological issues and one’s own emotions. Catastrophes predicted sleep disturbance after controlling for age and sex (β = 0. 35, P < 0. 001) but not when controlling additionally for anxiety and depression symptoms (β = 0. 15, P = 0. 106).

40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to examine}} the {{association}} between self-reported heat stress interference with daily activities (sleeping, work, travel, housework and exercise) and three graded-holistic health and well-being outcomes (energy, emotions and life satisfaction). Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: The setting is tropical and developing countries as Thailand, where high temperature and high humidity are common, particularly during the hottest seasons. Participants: This study {{is based on an}} ongoing national Thai Cohort Study of distance-learning openuniversity adult students (N= 60 569) established in 2005 to study the health-risk transition. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Health impacts from heat stress in our study are categorised as physical health impacts (energy levels), mental health impacts (emotions) and well-being (life satisfaction). For each health and well-being outcome we report ORs and 95 % CIs using multinomial logistic regression adjusting for a wide array of potential confounders. Results: Negative health and well-being outcomes (low-energy level, emotional problems and low life satisfaction) associated with increasing frequency of heat stress interfering with daily activities. Adjusted ORs for emotional problems were between 1. 5 and 4. 8 and in general worse than energy level (between 1. 31 and 2. 91) and life satisfaction (<b>between</b> 1. <b>10</b> <b>and</b> 2. <b>49).</b> The worst health outcomes were when heat interfered with sleeping, followed by interference with daily travel, work, housework and exercise. Conclusions: In tropical Thailand there already are substantial heat stress impacts on health and well-being.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} all {{the records}} within the Brazilian Hospital Information System (HIS) that contained information suggestive of severe maternal morbidity (near miss); {{to describe the}} diagnoses and procedures used; to identify variables associated with maternal death. Methods A descriptive population study with data from the HIS and Mortality Information System (MIS) files of records of women during pregnancy, delivery and in the postpartum period in all the capital cities of the Brazilian states in 2002. Initially, records of women <b>between</b> <b>10</b> <b>and</b> <b>49</b> years of age were selected; next, those records {{with at least one}} criterion suggestive of near miss were selected. For the linkage of HIS with MIS and HIS with itself, a blocking strategy consisting of three independent steps was established. In the data analysis, near miss ratios were calculated with corresponding 95 % confidence interval and the diagnoses and procedures were described; a multiple logistic regression model was adjusted. Primary and secondary diagnoses and the requested and performed procedures during hospitalization were the main outcome measures. Results The overall maternal near miss ratio was 44. 3 / 1, 000 live births. Among the records indicating near miss, 154 maternal deaths were identified. The criteria of severity most frequently found were infection, preeclampsia and hemorrhage. Logistic regression analysis resulted in 12 variables, including four significant interactions.

40|$|Background: Stroke {{presents}} with heterogeneous recovery periods, severity, and {{manifestation of}} deficits, {{all of which}} may adversely impact fitness-to-drive. Little {{is known about the}} association between site of lesion and driving performance after stroke. Objective: To investigate the association between site of stroke lesion and driving performance. Method: Seventy-three participants (age = 56 ± 11 years; 66 men) underwent a detailed battery of visual, cognitive, and on-road tests to determine fitness-to-drive at about 10 months after ischemic stroke. Associations between stroke location and driving performance were calculated using rank biserial (rrb) correlation coefficients. Correlations were considered weak below 0. <b>10,</b> moderate <b>between</b> 0. <b>10</b> <b>and</b> 0. <b>49,</b> <b>and</b> strong above 0. 50. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were employed to discern differences in on-road driving performance between participants whose performance was of concern to the driving assessor and those who exhibited no major difficulties on the road. Results: In all, 28 (38 %) out of the 73 participants exhibited major difficulties on the road. Those who showed difficulties on the road performed worse in all driving skills (p< 0. 05). Correlation analysis showed moderate to strong correlations between site of lesion and performance in several visual, cognitive and on-road tests. Lesions in the parietal lobe showed correlations ranging between 0. 23 and 0. 25 with driving skills including vehicle control and speed adaptations. Lesions in the occipital lobes correlated strongly with visual field (rrb = 0. 53) and moderately with visual neglect (rrb = 0. 28). Conclusions: Our results suggest that cortical lesions in the parietal and occipital lobes are associated with driving performance after stroke. Further advances in our understanding of the neural correlates of driving performance may provide prognostic markers of fitness-to-drive and lead to early targeted rehabilitation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The areas located outside {{metropolitan}} areas and also outside areas activated through other big cities are called peripheries. There are big {{differences between the}} levels of development of metropolitan and peripheral areas in Poland. There are also great differences in opportunities to development including the location of new investment. Peripheral areas are characterized by features such as: high unemployment, relatively impoverished populations, low productivity, low territorial accessibility, small development potential. Lack of development factors {{is the cause of}} low development level. Peripheral areas are differential. The author analyses this differentiation, including location of development factors in peripheral areas of northern Poland. Touristic values are such factor, but tourism is mainly seasonal. The tourist season is short, 2 - 4 months. The development of this tourism increases the income of people and business, but the increase of permanent work-places is small. The lack of robust businesses that are able to start constant and stable development {{is one of the main}} weakness of peripheral areas. Bed transport accessibility is the other weakness of peripheral areas. As one of the factors of socio-economic development considered by author is the spatial structure, including settlement network. In some areas lack of appropriately big node could be the weakness of such network. The analysis of case study area is conducted on the basis of the features of poviats (counties), which are described by following indicators: employees in the industry sector and market service sector per 1000 population of working age, number of entities in national economy <b>between</b> <b>10</b> - <b>49</b> <b>and</b> more than <b>49</b> workers per 1000 population of working age, investment outlays in enterprises per capita in the years 2008 - 2010, gross value of fixed assets in enterprises per capita, average monthly gross wages and salaries, unemployment rate, participation of the urban population, population of the biggest settlement node.

Materials and Methods: Five hundred and fifty-six patients operated on between 1991 and 2000 were selected. Patients were divided into age groups of <b>between</b> <b>10</b> <b>and</b> <b>49</b> years, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years and 70 to 83 years. Results: Patients having less than 60 years of age presented clinical stage (p = 0. 001), PSA (p = 0. 013) and biopsy Gleason score (p = 0. 013) more favorable than older patients. Age groups did not show any relationship between either postopera-tive Gleason score or pathological stage or risk of non-confined organ disease and involvement of seminal vesicles. After a mean follow-up of 58. 3 months, 149 (27 %) patients presented recurrence. Patients aged between 40 and 59 years pre-sented a disease-free survival rate significantly higher when compared to patients aged between 60 and 83 years (p = 0. 022). However, when controlled with clinical stage, PSA, Gleason score and percentage of positive fragments, there was no relationship between age and biochemical recurrence risk (p = 0. 426).

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{temporal}} evolution of maternal mortality and its spatial distribution. METHODS Ecological study {{with a sample}} made up of 845 maternal deaths in women <b>between</b> <b>10</b> <b>and</b> <b>49</b> years, registered from 1999 to 2008 {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. Data were obtained from Information System on Mortality of Ministry of Health. The maternal mortality ratio and the specific maternal mortality ratio were calculated from records, and analyzed by the Poisson regression model. In the spatial distribution, three maps of the state were built with the rates in the geographical macro-regions, in 1999, 2003, and 2008. RESULTS There was an increase of 2. 0 % in the period of ten years (95 %CI 1. 00; 1. 04; p = 0. 01), with no significant change in the magnitude of the maternal mortality ratio. The Serra macro-region presented the highest maternal mortality ratio (1. 15, 95 %CI 1. 08; 1. 21; p < 0. 001). Most deaths in Rio Grande do Sul were of white women over 40 years, with a lower level of education. The time of delivery/abortion and postpartum are times of increased maternal risk, with a greater negative impact of direct causes such as hypertension and bleeding. CONCLUSIONS The lack of improvement in maternal mortality ratio indicates that public policies had no impact on women&# 8217;s reproductive and maternal health.
