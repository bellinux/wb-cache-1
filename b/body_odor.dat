25|$|Choline is a {{precursor}} to trimethylamine, which some persons {{are not able to}} break down due to a genetic disorder called trimethylaminuria. Persons suffering from this disorder may suffer from a strong fishy or otherwise unpleasant <b>body</b> <b>odor,</b> due to the body's release of odorous trimethylamine. A <b>body</b> <b>odor</b> will occur even on a normal diet i.e., one that is not particularly high in choline. Persons with trimethylaminuria are advised to restrict the intake of foods high in choline; this may help to reduce the sufferer's <b>body</b> <b>odor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) and ORS have some demographic and clinical similarities. Where the social anxiety and avoidance behavior is primarily focussed on concern about <b>body</b> <b>odors,</b> ORS {{is a more}} appropriate diagnosis than avoidant personality disorder or SAD. Body dismorphic disorder (BDD) {{has been described as}} the closest diagnosis in DSM-IV to ORS as both primarily focus on bodily symptoms. The defining difference between the two is that in BDD the preoccupation is with physical appearance not <b>body</b> <b>odors.</b> Similarly, where obsessive behaviors are directly and consistently related to <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> rather than anything else, ORS is a more appropriate diagnosis than obsessive compulsive disorder, in which obsessions are different and multiple over time.|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal {{interactions}} are primarily mediated through vision. However, crucial information concerning other individuals is also captured through different senses. New {{evidence suggests that}} <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> can implicitly initiate, filter, and guide the integrated perceptions that characterize real human impressions. Human body-odor processing helps rapidly differentiate kin from friends and friends from foes, as well as identify potential threats or increase alertness to the proximity of strangers, thereby guiding social preference. <b>Body</b> <b>odors,</b> which are potent sources of discriminative, affective, and motor knowledge, elicit neural activity partly or exclusively outside the primary olfactory cortices in the brain areas responsible for the processing of social information, which are activated by equivalent visual signals. <b>Body</b> <b>odors,</b> which can act as an authenticator of truth and are reliably invoked to shape social relations, require us to revise {{our view of the}} traditional body-communication models...|$|R

25|$|Sebaceous gland {{activity}} (which is {{triggered by}} androgens) lessens, reducing oil production {{on the skin}} and scalp. Consequently, the skin becomes less prone to acne. It also becomes drier, and lotions or oils may be necessary. The pores become smaller because of the lower quantities of oil being produced. Many apocrine glands – a type of sweat gland – become inactive, and <b>body</b> <b>odor</b> decreases. Remaining <b>body</b> <b>odor</b> becomes less metallic, sharp, or acrid, and more sweet and musky.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of adrenarche and its {{relationship}} to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal androgens (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens {{contribute to the development of}} pubic hair (pubarche), adult <b>body</b> <b>odor,</b> and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and <b>body</b> <b>odor</b> changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.|$|E

5000|$|Research {{on human}} {{olfaction}} is scant {{in comparison to}} other senses such as vision and hearing, and studies specifically devoted to olfactory recognition are even rarer. Thus, what little information there is on this subject is gleaned through animal studies. Rodents such as mice or rats are suitable subjects for odor recognition research given that smell is their primary sense. [...] "these species, recognition of individual <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> is analogous to human face recognition in that it provides information about identity." [...] In mice, individual <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> are represented at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). [...] In a study performed with rats, the orbitofrontal cortex (OF) was found {{to play an important}} role in odor recognition. The OF is reciprocally connected with the perirhinal and entorhinal areas of the medial temporal lobe, which have also been implicated in recognition memory.|$|R
25|$|Most {{cases of}} trimethylaminuria {{appear to be}} {{inherited}} in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered.

25|$|Trimethylamine {{builds up}} in the bodies of {{patients}} with trimethylaminuria. The trimethylamine is released in the person's sweat, urine, reproductive fluids, and breath, giving off a strong fishy or <b>body</b> <b>odor.</b> Some people with trimethylaminuria have a strong odor all the time, but most have a moderate smell that varies in intensity over time. Individuals with this condition {{do not have any}} physical symptoms, and they typically appear healthy.|$|E

25|$|The body hair of {{surgical}} patients may be removed before surgery. In the past {{this may have}} been achieved by shaving, but that is now considered counter-productive, so clippers or chemical depilatories may be used instead. The shaving of hair has sometimes been used in attempts to eradicate lice or to minimize <b>body</b> <b>odor</b> due to accumulation of odor-causing micro-organisms in hair. Some people with trichiasis find it medically necessary to remove ingrown eyelashes. Shaving against the grain can often cause ingrown hairs.|$|E
25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as androstenedione, {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the androgenic effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type <b>body</b> <b>odor,</b> increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild acne. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the androgenic effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.|$|E
25|$|As the {{amplitude}} of LH pulses increases, the theca {{cells of the}} ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of progesterone. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called granulosa cells. Smaller increases of FSH induce {{an increase in the}} aromatase activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, <b>body</b> <b>odor,</b> acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by SHBG which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and prolactin levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that human <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> {{are involved in}} adaptive behaviors, such as parental attachment in infants or partner choice in adults. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate changes in body-odor perception around puberty, a period largely ignored for odor-mediated behavioral changes, despite major changes in social needs and in odor emission and perception. Nine families with two children (8 pre-pubertal, aged 7 - 10, and 10 pubertal, aged 11 - 18) evaluated <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> of family members and unfamiliar individuals for pleasantness, intensity, and masculinity, and performed a recognition task. The hypothesized emergence of a parent-child mutual aversion for the odor of opposite-sex family members at puberty was not found, contradicting one of the few studies on the topic (Weisfeld et al., J. Exp. Child Psychol. 85 : 279 - 295, 2003). However, some developmental changes were observed, including reduced aversion for odor of the same-sex parent, and increased ability of adults, compared to children, to recognize odor of family members. Sex and personality (depressive and aggressive traits) also significantly influenced odor judgments. Further research with larger samples is needed to investigate the poorly explored issue of how olfactory perception of self and family members develops, and how it could correlate with normal reorganizations in social interactions at adolescence...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} study {{examining}} interspecies emotion transfer via <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> (chemosignals). Do human <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> (chemosignals) produced under emotional conditions of happiness and fear provide {{information that is}} detectable by pet dogs (Labrador and Golden retrievers) ? The odor samples were collected from the axilla of male donors {{not involved in the}} main experiment. The experimental setup involved the co-presence of the dog's owner, a stranger and the odor dispenser in a space where the dogs could move freely. There were three odor conditions [fear, happiness, and control (no sweat) ] to which the dogs were assigned randomly. The dependent variables were the relevant behaviors of the dogs (e. g., approaching, interacting and gazing) directed to the three targets (owner, stranger, sweat dispenser) aside from the dogs' stress and heart rate indicators. The results indicated with high accuracy that the dogs manifested the predicted behaviors in the three conditions. There were fewer and shorter owner directed behaviors and more stranger directed behaviors when they were in the "happy odor condition" compared to the fear odor and control conditions. In the fear odor condition, they displayed more stressful behaviors. The heart rate data in the control and happy conditions were significantly lower than in the fear condition. Our findings suggest that interspecies emotional communication is facilitated by chemosignals.

25|$|ORS may be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. About 13% of schizophrenics have {{olfactory}} hallucinations. Generally, schizophrenic hallucinations {{are perceived}} as having an imposed, external origin, while in ORS they are recognized as originating from the individual. The suggested diagnostic criteria mean {{that the possibility of}} ORS is negated by a diagnosis of schizophrenia in which persistent delusions of an offensive <b>body</b> <b>odor</b> and olfactory hallucinations are contributing features for criterion A. However, some reported ORS cases were presented as co-morbid. Indeed, some have suggested that ORS may in time transform into schizophrenia, but others state there is little evidence for this. Persons with ORS have none of the other criteria to qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; primary trimethylaminuria), {{also known}} as fish odor {{syndrome}} or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the normal production of an enzyme named flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). When FMO3 is not working correctly or if not enough enzyme is produced, the body loses the ability to properly convert trimethylamine (TMA) from precursor compounds in food digestion into trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), through a process called N-oxidation. Trimethylamine then builds up and is released in the person's sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor or strong <b>body</b> <b>odor.</b> A variant of TMAU (secondary trimethylaminuria or TMAU2) exists {{where there is no}} genetic cause, yet excessive TMA is secreted, possibly due to intestinal dysbiosis, altered metabolism, or hormonal causes.|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a deep voice, broad shoulders, and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, <b>body</b> <b>odor,</b> and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the five}} basic senses, {{olfaction}} provides a unique channel to understand our sensory world and socioemotional experiences. It is phylogenetically old, highly conserved in evolution, and ubiquitously employed in the animal kingdom to communicate identity and motivation. Nevertheless, compared to vision and audition, human olfaction is poorly researched. Here six studies were conducted to probe the sensory properties of human olfactory system and its role in socioemotional communication. Study I examined whether sensory rivalry, as in binocular rivalry, also exists in the olfaction system. Study II looked at the influence of smells on visual perception. Study III tested the effect of chemosensory fearful cues on visual emotional perception. Study IV tested people's ability to detect chemosensory emotional cues and the role of familiarity in their sensitivity to such cues. Study V correlated one's chemosensory ability with his/her emotional capacity to probe the behavioral linkages between human olfaction and emotion. Lastly, Study VI examined the neural correlates of the social nature of natural human <b>body</b> <b>odors</b> by using a group of subjects with various degrees of social anxiety. The results demonstrate that there can be rivalry in olfactory processings between the two nostrils and in the cortex, and olfactory processings interact with visual processings. In addition, olfaction and emotion are closely related to each other. The olfactory system processes the socioemotional information conveyed by natural human <b>body</b> <b>odors,</b> which influences people's behavior and emotional processings, but often without their subjective awareness...|$|R
