25|$|The reader learns a {{great deal}} about what the family was like from how the robots {{continue}} on in their functions. Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> there. Robotic mice vacuum the home and tidy up. As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto {{the side of the house}} (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed. By the next morning, the entire house has collapsed except for one wall that announces the date over and over.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) nanny {{publishes a}} tell-all book, {{revealing}} {{that he has}} never actually had an affair with anyone, a secret he had shared only with Jack in [...] "The Ones". In order to restore his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business {{to spend more time with}} a stripper, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> convinced. To make matters worse, women begin to come forward and admit that they did not have sex with Tracy. His wife Angie even advises him to have an affair in order to save his career, a suggestion which Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) urges him to take seriously. Tracy attempts to proposition Liz, but is unable to pretend he wants to cheat on his wife. Liz rebuffs Tracy's advances, admitting she envies his happy marriage and urging him to embrace his monogamy.|$|E

500|$|Pete (Pemberton), a new mark, enters, but the prank {{does not}} {{work as well as}} with Tina. Among other problems, Pete swears too much and does not seem {{affected}} by the atmosphere, while cues are missed by the pranksters. Terry is surprised to hear a child's voice during Anne's performance as Madam Talbot, and, backstage, the camera stream is blurry. When [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] appears, Pete punches him, and the production crew rush in. The extra drifts {{in and out of consciousness}} before Gemma—having covered her face in blue paint after giving mouth-to-mouth—says he has died. Backstage, people wait for the police and ambulance; Terry is worried about his career, Anne wants to get away for some food and Amanda is keen to retrieve props from the corpse, but Pete and Gemma show some remorse. When alone, Terry looks to the camera feed and sees the extra standing in the séance room, and, relieved, runs to see him. Facing away from Terry and speaking in a rasping voice, the figure introduces himself as [...] "Spirit of Little Boy", and talks of a suicide after the embarrassment of wetting himself on television. After speaking to the [...] "boy", Terry believes that he himself is on Scaredy Cam, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> watching from backstage. When he touches the figure, the extra collapses, but a child's voice continues to shout. A corpse-like child (Wall) begins to rise from the cot used for Madam Talbot's doll. Backstage, Gemma and a police officer look for Terry. They find him in the séance room; he has wet himself, and insists that he is on Scaredy Cam. The child's face appears on the camera feed.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who {{is worried}} {{that he will not}} be able to meet the 8% {{quarterly}} sales growth figures that Robert California (James Spader) asked for by about $800, starts to think of creative ways to sell more paper. During a conference room meeting, he proposes that everyone in the office buy paper to alleviate some of the burden, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> willing. He then decides to ask Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to make a rounding mistake in the books, but Oscar tells Andy that he does not have time to make the mistake because he is leaving for a trivia contest in a bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He tells Andy that the prize is $1,000 and his team is determined to win it. Andy, encouraged by Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), decides to take the entire office to Philadelphia in an attempt to win the money and make up the sales growth difference. At the bar, which turns out to be a gay bar called the Liberty Well, Andy divides the office into three teams: the A-Team consisting of Jim, Darryl, Andy, and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), the B-Team consisting of Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad), and the [...] "Just For Fun" [...] team consisting of Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery). Oscar refuses to join Andy and stays on his original team. Initially, the Dunder Mifflin A-Team does well until they soon falter. However, much to Andy's surprise, the [...] "Just For Fun" [...] team (calling themselves The Einsteins) ends up doing much better than expected because of the group's trivial knowledge on a variety of issues. Humorously, the team misses the answers to a handful of common questions, including one about their namesake. They make it to the final round against Oscar's team and eventually win thanks to Kevin's correct answers. However, the Just for Fun team's luck runs out when they later get demolished while trying to win another bar's even more lucrative trivia contest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first game}} in the stadium was against Ohio Wesleyan University on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, [...] which left people {{concerned}} because the stadium was half empty. This concern was put to rest at the stadium's formal dedication against Michigan on October 21, which the Wolverines won, 190. The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> really sure how many people {{made it into the}} stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.|$|E

2500|$|With {{respect to}} a person's full {{knowledge}} of a certain act being a mortal sin, the Catholic Church teaches that [...] "unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the imputability of a grave offense. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> deemed to be ignorant {{of the principles of}} the moral law, which are written in the conscience of every man. The promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can external pressures or pathological disorders [...] Sin committed through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest." [...] Furthermore, Catholic teaching also holds that [...] "imputability and responsibility for an action can be diminished or even nullified by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, habit, inordinate attachments, and other psychological or social factors." [...] In this regard, a sin committed while one is inebriated may lack the awareness and consent necessary for the sin to be mortal. But when one becomes aware of the danger of excessive drink, such drinking itself becomes a serious matter.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall Sahlins has {{emphasized}} that non-market exchange is constrained by social relationships. That is, exchange in non-market societies is less about acquiring {{the means of}} production (whether land or tools) and more about the redistribution of finished goods throughout a community. These social relationships are largely kinship based. His discussion of types of reciprocity is located within what he calls the [...] "domestic mode of production." [...] His typology of reciprocity thus refers to [...] "cultures lacking a political state, and it applies only insofar as economy and social relations have not been modified by the historic penetration of states." [...] Paul Sillitoe has extended the analysis of reciprocity in these conditions, arguing that the type of reciprocity found will depend upon which sphere of production is being examined. The production of subsistence goods is under the control of domestic units and hence marked by generalized reciprocity. Wealth objects – by their nature from outside – are competitively exchanged to acquire status, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> able to control their production and hence centralize power.|$|E
