Instead, the tubules rapidly elongate to form the parts of the nephron: the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. These last join and establish communications with the collecting duct system derived from the ultimate ramifications of the ureteric bud.

40|$|Background: Comparative {{analysis}} of the cellular biology of the microvasculature in different tissues requires the availability of viable primary endothelial cells (ECs). This study describes a novel method to isolate primary ECs from healthy organs, repair <b>blastemas</b> and tumors as examples of non-proliferating and proliferating benign and malignant tissues and their functional characterization. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single cell suspensions from hearts, lungs, repair <b>blastemas</b> and tumors were incubated consecutively with an anti-CD 31 antibody and magnetic micro-beads, coupled to a derivative of biotin and streptavidin, respectively. Following magnetic bead separation, CD 31 -positive ECs were released by biotin-streptavidin competition. In the absence of micro-beads, ECs became adherent to plastic surfaces. ECs from proliferating repair <b>blastemas</b> and tumors were larger and exhibited higher expression densities of CD 31, CD 105 and CD 102 compared to those from non-proliferating normal tissues such as heart and lung. The expression density of CD 34 was particularly high in tumor-derived ECs, and that of CD 54 and CD 144 in ECs of repair <b>blastemas.</b> Functionally, ECs of non-proliferating and proliferating tissues differed in their capacity to form tubes in matrigel and to align under flow conditions. Conclusions/Significance: This method provides a powerful tool to generate high yields of viable, primary ECs of different origins.

25|$|Regeneration {{research}} using Planarians {{began in the}} late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a <b>blastema</b> formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.|$|E
500|$|According to biology {{professor}} and science {{advisor to the}} X-Files Anne Simon, {{the manner in which}} Betts can regrow limbs is somewhat similar {{to the way in which}} amphibians and newts can regenerate tails and other limbs. She notes that many amphibian cells can [...] "turn back the clock [...] revert back to an [...] time when any fate was possible". In humans, only two types of cells—blood cells and liver cells—are able to regenerate, however, the process is different via the stem cell. Simon also postulates that Betts was able to regenerate because he had a specific relationship between his immune system and his cellular growth. She notes that what Scully and Burks mistook for tumors were actually <b>blastema,</b> or masses of cells capable of growth and regeneration into organs or body parts. Simon also suggests that, for Betts to truly be composed entirely of cancer cells, he would have to lack functioning p53, the tumor suppressor protein. This condition, however, is always fatal.|$|E
2500|$|After amputation, the {{epidermis}} migrates {{to cover}} the stump in [...] 1–2 hours, forming a structure called the wound epithelium (WE). Epidermal cells continue to migrate over the WE, resulting in a thickened, specialized signaling center called the apical epithelial cap (AEC). Over {{the next several days}} there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a <b>blastema</b> (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells). As the <b>blastema</b> forms, pattern formation genes ndash& such as HoxA and HoxD ndash& are activated as they were when the limb was formed in the embryo. The positional identity of the distal tip of the limb (i.e. the autopod, which is the hand or foot) is formed first in the <b>blastema.</b> Intermediate positional identities between the stump and the distal tip are then filled in through a process called intercalation. Motor neurons, muscle, and blood vessels grow with the regenerated limb, and reestablish the connections that were present prior to amputation. The time that this entire process takes varies according to the age of the animal, ranging from about a month to around three months in the adult and then the limb becomes fully functional. Researchers at Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute at Monash University, have published that when macrophages, which eat up material debris, were removed, salamanders lost their ability to regenerate and formed scarred tissue instead.|$|E

We then used an annotation based enrichment analysis tool to analyze the B. neritina transcriptome and identified over-representation of genes related to Wnt signaling pathways, suggesting its involvement in metamorphosis. Finally, we studied the temporal-spatial gene expression studies of several Wnt pathway genes. We found {{that one of the}} Wnt ligand, BnWnt 10, was expressed spatially opposite to the Wnt antagonist BnsFRP within the <b>blastemas,</b> which is the presumptive polypide. Down-stream components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway were exclusively expressed in the <b>blastemas.</b> Bn?catenin and BnFz 5 / 8 were exclusively expressed in the <b>blastemas</b> throughout the metamorphosis. Based on the genes expression patterns, we propose that BnWnt 10 and BnsFRP may relate to the patterning of the polypide, in which the two genes served as positional signals and contributed to the polarization of the <b>blastemas.</b> Another Wnt ligand, BnWnt 6, was expressed in the apical part of the pre-ancestrula epidermis. Overall, our findings suggest that the Wnt signaling pathway may be important to the pattern formation of polypide and the development of epidermis. © 2012 Wong et al...|$|R

[...] Salamander limb regeneration occurs in two main steps. First, the local cells dedifferentiate at the wound site into progenitor to form a <b>blastema</b> Second, the blastemal cells will undergo proliferation, patterning, differentiation and growth using similar genetic mechanisms that deployed during embryonic development.

40|$|SummaryThe {{regenerative}} {{abilities of}} freshwater planarians {{are based on}} neoblasts, stem cells maintained throughout the animal's life. We show that {{a member of the}} Bruno-like family of RNA binding proteins is critical for regulating neoblasts in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. Smed-bruno-like (bruli) mRNA and protein are expressed in neoblasts and the central nervous system. Following bruli RNAi, which eliminates detectable Bruli protein, planarians initiate the proliferative response to amputation and form small <b>blastemas</b> but then undergo tissue regression and lysis. We characterize the neoblast population by using antibodies recognizing SMEDWI- 1 and Histone H 4 (monomethyl-K 20) and cell-cycle markers to label subsets of neoblasts and their progeny. bruli knockdown results in a dramatic reduction/elimination of neoblasts. Our analyses indicate that neoblasts lacking Bruli can respond to wound stimuli and generate progeny that can form <b>blastemas</b> and differentiate; yet, they are unable to self-renew. These results suggest that Bruli is required for stem cell maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bryozoa is a clade {{of aquatic}} protostomes. The bryozoan life cycle {{typically}} comprises a larval stage, which metamorphoses into a sessile adult that proliferates by asexual budding to form colonies. The homology of bryozoan larvae with other protostome larvae is enigmatic. Bryozoan larvae exhibit blastemic tissues {{that contribute to}} build the adult during morphogenesis. However, it remains unclear if the cells of these tissues are pre-determined according to their future fate or if the cells are undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells. Gene expression studies can help to identify molecular patterning of larval and adult tissues and enlighten the evolution of bryozoan life cycle stages. Results We investigated the spatial expression of 13 developmental genes in the larval stage of the gymnolaemate bryozoan Bugula neritina. We found most genes expressed in discrete regions in larval blastemic tissues that form definitive components of the adult body plan. Only two of the 13 genes, BnTropomyosin and BnFoxAB, were exclusively expressed in larval tissues that are discarded during metamorphosis. Conclusions Our {{results suggest that the}} larval <b>blastemas</b> in Bugula are pre-patterned according to their future fate in the adult. The gene expression patterns indicate that some of the bryozoan <b>blastemas</b> can be interpreted to correspond to homologous adult tissues of other animals. This study challenges an earlier proposed view that metazoan larvae share homologous undifferentiated "set-aside cells", and instead points to an independent origin of the bryozoan larval stage with respect to other lophotrochozoans. </p...|$|R

"Strategies {{include the}} {{rearrangement}} of pre-existing tissue, {{the use of}} adult somatic stem cells and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, {{and more than one}} mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal.

[...] During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of cell as they differentiate into different tissues. Development and regeneration involves the coordination and organization of populations cells into a <b>blastema,</b> which is [...] "a mound of stem cells from which regeneration begins." [...] Dedifferentiation of cells means that they lose their tissue-specific characteristics as tissues remodel during the regeneration process.

60|$|Moreover, {{it is to}} be remarked {{in further}} proof of our position, that it finds its clearest and most {{abundant}} illustrations where the conditions of the case are the simplest and most general--where the phenomena are the least involved: we mean in the production of individual cells. The structures which presently arise round nuclei in a <b>blastema,</b> and which have in some way been determined by those nuclei as centres of influence, evidently conform to the law; for the parts of the <b>blastema</b> in contact with the nuclei are differently conditioned from the parts not in contact with them. Again, the formation of a membrane round each of the masses of granules into which the endochrome of an alga-cell breaks up, is an instance of analogous kind. And should the recently-asserted fact that cells may arise round vacuoles in a mass of organizable substance, be confirmed, another good example will be furnished; for such portions of substance as bound these vacant spaces are subject to influences unlike those to which other portions of the substance are subject. If then we can most clearly trace this law of modification in these primordial processes, as well as in those more complex but analogous ones exhibited in the early changes of an ovum, we have strong reason for thinking that the law is fundamental.|$|E

Ambystoma mexicanum, {{commonly known as the}} axolotl, however, is one species that has achieved a remarkable ability to bypass the misfortune associated with a lost limb. Viewed as a model organism in regenerative studies, the axolotl retains extraordinary regenerative properties well into adulthood that humans severely lack. While the basics of regeneration have been described, much about the molecular processes of regeneration is still largely unknown. Thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1), an angiogenesis inhibitor, has been identified as a potential factor to play {{a significant}} role in the regrowth of limbs. Vascularization of tissues is vital to the survival of biological structures, and TSP- 1 has been shown to play a regulatory role in the development and remodeling of tissue vasculature. Here, we study the effect of a loss-of-function mutation in the tsp- 1 gene on the process of limb regeneration in the axolotl. Our studies reveal that tsp- 1 -/- animals lag in regeneration time, developing smaller <b>blastemas</b> in the first three weeks of regeneration. We show that the loss of TSP- 1, however, is not deleterious to the overall process of regeneration as late stage <b>blastemas</b> of the -/- animals catch up in size and development to the wild type animals after three weeks.

As development progresses, expression of rhoC outlines the growing distal tip of the digits, and marks the regions of interphalangeal joint formation.

We combined RNA sequencing of neoblasts from wounded planarians with expression screening and identified 33 transcription factors transcribed in specific differentiated cells and in small fractions of neoblasts during regeneration. Many neoblast subsets expressing distinct tissue-associated transcription factors were present, suggesting candidate specification into many lineages.

The doctrine of omnis cellula e cellula is admitted for plants, and widely prevails with respect to animals. (27/41. Dr. W. Turner 'The Present Aspect of Cellular Pathology' 'Edinburgh Medical Journal' April 1863.) Thus Virchow, the great supporter of the cellular theory, whilst allowing that difficulties exist, maintains that every atom of tissue is derived from cells, and these from pre-existing cells, and these primarily from the egg, which he regards as a great cell. That cells, still retaining the same nature, increase by self-division or proliferation, is admitted by every one. But when an organism undergoes great changes of structure during development, the cells, which at each stage are supposed to be directly derived from previously existing cells, must likewise be greatly changed in nature; this change is attributed by the supporters of the cellular doctrine to some inherent power which the cells possess, and not to any external agency. Others maintain that cells and tissues of all kinds may be formed, independently of pre-existing cells, from plastic lymph or <b>blastema.</b> Whichever view may be correct, every one admits that the body consists of a multitude of organic units, all of which possess their own proper attributes, and are to a certain extent independent of all others.
