25|$|More recently, the kype is {{regarded}} as a secondary sex characteristic displayed by males at the spawning grounds. Therefore, its function is considered to <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> the fish establish a hierarchy among other males where those with larger kypes are dominant over animals with smaller kypes, and/or characteristics that could be of importance in inter- and intra-sexual evaluations of individual quality. The size of the kype is believed to determine male spawning frequency.|$|E

Two months later another raid, which netted over 80 Mafiosi took place, although yet again Provenzano was not among those captured.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Snape {{demonstrates}} {{his expertise}} with potions by brewing the complex Wolfsbane potion {{for the new}} Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin. Throughout the third book, Snape suspects that Lupin may <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> Harry's godfather Sirius Black enter Hogwarts castle; Sirius had been convicted (wrongly, as it is later revealed) of murdering Peter Pettigrew and innocent bystanders, and betraying the Potter family's hiding place to Voldemort. This suspicion stems from Lupin's friendship with Sirius and Harry's father, James, while they were all at Hogwarts as students. Near {{the climax of the}} book, Snape attempts to apprehend Sirius, but Sirius escapes with Harry's aid. Snape informs Dumbledore of this circumstance, and when Harry and Lupin are not punished, Snape retaliates by revealing to the entire school that Lupin is a werewolf, forcing the latter to resign his post.|$|E

At 12:30a.m., hull {{investigations}} were started by the ROK Coast Guard {{with the help of}} flares. As of 6:00a.m., 171 ships, 29 aircraft and 30 divers were involved in the rescue effort. The Korea Coast Guard had assigned 20 divers in teams of two. The ROK Navy had also assigned 8 divers. However, the coast guard prevented navy divers from participating while waiting for divers from Undine Industries. At 7:24a.m., civilian groups of expert divers were reported to <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> out in the rescue operations. During the morning, the number of divers involved in the operations reached 555. The Navy also established a military control tower on a Dokdo-class amphibious assault ship. Starting around 2:00p.m., rescue operations were practically stopped due to bad weather conditions. A marine crane arrived on the scene at night.|$|E

25|$|Homeopathy {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} {{popularity in the}} 19th century. It {{was introduced to the}} United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann. The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the American Institute of Homeopathy, was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States, and by 1900, there were 22 homeopathic colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the United States. Because medical practice of the time relied on ineffective and often dangerous treatments, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of the doctors of the time. Homeopathic preparations, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic preparations less likely to be killed by the treatment that was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> them. The relative success of homeopathy in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of bloodletting and purging and to have begun the move towards more effective, science-based medicine.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that cockroaches are serious vectors of disease. Cockroaches are not vagile, i.e. they do not travel far from their birthplace {{as opposed to the}} housefly which may travel miles from its birthplace. The cockroach will spread its GI tract contents throughout a building. If that is a home it will <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> to spread the diseases that the family and friends bring into the home. [...] In a hospital or a restaurant it can spread diseases from sick to well individuals. [...] They have no bite or sting. [...] It is true that by external contact that cockroaches can carry bacteria such as salmonella onto surfaces. Their shells contain a protein, arylphorin, implicated in asthma and other respiratory conditions.|$|E

500|$|Behind {{the playful}} façade of Candide which has amused so many, there lies very harsh {{criticism}} of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their Inquisition, and the British for {{the execution of}} John Byng. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in Candide. For example, Voltaire mocks the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in Paraguay, Cacambo remarks, [...] " [...] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all…". Here, Voltaire suggests the Christian mission in Paraguay is {{taking advantage of the}} local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to <b>be</b> <b>helping</b> them.|$|E
500|$|Don't Look Now—marketed as a [...] "psychic thriller"—was {{released}} in Britain on 16 October 1973, {{as the main}} feature of a double bill. [...] The Wicker Man was its accompanying 'B' feature and—like Don't Look Now—went on to achieve great acclaim. [...] The two films have thematic similarities, and both end with their protagonists being led to preordained fates by a 'child' they believe to <b>be</b> <b>helping.</b> Michael Deeley, who was managing director of British Lion Films {{at the time of}} the film's release, claimed that the film's US reception was hurt by Paramount Pictures rushing the film into cinemas too early, due to the unexpected failure of Jonathan Livingston Seagull; despite its mismanaged distribution, Peter Bart—from his time at Paramount—recalls it performing [...] "fairly well" [...] at the box office. The film had recouped most of its expenses before it was even released, with its $1.1 million budget offset by the fee Paramount paid for the US distribution rights.|$|E
