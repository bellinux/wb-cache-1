40|$|The {{understanding}} of distribution and aggregation in herring (Clupea harengus) {{can be enhanced}} by integrated multi-scale studies in small ecosystems. Hydro-acoustics, underwater cameras, herring and predator gillnet samples and oceanographical measurements were used to quantify herring schooling dynamics. During autumn (September) after an active feeding period, the herring was distributed in small and dense schools, mostly close to land and in relatively shallow water ( 40 m depth). All recorded herring schools were then vertically extended {{in the water column}} within the most variable temperature and oxygen profiles, presumably enabling individuals to adjust maturation rate to prevailing environmental conditions and synchronize spawning of individuals within the school. From late February prior to spawning, only one major pelagic school was observed, extraordinarily stationary at the only inlet to the inner basin. The pre-spawning herring aggregation was fairly easy to detect acoustically for more than one month. Just prior to spawning and during spawning, herring spread out and became extremely difficult to detect acoustically. Only underwater cameras and <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> <b>gillnets</b> could then be used to identify herring and selected spawning areas. We argue that the dramatic seasonal changes in acoustic detectability and catchability we observe is best understood and predicted based on detailed knowledge of how herring react to a changing environment according to their physiological state and motivation. Such factors should also be taken more systematically into account when performing acoustic surveys in large marine ecosystems. We need to study in more detail the vital underlying processes behind the substantial variability observed in acoustic detectability and catchability of pelagic planktivorous fish species during their annual life cycle in order to better understand and quantify variability in acoustic surveys, and thereby improve our acoustic abundance estimation...|$|R
40|$|The bycatch of {{cetaceans}} {{in fishing}} gear {{is considered to}} be one of the biggest conservation threats to these species. Gear modifications have the potential to reduce these bycatches in global fisheries but there is little available information on how such modifications may change the fishing performance of gear, or indeed the behavior of cetaceans interacting with fishing gear. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to identify factors related to cetacean bycatches in UK <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> <b>gillnets.</b> Rigged net height had a significant positive relationship with harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) bycatch in ICES Area VII suggesting that lowering the profile of gillnets may have the potential to reduce bycatch rates. Modifications to gillnets, such as changing the amount of floatation or increasing the density of the meshes, were found to have significant effects on the active fishing heights of these nets. However, results from a bycatch mitigation trial in Argentina showed that the reduced fishing profile of one experimental net did not result in a concurrent reduction in the bycatch rate of Franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei). While there was no significant difference in the rate, length or intensity of harbour porpoise encounters in the presence or absence of gillnets, the proportion of fast echolocation click trains were significantly higher when a net was present, indicating that porpoises either increased acoustic inspection of the net or foraging in the vicinity of the net. An analysis of underwater video footage collected inside trawl nets in an Australia fishery showed that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) were present inside nets more frequently than they were caught and were actively foraging inside these nets. The orientation of dolphins inside these nets indicates that the current design of excluder devices used in this fishery could be improved to further reduce bycatch rates.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the biology, ecology and anthropogenic threats of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) off Zanzibar, Tanzania, {{based on research}} conducted and samples collected between 2000 and 2008. Distribution and occurrence are described based on incidental catches (bycatch) in gillnet fisheries. Biology and ecology are examined by ageing and studying the reproductive biology and stomach contents of collected specimens. The composition of organohalogen compounds is determined in blubber samples, and assessment and mitigation of bycatch are conducted using observers onboard fishing vessels. Fisheries bycatch data showed that Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins occur year round in all areas around Zanzibar. Sexual maturity was attained between 7 and 8 years and body length 190 - 200 cm in females and at 16 years and body length 213 cm in males. The gestation period {{was estimated to be}} 12. 3 months, with calving occurring throughout the year, peaking November-March and with an interval of 2. 7 years. The estimated pregnancy rate was between 0. 10 and 0. 58 depending on methods used. Stomach contents revealed a relatively large number of prey species, but that only a few small- and medium-sized neritic fish and cephalopods contribute substantially to the diet. Estimates of total annual bycatch were > 9 % which is not considered sustainable. An experiment showed that pingers can be a short term mitigation measure to reduce bycatch of dolphins in both drift- and <b>bottom</b> <b>set</b> <b>gillnets.</b> Methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (Meo-BDEs) were found at higher concentrations than anthropogenic organic pesticides (OCPs), with only traces of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) detected. This study reveals the magnitude and apparent susceptibility of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins off Zanzibar to anthropogenic threats, especially fisheries bycatch, and it is clear that immediate conservation and management measures are needed to reduce bycatch.

2500|$|The venomous tail {{spine of}} the red {{stingray}} is potentially injurious to humans. The Ainu once used the dried tail spine, with the toxic sheath intact, as a weapon. This species is an incidental catch of commercial fisheries targeting flounder and other bottom-dwelling fishes, using <b>bottom</b> trawls, <b>gillnets,</b> <b>set</b> nets, and line gear. It is valued as food in Japan, especially in the Tokyo Bay area where it is consumed in autumn and winter; it may be prepared hard boiled, with miso soup, or as kamaboko. However, {{the small size of}} the red stingray limits its economic importance. [...] Annual catches reported by Japanese fisheries have steadily declined from 20,000 tons in 1950 to varying between 3,959 and 5,388 tons from 1997 to 2004. Such apparent depletion, coupled with continuing heavy fishing pressure and a slow reproductive rate, have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess this species as Near Threatened.|$|R
40|$|Understanding trophic {{interactions}} of non-native species {{is key to}} elucidating their potential ecological role in newly-invaded ecosystems. The Great Lakes region has long been characterized by {{a high rate of}} invasive species establishment. Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were first detected in Lake Michigan in 1994, and have since increased dramatically in abundance. While past studies of Round Goby in Lake Michigan have primarily focused on specific regions and habitats, Lake Michigan is a large, diverse system and Round Goby trophic interactions may vary across regions and over time. During May, July, and September 2010 - 2011, we collected Round Goby (via 2 -hr <b>bottom</b> <b>set,</b> micromesh <b>gillnets)</b> and their potential benthic invertebrate prey at ten sites throughout much of Lake Michigan. In the laboratory, we identified and enumerated diet contents and potential prey items, and homogenized gobies for subsequent fatty acid and δ 13 C and δ 15 N stable isotope quantification. These three trophic indicators provide complementary information regarding trophic interactions. Diet content analysis and stable isotope analyses are well-established approaches and provide detailed quantification of recent (i. e. short term) prey consumption and long-term indexing of production pathways, respectively. In contrast, fatty acid analysis is a relatively novel method for describing trophic interactions over an intermediate temporal scale. Results indicate diets, fatty acids, and stable isotope signatures of gobies vary individually (by size), seasonally, and spatially. Specifically, the three trophic indicators collectively indicate that Round Goby display a greater reliance on near-shore benthic pathways in western Lake Michigan versus a greater reliance on pelagic pathways in eastern Lake Michigan. This spatial pattern may reflect differential prey production related to physical processes and substrate, i. e., relatively high frequency of upwelling events and preponderance of rocky substrate in western Lake Michigan versus downwelling events and predominately sandy substrate in much of eastern Lake Michigan. ...|$|R

40|$|The European Commission has {{acknowledged}} {{the value of}} fleet-based management approaches since the 2001 Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In the 2009 Green Paper, this was again recognized as a key area of interest for future development of the CFP, in particular setting the technical basis for the recent Data Collection Framework (DCF), which specifies the standard for national fishery sampling programs within a pan-European context. These policy changes require deeper and up to date knowledge about European fleets and fisheries, thus encouraging Member States to undertake scientific projects {{in order to obtain}} appropriate fleet segmentations classifying their fishing activities within a hierarchical structure. The work presented in this book is the first comprehensive analysis of the Spanish fleets operating in Atlantic European waters, taking into account both European and national management requirements. This has been possible due to the availability of official logbooks, which provide the broadest perspective on the activity of Spanish fleets in the study area. The only exception to this is small scale fisheries, pursued mainly by vessels of less than 10 m of length and, therefore, not subject to the requirement of keeping logbooks. In order to match better European and Spanish fleet classifications, a new level (“Management Unit”) is proposed here, which is placed between “modalidad”, used in the Spanish regulations, and “métier”, as is defined by the recent DCF. Spanish national waters comprise four fishing grounds, two of which are in the European Atlantic. Nine Management Units have been identified in the Northern Spanish fishing ground: bottom otter trawl (OTB 10), bottom pair trawl (PTB 10), purse seine (PSN 10), set long line (LLS 10), <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> targeting hake (GNS 11), <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> targeting anglerfish (GNS 12), trolling (LTL 11) and bait-boats (LHP 11) targeting albacore, and hand line targeting mackerel (LHP 12). Two Management Units have been identified in Southern Spanish waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 20) and purse seine (PSN 20). In European waters outside Spain, six Management Units have been identified in non-Iberian waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 50), bottom pair trawl (PTB 50), set long line (LLS 50) and <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> (GNS 50) by vessels of more than 100 GRT, and set long line (LLS 60) and <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> (GNS 60) by vessels of less than 100 GRT. Finally, one Management Unit using bottom otter trawl has been found to operate in Portuguese waters (OTB 70). Unluckily, the analyses made on the logbooks of the Spanish fleet using drifting long line could not be used to categorize this fleet due to the geographical limitations of the logbooks available. After detailed analyses and categorization of the Management Units, the results obtained were used in an exercise to test the usefulness and feasibility of using logbook information to answer some DCF requirements. This revealed that logbooks are an essential tool to deal with bioeconomic challenges posed by the new CFP. Versión del edito...|$|R

40|$|Galicia (NW Spain) is an {{important}} fishing region with a high potential for cetacean–fishery interactions. Cetacean depredation on catch and damage to fishing gear can potentially lead to substantial economic loss for fishers, while cetacean bycatch raises conservation concerns. With the aim of gathering information on the types and scale of interactions and of suggesting possible management strategies, we conducted face-to-face interviews with fishers in local fishing harbours, in particular to identify specific problematic interactions and to quantify the level of economic loss and bycatch rates associated with these interactions. We found that cetacean–fishery interactions are frequent, although damage to catch and fishing gear by cetaceans was mostly reported as small. Nevertheless, substantial economic loss can result from common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) damaging coastal gillnets and from short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) scattering fish in purse-seine fisheries. Cetacean bycatch mortality {{was reported to be}} highest for trawls and <b>set</b> <b>gillnets,</b> and probably exceeds sustainable levels for local common and bottlenose dolphin populations. Although interview data may be biased due to the perceptions of interviewees, and therefore should be interpreted with care, the methodology allowed us to cover multiple sites and fisheries within a reasonable time frame. Minimizing cetacean–fishery interactions requires the implementation of case-specific management strategies with the active participation of fishers. For <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> and purse-seine fisheries, the use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) may prevent cetaceans from approaching and getting trapped in the nets. For trawl fisheries, where bycatch appears to be particularly high at night in water depths of 100 – 300 m, possible solutions include the implementation of time/area closures and the relocation of some fishing effort to deeper waters.
