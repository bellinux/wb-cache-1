5|$|Andrei Rublev {{is divided}} into seven episodes, with a prologue and an {{epilogue}} only loosely related to the main film. The main film charts {{the life of the}} great icon painter through seven episodes which either parallel his life or represent episodic transitions in his life. The background is 15th century Russia, a turbulent period characterized <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> between rival princes and the Tatar invasions.|$|E
50|$|Many Syrian actors, {{producers}} and directors left the country; many film sets {{have been destroyed}} or made inaccessible <b>by</b> the <b>fighting.</b> <b>By</b> 2014 only 20 Syrian series were being made, compared to the 40 produced in 2010.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the colony, much of the administration's {{attention}} was focused on consolidating its control <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> the African peoples on the colony's periphery who resisted colonial rule.

5|$|In September 1944, {{the brigade}} formed {{part of the}} second day's {{parachute}} landings at the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden. Problems reaching the bridges in Arnhem forced the divisional commander, Major-General Roy Urquhart, to divert one of the brigade's battalions to assist the 1st Parachute Brigade. After a short delay the brigade headed out for its objective. When only halfway there, however, the remaining two battalions were confronted by prepared German defences. The brigade, having suffered heavy losses, was eventually forced to withdraw. The next day, weakened <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> at close quarters and now numbering around 150 men, the brigade eventually reached the divisional position at Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} episode, the Vorticon {{mothership}} has locked its X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons on eight of Earth's landmarks, and Keen journeys {{to the ship}} to find and deactivate each of the cannons. Keen does so <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> more varied enemies and hazards and a Vorticon at each cannon's control. At {{the end of the}} episode, he discovers that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

5|$|The Story Mode, {{reveals the}} game's plot through battles {{interleaved}} with conversations between the player character and its enemies. It {{vary depending on}} the player's choice and performance in the battles; there is a total of 60 possible endings.

Two players can play in the Versus 2P, and on the Versus CPU the player fight against an AI-controlled character. In addition to those modes, there is a gallery with artworks, character endings, and cut scenes that are unlocked by playing Arcade, Mission and Story Mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when fighting. This {{may have led to}} greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> in the new manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} Michaelmas Task Force was to (1) seize the Saidor area; (2) {{establish}} facilities for a fighter group; (3) {{assist in the}} establishment of air forces in the area; (4) assist {{in the establishment of}} light naval forces in the area; and (5) construct minimal port and base facilities. Notably, it did not contain any explicit instruction to fight the Japanese. Lieutenant General Frank Berryman's Australian II Corps would cooperate by exploitation along the coast, while the Australian 7th Division would contain Japanese forces in the Bogadjim area <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> patrols.|$|E

5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted hyenas act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted hyenas will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the {{abdominal}} cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the hyenas will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the hyenas carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted hyenas are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 hyenas can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted hyenas do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He {{knew exactly what he}} was doing: <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|Florida State earned its bid to the ACC Championship game <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> {{through an}} Atlantic Division {{schedule}} that included several nationally ranked teams. After defeating ninth-ranked Miami in their opening contest, the Seminoles won their next four games before losing at Virginia {{in a close}} match. Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson {{at the end of}} the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game, but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National Championship Game, and the rematch served as a point of public interest.|$|E

5|$|He {{participated in}} attacks {{alongside}} Druze warriors against French positions and {{offices in the}} Hauran, {{and of all the}} rebel commanders from Damascus, al-Bakri was the most respected among the Druze. As fighting between rebels and French forces in the Ghouta escalated, al-Bakri devised an operation to wrest control of Damascus from the French by capturing the citadel and the Azm Palace. The former housed the city's French garrison, while the latter housed the French Mandate High Commissioner Maurice Sarrail. Al-Bakri requested reinforcements from al-Atrash and his men, but they were occupied <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> in the Hauran and notified al-Bakri that any help would be delayed. Al-Bakri decided to move ahead nonetheless. On 17 October, he assembled al-Kharrat's group and another group of rebels from al-Midan and Jaramana inside Damascus. The next day al-Kharrat launched the operation.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Pitt and Jolie {{established}} a charitable organization, the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world. The foundation made initial donations of $1million each to Global Action for Children and Doctors Without Borders, {{followed by an}} October 2006 donation of $100,000 to the Daniel Pearl Foundation, an organization created {{in memory of the}} late American journalist Daniel Pearl. According to federal filings, Pitt and Jolie invested $8.5million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4million in 2006 and $3.4million in 2007. In June 2009 the Jolie-Pitt Foundation donated $1million to a U.N. refugee agency to help Pakistanis displaced <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> between troops and Taliban militants. In January 2010 the foundation donated $1million to Doctors Without Borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the 2/2nd {{was brought}} back to Australia to fight several campaigns against the Japanese. The first of these came in September 1943 when the {{battalion}} landed east of Lae in New Guinea and then {{took part in the}} advance to secure the town, which fell within a fortnight. This was followed <b>by</b> <b>fighting</b> on the Huon Peninsula, which saw the battalion undertake an amphibious landing at Scarlet Beach and then take part in actions around Finschhafen, Sattelberg and Sio until it was withdrawn back to Australia in early 1944. In mid-1945, the machine gunners from the 2/2nd supported landings on Tarakan, Labuan and Brunei Bay as part of Allied efforts to recapture Borneo. After the war, the battalion was disbanded in February 1946.|$|E
