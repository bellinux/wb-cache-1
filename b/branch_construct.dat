This <b>branch</b> <b>construct</b> {{is a new}} operator type that allows arbitrary branching from one location in an individual’s execution tree to another. The branch {{can be understood as}} alternatively allowing arbitrary code reuse or approximating access to a potentially infinite number of automatically defined functions. This paper describes the proposed design of this branch operator. This proposed design is then implemented in a real world system, and the performance effects of the branch operator are evaluated in two well known genetic programming problems: the artificial ant problem and the lawnmower problem. [1, 2] The branch is found to provide some performance benefits in both of these problems, and areas for further investigation are outlined. Introduction and Overview In the day-to-day programming done by humans, most all control structures in code originate from a high level. Whether programming in a low-level language like C or a higher-level language like LISP, we are accustomed to using high-level control constructs like functions, loops, if statements, and recursion to control the path of execution and maximize code reuse. The thought of using a branch, or “goto ” or “jump...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial derived lipoproteins {{constitute}} potent macrophage activators in vivo and {{are effective}} stimuli, enhancing the immune response especially {{with respect to}} low or non-immunogenic compounds. In the present study we have prepared <b>branched</b> lipopeptide <b>constructs</b> in which different (B- and T-cell) epitopes of Herpes simplex virus type 1, derived from glycoproteins B (gB) and D (gD), are linked to a synthetic lipid core. The ability of the lipid core peptide (LCP) constructs (LCP-gB and LCP-gD) to induce cytokine expression and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade has been evaluated and compared with the behaviour of the isolated epitopes and the lipid core. In this respect, the use of LCP technology coupled {{with the use of}} three different gB or gD peptide epitopes in the same <b>branched</b> <b>constructs</b> could represent an interesting approach in order to obtain efficient delivery systems {{in the development of a}} synthetic multiepitopic vaccine for the prevention of viral infections...|$|R
