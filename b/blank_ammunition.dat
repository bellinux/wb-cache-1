5|$|The tenth {{anniversary of}} the RLI's {{formation}} on 1 February 1961 was commemorated on 30 January 1971 with a special military tattoo, held at Glamis Stadium in Salisbury. The Battalion spent three weeks rehearsing for the three-hour tattoo, {{which was the first}} held by a single military unit in Rhodesia. The men gave demonstrations of drilling, physical training and unarmed combat; a staged assault on a guerrilla camp was held by 2 Commando, using <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> and dummy mortars. The show culminated with a sky-dive by three Battalion Parachute Club members, Captain Garth Barrett, Sergeant Dennis Croukamp and Major John Pierson. Following this a retreat ceremony was held as well as a final march-past by all participants.|$|E
25|$|HEAT M67 Shell had {{non-adjustable}} propelling charge. For <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition,</b> {{a shorter}} Cartridge Case M15 with black powder charge was used.|$|E
25|$|During {{training}} with <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition,</b> a special plug {{is added to}} the muzzle of the FAMAS. This plug is necessary for automatic or semi-automatic blank fire operation, and functions by blocking part of the gas used in a blank bullet.|$|E
50|$|When firing blanks, the M13 or M13A1 blank-firing adaptor (BFA) is {{necessary}} in order to produce enough gas pressure to cycle the weapon with <b>blanks.</b> All <b>ammunition</b> must be fixed in a NATO standard M13 disintegrating metallic split-link belt to feed into the weapon.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the first}} shoots of the video, in Pallasseum a big {{apartment}} house in Schöneberg, Fler drove {{in a white}} VW Van with the film team and two friends to the next location. As they stopped at a traffic lights, a silver Volvo stopped next to them and four men attacked them armed with knives, one machine gun (with <b>blank</b> <b>ammunitions)</b> and nightsticks. Fler and the others could escape without being harmed. [...] "I'm glad that in the machine gun were just blank ammunitions", told Fler seriously the magazine Bravo HipHop Special, [...] "but nobody realized {{it in the first}} moment". The car was slightly damaged: it has a bump and the car door was winged out of the hinges. [...] "When I saw the gun, I was frightened to death", said Fler.|$|R
50|$|Mounted {{shooting}} uses {{black powder}} theatrical blanks with no bullet. Companies such as Western Stage Props, Buffalo Blanks, Circle E Blanks, Lonesome Pine, and Whitehouse <b>Blanks</b> manufacture certified <b>ammunition</b> for competition. These blanks were originally used in movie production {{and on the}} theatrical stage so that flame and smoke {{can be seen from}} the muzzle of the firearm. A slow-burning powder component of the blank can break a balloon target at a range of up to 20 feet (6 m).|$|R
25|$|A blank-firing adapter or blank-firing {{attachment}} (BFA), {{sometimes called}} a blank adapter or blank attachment, is a device {{used in conjunction}} with <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Blank firing adapters are required for allowing blanks to cycle most automatic firearms. It can also be a safety feature designed so if a live round is mistakenly fired, most of the energy is spent smashing through the BFA reducing both the range and damage inflicted. A BFA may also divert the hot gases from a blank discharge out to the sides, reducing the risk of injury to the target of an aimed shot.|$|E
500|$|On 23 April, Carmichael-Smyth {{announced}} a parade {{for the following}} day, during which {{the men of the}} regiment would be taught the new drill, using the muskets and ammunition which they had been using for years, rather than the new rifles or ammunition. During that evening, the men decided that they would not accept the cartridges; some approached a junior officer directly, and when they were told that none of the new cartridges were being used, they stated that using any type of cartridge would [...] "lay themselves open to the imputation from their comrades and from other regiments of having fired the objectionable ones." [...] These concerns were communicated to Carmichael-Smyth, who decided that the parade would go ahead as planned; during the night, Carmichael-Smyth's tent and some buildings were destroyed by fire. The following morning, 90 men, the regiment's carabiniers or skirmishers, were lined up to carry out the new parade drill using <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition.</b> When Carmichael-Smyth arrived at the parade ground, he found that no man had taken their ammunition, and he ordered the Havildar Major to carry out the drill. There was then an attempt to distribute the cartridges {{to the rest of the}} carabiniers but this was refused, despite a speech from Carmichael-Smyth reminding the men that the cartridges were the type they had been using for years. Out of 90 men, 85 refused the order to accept the ammunition.|$|E
2500|$|Foal Eagle 1999 {{took place}} between 26 October and 5 November 1999, and that year's {{exercise}} scenario involved defending against infiltration by North Korean special operation forces into the rear area. [...] Most training sites were located well south of Seoul, with training events included firing <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> and night operations.|$|E
50|$|What {{followed}} was panic and chaos. While some 'detachments' vigorously fought back, launching numerous counter-attacks despite heavy losses and throwing improvised sulfur bombs at the tanks, other prisoners hid or committed suicide. The tanks, T-34s, alternately ran over prisoners or brought down barrack walls where prisoners were hiding, and used <b>blank</b> rounds of <b>ammunition</b> to strike terror and confusion into the prisoners. The hundreds of helmeted Red Army soldiers that flooded the camp were using live ammunition, though, and with these many prisoners were killed. Some tanks carried in barbed wire-laden trestles, {{and these were}} immediately set down {{as a means of}} quickly dividing up the camp and hindering the prisoners' freedom of movement. The leaders of the uprising were specifically targeted by designated squads of soldiers and they were taken into custody alive, many of whom were later tried and executed. After ninety minutes of violence, the remaining live prisoners, most of whom were in hiding, were ordered to come out on the promise {{that they would not be}} shot.|$|R
5000|$|With bump-firing it {{is common}} to [...] "empty the mag" [...] with but it becomes easy to create a {{stoppage}} as the cycling of all semiautomatic firearms requires the bolt to move against the stationary firearm (low-mass semiautomatic pistols suffer from the same problem due to [...] "limp wristing". The bolt must complete the stroke against the spring and that doesn't happen if both the bolt and spring are moving rearward. Non-bump fire rifles can suffer the same failure from fouling or for undercharged <b>ammunition.</b> <b>Blanks</b> also can cause these failures. Additionally, it is possible that if a weapon is bump fired too fast, the hammer will be released before the bolt closes. This will either cause the hammer to [...] "ride" [...] the bolt carrier without firing the chambered round, or cause the weapon to slamfire. If a weapon with a locking bolt slamfires, there is an inherent danger of the weapon firing before the bolt is fully closed and locked, potentially causing an explosion and injuring the user.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{developmental}} {{versions of}} ammunition were prepared beginning in 1910 before approximately 1,000 Pattern 1913 Enfield rifles with 600,000 rounds of RL18000C trials cartridges {{were distributed to}} troops in 1913. The great majority of troop trial ammunition was manufactured by the Royal Laboratory with the headstamp simply [...] "R^L", {{but it was also}} made by Kings Norton, Kynoch and Greenwood and Batley. Although the troop trial round was never formally approved, it was referred to as [...] "Cartridge S.A. Ball [...]276 inch Mark I" [...] in some documents and on the packet labels. The troops' trials rifles and ammunition were distributed to the musketry school at Hythe, to one squadron in each of three cavalry regiments, and to one company in each of eight infantry battalions. One of the cavalry squadrons was stationed in South Africa and one of the infantry companies was stationed in Egypt. The remainder of the units were in the United Kingdom. Cartridges were packaged in 5-round stripper clips similar to those used by the Mauser Gewehr 98 and M1903 Springfield rifles. Ball ammunition was loaded with 49.3 gr g of cordite MDT behind 165 gr g cupronickel-jacketed [...]282 in diameter 1.365 in long spitzer bullets. The bullet core was made of 98% lead and 2% antimony alloy. Drill rounds containing no primer or powder have been reported in two versions. One has a tin-plated case with the standard bullet, and the other has a round-nose wood bullet with an unplated brass case.Inert Dummy or Inspection, RL20408 <b>blank</b> and proof <b>ammunition</b> was also produced based on the case of RL 18000C. Proof test ammunition was made in a RL 18000.B(i) variant for use with pressure barrels and a RL 18000.B(j) variant for proofing rifles.|$|R
2500|$|Mainstream {{academics}} {{reject the}} Baconian theory (along with other [...] "alternative authorship" [...] theories), citing {{a range of}} evidence – not least of all its reliance on a conspiracy theory. [...] As far back as 1879, a New York Herald scribe bemoaned the waste of [...] "considerable <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> [...] in this ridiculous war between the Baconians and the Shakespearians", while Richard Garnett made the common objection that Bacon was far too busy with his own work to {{have had time to}} create the entire canon of another writer too, declaring that [...] "Baconians talk as if Bacon had nothing to do but to write his play at his chambers and send it to his factotum, Shakespeare, {{at the other end of}} the town." ...|$|E

50|$|HEAT M67 Shell was {{originally}} designed as fixed round, with Cartridge Case M14 type II. It was later changed to semi-fixed type {{with the standard}} cartridge, but with non-adjustable propelling charge. For <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition,</b> a shorter Cartridge Case M15 with black powder charge was used.|$|E
50|$|The quick-change barrel, {{ended with}} a slotted flash suppressor, has a fixed handle used to remove it. The machine gun uses three types of barrels: a light profile, heavy profile (in a heavy machine gun role), and special type (used for firing <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Deployable Tactical Engagement System is a {{training}} device manufactured by SAAB {{used by the}} British Army.

50|$|<b>Blank</b> <b>ammunition,</b> {{which is}} a primed casing filled with gunpowder, either crimped or covered with a wad, is {{dangerous}} up to 15 feet. In the past, people have injured or killed themselves believing that blanks were not dangerous. Therefore, gun safety rules apply even to guns loaded with blanks.|$|E

50|$|There {{also is a}} soda/beer can {{launcher}}. Unlike {{the golf}} ball launcher that screws onto {{the end of the}} barrel, where the AR-15/m16 family of rifles' flash hider attaches, the can launcher tube is fitted directly to the AR-15 upper receiver and is the entire barrel assembly. Both the golf ball launcher and can launcher require use of <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cowboy mounted {{shooting}} (also called western mounted {{shooting and}} mounted shooting) is a competitive equestrian sport involving the riding {{of a horse}} to negotiate a shooting pattern. Depending on sponsoring organizations, it can {{be based on the}} historical reenactment of historic shooting events held at Wild West Shows in the late 19th century. Modern events use <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> instead of live rounds, certified to break a target balloon within twenty feet.|$|E
50|$|An {{offshoot}} of cowboy action shooting is cowboy mounted shooting, also sometimes called western mounted shooting, or simply mounted shooting. Events {{require that the}} contestant ride a horse through a course of fire while carrying the same guns used in cowboy action shooting. The rider shoots up to ten balloon targets. Events use <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> certified to break a target balloon within twenty feet instead of live rounds.|$|E
50|$|Ownership of handguns is {{forbidden}} to the public, hunting rifles and ceremonial swords are {{registered with the}} police, and the manufacture and sale of firearms are regulated. The production and sale of live and <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> are also controlled, as are the transportation and importation of all weapons. Crimes are seldom committed with firearms, yet knives remain a problem {{that the government is}} looking into, especially after the Akihabara massacre.|$|E
50|$|Tactical battles are {{generally}} not open to the public. Tactical battles are fought like real battles with both sides coming up with strategies and tactics to beat their opponents. With no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and on-site judges, tactical battles {{can be considered a}} form of Live action role-playing game, but, in the cases where firearms are used, with real weapons firing <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> (depending on gun control ordinances).|$|E
50|$|Threading is {{provided}} at the muzzle {{to work with}} certain muzzle devices made by Heckler & Koch, including: a slotted flash suppressor, blank firing attachment (marked with a red-painted band denoting use with <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> only), an adapter for launching rifle grenades (for use with rifle-style grenades with an inside diameter of 22 mm using a special grenade launching cartridge) and a cup-type attachment used to launch tear gas grenades. An optional three-lugged barrel is also available for mounting a quick-detachable suppressor.|$|E
50|$|Dependent {{upon the}} type of projectile, {{ammunition}} for these guns is classified as high explosive, target practice, blank, or drill. The high explosive projectile contains a high explosive filler. The target practice projectile contains no explosive; it consists of either a solid projectile (designated shot) or a heavy-walled projectile with an empty base cavity. The <b>blank</b> <b>ammunition</b> has a black powder (low explosive) charge in the cartridge case and no projectile. The drill ammunition consists of completely inert cartridge which simulates the service ammunition.|$|E
