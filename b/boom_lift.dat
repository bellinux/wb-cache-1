50|$|A {{telescopic}} handler, {{also called}} a telehandler, teleporter, or <b>boom</b> <b>lift,</b> is a machine {{widely used in}} agriculture and industry. It is somewhat like a forklift but has a , making it more a crane than a forklift, with the increased versatility of a single telescopic or articulating boom that can extend forwards and upwards from the vehicle. On {{the end of the}} boom the operator can fit one of several attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, muck grab, or winch. Telehandlers are sometimes called cherry pickers in North America, as that name can refer to any truck or heavy equipment that has such a boom.|$|E

50|$|Railcar movers {{are fairly}} lightweight, {{so in order}} to gain more {{traction}} some models transfer weight from the car they are hauling onto their own wheels to increase their effective weight. These models use steel wheels on steel rail, much like a locomotive, which provides a more consistent traction among wider variety of conditions. The steel wheels also last far longer than rubber tires and overall cost less to operate. In Australia, construction equipment such as loaders and telehanders are converted to shunting use and on these machines, the <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> is used to transfer weight from the car to the drive wheels. In Europe, trucks (lorries) fitted with railway wheels and couplings are used as rail car movers (often called towing or shunting vehicles).|$|E
5000|$|JLG {{electric-powered}} and engine-powered {{aerial work}} platforms {{are designed for}} a variety of job sites, such as steel mills and chemical plants, airports, convention centers, shipyards and heavy construction. There are models with lift heights ranging from 30 feet to 185 feet, the worlds tallest self-propelled aerial work platform. JLG’s exclusive QuikStik boom design delivers fast cycle speeds - 115 seconds from ground to elevation. In addition, JLG Ultra Series boom lifts come with the only oscillating axle in their boom class, providing enhanced mobility. The Ultra Booms also have full-time four-wheel drive for superior traction. In 2011, JLG introduced the award-winning 1500SJ, which is the first straight <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> that takes workers to 150 feet without an oversized load permit (over weight permit is required for highway transportation).|$|E

5000|$|Part of {{the running}} rigging, topping lifts are {{primarily}} used to hold a boom up when the sail is lowered. http://www.sailingusa.info/weather_and_reefing.htm This line would run from near the free end of the boom(s) forward {{to the top of}} the mast. The line may be run over a block at the top of the mast and down to the deck to allow it to be adjusted. For small booms, the topping lift may be run from end of the boom to the backstay or next mast aft. When the sail is raised again, the topping lift is loosened or removed. On sailboats used for racing, <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> function is frequently incorporated into the boom vang system, to reduce the number of lines aloft.

50|$|The {{defining}} element for Lyons {{design for}} the Swanston Academic Building was its central site to Melbourne’s CBD, which influenced its footprint and form. Adrian Stanic (Lyons Architectural Director and RMIT alumnus) said in a media release (22/10/2010) “We saw the site as a {{focal point of the}} city and looked at how the SAB could create a dialogue with the other landmark buildings that define Melbourne. The process involved mapping lines from the site to these buildings. Using these lines we then created a computerized algorithm that generated the three-dimensional shapes and form of the building. We also put a <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> on site and hoisted architectural photographer Dianna Snape up to photographically capture the vistas from the 11 levels of the building. The best viewpoints then became the location for the student ‘portals’ on each level that connect student activities inside the building with the surrounding cityscape. In this way we have created a design that integrates the building into the very heart of Melbourne architecturally, but also reflects and embraces the broader architectural legacy of the city.” Predominant colours of Melbourne were derived from a survey, which has been reflected in the colour palette of the SAB. Lyons has connected the Swanston Academic Building {{to the rest of the}} RMIT campus by designing it with “a sense of openness, transparency and energy". When designing the layout for the Swanston Academic Building, Lyons consulted extensively with a wide range of academic staff to gather information about learning and teaching methodologies (both current and future), including learning and teaching spaces that would aid their teaching practice.|$|E
5000|$|On June 21, 2008, Kalitta was fatally injured {{during the}} final round of {{qualifying}} for the Lucas Oil NHRA SuperNationals at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park. [...] Kalitta's Funny Car was traveling at about 300 mph when the engine exploded in flames near the finish line. The parachutes were damaged and failed to slow the vehicle. According to the New Jersey State Police official news release evidence discovered in Kalitta’s lane revealed that he had applied mechanical braking and maintained steering control of the vehicle throughout the 2235-foot-long “shutdown” portion of the racetrack. Post-crash examination of the vehicle further revealed the clutch system to be locked, maintaining engine power to the rear wheels. Witnesses and audio recordings reveal the vehicle’s engine was firing throughout the shutdown portion of the racetrack, which further reinforced the fact that the vehicle’s engine was still providing power for some period of time. Kalitta's vehicle {{reached the end of the}} paved race track and went through a sand trap at around 125 mph. The vehicle went over the concrete retaining wall. The vehicle continued forward and impacted a piece of heavy equipment (JLG model 600S telescopic <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> vehicle), which was positioned outside the “run-off” area by the ESPN television crew. This impact caused catastrophic damage to the vehicle and additional separation of chassis components and the vehicle's engine. The largest portion of the race vehicle came to rest in a grassy area 250' south of the shutdown area. Kalitta was contained in this portion of the race vehicle and had sustained fatal blunt force injuries. A review of information provided by Delphi, which was recorded by accelerometers mounted to the Kalitta vehicle, revealed multiple impacts producing over 100 G, with some approaching or exceeding 200 G. He was transported to the Old Bridge Division of Raritan Bay Medical Center and was pronounced dead on arrival.|$|E

40|$|In {{mechanized}} forestry, much of {{the work}} is conducted by use of cranes, and recovering potential energy is a possible method to reduce energy consumption when using cranes for lift work. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the capacity of a new »Energy-efficient hydraulic lift cylinder« (EHLC), which has a secondary cylinder built into its piston rod, to store potential energy from lowering the boom in the form of pressurized hydraulic oil in an accumulator and using the stored energy in the next <b>boom</b> <b>lift.</b> The EHLC was mounted on a forwarder, and manipulated to enable its use also as a standard cylinder. We then compared the EHLC and a standard cylinder in terms of function and energy consumption during repetitive boom lifts and lowerings. With the tested settings the EHLC saved up to approximately 9. 4 % of the energy consumed during the first part of boom lifts and up to 3. 2 % of the total lift energy. With possible further adjustments, such as optimization of the accumulator size, enlargement of the assisting cylinder diameter, and enhancement of the accumulator pressurization, but most importantly reduction in internal leakage, the current EHLC could have commercial potential...|$|E
40|$|Characterising {{radiation}} from wildland fires {{is an important}} focus of fire science because radiation relates directly to the combustion process and can be measured across {{a wide range of}} spatial extents and resolutions. As part of a more comprehensive set of measurements collected during the 2012 Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research (RxCADRE) field campaign, we used ground, airborne and spaceborne sensors to measure fire radiative power (FRP) from whole fires, applying different methods to small (2 ha) and large (. 100 ha) burn blocks. For small blocks (n 1 / 46), FRP estimated from an obliquely oriented long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera mounted on a <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> were compared with FRP derived from combined data from tower-mounted radiometers and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS). For large burn blocks (n 1 / 43), satellite FRP measurements from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors were compared with near-coincident FRP measurements derived from a LWIR imaging system aboard a piloted aircraft. We describe measurements and consider their strengths and weaknesses. Until quantitative sensors exist for small RPAS, their use in fire research will remain limited. For oblique, airborne and satellite sensors, further FRP measurement development is needed along with greater replication of coincident measurements, which we show to be feasible...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{the nursery}} {{industry}} lacks an automated inventory control system. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) software and aerial images {{could be used}} to count plants in nurseries. The objectives of this research were: 1) to evaluate the effect of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight altitude and plant canopy separation of container-grown plants on count accuracy using aerial images and 2) to evaluate the effect of plant canopy shape, presence of flowers, and plant status (living and dead) on counting accuracy of container-grown plants using remote sensing images. Images were analyzed using Feature Analyst® (FA) and an algorithm trained using MATLAB®. Total count error, false positives and unidentified plants were recorded from output images using FA; only total count error was reported for the MATLAB algorithm. For objective 1, images were taken at 6, 12 and 22 m above the ground using a UAV. Plants were placed on black fabric and gravel, and spaced as follows: 5 cm between canopy edges, canopy edges touching, and 5 cm of canopy edge overlap. In general, when both methods were considered, total count error was smaller [ranging from - 5 (undercount) to 4 (over count) ] when plants were fully separated with the exception of images taken at 22 m. FA showed a smaller total count error (- 2) than MATLAB (- 5) when plants were placed on black fabric than those placed on gravel. For objective 2, the plan was to continue using the UAV, however, due to the unexpected disruption of the GPS-based navigation by heightened solar flare activity in 2013, a <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> that could provide images on a more reliable basis was used. When images obtained using a <b>boom</b> <b>lift</b> were analyzed using FA {{there was no difference between}} variables measured when an algorithm trained with an image displaying regular or irregular plant canopy shape was applied to images displaying both plant canopy shapes even though the canopy shape of `Sea Green 2 ̆ 7 juniper is less compact than `Plumosa Compacta 2 ̆ 7. There was a significant difference in all variables measured between images of flowering and non-flowering plants, when non-flowering `samples 2 ̆ 7 were used to train the counting algorithm and analyzed with FA. No dead plants were counted as living and vice versa, when data were analyzed using FA. When the algorithm trained in MATLAB was applied, there was no significant difference in total count errors when plant canopy shape and presence of flowers were evaluated. Based on the combined results from these separate experiments, FA and MATLAB algorithms appear to be fairly robust when used to count container-grown plants from images taken at the heights specified...|$|E

40|$|On June 4, 2003, a 49 year-old male {{millwright}} {{employed at}} a magnetic powder manufacturing company sustained fatal injuries when an {{aerial work platform}} (an extensible articulating <b>boom</b> <b>lift)</b> he was operating tipped over. On {{the day of the}} incident, the victim and a co-worker operated the lift that was leased from a local leasing company to perform maintenance tasks. The aerial lift was equipped with a stabilizing device: an extendable axle to enhance the vehicle’s stability. The manufacturer stated in the Operators and Safety Manual that all operators must properly position the extendable axle and lock it into position before raising the platform or extending the boom. There were two safety features on the lift that were designed to ensure the use of the stabilizing device: an axle set indicator light and an interlock. A post incident test showed that while the indicator light worked, the interlock was inoperable. The plant maintenance crew did not receive the Operators and Safety Manual from the leasing company nor did they receive any training on how to operate the lift. According to the witnesses, the extendable axle was never set out during the entire day of the incident. At approximately 3 : 30 PM, the victim was performing a visual inspection of the exterior of a bucket elevator that was about 70 feet high.

40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} <b>boom</b> <b>lifting</b> and slewing need to repeat ten {{hundreds}} times in truck crane operating reliability, resulting in lasting {{for dozens of}} days. It is difficult for the inspection officials to supervise the entire procedures, which influences the objectivity of examination. A monitoring system was developed based on virtual instrument technology. It consisted of the load lifting height detection nodes, boom slewing counter module and data collector, etc. The height was measured by two relative-distance wireless nodes {{which are based on}} CSS (Chirp Spread Spectrum, CSS) technology. The boom slewing count was achieved by logic circuit. The signal of it was input by two sensors which were distributed at 180 °. The height and count were transported to data collector via wireless network. The number of cycles of <b>boom</b> <b>lifting</b> and slewing was automatically judged by client software in data collector based on the height and slewing count. Preliminary experiments were conducted. A total of 800 experiments were tried and 793 times were successfully counted. The accuracy was 99. 1 %.
