40|$|Abstract: Recently the {{potential}} development of green architecture {{in our country}} is huge, but inaccurate control of green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost</b> is the key reason for restricting its development. After analyzing influencing factors of green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost,</b> four influencing factors are put forward:technical measures, project regions,fixed position and time to research feasibility. On basis of the factors, the ways are proposed to reduce green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost,</b> which provides theoretical basis {{for the development of}} green architecture. introduction China has promoted green building thoroughly,but people still have misunderstanding about green <b>building’s</b> <b>cost</b> at present: <b>cost</b> of <b>building</b> will increase much when connecting with “green”. Green <b>building</b> signifies high <b>cost.</b> Professionals in architecture and real estate also overestimate green <b>building’s</b> <b>cost</b> that even reaches up to 300 %. The reason that causes misunderstanding is the choice of pilot projects with relatively high price in previous green real estate; the theory of high technological mansion is propagated greatly. Although the primary investment <b>cost</b> of green <b>building</b> is higher than normal building, we should also notice the profit brought by green <b>building</b> except incremental <b>cost.</b> （ 1 ）direct benefit-energy conservation and expense-saving produced by incrementa...|$|R

40|$|A pre-tender <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> {{estimate}} {{is an important}} piece of information when making decisions at the project planning and design stage. The important project characteristics influencing the accuracy of pre-tender <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> estimates are examined and practical improvement for increasing the accuracy of estimates are considered. A quantitative approach is used to address the research problem. Analysis of data from 56 projects and from a postal questionnaire survey of 102 quantity surveying firms suggests that the accuracy of pre-tender <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> estimates varies according to project size and principal structural material. When eight identified project characteristics are controlled in a multiple regression analysis, the accuracy of estimates is influenced by project size. The estimates of smaller projects are more biased than the estimates of larger projects. It was discovered that pre-tender <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> are more often overestimated than are underestimated. Overestimated forecasts are incorrect by a larger amount than underestimated forecasts. Data analysis also revealed that the accuracy of pre-tender <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> estimates has not improved over time. The {{majority of the respondents}} are somewhat dissatisfied with the accuracy of estimates in the industry. Probability estimation and simulation of past estimates, reducing quantity surveying and cost engineering skill turnover, incorporating market sentiments into estimates, early involvement of the quantity surveyor at the brief stage, and proper documentation of experience gained in the estimation of projects should help firms increase the accuracy of estimates for new projects.
