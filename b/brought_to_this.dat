25|$|Hugo Philipp Jacob Wolf (13 March 1860 – 22 February 1903) was an Austrian {{composer}} of Slovene origin, particularly {{noted for}} his art songs, or Lieder.

In particular, at the handover of the first native title grant to the Gurindji people at Wattie Creek in the Northern Territory in 1975, Stanner recommended Prime Minister Gough Whitlam should perform the memorable symbolic act of pouring earth through the hands of Gurindji leader, Vincent Lingiari.|$|E

25|$|Australia has {{a unique}} {{tradition}} of folk music, with origins in both the indigenous music traditions of the original Australian inhabitants, {{as well as the}} introduced folk music (including sea shanties) of 18th and 19th century Europe. Celtic, English, German and Scandinavian folk traditions predominated in this first wave of European immigrant music. The Australian tradition is, in this sense, related to the traditions of other countries with similar ethnic, historical and political origins, such as New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. The Australian indigenous tradition <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> mix novel elements, including new instruments, some of which are now internationally familiar, such as the didgeridoo of Northern Australia.|$|E
25|$|Southwest Drive and Catclaw Drive {{have become}} the source of {{multiple}} new businesses, {{many of which are}} national chains with their first Abilene location. Two new shopping centers have been created in the area since 2005, Shops at Abilene and Abilene Marketplace, though the latter currently only has one tenant. Also, Buffalo Gap Road and Ridgemont Drive have been a constant area for retail and business and still continues to develop. Here the Mall of Abilene has been a strong spur for commerce since the 1980s, after it was constructed in 1979. Contained is a list of several new businesses <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> commercial district {{since the turn of the}} century.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{surviving}} {{epitome of}} the lost Trojan War epic of Arctinus of Miletus, the remains of Achilles and Patroclus were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> island by Thetis, {{to be put in}} a sanctuary, furnishing the aition, or founding myth of the Hellenic cult of Achilles centred here. Ruins believed to be of a square temple dedicated to Achilles, 30 meters to a side, were discovered by the Russian naval Capt. N.D.Kritzkii in 1823, but the subsequent construction of a lighthouse on the very site obliterated all trace of it. Ovid, who was banished to Tomis, mentions the island, so do Ptolemy and Strabo. The island is described in Pliny the Elder's Natural History, IV.27.1.|$|E

25|$|Prior to World War II, the U.S. Army {{constructed}} a new fort in Richmond County, Camp Gordon, which was finished {{a few days}} after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Many new soldiers were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> camp to train to go off to war. Within the few months after WWII, many of the GIs at Camp Gordon had been sent back home, and the importance of the army in the community seemed to almost come to an end. Music legend James Brown, then a teenager, often performed for the soldiers. Brown grew up in Augusta during the 1930s and 1940s (he lived with his aunt, who was the madam of a house of prostitution).|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{contains the}} crypt and an octagonal chapel in the center. The crypt is therefore beneath the terrace, and its perimetrical and axial corridors intersect {{to create the}} central area where the chapel, which includes an altar, is located. Also set in the chapel are the remains of twelve Italian Gold Medals of Military Valor. Along {{the walls of the}} corridors are burial niches holding the remains of 33,086 fallen Italian soldiers, whose bodies were exhumed from 35 nearby war cemeteries between 1935 and 1938. The identified remains are in individual burial niches in alphabetical order, and the unidentified remains are in two communal tombs. Of the Italians buried in this memorial, 12,795 are known and 20,291 are unknown. Some years later the remains of 18,505 Austro-Hungarian soldiers, 12,355 of which are unidentified, were also gathered from surrounding war cemeteries and <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> crypt.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after a Prussian {{official}} in Soldau forwarded the information that on 18 August 1708 the plague had reached the village of Piekielko on the Polish side of the border, the epidemic had crossed into the village of Bialutten on the Prussian side, killing most of its inhabitants within a month. The Prussian authorities reacted by containing the village with a palisade; however, the survivors, led by the local reverend, had already taken refuge in the nearby woods. On 13 September 1708, a Prussian official from Hohenstein reported that the plague had been <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> small border town by {{the son of the}} local hatter returning from Polish service. By December, 400 people had died in Hohenstein. While the plague faded out during the hard winter, food became scarce due to war contributions and conscription, and the cordon sanitaire and the respective restrictions were lifted by edict on 12 July 1709.|$|E

25|$|At {{the back}} of the town house lie six of the seven provost's lamps of the former royal burghs within Kirkcaldy district. The six lamps are from: Kirkcaldy, Burntisland, Kinghorn, Leven, and Buckhaven and Methil. These lamps once stood outside the houses of senior councillors, and were all <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> site when the royal burghs were {{abolished}} in 1975. Only the lamp for Leslie is not there. Around the building, both of the town's two coats of arms can be seen. The spiritual coat of arms showing St Bryce is located at the south entrance and the one which depicts Dunfermline Abbey is at the west entrance. Inside the building itself, displayed across the stairwell is a mural designed by Walter Pritchard of the Glasgow School of Art. This makes references to the industries associated with the town such as linoleum, coal mining and weaving. Other references are to famous people such as Adam Smith and the Adam Brothers. Charles II is shown granting the town its royal burgh status in 1644, received by a figure in a Sinclair tartan.|$|E

All French army vehicles were eventually <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> newer standard; the designation remained AMX 30B.|$|E

500|$|The Flowering Orchards (also the Orchards in Blossom) {{are among}} the first groups of work {{completed}} after Van Gogh's arrival in Arles in February 1888. The 14 paintings are optimistic, joyous and visually expressive of the burgeoning spring. They are delicately sensitive and unpopulated. He painted swiftly, and although he <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> series a version of Impressionism, {{a strong sense of}} personal style began to emerge during this period. The transience of the blossoming trees, and the passing of the season, seemed to align with his sense of impermanence and belief in a new beginning in Arles. During the blossoming of the trees that spring, he found [...] "a world of motifs that {{could not have been more}} Japanese". Vincent wrote to Theo on 21 April 1888 that he had 10 orchards and [...] "one big [...] of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled".|$|E
500|$|A boy called Simon was celebrating his 12th birthday, and was {{impressed}} by a magician who pulled rabbits out of hats and conjuring infinite amounts of gaily coloured handkerchiefs. A dog wrapped in paper turned up at the door, who had a book that nobody was able to read. Although Simon's parents were unaware of who had sent the dog, they adopted him and Simon called him Chippy. The book was stored in the loft. One day, Simon hears Chippy in the loft. Investigating, Simon finds that the book is titled [...] "Ye Olde Spellbooke". Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, only for a portal to open above it. Chippy quickly goes through the portal and Simon follows, ending up in another world. After escaping from some goblins who intended to eat Simon, he quickly discovers {{a house in a}} village belonging to a wizard called Calypso, along with a note from him. Through it, Simon learns he was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> world to save Calypso from the evil sorcerer, Sordid.|$|E
