5000|$|The wedge {{pattern is}} a {{commonly}} found {{pattern in the}} price charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc.). The pattern {{is characterized by a}} contracting range in prices coupled with an upward trend in prices (known as a rising wedge) or a downward trend in prices (known as a falling wedge). [...] __FORCETOC__A wedge pattern {{is considered to be a}} pattern which is forming at the top or bottom of the trend. It is a type of formation in which trading activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>point</b> creates another difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes itself, the wedge pattern loses its effectiveness as a technical indicator.|$|E

50|$|Tenders {{to supply}} the cable and other {{equipment}} were undertaken and the main supplier, Felten and Guilleaume (West Germany) was selected in early 1959). The details of the contracts were finalised by mid-1959. The cable for the Canberra-Melbourne link was manufactured by a subcontractor (Olympic Cables Pty Ltd) in Australia. The remaining cable and carrier equipment were manufactured in West Germany. Construction work was undertaken by staff of the PMG.The initial shipment of cable arrived from Germany {{at the end of}} 1959. Cable laying was completed in October 1961 and jointing and testing completed in December 1961.In total, over 960 kilometres of cable were laid and over one million tons of rock and soil excavated to lay the cable. Main repeater stations (which were attended by staff) were constructed every 64 kilometres and minor, unmanned repeater stations every 9 kilometres (103 in total. The main repeater stations also provided <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>points</b> to connect minor trunk routes to regional towns (e.g. Goulburn, Yass, Gundagai). Many of the repeater stations remain today along the route, along with cable markers and other reminders of the project.|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms exhibit a multicellular developmental life cycle analogous {{to that of}} the myxobacteria. In non-mucoid PAO 1 biofilms cultured in glass flow cells the phenotypic differentiation of microcolonies into a motile phenotype in the interior of the microcolony and a non-motile surrounding 'wall phenotype' are described. After differentiation the interior cells coordinately evacuated the microcolony from local <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>points</b> and spread over the wall of the flow cell, suggesting that the specialized microcolonies were analogous to crude fruiting bodies. A microcolony diameter of approximately 80 microm was required for differentiation, suggesting that regulation was related to cell density and mass transfer conditions. This phenomenon was termed 'seeding dispersal' to differentiate it from 'erosion' which is the passive removal of single cells by fluid shear. Using the flow cell culturing method, in which reproducible seeding phenotype in PAO 1 wild-type was demonstrated, the effects of quorum sensing (QS) and rhamnolipid production (factors previously identified as important in determining biofilm structure) on seeding dispersal using knockout mutants isogenic with PAO 1 was investigated. Rhamnolipid (rhlA) was not required for seeding dispersal but las/rhl QS (PAO 1 -JP 2) was, in our system. To assess the clinical relevance of these data, mucoid P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolate FRD 1 was also investigated and was seeding-dispersal-negative...|$|R

5000|$|Farther {{away from}} the {{eruption}} point, lava can flow in an unchanneled, fan-like manner as it leaves its source, which is usually another lava tube leading back to the eruption point. Called pāhoehoe flows, these areas of surface-moving lava cool, forming either a smooth or rough, ropy surface. The lava continues to flow this way until it begins to block its source. At this point, the subsurface lava is still hot enough to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> at a <b>point,</b> and from this point the lava begins as a new [...] "source". Lava flows from the previous source to this breakout point as the surrounding lava of the pāhoehoe flow cools. This forms an underground channel that becomes a lava tube.|$|R

Skilled attackers are often able to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down computing environments and intentionally misuse shared access computers. This misuse has resulted in cases of mass identity theft and fraud, some of which have had an estimated cost ranging in millions. In order to determine if it is possible to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down computing environments an assessment method is required. Although a number of vulnerability assessment techniques exist, none of the existing techniques are sufficient for assessing locked down shared access computers. This is due to the existing techniques focusing on traditional, application specific, software vulnerabilities. <b>Break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities (which are exploited by attackers in order to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down environments) differ substantially from traditional vulnerabilities, and as a consequence are not easily discovered using existing techniques.
