2500|$|For {{periodic}} functions, {{both the}} Fourier transform and the DTFT comprise only a discrete set of frequency components (Fourier series), and the transforms diverge at those frequencies.

2500|$|From {{the time}} of the fall of Rome, Wales was divided into {{numerous}} petty [...] "kingdoms" [...] (gwledydd, lit. [...] "peoples") which were repeatedly unified and then redivided.

2500|$|As {{a method}} of sending a missile to the higher, and even highest, part of the earth's {{atmospheric}} envelope, Professor Goddard's multiple-charge rocket is a practicable, and therefore promising device.

It is not obvious, however, that the instruments {{would return to the}} point of departure; indeed, it is obvious that they would not, for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do.

2500|$|In Roy Webber's The County Cricket Championship, {{he asserts}} that the {{championship}} [...] "is generally accepted as starting in the 1873 season <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> convenient date decided upon many years later" [...] because 1873 was [...] "the first season in which rules of county qualification were in operation". Webber acknowledges the difficulties posed from 1873 to 1890 by varying programmes with some county clubs playing many more matches than others. For example, in 1874 when Derbyshire was held by some to have won the title, they played only four matches while Yorkshire played twelve. A list of champions for the period would be subjective and in most seasons there would be strongly competing claims. In general, it may be asserted that Gloucestershire with all three Grace brothers were the strongest team {{in most of the}} 1870s; Nottinghamshire were in the ascendancy from about 1879 to 1886; and then Surrey from 1887 through the start of the official championship in 1890.|$|E

2500|$|This intuition can be formalized {{by saying}} that any two finite totally ordered sets of the same {{cardinality}} have a natural isomorphism, the one that sends the least element {{of the first to}} the least element of the second, the least element of what remains in the first to the least element of what remains in the second, and so forth, but in general, pairs of sets of a given finite cardinality are not naturally isomorphic because {{there is more than one}} choice of map—except if the cardinality is 0 or 1, where there is a unique choice. different isomorphisms between two sets with three elements. This is equal to the number of automorphisms of a given three-element set (which in turn is equal to the order of the symmetric group on three letters), and more generally one has that the set of isomorphisms between two objects, denoted [...] is a torsor for the automorphism group of A, [...] and also a torsor for the automorphism group of B. In fact, automorphisms of an object are a key reason to be concerned with the distinction between isomorphism and equality, as demonstrated in the effect of change of basis on the identification of a vector space with its dual or with its double dual, as elaborated in the sequel. On this view and in this sense, these two sets are not equal because one cannot consider them identical: one can choose an isomorphism between them, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> weaker claim than identity—and valid only in the context of the chosen isomorphism.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of June 30, McClellan, who had {{witnessed}} none of the fighting, wired the War Department: [...] "My Army has behaved superbly and have done all that men could do.

[...] He later requested 50,000 reinforcements (which the War Department had no chance of providing). [...] "With them, I will retrieve our fortunes." [...] McClellan has received significant criticism from historians about his detachment from the battle, sailing on the Galena out of touch while his men fought. Ethan Rafuse wrote that after McClellan supervised the deployment of three corps near the Glendale crossroads, what he did next [...] "almost defies belief. ... Even though his men were at the time engaged in a fierce battle near Glendale ... he spent the afternoon on board the Galena, dining with [...] Rodgers and traveling briefly up river to watch the gunboat shelling of a Confederate division that had been spotted marching east along the River road toward Malvern Hill." [...] Brian K. Burton wrote that, [...] "more than on any other day, McClellan's judgment on the thirtieth is suspect. He had arranged for signal communications between Malvern Hill and the river <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> poor substitute.

2500|$|Expert advice {{published}} in the 2010 document Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation is to shelter in place, in an area away from building fires, for at least 1 to 2 hours following a nuclear detonation and fallout arriving, [...] with the greatest benefit, assuming personnel are in a building with a high protection factor, is sheltering for no less than 12 to 24 hours before evacuation. Therefore, sheltering {{for the first few}} hours can save lives. Indeed, death and injury from local fallout is regarded by experts as the most preventable of all the effects of a nuclear detonation, being simply dependent on if personnel know how to identify an adequate shelter when they see one and enter one quickly, with the number of potential people saved being cited as in the hundreds of thousands. Or even higher if the remaining occupants of the city are made aware of the contaminated areas, by emergency systems, within hours of the events aftermath. In 2009-2013 a further iteration on sheltering-in-place was made to determine the optimal improvised fallout-shelter-residence-times following a nuclear detonation, with computer analysis, and including a summary of prior studies and guidance, it was found that individuals should quickly get into the best intact building at least under 5 minutes distant in travel time following the detonation and they should stay there for at least 30 minutes before venturing out to find a shelter with a higher protection factor <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> greater travel time away +10 minutes. However, although this would be effective in cases were the initial building protection factor is less than about 10, it requires a high degree of individual situational awareness that may be optimistic to assume following the shock of a nuclear detonation, if a building with a PF of 20 or more is nearby, such as the fallout shelters depicted in the film, {{in the vast majority of}} fallout circumstances, it would not be advisable to leave it until 3+ hours have elapsed following the initial arrival of the local fallout.|$|E
