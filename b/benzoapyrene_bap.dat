5000|$|Extensions of the {{adaptive}} response are the toxic responses elicited by Ahr activation. Toxicity results {{from two different}} ways of Ahr signaling. The first is {{a side effect of}} {{the adaptive}} response in which the induction of metabolizing enzymes results in the production of toxic metabolites. For example, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon <b>benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP),</b> a ligand for Ahr, induces its own metabolism and bioactivation to a toxic metabolite via the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in several tissues. The second approach to toxicity is the result of aberrant changes in global gene transcription beyond those observed in the [...] "Ahr gene battery." [...] These global changes in gene expression lead to adverse changes in cellular processes and function. Microarray analysis has proved most beneficial in understanding and characterizing this response.|$|E
50|$|Cooking any meat {{at a high}} {{temperature}} or smoking meat produces carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs). The subgroups of heterocyclic amines compounds are amino-dimethylimidazo-quinoxaline (MelQx), amino-dimethylimidazo-quinoxaline (DiMelQx), and amino-methyl-phenylimidazo-pyridine (PhIP), which are mostly formed when meat is cooked at {{high temperature}}s. <b>Benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> is another compound found in meat cooked at extremely high temperatures. This aromatic hydrocarbon is normally found in coal tar, wood burning, or automobile exhaust fumes. According to a study, there was 36% of the MeIQx and 50% of DiMeIQx present in a well-done barbecued steak; contrary, 20% of PhIP was present in a medium-done barbecued steak. Likely because of these factors, marinating fresh lean red meat, and thoroughly cooking it at a low temperature will reduce the production of carcinogenic compounds and thereby {{lower the risk of}} colorectal cancer.|$|E
50|$|The British Geological Survey {{reported}} {{the amount and}} distribution of PAH compounds including parent and alkylated forms in urban soils at 76 locations in Greater London, UK. The study showed that parent (16 PAH) content ranged from 4 to 67 mg/kg (dry wt soil) and an average PAH concentration of 18 mg/kg (dry wt soil) whereas the total PAH content (33 PAH) ranged from 6 to 88 mg/kg and fluoranthene and pyrene were generally the most abundant PAH. <b>Benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> the most toxic of the parent PAH is widely considered a key marker PAH for environmental assessments; the normal background concentration of BaP in the London urban sites was 6.9 mg/kg (dry wt soils). London soils contained more stable 4-6 ring PAH which were indicative of combustion/pyrolytic sources such as coal/oil burning and traffic sourced particulates. However, the overall distribution also suggested that the PAHs in London soils had undergone weathering and been modified {{by a variety of}} pre-and post-depositional processes such as volatilization and microbial biodegradation.|$|E
30|$|This study {{aims for}} {{reporting}} on the determination of selected organic contaminants in moss samples from Germany taken {{within the framework of}} the 2015 European moss survey. In the European moss survey programme, since 1990, every 5  years, moss have been sampled at up to about 7300 sites in up to 36 countries, among them Germany. Within the European moss survey programme, sampling, chemical determination of heavy metals (since 1990), nitrogen (since 2005), as well as POP and POP-like substances (since 2010) in moss specimens, quality control and statistical evaluation were conducted according to a harmonized methodology [25]. In Germany, (persistent) organic pollutants in moss samples were to be determined for the first time within this programme in 2015. Therefore, this study aims for the determination of a wide range of organic pollutants to get insight of their extent of accumulation and distribution in moss from Germany. As some of these contaminants were also monitored in tree leaf samples within the German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB), accumulation in moss should be compared to that in tree leaves. Among the target analytes of this study are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) including <b>benzo(a)pyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> as classical air pollutant with limit value of 1  ng m− 3 in ambient air (PM 10) [15], PCDD/F, PCB, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), PBDE as well as novel or emerging halogenated flame retardants (HFR) of different substance classes (Dechloranes, brominated aromates, brominated ethers, cyclic HFR). Overall, 120 target analytes were investigated.|$|E
40|$|Exfoliated cells, {{isolated}} from breast milk samples donated by UK-resident women (n= 15), were incubated, either immediately or after culture for 7 days, {{with one of}} a series of genotoxins, either in the presence or absence of the DNA-repair inhibitors, hydroxyurea (HU), and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). The numbers of DNA single-strand breaks induced were then assessed as comet tail length (CTL) () using the alkaline single cell?gel electrophoresis (?Comet?) assay; cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. The heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) (2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo 4, 5 -bpyridine (PhIP) (0. 4 mM), 3 -amino- 1, 4 -dimethyl- 5 H-pyrido 4, 3 -bindole (Trp-P- 1) (1. 67 mM), 3 -amino- 1 -methyl- 5 H-pyrido 4, 3 -bindole (Trp-P- 2) (1. 77 mM)), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (<b>benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> (0. 36 mM)), a nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (1 -nitropyrene (1 -NP) (1. 84 mM)) and aromatic amines (o-toluidine (0. 85 mM), p-chloroaniline (0. 71 mM)) each induced statistically significant (P< 0. 0001, Mann?Whitney test) increases in median CTLs in breast milk cells from all the donors examined when incubated (30 min, 37 ?C) in the presence of HU/ara-C. In some cases, these compounds were also active in the absence of the repair inhibitors. There were marked variations in comet formation between donors and between genotoxins. Cell culture appeared to increase the epithelial cell proportion and cultured cells retained their ability to activate genotoxins. The results suggest that breast milk is a valuable source of human mammary cells for the study of the metabolic activation of possible carcinogens...|$|E
40|$|In indoor {{environment}} situations severe odour nuisances often limits or prevents use. This often {{is reason to}} check indoor Air PAH-contamination which mainly derive {{from a variety of}} building material containing coal tar constituents. Today the use of tar as an additive to wood-preservatives, solvents and building material is strongly restricted in Germany (GefStoffV) but other sources for similar odours are fire-events, asphalt and bitumen products. Using a modified VDI method 3875 - 1 including an additional sampling on Polyurethane-foam for analysing air-samples, very variable patterns of single PAH concentrations are obtained which correspond to the source-type. While high concentrations with naphthalene are regularly found indoors, not volatile and rather dust-borne PAH like <b>Benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> rarely occur in concentrations about 2 ng/m. Some PAH have a very high carcinogenic potency in human, some smell intensively. However, as the absence of the characteristic smell does not implicate the absence of PAH, it cannot be used for remediation guidelines and health-concerns remain. For remediation official threshold guideline levels and remediation action criteria are needed. In this course a risk-assessment is proposed using PAH toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) against BaP. Multiplication with measured concentrations and summarising leads to the Cancerogenic Equivalence Sum (KEsum) for the 16 measured PAH. Using data on the additional cancer risk through definite BaP-exposition in the PAH mixture of coking plant gas (unit risk) we can postulate a KEsum of 1, 36 for this gas. On a basis of this scaling we can quantify the additional cancer risk for various air samples. Accepted risks of 10 - 4 and 5 · 10 - 4 lead to guideline values for successful remediation of KEsum = 10. 0. Case studies are shown where the scheme could successfully be applied as the main criteria for building remediations...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure in oesophageal epithelial tissue and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) case status in an ESCC case - control study in a high-risk population in north-eastern Iran. Methods: Tissue microarrays (TMAs) of non-tumoral oesophageal biopsies from patients with biopsy-proven ESCC and gastrointestinal clinic patients with no endoscopic or biopsy evidence of ESCC (control subjects) in a rural region in north-eastern Iran were immunohistochemically stained. Immunohistochemistry was performed using monoclonal antibodies 8 E 11 and 5 D 11 raised against <b>benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> diol epoxide (BPDE) -I-modified guanosine and BPDE-I-modified DNA, respectively. Staining intensity was quantified by image analysis and the average staining in three replicates was calculated. The main outcome measure was adjusted ORs with 95 % CIs for the association between antibody staining intensity and ESCC case status. Results: Cultured ESCC cells exposed to BaP in vitro showed dose-dependent staining with 8 E 11 but not with 5 D 11. With 8 E 11, sufficient epithelial tissue was available in the TMA cores to analyse 91 cases and 103 controls. Compared with the lowest quintile of 8 E 11 staining in the controls, adjusted ORs for the 2 nd to 5 th quintiles were 2. 42, 5. 77, 11. 3 and 26. 6 (95 % CI 5. 21 to 135), respectively (p for trend < 0. 001). With 5 D 11, 89 cases and 101 controls were analysed. No association between staining and case status was observed (ORs for the 2 nd to 5 th quintiles were 1. 26, 0. 88, 1. 06 and 1. 63 (95 % CI 0. 63 to 4. 21), p for trend= 0. 40). Conclusions Dramatically higher levels of 8 E 11 staining were observed in non-tumoral oesophageal epithelium from patients with ESCC than from control subjects. This finding strengthens the evidence for a causal role for PAHs in oesophageal carcinogenesis in north-eastern Iran...|$|E
40|$|Differences in the {{incidence}} of prostate cancer (CaP) amongst different migrant populations point to causative agents of dietary and/or environmental origin. Prostate tissues were obtained following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or radical retropubic prostatectomy. After surgery, TURP-derived or tumour-adjacent tissue fragments were minced in warm PFMR- 4 A medium (37 ?C) and suspensions pipetted into collagen-coated petri dishes. Non-adherent material was removed by washing with fresh medium after 12 h. Adhered cells subsequently reacted positively with monoclonal antibodies to prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA was also detected in the medium. The genotoxicities of the chemical carcinogens 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo 4, 5 -b pyridine (PhIP), its N-hydroxy metabolite (N-OH-PhIP) and <b>benzoapyrene</b> (<b>BaP)</b> in adherent cell populations from different donors (n= 8) were examined. Cells were treated in suspension for 30 min at 37 ?C {{in the presence of the}} DNA repair inhibitors hydroxyurea (HU) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). DNA single-strand breaks were detected in cells by the alkaline single cell-gel electrophoresis ('Comet') assay and quantified by measuring comet tail length (CTL) in m. All three carcinogens induced dose-related increases in CTLs (P< 0. 0001) in cells from four donors 24 h post-seeding. However, in cells from a further two donors the genotoxic effects of PhIP, N-OH-PhIP and BaP were much less apparent after 48 h than after 24 h in culture. After 96 h in culture, cells from these donors appeared to be resistant to the comet-forming activity of the compounds. However, BaP-DNA adducts were still measurable by 32 P-postlabelling for up to 14 days following a 24 -h exposure to 50 M BaP in adhered cells from another two donors. This study shows that primary cultures of cells derived from the prostate can activate members of two classes of chemical carcinogens. Further development may provide a robust model system in which to investigate the aetiology of CaP...|$|E
