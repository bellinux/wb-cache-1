5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bite</b> <b>force</b> {{estimates}} for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This {{study concluded that}} Deinonychus likely had a maximum <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture marks in the bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> of Deinonychus {{was significantly higher than}} earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.|$|E
5|$|Gignac {{and colleagues}} also noted, however, that bone {{puncture}} marks from Deinonychus are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like Tyrannosaurus, Deinonychus {{probably did not}} frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} smaller mandibles {{and need to}} chew through {{decaying}} wood to lay eggs, females {{are thought to have}} a greater <b>biting</b> <b>force.</b> However, contrary to popular belief, the <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> of the male mandibles can in fact exceed the <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> of the females, for example, the <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> of Cyclommatus metallifer males was found to 3 times that of females.|$|R

A comparison of the maximum <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> between dementia and non-dementia groups using the t-test showed that it was significantly stronger in the non-dementia group than in the dementia group regardless of sex (at the 5 % level for males and the 1 % level for females).

Os pacientes eram portadores de próteses parciais removíveis inferiores classes I, II ou III. A arcada antagonista era prótese, parcial removível ou fixa, ou total. Os resultados permitiram concluir que: as selas de extremidade livre, principalmente em suas posições extremas, conduziram a forças de mordida muito baixas; o envolvimento de prótese total, também, conduziu a forças de mordida baixas; o sexo masculino alcançou valores maiores que o feminino; com prótese parcial removível classe III, os dentes naturais molares e pré-molares desenvolveram valores maiores do que com classes I e II.

5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons <b>bite</b> <b>force.</b> Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|Eudimorphodonts can {{be divided}} into two major categories-those with long, robust wings similar to Campylognathoides, and those with long, slender wings. Species in the former category, {{including}} Carniadactylus and Eudimorphodon itself, were highly aerial animals and fast, agile flyers. The former was almost certainly insectivorous due to its small size; Eudimorphodon has been found with fish remains in its stomach. Slender-winged species, such as Austriadactylus and Caviramus, were likely terrestrial/semiarboreal in habits, and potentially generalists. Caviramus likely had a strong <b>bite</b> <b>force,</b> indicating an adaptation towards hard foods. All eudimorphodonts possessed well-developed molariform teeth and could chew their food, as indicated by the tooth wear on Caviramus and Eudimorphodon teeth. Austriadactylus and Eudimorphodon had a pair of these molariform teeth developed into enlarged fangs.|$|E
40|$|Muscle groups {{affected}} on <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> {{are called}} temporal muscle {{as a major}} and masseter muscle as a minor. According to the human posture stability, forces of these muscles vary with the force directions. In this case, experimental investigation is strictly important such that <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> under different postural and eye- positional situations is changed. In this study, seven-male and seven-female within the age-range of 17 - 24 are considered corresponding to having with restorated molar tooth and without that type of tooth. With the help of specially designed biting fork, different posture- and eye-positions are investigated for experimental <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> analysis. Changes in eye-positions are not indicated significant difference for all postural positions. On one hand, it is obtained that <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> of no-filling tooth in men becomes maximum if facial muscles give full effort to biting. On the other hand, effect of facial muscles for women is not clearly noticed depending on the postural differences...|$|R

5|$|The {{distinct}} {{shape of}} the skull shows that Deinocheirus had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs. The beak {{was similar to that}} of ducks, which indicates it may have likewise foraged in water, or browsed near the ground like some sauropods and hadrosaurs. The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison {{to the size of the}} skull, which indicates Deinocheirus had a weak <b>bite</b> <b>force.</b> The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft understorey or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in sucking in food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs from the food they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more <b>bite</b> <b>force</b> than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E

40|$|Durophagous crabs {{successfully}} hunt hard-shelled prey by subjecting them to extremely strong <b>biting</b> <b>forces</b> {{using their}} claws. Here I show that, {{for a given}} body mass, six species of Cancer crabs (Cancer antennarius, Cancer branneri, Cancer gracilis, Cancer magister, Cancer oregonensis and Cancer productus) were able to exert mean maximum <b>biting</b> <b>forces</b> greater than the forces exerted in any other activity by most other animals. These strong <b>biting</b> <b>forces</b> were in part {{a result of the}} high stresses (740 - 1350 kN m(- 2)) generated by the claw closer muscle. Furthermore, the maximum muscle stress increased with increasing mean resting sarcomere length (10 - 18 microm) for the closer muscle of the claws of these six Cancer species. A more extensive analysis incorporating published data on muscle stresses in other animal groups revealed that stress scales isometrically with the resting sarcomere length among species, as predicted by the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. Therefore, muscle or filament traits other than a very long mean sarcomere length need not be invoked in explaining the high stresses generated by crustacean claws...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} felids {{are known}} from the Oligocene of Europe, such as Proailurus, and the earliest one with saber-tooth features is the Miocene genus Pseudaelurus. The skull and mandible morphology of the earliest saber-toothed cats {{was similar to that}} of the modern clouded leopards (Neofelis). The lineage further adapted to the precision killing of large animals by developing elongated canine teeth and wider gapes, in the process sacrificing high <b>bite</b> <b>force.</b> As their canines became longer, the bodies of the cats became more robust for immobilizing prey. In derived smilodontins and homotherins, the lumbar region of the spine and the tail became shortened, as did the hind limbs. Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, the lineages of Homotherium and Smilodon are estimated to have diverged about 18 Ma ago. The earliest species of Smilodon is S.gracilis, which existed from 2.5 million to 500,000 years ago (early Blancan to Irvingtonian ages) and was the successor in North America of Megantereon, from which it probably evolved. Megantereon itself had entered North America from Eurasia during the Pliocene, along with Homotherium. S.gracilis reached the northern regions of South America in the Early Pleistocene as part of the Great American Interchange. The younger Smilodon species are probably derived from S.gracilis. S.fatalis existed 1.6 million–10,000 years ago (late Irvingtonian to Rancholabrean ages), and replaced S.gracilis in North America. S.populator existed 1 million–10,000 years ago (Ensenadan to Lujanian ages); it occurred in the eastern parts of South America.|$|E

40|$|Masticatory <b>force</b> and <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> {{applied to}} the teeth are shown {{experimentally}} to generate compressive force to the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ). This force {{is referred to as}} "temporomandibular joint load". Normal TMJs are both tolerable and adaptable to a certain amount of load, although excessive loads are believed to be a cause of TMJ dysfunctions. Thus, TMJ load can be considered to be controlled to a certain extent by the stomatognathic system, so as not to exceed a certain limit. In order to clarify the amount of load {{applied to the}} TMJ, the magnitude and direction of TMJ load have been estimated intensively under various biting conditions, employing a static equilibrium analysis. The controllability of TMJ load, however, has yet to be investigated sufficiently, due to the difficulty of manipulating various model parameters. To simplify this analysis, we employed a two-dimensional jaw model incorporating three masticatory muscles, masseter (assumed to include internal pterygoid), the anterior portion of temporalis, and lateral pterygoid, which function dominantly during biting. We determined the location, the orientation and the magnitude of muscle forces of our model, employing morphological and electro myographic data reported previously. Biting force is assumed to be applied solely to the first molar. We carried out two distinct experiments to obtain TMJ load: 1) under various magnitudes of force on each muscle, and 2) under various directions of TMJ force, while other model parameters are all fixed. Experimental results indicated that the anterior portion of the temporalis can generate <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> without amplifying the magnitude of TMJ load, and additionally can control the direction of TMJ load. This load was clarified, for the first time, to be minimized when it points in a certain direction, under the condition of a fixed <b>biting</b> <b>force.</b> This direction corresponded to that anatomically optimum to support compressive forces, and was independent of the direction of <b>biting</b> <b>force.</b> It was also verified to be reduced by applying <b>biting</b> <b>force</b> somewhat antero-inferiorly. These results suggest that TMJ load can be considered to be controllable by coordinated activities of masticatory muscles...|$|R

However, how <b>bite</b> <b>forces</b> scale during {{ontogeny}} across the clade {{has yet to}} be studied. Here we test the hypotheses that extant crocodylians share positively allometric and statistically comparable developmental scaling coefficients for maximal bite-force capacity relative to body size. To do this, we measured <b>bite</b> <b>forces</b> in the Australian freshwater crocodile Crocodylus johnsoni and the Saltwater crocodile C.  porosus, and determined how performance changed during ontogeny. We statistically compared these results with those for the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis using 95 % prediction intervals and interpreted our findings in a phylogenetic context. We found no observable taxon-specific shifts in the intraspecific scaling of biomechanical performance. Instead, all bite-force values in our crocodylid dataset fell within the bounds of the A.  mississippiensis 95 % prediction intervals, suggesting similar bite-force capacity when same-sized individuals are compared. This holds true regardless of differences in developmental stage, potential adult body size, rostro-dental form, bone mineralization, cranial suturing, dietary differences or phylogenetic relatedness. These findings suggest that intraspecific bite-force scaling for crocodylians with feeding ecologies comparable with those of extant forms has likely remained evolutionarily static during their diversification...|$|R

The incidence of claw damage was correlated with the degree of wear, suggesting that claws later in the intermolt interval were more likely to fail. Within species, safety factors increased from 3. 1 to 4. 6 with increasing instar number due primarily to a decline in muscle stress (force per unit area of apodeme).
