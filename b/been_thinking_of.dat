5|$|Pistrucci was {{introduced}} to Lord and Lady Spencer by Banks. Lady Spencer showed Pistrucci a model of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style {{as part of her}} husband's regalia as a Knight of the Garter. Pistrucci had already <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> such a work, and he produced the cameo. The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet's Hotel in Leicester Square, where he had stayed after coming to London.|$|E
25|$|The {{well-known}} aphorism, , {{is probably}} due to Alfréd Rényi, although it is often attributed to Rényi's colleague Paul Erdős (and Rényi may have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Erdős), who was famous for the many theorems he produced, the number of his collaborations, and his coffee drinking.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{speculate}} that Takami {{may have been}} attempting to make up this lost time by increasing the train's speed beyond customary limits. Many reports from surviving passengers indicate that the train was travelling faster than normal. Plus, the driver might have been stressed because he would be punished both for having passed by a red light and for having overshot the platform at Itami Station. Ten months before the crash, Takami had been reprimanded for overshooting a station platform by 100 meters. In the minutes {{leading up to the}} derailment, he might have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the punishment he would face, and not totally focused on driving.|$|E
25|$|After a {{four-year}} absence, Lucy Speed {{decided that she}} wanted to return to the series. She mentioned this to her former castmate Ross Kemp, who played Grant Mitchell in the serial and he initiated contact between Speed and then executive-producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> introducing a new love-interest for the character Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson) and he had already considered the possibility that the love interest could be Natalie. Speed has commented “It was good timing. He thought I and the character fit the bill.” Natalie made her reappearance on-screen on 8 March 1999 and a relationship between the two characters was developed. A friendship was also re-established between the characters Natalie and Bianca in a special four-hander episode – although “the closeness was never quite the same”.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} antique Testament of Solomon, Abyzou (as Obizuth) is {{described}} as having a “greenish gleaming face with dishevelled serpent-like hair”; {{the rest of her}} body is covered by darkness. The speaker (“King Solomon”) encounters a series of demons, binds and tortures each in turn, and inquires into their activities; then he metes out punishment or controls them as he sees fit. Put to the test, Abyzou says that she does not sleep, but rather wanders the world looking for women about to give birth; given the opportunity, she will strangle newborns. She claims also to be the source of many other afflictions, including deafness, eye trouble, obstructions of the throat, madness, and bodily pain. Solomon orders that she be chained by her own hair and hung {{up in front of the}} Temple in public view. The writer of the Testament appears to have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> the gorgoneion, or the icon of the Medusa’s head, which often adorned Greek temples and occasionally Jewish synagogues in late antiquity.|$|E

25|$|Will {{returns to}} The Great Hall, and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals {{the first sign}} within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure {{to help him get}} the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his {{affections}} for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for immortal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom.|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] {{was written}} after Gilligan had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> a story {{involving}} a [...] "memory vampire" [...] for months. Furthermore, the episode was MacLaren's directorial debut. Noted director Kim Manners helped guide {{her through the}} process. Director of photography Bill Roe used specific lighting for the episode; indoor scenes are dark and hard to make out whereas outside scenes are bright and over-saturated with light. The Mexican hotel apartment was created from Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) old apartment set.|$|E

500|$|Beahan had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{releasing}} a tribute record through his {{company for a}} long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute came to me in a dream last fall, and I immediately started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E

To create the rigid structure of the angels' dresses, prosthetics supervisors Rob Mayor soaked fabric in fibreglass resin, which was then painted over. Although they are never shown moving on screen, all of the Weeping Angels were played by actresses Aga Blonska and Elen Thomas wearing makeup and prosthetics. The actresses wore two distinct masks: one that was more docile looking, and one with fangs bared. Blonska later noted that [...] "I'm partly painted, partly glued into the costume, but it's quite comfortable." [...] Although the actresses were slightly [...] "wobbly" [...] when they stood still, the producers used digital effects to, in essence, freeze the angels on film. Moffat was {{very pleased with the}} results, and called them [...] "fantastic". Mulligan later called the effects [...] "so good" [...] and [...] "really creepy".|$|E
500|$|The 1940 presidential {{campaign}} was conducted {{against the backdrop}} of World War II. Although the United States remained neutral, the nation—and especially the Republican Party—was deeply divided between isolationists, who felt the nation should avoid any steps that could lead America into the war, and interventionists, who felt that America's survival depended upon helping the Allies defeat Nazi Germany. The three leading candidates for the 1940 Republican nomination were all isolationists to varying degrees: Senators Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, and Thomas E. Dewey, the young (38), [...] "gangbusting" [...] Manhattan District Attorney. Roosevelt's popularity had declined since the 1936 landslide, but many still hoped he would run for an unprecedented third term. [...] He had long contemplated one, but made no announcement. Roosevelt's decision-making on this point is uncertain: as late as April 1940, he may have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> retirement. [...] If he stepped aside, possible candidates included Vice President Garner, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Postmaster General James A. Farley.|$|E
500|$|In early 1944, {{news of the}} Philadelphia {{pilot plant}} reached Robert Oppenheimer, the {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Oppenheimer wrote to Conant on 4 March 1944, and asked for the reports on the liquid thermal diffusion project, which Conant forwarded. Like nearly everyone else, Oppenheimer had <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> uranium enrichment in terms of a process to produce weapons grade uranium suitable for use in an atomic bomb, but now he considered another option. If the columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, then it might produce 12kg per day of uranium enriched to 1 percent. This could be valuable because an electromagnetic enrichment process that could produce one gram of uranium enriched to 40 percent uranium-235 from natural uranium, could produce two grams per day of uranium enriched to 80 percent uranium-235 if the feed was enriched to 1.4 percent uranium-235, double the 0.7 percent of natural uranium. On 28 April, he wrote to Groves, pointing out that [...] "the production of the Y-12 plant could be increased by some 30 or 40 percent, and its enhancement somewhat improved, many months earlier than the scheduled date for K-25 production." ...|$|E

500|$|On June 22, 2017, Swanigan {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} (26th overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 3, 2017, Swanigan signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> this moment for a long time. I know this is only the first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for to begin this journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft. It’s been an incredibly tough road for him to get to this point and no one deserves it more than he does". Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E
500|$|In April 1957 Boris Ford, Head of Schools Broadcasting at Associated Rediffusion (A-R), {{wrote to}} Britten, proposing {{a series of}} half-hour programmes. These would show Britten {{composing}} and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with [...] "an intimate piece of musical education, by... watching {{a piece of music}} take shape and in some degree growing with it". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time [...] busy [...] travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with Let's Make an Opera. However, he agreed to meet Ford [...] to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant Imogen Holst. Britten told Ford that he had [...] "for some months or a year vaguely <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> doing something with the [...] miracle plays", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. The Church of St Bartholomew, Orford, was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's two {{previous}} albums, The Times They Are A-Changin' and Another Side of Bob Dylan both {{ended with a}} farewell song, [...] "Restless Farewell" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe" [...] respectively. [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] concludes Bringing It All Back Home in consistent fashion. Much speculation has surrounded who or what the [...] "Baby Blue" [...] to whom Dylan is singing farewell is. Although Dylan himself has remained mute on the subject, Dylan scholars {{believe that it is}} probably an amalgam of personalities within Dylan's social orbit. One person who has been regarded as the subject of the song is folk singer Joan Baez. Dylan and Baez were still in a relationship and were planning to tour together, but Dylan had been growing as an artist and as a person and may have already been planning to leave the relationship. Another possibility is a singer-songwriter named David Blue. A friend or acquaintance of Dylan's from his days in New York's Greenwich Village, Blue is pictured on the cover of Dylan and the Band's The Basement Tapes album wearing a trench coat. Yet another possibility is Dylan's one-time friend, folk singer Paul Clayton. Although Clayton had been Dylan's friend throughout 1964, and had accompanied Dylan on the road trip across the United States on which [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] were written, by 1965 he may have become more devoted to Dylan than Dylan was comfortable with, and Clayton's use of amphetamines may have made him difficult to be around. However, author Paul Williams, in his book Performing Artist: Book One 1960–1973, counters that [...] "Dylan may have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> a particular person as he wrote it, but not necessarily", adding that the song has such a natural, flowing structure to it, that it could [...] "easily have finished writing itself before Dylan got around to thinking about who 'Baby Blue' was." ...|$|E
