Because prosodic phrase boundaries are correlated to syntactic boundaries, listeners can determine the syntactic category of a word, using only prosodic <b>boundary</b> <b>information.</b> Christophe et al. (2008) demonstrated that adults could use prosodic phrases to determine the syntactic category of ambiguous words.

40|$|Recently Young and Wong {{extended}} the well-known simulated annealing based Wong-Liu algorithm [I] {{to solve the}} problem of slicing floorplan design with boundary constraints. The main idea behind the Young-Wong algorithm [4] is to determine the <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> of each module in a floorplan by traversing the corresponding normalized Polish expression from right to left once. By having carefully examined each of the three types of moves adopted by the Young-Wong algorithm for generating a new normalized Polish expression, we observe that it is very likely that only a subset of modules might have the <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> changed in the new normalized Polish expression, and hence only the <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> for those modules needs to be re-computed. Based on the observation, we improve the Young-Wong algorithm by providing methods to accelerate the <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> computation. ...|$|E

Especially extracting <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> of man-made {{features such as}} buildings is quite important because building {{is one of the}} major components consisting complex contemporary urban area, and has artificially defined shape.

The proposed algorithm begins with composing Delaunay triangulation process for given points and removes edges satisfying specific conditions process. Additionally, to make whole boundary extraction process efficient, we used Sweep-hull algorithm for constructing Delaunay triangulation. To verify the performance of the proposed extended χ-algorithm, we compared the proposed algorithm with Encasing Polygon Generating Algorithm and α-Shape Algorithm, which had been researched in the area of feature extraction. Further, the extracted <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> from the proposed algorithm was analysed against manually digitized building boundary in order to test accuracy of the result of extracting boundary.

We develop alternate constraints from the definition of surface smoothness, since the closed loop constraints do not work in stereographic space.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{previously}} developed a model-based strategy for joint estimation of myocardial perfusion and boundaries using ECT (emission computed tomography). They have also reported difficulties with boundary estimation in low contrast and low count rate situations. Here they propose using <b>boundary</b> side <b>information</b> (obtainable from high resolution MRI and CT images) or boundary regularization to improve both perfusion and boundary estimation in these situations. To fuse <b>boundary</b> side <b>information</b> into the emission measurements, the authors formulate a joint log-likelihood function to include auxiliary boundary measurements {{as well as}} ECT projection measurements. In addition, they introduce registration parameters to align auxiliary boundary measurements with ECT measurements and jointly estimate these parameters with other parameters of interest from the composite measurements. In simulated PET O- 15 water myocardial perfusion studies using a simplified model, the authors show that the joint estimation improves perfusion estimation performance and gives boundary alignment accuracy of < 0. 5 mm even at 0. 2 million counts. They implement boundary regularization through formulating a penalized log-likelihood function. They also demonstrate in simulations that simultaneous regularization of the epicardial boundary and myocardial thickness gives comparable perfusion estimation accuracy {{with the use of}} <b>boundary</b> side <b>information...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{iterative}} method for computing shape from shading using occluding <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> is proposed. Some applications {{of this method}} are shown. We employ the stereographic plane to express the orientations of surface patches, rather than the more commonly. used gradient space. Use of the stereographic plane {{makes it possible to}} incorporate occluding <b>boundary</b> <b>information,</b> but forces us to employ a smoothness constraint different from the one previously proposed. The new constraint follows directly from a particular definition of surface smoothness. We solve the set of equations arising from the smoothness constraints and the image-irradiance equation iteratively, using occluding <b>boundary</b> <b>information</b> to supply boundary conditions. Good initial values are found at certain points to help reduce the number of iterations required to reach a reasonable solution. Numerical experiments show that the method is effective and robust. Finally, we analyze scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures using this method. Other applications are also proposed. 1...|$|E
