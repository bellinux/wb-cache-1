40|$|A massively {{parallel}} computer handles massive amount of data with simultaneous access requests from multiple processors, and therefore the {{massively parallel}} computer must have a large capacity secondary storage system of very high concurrency. Such a storage system should consists many disks that are connected in paralle. With such large-scale parallel disk systems, access load balancing is extremely important to enhance the effective operation of all disks. This paper proposes a parallel file access method named DECODE (Dynamic Express Changing Of Data Entry) that implements load <b>balancing</b> among <b>disks</b> <b>by</b> dynamically finding the l~ss busy disks for writing data. The efficiency of this method was verified by preliminary performance evaluation using software simulation under varying access conditions...|$|R

For levofloxacin, ≥ 99. 0 % of strains were susceptible at ≤ 2. 0 μg/ml with zone diameters of ≥ 17 mm, regardless of incubation in air or CO 2. Although zone sizes were smaller and E-test MICs were higher for clarithromycin in CO 2 {{than those in}} air, category differences were minor, and susceptibility rates for clarithromycin {{were similar to those}} obtained by agar and microdilution in air (range, 76. 9 to 80. 9 % by all methods). For clarithromycin, adjustment of breakpoints based upon distribution of results resulted in susceptibility rates which were similar by all methods (75. 8 to 76. 9 % susceptible, 0 to 1. 5 % intermediate, 22. 6 to 23. 1 % resistant). Minor discrepancies were obtained with levofloxacin for one strain (0. 5 %) by microdilution and two strains (1. 0 %) <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion in CO 2.

40|$|Methods for {{detection}} of high-level resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics were evaluated using 104 blood isolates of enterococci (97 Enterococcus faecalis and 7 Enterococcus faecium). Kanamycin {{was used to}} predict resistance to amikacin. Discrepancies between methods were resolved by time-kill studies. Four methods (MicroScan, macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion) for detecting resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were compared, using 51 consecutive strains. There were 13 gentamicin-resistant strains, {{all of which were}} detected by macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion. MicroScan detected 2 (15 %) of the 13. Of the 18 streptomycin-resistant strains, 17 (93 %) were detected <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion, 16 (89 %) by microtiter, 9 (50 %) by macrotube, and 6 (33 %) by MicroScan. An additional 53 consecutive strains were examined only <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion and microtiter for resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. The entire population of 104 strains contained 35 gentamicin-, 22 streptomycin-, and 54 kanamycin-resistant enterococcal isolates. All 35 gentamicin-resistant strains were detected by both methods. Of the 22 streptomycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion, and 19 by both methods. Of the 54 kanamycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion, and 51 by both methods.

40|$|We {{consider}} accretion-disk winds, {{which are}} driven <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> radiation fields, while {{taking into account}} radiation drag as well as radiation pressure. The winds ejected from the accretion <b>disk</b> are exerted <b>by</b> {{the influence of the}} radiation pressure from the central object and the accretion disk, itself. We calculate, under the near-disk approximation, the trajectories of particles for various parameters, such as the initial radii and the luminosities of the central object and the disk. We then obtain the conditions which determine whether particles escape or not. These particles moving in intense radiation fields with a velocity of the order of the light speed are also affected by radiation drag. Due to the radiation-drag effect, dragged particle winds are hard to escape compared with the case of non-dragged winds. When they are captured by the gravitational force of the central object, particles float at some typical height above the accretion <b>disk</b> while being <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> the vertical gravitational force of the central object and the force of the disk radiation pressure. In such a case, the ejected material becomes coronal gas spreading above/below the disk. When the winds blow, on the other hand, the trajectories of the particles tend to widen in the radial direction, since the winds are dragged <b>by</b> the <b>disk</b> radiation fields and gain angular momentum...|$|R

A total of 21 isolates (53 %) were susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion, under currently recommended criteria for ticarcillin susceptibility. Macro-broth dilution tests (ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid, 2 micrograms/ml) confirmed susceptibility (MIC {{less than or}} equal to 64 micrograms/ml) of only 8 (38 %) of 21 isolates. Time-kill studies of disk diffusion susceptible isolates indicated 2 log 10 or greater killing of most isolates at 6 h in broth containing ticarcillin (64 micrograms/ml) combined with clavulanic acid (1, 2, 5, or 10 micrograms/ml). After 6 h, regrowth was common in all concentrations of clavulanic acid except 10 micrograms/ml. Regrowth populations were resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanate by MIC determination. Poor bactericidal activity of ticarcillin-clavulanate against ticarcillin-resistant P. aeruginosa was confirmed, as most isolates did not undergo 99. 9 % or greater killing at 24 h in all concentrations of clavulanic acid. Serotype O- 11 was our most common serotype and was associated with disk diffusion "pseudosusceptibility. " Concomitant disk diffusion testing of ticarcillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin is recommended for testing the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ticarcillin-clavulanate <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion. P. aeruginosa isolates resistant to ticarcillin should as a rule be considered also resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanate, despite apparent susceptibility <b>by</b> <b>disk</b> diffusion...|$|R
