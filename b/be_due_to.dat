5|$|Slow {{progress}} in preventing the disease may in part <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> stigma associated with TB. Stigma may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the fear of}} transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS. Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E
5|$|In rare individuals, {{paracetamol}} toxicity {{can result}} from normal use.

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The {{study also found that}} California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus) and the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus), the grey reef shark {{is one of the}} three most common sharks inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs. They {{actively}} expel most other shark species from favored habitats, even species larger in size. In areas where this species co-exists with the blacktip reef shark, the latter species occupies the shallow flats, while the former stays in deeper water. Areas with a high abundance of grey reef sharks tend to contain few sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus), and vice versa; this may <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their similar diets causing competitive exclusion.|$|E
