5000|$|<b>Blended</b> <b>finance</b> {{is defined}} [...] "as the {{strategic}} use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets", resulting in positive results for both investors and communities. <b>Blended</b> <b>finance</b> offers {{the possibility to}} scale up commercial financing for developing countries and to channel such financing toward investments with development impact. As such, <b>Blended</b> <b>finance</b> is designed to support progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. Meeting the SDGs will require an additional $2.5 trillion per year, and an additional $13.5 trillion to implement the COP21 Paris climate accord.

40|$|AbstractIn {{developing}} countries, {{cities are}} experiencing rapid urbanization with increasing informality affecting urban poor {{to live in}} slums and squatters subject to eviction. Abating the issue, current participatory planning and collaborative actions are becoming popular. The major challenge in contemporary pro-poor housing practices is to explore the best practices of community participation, is well-discussed after the withdrawal of government intervention in housing and relying heavily on housing market. This study attempted to explore different forms of community participation to identify options introducing community-led housing in Bangkok and Mumbai for urban poor. The SWOT analyses of the ongoing projects in Bangkok and Mumbai identified scope and operational methodology of community-led housing. Results revealed that different forms of participatory practices are still considering urban poor as beneficiaries in expert-designed pre-determined projects and programmes. Community-led housing process {{has emerged as a}} different thought of action which is impulsive, inclusive and initiated by the community. We identified the elements of community-led housing are noticeable through representative networking, collective savings and <b>blended</b> <b>financing,</b> participatory designing, collective ownership, and participatory monitoring and evaluation. Although the community-led housing practice is becoming successful by enabling urban poor in five aspects, yet issue of scaling-up and institutionalization remains unsolved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to find out the {{techniques}} and suggest computer-based solution to reduce poverty from Pakistan, and suggest sustainable management of micro-Finance and Self-help Finance systems. Literature review at national and international level reveals that many researchers have attempted to suggest microfinance as a tool to reduce poverty. Self-help <b>financing</b> <b>blended</b> with donor’s <b>finance</b> is also successfully being practiced. Model of Grameen Bank is also being replicated with some modification as per demand of the localities, as there is always a room for improvement with scientific and technological inventions. Computer technology, as it is already playing its role in various fields, can be fruitfully utilized for proper management of this proposed project. Presently NADRA e-Sahulat and Telenor’s easy paisa are programs that have capability to help the masses with maximum accuracy in the financial transactions. Some studies also encourage establishing a microfinance bank, with small deposits plus donor’s funds, to be electronically managed by NGOs and controlled by organizations of indigenous peoples in villages. This study concludes that by reducing manpower intermediate-expenditure and irregularities will reduce poverty and will help in saving the amount for maximizing their own welfare. Presently, facilities are already available with latest technology, which if modified and innovated will bear fruit. This study suggested that how national and international donor Agencies should get accurate real-time information relating dissemination of their funds in right-hands, with to increased efficiency and decreased management expenditure. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{resources}} needed to bridge the funding gap to meet SDG requirements cannot be met through public resources (such as Official Development Assistance) alone, and private investment will be key to increasing the scope and impact of development finance and philanthropic funders.

The current challenge for the SDG era is how to channel more of these private resources to the sectors and countries that are central for the SDGs and broader development efforts. This is particularly important in a context where public resources are increasingly under pressure, while private flows to developing countries are increasing significantly. <b>Blended</b> <b>finance</b> is designed to fuel vast inflows of private capital to support these development outcomes.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we explore the {{implications}} of Brexit for the UK and the EU's development policies and strategic directions, focusing on the former. While {{it is likely that}} the operational process of disentangling the UK from the various development institutions of the EU will be relatively straightforward, the choices that lie ahead about whether and how to cooperate thereafter are more complex. Aid and development policy touches on a wide range of interests—security, trade, climate change, migration, gender rights, and so on. We argue that Brexit will accelerate existing trends within UK development policy, notably towards the growing priority of private sector-led economic growth strategies and <b>blended</b> <b>finance</b> tools. There are strong signals that UK aid will be cut, as successive secretaries of state appear unable to persuade a substantial section of the public and media that UK aid and development policy serves UK interests in a variety of ways...|$|E

Giving circles can provide a learning experience for people who want to better understand philanthropy, such as how to create social value by donating their money and skills in a socialised context. When philanthropy is described as a journey that individuals embark upon throughout life, it is not simply about giving more money over time. Giving should be made more intelligently and strategically; it can involve leveraging non-financial resources; and it understands and measures the impact created. Collaborating with others on the philanthropy journey holds the potential to make giving a more impactful and personally fulfilling experience. Giving circles make it easier for individuals to enter into larger scale and more sophisticated philanthropy and share the risks and rewards with others. ...|$|R
40|$|Today core banking {{has become}} the major part of {{financial}} system. Presently, to fulfill the basic financial needs, the customer open different account numbers in different banks, financial institutions, Provident funds, Mutual funds, Insurances, etc. for various transactions. The major drawback of this system is that, there is no unique identification code of a customer to maintain various transactions and different accounts detail in different branches of different banks and financial institutions. In this paper, {{we have tried to}} focus to remove the above drawback by introducing the 7 -tier architecture to maintain the Bank unique identification code (BUID code). Here the 7 -tier architecture model is designed with the seven layers with the use of biometric tools and the data of customers are stored in Data Warehouse through data mart.

Though both the absolute number {{and the proportion of}} blended families is increasing throughout Europe, there is still little research information available on how they manage their <b>finances.</b> <b>Blended</b> families are an interesting group to study because their money management is clearly more complex than that of traditional nuclear families. In this paper I examine the extent of the differences between blended and nuclear families in money management, with special reference to bank accounts and the conducting of payments. I also seek to identify factors explaining the differences discovered. The research data comes from an Internet survey conducted in November 2006, which yielded answers from 469 Finnish families with children. The results, confirming earlier findings, suggested that money management is more separated in blended families than in nuclear ones. In nuclear families, both the bank accounts and the paying of expenditures are consistently managed jointly, whereas the spouses in blended families prefer separate bank accounts and display several different practices in the paying of common expenditures. In nuclear families the adults pay the expenditures together, but in blended ones they are responsible for the expenditures of their own biological children. Consumer research Family Money...|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlined}} ways {{in which}} persons with addiction are currently underserved by our current health care system. However, with the coming broad scale reforms to our health care system, the access to and availability of high-quality care for substance use disorders will increase. Addiction treatments {{will continue to be}} offered through traditional substance abuse care systems, but these will be more integrated with primary care, and less separated as treatment facilities leverage opportunities to <b>blend</b> services, <b>financing</b> mechanisms, and health information systems under federally driven incentive programs. To further these reforms, vigilance will be needed by consumers, clinicians, and policy makers to assure that the unmet treatment needs of individuals with addiction are addressed. Embedded in this article are essential recommendations to facilitate the improvement of care for substance use disorders under health care reform. Ultimately, as addiction care acquires more of the 2 ̆ 2 look and feel 2 ̆ 2 of mainstream medicine, {{it is important to be}} mindful of preexisting trends in health care delivery overall that are reflected in recent health reform legislation. Within the world of addiction care, clinicians must move beyond their self-imposed 2 ̆ 2 stigmatization 2 ̆ 2 and sequestration of specialty addiction treatment. The problem for addiction care, as it becomes more 2 ̆ 2 mainstream, 2 ̆ 2 is to not comfortably feel that general slogans like 2 ̆ 2 Treatment Works, 2 ̆ 2 as promoted by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2 ̆ 7 s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment during its annual Recovery Month celebrations, will meet the expectations of stakeholders outside the specialty addiction treatment community.

40|$|Increasingly, {{investors are}} {{integrating}} environmental risk and opportunity into their financial valuations {{of public and}} private assets. This paper offers an overview of how environmental factors might be integrated into companies’ financial valuation. More speculatively, it suggests ways in which a blended value investor could potentially attain equal or better financial returns than traditional investors agnostic to the environmental implications of their investments. There are indications that financial markets are gradually integrating environmental considerations into securities valuations, emerging from a long period when such concerns had little if any influence on securities’ prices. If this assertion is true, the tools and perspectives of blended value investing can help an investor identify and profit from the financial manifestation of previously unpriced environmental value. Using the terms of <b>finance,</b> <b>blended</b> value investing may be a way to generate ‘alpha’ – or returns above the risk-adjusted performance of the overall market, which are typically attributed to an investment manager’s unique ability. Public equities and debt operate in relatively liquid, efficient markets that combine information from many investors and market influences to reveal clear prices for securities. Nevertheless, markets do not ‘explain’ how they arrived at a given valuation. Thus, for example, {{it is difficult to know}} how much of an oil company’s current share price reflects its commitment to alternative energy technology or to a recently announced reorganisation of its distribution network. In order to disentangle cause and effect, an investor or analyst must attempt to interpret the various pieces of information that contributed to the market’s valuation. In the matter of environmental opportunity and risk, more mainstream market participants are examining how environmental considerations can have a direct impact on securities prices. Accordingly, the mid- 2000 s may be an excellent time to be a blended value investor. To deploy such an investing strategy effectively requires an understanding of the standard tools of valuation as well as the development and use of new blended value methods...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates students&rsquo; {{expectations}} {{and experiences of}} blended learning at Hanoi Open University, Vietnam. In recent years, the Vietnamese government has produced a number of polices advocating the use of ICT in education, including blended learning, aligning this implementation with its goals to modernise. While there has been considerable research around blended learning in {{higher education in the}} west, including in the USA, UK and Australia, research in Vietnam is relatively new. Previous research has suggested that while there is some debate around defining blended learning, there are numerous benefits and limitations. This study aims to add to this research, by exploring blended learning in the Vietnamese context. This study is framed by a qualitative approach. It employs a case study method to develop rich and detailed descriptions of participant {{expectations and}} experiences of blended learning. 13 second year students, in one of 4 <b>blended</b> courses (Accounting, <b>Finance</b> and Banking, Business Management or Applied Information Technology), participated in this study. Data was collected from semi-structured interviews through Skype and later categorised into key themes using inductive analysis. The findings reveal participants had very positive expectations of blended learning and these related to timing (flexibility and convenience), usefulness, (for work and future qualifications) interaction, experiencing new technology, quality of course, and accreditation. While each participant identified more than one expectation, timing and usefulness were most often identified. The participants also had mainly positive experiences in relation to the online components, the face-to-face components, and interaction. Most commented on benefitting from the flexibility and timing of the course as well as learning outcomes. Most also commented that their experience was affected by lack of interaction and technical problems. Participants&rsquo; expectations and experiences generally aligned especially around timing. This study confirms many of the findings in previous research around student expectations and experiences of blended learning in higher education. However it adds to this research by suggesting that participants in this particular context, also had expectations around the usefulness of blended learning courses to work and future qualifications as well as expectations around accreditation that have not been given much attention in previous research. It suggests also that these participants experienced benefits to their work, which have also been underplayed in research. Finally this study suggests that these additions to the research have particular implications for administrators, faculty and universities...|$|R
