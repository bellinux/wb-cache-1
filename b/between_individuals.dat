5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this relational nature of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E

5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E
5|$|Amartya Sen’s {{cooperative}} conflicts {{approach to}} gender biases frames women’s gender disadvantage through three different responses: breakdown wellbeing, perceived interest and perceived contribution responses. The breakdown well-being response—derived from the Nash equilibrium—describes breakdown positions <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> during cooperative decisions. When the breakdown position of one individual {{is less than}} the other person, the solution to any conflict will ultimately result in less favourable conditions for the first individual. In terms of women’s health in India, the overall gender disadvantage facing women—represented by cultural and societal factors that favour men over women—negatively impacts their ability to make decisions with regards to seeking out healthcare.|$|E

5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication <b>between</b> <b>individuals,</b> {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} lion, the cheetah {{is the only}} cat that is gregarious; however, female cheetahs tend to remain solitary. Tim Caro, of the University of California, Davis, {{identified}} the various social classes and their longevity. Pregnant and nursing females, a few adolescents, and males who have not joined any groups are typically solitary. Non-lactating females, their cubs, adolescent siblings, and several males will form their own groups. A loose association <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> {{of the opposite sex}} can be observed during the breeding season. These social groups typically keep away from one another.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size of meals varies <b>between</b> <b>individuals.</b> Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the what (the existing facts about animals) prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E

5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling <b>between</b> <b>individuals</b> have been observed in the wild. Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild. When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic.

5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations <b>between</b> <b>individuals.</b> Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
