2500|$|Around one {{thousand}} M3 submachine guns in caliber 9mm Parabellum were built by Guide Lamp. [...] These original 9mm guns, {{identified by the}} markings [...] "U.S. 9 mm S.M.G." [...] {{on the left side}} of the magazine well (without any model designation, such as M3), were delivered to the OSS in 1944. [...] Additionally, Rock Island Arsenal and Buffalo Arms Corporation manufactured parts for a limited number of 9mm conversion kits for the M3. [...] Though 25,000 kits were originally requested for procurement, this was changed to a recommendation by the Ordnance Committee in December 1943 that only 500 9mm conversion kits be obtained. [...] Procurement was authorized in February 1944, but it is believed that only a limited number of kits were actually produced. [...] These conversion kits included a new 9mm barrel, replacement bolt and recoil springs, a magazine well adapter for use with British Sten gun 32-round magazines, and a replacement 9mm Sten magazine of British manufacture. [...] As the M3's sights were not altered for the new cartridge, the 9mm M3 shot high at 100 yards, but the sighting error was deemed inconsequential. [...] The OSS also requested approximately 1,000 [...]45-caliber M3 submachine guns with an integral sound suppressor (designed by Bell Laboratories). [...] Specially drilled barrels and <b>barrel</b> <b>nuts</b> were manufactured by Guide Lamp, while the High Standard Firearms Company produced the internal components and assembled the weapon. [...] The Bell Laboratories suppressor was estimated to be only 80% as efficient as the British suppressed STEN Mk IIS.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> (also {{known as}} steel cross dowel or dowel nut) is a {{specialized}} nut, and {{is commonly used}} in aerospace and ready-to-assemble furniture applications.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{innovations}} {{developed by}} POF-USA include the integral bolt-carrier key with the interface behind the cam pin, oversized heat-sink <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> roller cam pin, and regulating gas plug.|$|R
50|$|Furniture cross dowel <b>barrel</b> <b>nuts</b> are {{cylindrical}} shaped metal nuts (metal dowels) {{used with}} furniture connector bolts to join {{two pieces of}} wood. The inside threaded hole is unusual in that it passes through {{the sides of the}} dowel. To install, the pieces of wood to be joined are aligned, then a bolt hole is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled laterally across the bolt hole and the cross dowel is inserted into it. The end of the cross dowel is slotted so that a screwdriver can be inserted to rotate the dowel so that its threaded shaft aligns with the bolt hole. The furniture connector bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together.|$|E

50|$|It {{is used to}} bolt {{thin sheet}} metal parts to larger, often billet or forged, parts. The <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> is a round slug, or formed sheet metal part with threads {{perpendicular}} {{to the length of}} the nut. The nut sits in a hole inside the forging and a standard bolt is threaded into the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> from outside the sheet metal. They are preferred over a standard nut and bolt, because they do not require a flange to be machined or forged onto the receiving part, thus reducing weight.|$|R
50|$|A sex bolt is a mating {{fastener}} combining {{a fastener}} (nut) with a fastener (screw). The sex bolt {{consists of a}} female (internally) threaded <b>barrel</b> (<b>nut)</b> and a male (externally) threaded screw. Both the barrel and screw have heads designed to clamp (bind) material between {{the head of the}} barrel {{and the head of the}} screw, or to bridge the gap between two parts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>barrel</b> {{takedown}} <b>nut</b> {{tends to}} loosen during firing and may need hand-tightening to maintain both accuracy and reliability.|$|R
50|$|The initial ACR {{design was}} {{offered in the}} Army's Individual Carbine competition. In late 2011, Remington {{unveiled}} an improved version specifically for the competition. Improvements included a magnesium lower receiver, A2-style pistol grip, collapsible but non-foldable stock, carbine length gas system, a new <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> (which eliminates the quick change barrel), and a folding charging handle. These changes made the weapon 1.8 lbs lighter. The Individual Carbine competition was cancelled before a winning weapon was chosen.|$|R
5000|$|Norinco of China {{manufactures}} an unlicensed {{copy of the}} Uzi Model B that is sold as the M320. Early versions {{were marked}} [...] "POLICE Model" [...] in English. Modifications were made to avoid the US Assault Weapon Import Ban: the folding stock was replaced with a wooden thumbhole stock, the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> was welded in place, and the bayonet lug was removed. The gun had a gray parkerized finish, a 410-mm (16-inch) carbine-length barrel and is 800 mm (31.49 inches) overall.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle has an open rear {{sight and}} ramp front sight with high {{visibility}} orange post {{surrounded by a}} cutaway hood. The receiver has an integral [...]22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock. Included Marlin accessories are a 7-round metal magazine, a tool for adjusting the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> and a padded nylon carrying case designed to float in water. Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10-round nickel plated metal magazines. 25-round magazines are available.|$|R
50|$|The MAG's {{receiver}} {{is constructed}} from sheet metal stampings reinforced by steel plates and rivets. The front is reinforced {{to accept the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> and gas cylinder which are permanently mounted. Guide rails that support the bolt assembly and piston extension during their reciprocating movement are riveted to the side plates. The bolt's guide rails are shaped downward to drive the locking lever into engagement with the locking shoulder, which is also riveted to the side plates. The rear of the receiver has been reinforced and slotted to accept the butt-stock.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{fasteners}} {{are known}} by many different names: sex bolt, binding posts, Chicago screws, interscrews, <b>barrel</b> bolts, <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> partition screws, door closure bolts, furniture screws, panel fasteners, architectural sex bolts, arch series screws, hinge screws, display fasteners, screw nuts, connector bolts, threaded rivets, grommet nuts, post and screw sets, book screws, and stationary screws. Applications vary widely from book binding to installing bathroom partitions. This group of fasteners {{are used to}} assemble fitness apparatus, solar panels, playground equipment, railing systems, furniture, athletic helmets, knives, store fixtures, signs, panic bars, and many other products.|$|R
50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> <b>barrel</b> bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is internally threaded. The boss sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{slide of}} the [...]22 LR has an {{opening at the}} front that allows the buffer to be unused when firing the gun. Heckler & Koch {{provides}} a special scraper tool for the [...]22 LR-barrel. The tool is needed to clean {{the inside of the}} floating chamber for save operation. An additional exchange tool is provided for all calibers to screw and unscrew the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> that attaches the barrel to the frame. Both tools can be seen in one of the pictures of the P7K3 on this page. P7K3's are more rare in the U.S. than in Europe and are valued at higher prices especially when they are in good condition.|$|R
50|$|Handguards: In {{all cases}} a {{free-floating}} forearm is used, {{which does not}} touch the barrel directly. This increases {{the accuracy of the}} weapon by removing vibration and pressure exerted on the barrel {{by the rest of the}} gun. The first SPRs used PRI Gen I or Gen II carbon-fiber free-float tubes. The SPR/A, SPR/B, and Mk 12 Mod 1 all use the Knights Armament Company M4 Match Free-Floating Rail Adapter System, KAC part number 99167. The Mk 12 Mod 0 uses PRI Gen III free-float tubes. The Gen I and Gen II Freefloat Forearms are combined with the Atlantic Research Marketing Systems #38 SPR MOD Sleeve, while the Gen III Freefloat Forearm, due to its it larger <b>barrel</b> <b>nut,</b> only works with the ARMS #38 SPR PEQ-2-3.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{interchangeable}} barrel revolvers produced {{were the}} Dan Wesson Models W8, W9, W11, and W12, all medium-frame size frame revolvers chambered in [...]38 Special or [...]357 Magnum. The W8 and W11 had either a fixed rear sight, or a rear sight adjustable only for windage, while the W9 and W12 featured a rear sight fully adjustable for both windage and elevation. The barrels and shrouds for both models were interchangeable {{and used a}} large externally mounted nut on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange (known to collectors as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] shrouds) which mated with {{the front of the}} revolver's frame. Initial barrel/shroud options were 2 1/2-inch, 4-inch, 6-inch, and 8-inches. A custom <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> wrench and feeler gauge were supplied with each pistol, and barrel changes could be accomplished in two minutes or less.|$|R
5000|$|The Franchi LF57 is an Italian pressed-metal submachine gun. A {{small number}} {{were made for}} the Italian Navy in the 1960s, but few others ordered it. The LF57 uses a {{recessed}} bolt head similar to the Beretta Model 12's {{as a method of}} reducing the weapon's length, although on the LF57 the bolt's mass is carried above the barrel rather than around it. This allows manufacture to be simplified to a degree. Most parts are made of stampings and pressings, and {{the two sides of the}} gun are one piece each, joined by a long seam. Dismantling the weapon is very simple, such as the barrel, which is held on by one single <b>barrel</b> <b>nut.</b> The tubular butt folds to the right side of the receiver, and the pistol grip is made entirely of steel. The sights are simple fixtures on the top of the barrel. Also it was rapidly known as the [...] "Dead Squirrel" [...] due to its low ammunition capacity.|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} a milled receiver, a chrome lined hammer-forged barrel, a slanted 45 degree gas block, a threaded <b>barrel,</b> a muzzle <b>nut,</b> a cleaning rod and a bayonet lug. The furniture {{is made from}} blond wood and the buttstock is of Warsaw pact length. The rifle is supplied with one 30-round magazine, a sling, an oil bottle and cleaning kit.|$|R
5000|$|The P7K3 is a {{shortened}} {{version of}} the P7 (inspired by the HK4 pistol) that uses straight blowback for operation. This version has a removable barrel and uses a sealed hydraulic recoil buffer {{in place of a}} gas cylinder. After swapping out the barrel and magazine it can use [...]380 ACP (9×17mm Short) or [...]32 ACP (7.65×17mm Browning SR) pistol cartridges and after replacing the slide, magazine and barrel (with floating chamber insert)—it {{can also be used to}} fire [...]22 LR (5.6mm Long Rifle) ammunition. The hydraulic recoil buffer of the P7K3 is prone to wear and causes a serious problem to operate the gun when it is worn down. Heckler & Koch does not make a replacement part for the buffer. However, there are some commercial buffers available. When the [...]22 LR slide and barrel are installed, the buffer is not engaged.The slide of the [...]22 LR has an opening at the front that allows the buffer to be unused when firing the gun. Heckler & Koch provides a special scraper tool for the [...]22 LR-barrel. The tool is needed to clean the inside of the floating chamber for save operation. An additional exchange tool is provided for all calibers to screw and unscrew the <b>barrel</b> <b>nut</b> that attaches the barrel to the frame.

50|$|The M/50 {{is made of}} stamped sheet metal. It is an open bolt design {{which means}} it fires when the bolt is in the locked back open {{position}} with a fixed firing pin. The M/46-M/50 share a unique design: the firearm is stamped from 2 pieces of sheet metal which are shaped with an integral rear pistol grip and magazine housing. The two pieces fit together like a clam shell with the hinge {{at the rear of}} the pistol grip. The firearm is held together with a <b>barrel</b> locking <b>nut</b> which is threaded onto the fore section of the two receiver halves. The pistol grip is hollow, providing storage space for a magazine loading tool.|$|R
5000|$|The Marlin Model 70P, {{also known}} as the Marlin Papoose, is a [...]22 Long Rifle {{semi-automatic}} rifle manufactured by Marlin Firearms. The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 in in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. Disassembly requires loosening a <b>barrel</b> retention <b>nut</b> by hand or with a supplied tool. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel and conventional stock. Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. The Marlin Model 70PSS variant has a synthetic stock and stainless steel barrel.|$|R
50|$|The Borz {{was very}} simple and {{inexpensive}} to produce, costing about $100 in Chechnya. The receiver could be square steel tubing with a stamped steel dust-cover {{on top and}} trunnions {{in the front and}} rear, although some versions have a round receiver. The bolt design closely mimicked that of the Soviet PPS, and the magazine was based on the magazine used in the German MP 40. The trigger mechanism has features in common with the Madsen M-50, and enables both fully automatic and single fire. The ejector and <b>barrel</b> locking <b>nut</b> also resemble those of the Madsen. Its lightweight design and ease of use was ideal for sudden attacks, making up for its quality shortcomings. The barrel would generally wear out after firing about three magazines worth of ammunition, with the result of increasingly poor accuracy. Like many improvised firearms (such as the FP-45 Liberator), the Borz submachine gun was intended for use by guerillas as a crude semi-disposable weapon to ambush police and military forces in urban settings, after which they could obtain higher-quality factory-produced arms from the dead and wounded.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{manufactured}} by the Industria National de Armas S.A. in São Paulo Brazil under license for Madsen. Production began in 1950. The first Model was marked M.B.-50 and was manufactured till 1953 and was {{marked with a}} large Brazilian crest. In late 1953 the Model 1953 was introduced. Improvements on the 1953 model were a larger magazine housing and a metal loop riveted to the lower {{right side of the}} magazine housing. The loop could then hold the magazine housing together. Also the retracting handle was changed on the Model 953 to the right side instead of the top as was the buffer spring and the shape of the extractor, ejector and the firing pin. The INA Model 53 is made of stamped sheet metal. It's an open bolt design which means it fires when the bolt is in the locked back open position with a fixed firing pin. The firearm is stamped from 2 pieces of sheet metal which are shaped with integral rear pistol grip and magazine housing. The two pieces fit together like a clam shell with the hinge {{at the rear of the}} pistol grip. It splits in half right down the middle of the top and bottom of the receiver. The entire firearm is held together with a <b>barrel</b> locking <b>nut</b> which is threaded onto the fore section of the two receiver halves. The folding stock is made of tubular steel and it folds onto the right side of the firearm.|$|R
