25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} Latter Day Saint denomination, the Melchizedek priesthood {{is one of}} two {{governing}} priesthoods, which is typically given {{as a matter of course}} to worthy male members 18 years and older. No exact rule exists about how much time a man must be a member first; he may receive this priesthood as soon as local church leaders feel he is prepared. Ordination is based on the recipient's age and worthiness and does not require any specific training or aptitude. A candidate for this ordination is interviewed and often counseled to study the 84th, 107th, and 121st sections of the Doctrine and Covenants to <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> oath and covenant of the priesthood, the covenant a person makes with God when he receives the Melchizedek priesthood. The candidate is also usually asked to stand in a gathering of the members of the church to be publicly accepted as being worthy of ordination. For male Latter-day Saints, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance of the gospel.|$|E
500|$|The player {{learns that}} 1000 {{years before the}} game, Shuyin was a famous blitzball player in the {{high-tech}} metropolis of Zanarkand, and the lover of a popular songstress and summoner—Lenne. [...] Before he could use Vegnagun, Lenne begged him to stop. Shuyin yielded, but a group of Bevelle soldiers arrived a moment later and shot the couple. The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. Additionally, the Songstress dressphere worn by Yuna is revealed to hold Lenne's memories, resulting in a sphere screen projecting them to everyone in attendance during the concert. Witnessing images of Shuyin and Lenne's last moments, Spira's citizens <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> unproductive nature of their disagreements.|$|E

So that's where this collaboration came together giving young people the tools and supplying them with hope." ...|$|E

60|$|But, as for Christian people, this I {{will tell}} you, {{that unless you}} hold true doctrines, you will not lead good lives. My {{experience}} is, that people are often wrong, when they say false doctrine is a mistake {{of the head and}} not of the heart. I believe false doctrine is very often not bred in the head at all, but in the heart, in the very bottom of a man's soul; that it rises out of his heart into his head; and that if his heart was right with God, he would begin at once to have clearer and truer notions of the true Christian faith. I do not say that it is always so; God forbid! But I do say that it is often so, because I see it so; because I see every day false doctrines about God making men lead bad lives, and commit actual sins; take God's name in vain, dishonour their fathers and mothers, lie, cheat, bear false witness against their neighbours, and covet other men's goods. I say, I see it, and I must believe my own eyes and ears; and when I do see it, I <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> text which says, 'This is eternal life, to know thee, the only God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;' and I <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> Athanasian Creed, which says, that if a 'man does not believe rightly the name of God, and the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, he will perish everlastingly; his soul will decay more and more, become more and more weak, unhealthy and corrupt, till he perishes everlastingly. And whatsoever that may mean, it must mean something most awful and terrible, worse than all the evil which ever happened to us since we were born.|$|E

I have hesitated, I have collected unfavourable advice, but at last I have resolved to make at least one experimental volume of Boon's remains. After all, whatever we have of Aristotle and Socrates and all that we most value of Johnson comes through the testimony of hearers. And though I cannot venture to compare myself with Boswell....|$|E
