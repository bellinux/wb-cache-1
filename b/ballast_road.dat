40|$|Abstract In nature, {{metal ores}} such as iron, lead, {{aluminum}} {{and others are}} found in an impure state, sometimes oxidized and mixed with silicates of other metals. During casting, when the ore is exposed to high temperatures, these impurities are separated from the molten metal and can be removed. The mass formed by these compounds is slag. Slag is the co-product of the smelting of ore to purify metals. It may be considered a mixture of metal oxides, but may also contain metal sulphites and metal atoms in their elemental form. After it is reprocessed to separate the metals contained, the co-products of this process {{can be used in}} cement, rail <b>ballast,</b> <b>road</b> paving and various other purposes. The objective of this research work is the presentation of the chemical and mineralogical characterization tests of the silicon-manganese iron slag with the purpose of reusing the co-product as rail ballast. X-ray diffraction tests, quantitative chemical analyzes, scanning electron microscopy and free lime content were prepared for these characterizations. The results of these tests showed the technical feasibility of using slag as rail ballast...|$|E

5000|$|The salt {{industry}} {{began in}} 1769 provided Anguilla with an export. This industry {{was based in}} the village known as [...] "Sandy Ground", which is situated on a stretch of sand between the large Road Salt Pond and Road Bay. Anguilla has roughly 270 acre of salt ponds, {{less than half of}} that of the Turks and Caicos. Although it lacked plantations and had smaller salt ponds, the salt industry benefited from close proximity to Demerrara, Trinidad, Barbados, Antigua and St. Kitts. Schooners returning to Canada from these colonies would make a last stop in Anguilla or St. Martin to purchase salt. These ships would jettison their <b>ballast</b> in <b>Road</b> Bay as the salt was loaded on board. The granite rocks used as ballast accumulated at the northern end of Road Bay and formed a reef known locally as [...] "The Ballast".|$|R

40|$|Railway {{tracks are}} made up of rails, sleepers, and track ballast (Figure 1). This {{construction}} efficiently distributes the load of the trains to the roadbed. Repeated loads on the structure by trains repeatedly going over it cause the track <b>ballast</b> and <b>roadbed</b> to gradually sink. When the rail surface of the tracks that the trains run on become uneven, this adversely effects the ride and can even lead to trains jumping the tracks in the worst cases. The railway track maintenance unit periodically inspects the tracks for unevenness and the rails and other materials for functionality. When the inspections show that tracks are outside the safety margins, appropriate maintenance work is conducted to assure the safe operation of trains. This maintenance work involves the use of large machinery such as multiple tie tampers (MTT) to harden the track ballast, and track ballast that has become too fine is replaced. These inspections and repair work are conducted continuously while trains are running, and they are an indispensable part of railway track maintenance. Therefore, if track maintenance work, such as the hardening of track ballast, can be reduced while maintaining safe operation of trains, then costs can be reduced considerably. Research and development on reduced maintenance tracks {{to reduce the amount of}} maintenance work required for track ballast has been conducted since before 1965. The Technical Center has been involved in the research and development of reduced maintenance tracks since it was opened in 1991, and it developed the "TC Typ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the early 20 th century that {{particle}} shape has an influence on geotechnical properties. Even if this is known, there has been only minor progress in explaining the processes behind its performance and has only partly implemented in practical geotechnical analysis. This literature review covers different methods and techniques used to determine the geometrical shape of the particles as well as reported effects of shape on granular material behaviour. Particle shape could be classifying in three categories; sphericity - the overall particle shape and similitude with a sphere, roundness - the description of the particle’s corners and roughness - the surface texture of the particle. The categories are scale dependent and the major scale is to sphericity while the minor belongs to roughness. Empirical relations and standards had been developed to relate soil properties, e. g. internal friction angle, minimum and maximum void ratio, density, permeability, strain, with the particle shape. The use of the relations and standards enhance the bulk material performance e. g. asphalt mixtures and rail <b>road</b> <b>ballast.</b> The overview has shown that there is no agreement on the usage of the descriptors and is not clear which descriptor is the best.

50|$|Pfeffelbach was {{originally}} a big farming village, though by and by, workers came to seek their livelihoods in other occupations, too, at ﬁrst mainly as stone quarry workers, {{and then in}} the early 20th century also as so-called Saargänger (“Saar-goers”) at the collieries in the nearby Saarland. The farming village ﬁrst turned into a workers’ village. For centuries, the mills were traditional businesses. The Altmühle (“Old Mill”) was in early feudal times held by the church and was said to be the church estate mill, meaning that all the parish’s farmers had to have their grain ground here. A Mühlenweistum (a Weistum - cognate with English wisdom - was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times; a Mühlenweistum is one that deals with mills) for this mill was ﬁrst put together in 1585 and survives today in a 1762 copy. At the time of the French Revolution, the mill passed into state ownership and was then sold to a family named Jung, and has belonged to their descendants ever since, although the mill itself long ago ceased to function as such. The Eselsmühle (“Ass’s Mill”), also called the Schwarzenborner Mühle, was a so-called Pletschmühle (one with an overshot waterwheel that could only run when the water ﬂow was strong enough) that only ground grain for its successive owners’ needs, and only served others if the estate mill was overloaded. This mill, too, was mentioned even before the Thirty Years' War, and by 1632, it was owned by Heinrich Süß. A third mill downstream from the village in turn bore the names Neumühle (“New Mill”), Brunnenmühle, Bremmenmühle, and last, Faußmühle, according to its owners during the 19th century, and it, too, existed before the Thirty Years' War. Once also standing within Pfeffelbach’s limits was a walking mill, although its exact site is now unknown. About the middle of the 19th century, the ﬁrst hard-stone quarries were opened within Pfeffelbach’s limits. The ﬁrst major quarry was opened in 1870, while others followed in 1887 and 1904. Workers and, as a secondary occupation, also smallhold farmers could seek employment in the village itself. The operations were heavily bound to economic cycles. The quarries originally produced only paving stones, but later also crushed stone and <b>ballast</b> for <b>road</b> and railway building. Two quarries are still in business even now, but now employ few workers. Besides the quarries, there are small businesses, shops and inns in the village. All in all, Pfeffelbach is nowadays a residential community for people in the most varied of occupations, many of whom must commute elsewhere to their jobs.|$|R
40|$|The isomorphy {{of natural}} and anthropogeneous landscapes {{with regard to the}} {{environmental}} conditions in border areas The contact in space between opposite situations constitutes two main types of boundaries. The distinction of these two types offers a useful expedient in ecology. It may also clarify the question why the effects of old-fashioned and modern agricultural systems on the biological richness of man-made landscapes in Western Europe are quite opposite, viz. by increasing respectively reducing the spatial variety. In the neighbourhood of a straight boundary line (fig. 1, A 2) total difference is existing between the white border on the left (w) and the black one on the right (z). This entire difference between the two frontier areas (external) is connected with complete equality within them (internal). It means that in the direction of d (fig. 1, A 3) we shall find a relation of isolation, unequality or closure, while in the direction of o we may expect a relation of communication, equality or openness. The combination of wide external difference and high internal equality marks the phenomena of concentration, damming up and convergence, as for example can be observed along shores (migration birds, seaside visitors, tidal drift) and in the behaviour of water on plastic raincoats. In the case of undulating boundary lines (fig. 1, B 2) {{the difference between the two}} border areas has diminished. Both are black and white together, so that in the direction d + (o) (fig. 1, B 3) openness or equality has been gained at the cost of some closure. On the other hand much closure or difference has been gained within the two borders, so in the direction o + (d). The combination of less external and more internal variety marks the phenomena of dispersion, expansion and divergence. This dispersion is maximal in a gradual transition zone between two or more contrasting situations, as demonstrated in fig. 2, A. Vegetation patterns in the latter type of boundaries, here called “limes divergens”, are characterised by a fine granulation and faint lines of demarcation, which can hardly be discerned. The vegetation in such gradient areas is comparatively rich in species, most of them represented by only a few individuals. Moreover a limes divergens is marked by stable internal conditions and stabilizing qualities, as for example can be observed in the behaviour of water on woollen raincoats. In boundaries of this type (“more-or-less”) a high amount of variety-in-space is coupled with a low amount of variety-in-time. The vegetation profile of fig. 3, B represents an example of a natural gradient area (ecocline) between grassland and woodland on limestone. In the first-named type of boundaries, here called “limes convergens”, vegetation patterns show a coarse granulation and sharp lines of demarcation, which can easily be discerned. In this case the vegetation is poor in species, most of them represented by many individuals. Boundaries of this type are met with in frontier areas where two or more contrasting situations alternate in time (fig. 2, B, C, D and fig. 4, 1 C). Thus a limes convergens is marked by unstable internal conditions (“now-and-then” or “to-and-fro”). Here a low amount of variety-in-space is coupled with a high amount of variety-in-time. It is suggested to confine the concept of “ecotone” to the limes convergens. Either category has its own characteristic organisms. Orchids are mentioned here as typical gradient plants, while species such as Potentilla anserina and Agrostis stolonifera are representative of the limes convergens. The vegetation profile of a natural instable environment, as for example can be distinguished on salt marshes (fig. 3, A), is isomorphic to that of the modern anthropogeneous landscape. The fixation of the relations in the latter one is only an artificial stability. The uncertainty of “nowand-then” is always threatening here. This subtype of the limes convergens forms the habitat of those mobile organisms which need the combination of at least two widely differing types of environment situated contiguously without a gradual transition zone between them (fig. 4, 2 (a + b), (b + c)). These “shuttling” animals, such as gulls and many amphibians, live temporarily in large concentrations or colonies, another aspect of convergence. A special subtype of the limes divergens is found in places where instability shows gradual differences in space. The borders along old-fashioned footpaths and tracks across a moorland are wellknown examples of man-made frontier areas of this subtype with characteristic plants such as Orchis maculata, Carex flacca, and Linum catharticum. There also exist typical annuals, such as Cicendia filiformis and Juncus mutabilis, that shuttle from year to year within the gradual transition area (fig. 5, 2 c). The modern technical civilization favours more and more the limes convergens by making sharp lines of demarcation, monotonous vegetations, barrages, <b>ballasted</b> <b>roads,</b> straight canals, by soil hardening and by scale enlarging in re-allotments. On the contrary the former agricultural and mining (peat digging etc.) systems automatically lead to amplification of the spatial diversity in life circumstances. This regulation amplifying between nobsphere and biosphere was mainly the result of three factors: 1. The methods did not change for centuries. By this stability (no variety-in-time) the variety-inspace steadily increased. 2. Isolation by distance gave a gradual restriction to human influence. This restraint was minimal near the dwelling-places in the centre of the action-radius and maximal at the outside, with all possible degrees of influence between the extremes (fig. 6). 3. Our ancestors were operating gradually and on a small scale. By this dispersion in time, which has the same effects as dispersion in space, the spatial variety increased still more. Besides these three main factors numerous smaller elements of divergence occurred in the landscape, such as the unevenness of the soil surface, the windings of ways and watercourses and the tracks already mentioned before...|$|R
