40|$|Bico fibers include <b>bicomponent</b> and biconstituent fibers. <b>Bicomponent</b> fibers are {{synthetic}} fibers {{made from}} two polymers of different chemical and physical structure. They {{are produced by}} common melt-drawing processes similar to conventional synthetic fibers. [1]. The biconstituent fiber consists of a continuous matrix of one polymer in which a different fiber-forming polymer is dispersed as a second distinct discontinuous phase; it as mix-polymer fiber or fascicular microfiber because the microfibers are connected {{to each other and}} can’t function independently from each other. [2]. Among <b>bicomponent</b> fibers, the <b>bicomponent</b> microfiber is different from the core-sheath type of <b>bicomponent</b> fiber. In theory bico fibers can be made from many polymers but in fact, they are made frequently from CoPET/PA because of cost factors. The core-sheath bico fiber, including such varieties as PE/PP, PE/PET and CoPET/PET are used as bonding fibers for hygiene and medical nonwovens. A cross-sectional morphology of <b>bicomponent</b> fibers can be classified into four main types:”core-sheath”,”side-by-side”,”pie-wedge” and “islands in the sea”. The core-sheath and side-by-side <b>bicomponent</b> fibres are the basic structures of <b>bicomponent</b> fibres.

40|$|Symposium, Gels and Biomedical MaterialsGels and Biomedical MaterialsElectrospinning is a {{versatile}} technique for fabricating three-dimensional (3 D) nanofibrous scaffolds and the scaffolds {{have been found}} to elicit desirable cellular behavior for tissue regeneration because the nanofibrous structures mimic the nanofibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) of biological tissues. From the material point of view, the ECM of bone is a nanofibrous nanocomposite consisting of an organic matrix (mainly collagen) and inorganic bone apatite nanoparticles. Therefore, for bone tissue engineering scaffolds, it is natural to construct nanofibrous nanocomposites having a biodegradable polymer matrix and nanosized bioactive bioceramics. Our previous studies demonstrated: (1) electrospun nanocomposite fiber loaded with calcium phosphate (Ca-P) were osteoconductive and could promote osteoblastic cell proliferation and differentiation better than pure polymer fibers; (2) The controlled release of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP- 2) from scaffolds provided the scaffolds with desired osteoinductivity. In the current investigation, novel <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds for bone tissue engineering were produced using our established dual-source dual-power electrospinning technique to achieve both osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity. In the <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds, one fibrous component was electrospun Ca-P/PLGA nanocomposite fibers and the other component was emulsion electrospun PDLLA nanofibers incorporated with rhBMP- 2. Through electrospinning optimization, both fibers were evenly distributed in <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds. The mass ratio of rhBMP- 2 /PDLLA fibers to Ca-P/PLGA fibers in <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds could be controlled using multiple syringes.

40|$|Session J 3 : Nerual Tissue modulationSymposium J: Materials for Neural InterfacesRepairing {{peripheral}} nerve damages caused by nerve trauma, compression or tumor {{is still a}} challenge. For severe nerve defects, appropriate devices for bridging and guiding axons are necessary. Neural autograft segments {{can be used for}} such purposes but limited availability of donor nerves and function loss of donor sites have hampered the use of autografts. Tissue engineering nerve guides are a promising alternative. A variety of techniques can produce 3 D scaffolds with various architectures and properties but electrospinning and electrospun fibrous scaffolds have attracted great attention owing to many advantages. In nerve tissue repair, nanofibrous scaffolds can provide favourable conditions for Schwann cell migration and for guiding neurite outgrowth. Delivering locally growth factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF) can promote a range of neural responses and affect cell fate. In this investigation, for dual delivery and sustained release of growth factors, <b>bicomponent</b> nanofibrous scaffolds containing NGF and GDNF were fabricated via dual-source dual-power electrospinning and then evaluated. NGF and GDNF were encapsulated in PDLLA fibers and PLGA fibers, respectively, through emulsion electrospinning. The mass ratio of NGF/PDLLA fibers to GDNF/PLGA fibers in <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds could be varied to modulate growth factor release. Through optimization, uniform fibers were made and both types of fibers were evenly distributed in <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds. Using various techniques, the structure and properties of <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds were studied. Core-shell structures were formed for both types of fibers, with the growth factor-containing water phase being the core. All fibrous scaffolds exhibited good wettability. In vitro degradation of scaffolds and in vitro release of both growth factors were investigated for up to 42 days. The degradation rate of NGF/PDLLA fibers was much lower than that of GDNF/PLGA fibers due to slower degradation of PDLLA. The degradation rate of <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds increased with an increasing amount of GDNF/PLGA fibers. Scaffolds with fibers of different diameters exhibited different degradation rates. NGF and GDNF were both successfully incorporated in <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds with relatively high encapsulation efficiency. Sustained release of both growth factors was observed. The release of GDNF from mono- or <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds was much faster than that of NGF. The cumulative release amount of NGF or GDNF increased with an increasing amount of NGF/PDLLA fibers or GDNF/PLGA fibers in <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds, and increased with a decrease in fiber diameter.

This construction allows for a thermal annealing process that can be applied selectively to the skins to improve their conductivity through a kinetic re-aggregation process while retaining the mechanical properties of the core and hence those of the overall tape or fibre.

In contrast to composites and woven fabrics, nonwoven materials have a unique web structure, which is composed of randomly oriented fibres bonded in a pattern by mechanical, thermal or chemical techniques. The type of nonwovens studied in this research is a thermally bonded one with polymer-based <b>bicomponent</b> fibres. Such fibres have a core/sheath structure with outer layer (sheath) having a lower melting temperature {{than that of the}} core. In thermal bonding of such fibres, as the hot calender with an engraved pattern contacts the fibrous web, bond points are formed thanks to melting of the sheath material. Molten sheath material acts as an adhesive while core parts of the fibres remain fully intact in the bond points. On the other hand, web regions, which are not in contact with the hot engraved pattern, remain unaffected and form the fibre matrix that acts as a link between bond points. With two distinct regions, namely, bond points and fibre matrix, with different structures, nonwovens exhibit a unique deformation behaviour. This research aims to analyse the complex mechanical behaviour of thermally bonded <b>bicomponent</b> fibre nonwoven materials using a combination of experimental and numerical methods.

The outer annulus is made of nylon and has an inside diameter of 10 mum and outer diameter of 50 mum. The inner annulus is composed of carbon powder and has an outer diameter of 10 mum. For the bench scale reactors, approximately one kilometer length of fibers was wrapped around a series of plastic panels and placed in a plexiglass container containing sodium nitrate solution. The ends of the fibers were covered with electrically conductive epoxy and connected to a DC power supply. In experiments which lasted up to 96 h., the solution showed up to 50 percent decrease in nitrate concentration after the power supply was applied. Preliminary studies indicated that distance between panels, polarity of panels and voltage magnitude influenced observed concentration. Two one dimensional analytical solutions and finite element solutions for two dimensions were derived for no flow condition between parallel plates.

40|$|Electrospun fibrous {{scaffolds}} {{capable of}} providing growth factor delivery and contact guidance have distinctive advantages for tissue engineering. Gene delivery may also be employed for tissue regeneration. This project aimed to investigate the formation, structure and characteristics/properties of <b>bicomponent</b> nanofibrous scaffolds for the dual delivery of glial cell line-derived growth factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), aligned-fiber scaffolds providing both biochemical and topographical cues for peripheral nerve tissue regeneration, new polymeric vectors for gene delivery, and composite scaffolds with the combination of nanofibrous scaffolds and gene delivery. GDNF and NGF were incorporated into core-shell structured poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly (D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) nanofibers, respectively, through emulsion electrospinning. Using dual-source dual-power electrospinning (DSDP-ES), <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds composed of GDNF/PLGA fibers and NGF/PDLLA fibers with different fiber component ratios were produced. The structure and properties, including in vitro release behavior and in vitro degradation, of mono- and <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds were systematically investigated. Aligned-fiber <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds were subsequently made using DSDP-ES and high-speed electrospinning. Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) were formed using aligned-fiber scaffolds. To modulate the release behavior of GDNF and NGF, multi-layered fibrous scaffolds were fabricated through DSDP-ES and sequential electrospinning. Concurrent and sustained release of GDNF and NGF from <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds was achieved and their release profiles could be tuned. The aligned-fiber topography and dual and sustained delivery of growth factors were realized in both aligned-fiber <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds and NGCs. Spatio-temporal release of GDNF and NGF was achieved using multi-layered fibrous scaffolds. For gene delivery, PLGA and poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) -based nanocomplexes (NCs) were fabricated using different methods. To improve the stability and transfection efficiency of NCs, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), folic acid (FA), arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) peptides and isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV) peptides were employed and PLGA-PEI-PEG-FA and PLGA-PEI-PEG-RGD copolymers were synthesized. PLGA-PEI-PEG-FA/DNA, PLGA-PEI-PEG-RGD/DNA and PLGA-PEI-PEG-RGD/IKVAV/DNA NCs were formed through bulk mixing. The structure and properties, including morphology, particle size, surface charge and DNA encapsulation, of NCs were studied. Robust NCs with spherical shape, uniform size distribution and slightly positive charge were able to completely bind DNA above their respective N/P ratios. Composite scaffolds composed of <b>bicomponent</b> fibrous scaffolds and PLGA-PEI-PEG-RGD/DNA NCs were eventually formed using a wetting and freeze-drying method. In vitro biological investigations were conducted for scaffolds and NCs. The bioactivity of GDNF and NGF was preserved. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC 12 cells) were found to attach, spread and proliferate on all scaffolds. The release of growth factors from scaffolds could induce much improved neurite outgrowth and neural differentiation. GDNF and NGF released from GDNF/PLGA scaffolds and NGF/PDLLA scaffolds, respectively, could induce dose-dependent neural differentiation separately. A synergistic effect of GDNF and NGF released from <b>bicomponent</b> scaffolds on promoting neural differentiation was found. The delivery of growth factors and aligned-fiber morphology induced neurite alignment and much enhanced neural differentiation in a synergetic manner. PLGA-PEI-PEG-FA/DNA, PLGA-PEI-PEG-RGD/DNA and PLGA-PEI-PEG-RGD/IKVAV/DNA NCs showed both N/P ratio and cell type-dependent transfection efficiency. An increase in N/P ratio resulted in increased transfection efficiency, and much improved transfection efficiency of NCs was observed above their respective critical N/P ratios. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method to}} build <b>bicomponent</b> peptide self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been developed, by {{exploiting}} helix center dot center dot center dot helix macrodipole interactions. In this work, a peptide-based self-assembled monolayer {{composed of two}} helical peptides was immobilized on a gold surface. Specifically, a pyrene-containing octapeptide, devoid of any sulfur atom (A 8 Pyr), and a hexapeptide, functionalized at the N-terminus with (S,R) lipoic acid, for binding to gold substrates (SSA 4 WA) via a Au-S linkage, have been employed. Both peptides investigated attain a helical structure, because they are almost exclusively formed by strongly folding inducer C-alpha-tetrasubstituted alpha-amino acids. We demonstrate that the two peptides generate a stable supramolecular nanostructure (a densely packed <b>bicomponent</b> peptide monolayer), where A 8 Pyr is incorporated into the SSA 4 WA palisade by exploiting helix center dot center dot center dot helix macrodipole interactions. The presence of both peptides on the gold surface was investigated by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques, while the morphology of the monolayer was analyzed by ultra high-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscopy. The composition of the <b>bicomponent</b> SAM on the surface was studied {{by a combination of}} electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. In particular, the amount of Au-S linkages from the sulfur-containing peptides was quantified from reductive desorption of the peptide-based SAM, while the amount of A 8 Pyr was estimated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The antiparallel orientation of the A 8 Pyr and SSA 4 WA peptide chains minimizes the interaction energy between the helix dipoles, suggesting that this kind of electrostatic phenomenon is the driving force that stabilizes the <b>bicomponent</b> SAM...|$|E
40|$|Melt {{spinning}} of {{conductive polymer}} composites (CPCs) is coupled with some difficulties {{such as a}} decrease of conductivity upon drawing and a reduced spinnability with increasing filler concentration. Applying <b>bicomponent</b> technology may provide the possibility to produce fibers from CPCs with a high filler concentration. A pilot-scale <b>bicomponent</b> melt spinning set-up was used to produce core/sheath fibers with fiber titers between 13 and 47 dtex. The sheath material was polyamide 6 (PA 6) or polypropylene (PP) and the core material was a CPC. Two CPCs were used, polypropylene (PP) with carbon black (CB), denoted by PP/CB, and polyethylene (PE) with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), denoted by PE/MWNT. The results showed that both materials could be used with a filler concentration of 10 wt % to obtain melt draw ratios up to 195. The volumetric fraction of core material in the <b>bicomponent</b> structure was 28 %. A heat treatment of PP/CB fibers restored the conductivity {{to the level of}} the undrawn material, corresponding to an increase in conductivity by a factor 5. The same heat treatment had a positive effect on the conductivity of PE/MWNT fibers although the conductivity was not restored...|$|E
