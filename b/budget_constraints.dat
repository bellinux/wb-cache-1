By classifying the problems that were formerly conglomerated under the name of the “soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint,</b> ” we show that a “hard ” <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> exists for each specific problem. This leads to the realization that each of these problems originally belonged in a different analytic framework, and {{does not need to be}} related to the soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint.</b> Finally, we illustrate how the former conclusions drawn from the “soft ” perspective can be adjusted to form better interpretations under the original frameworks.

This article concentrates on the hospital sector. It describes the motivations and the contradictory behavior of the five main types {{of participants in the}} events: patients, doctors, hospital managers, politicians, and hospital owners. The motivations explain why the propensity to overspend and the tendency to soften the <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> are so strong. The burdens of overspending and indebtedness are pushed upwards at every level of the decision-making and funding processes. The article considers the connection between the soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> syndrome and the various forms of ownership (state ownership and the non-profit and for-profit forms of non-state ownership).

It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier {{would have been able to}} operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to <b>budget</b> <b>constraints.</b> Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks.

The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E

Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> forced a revision to 77,000.

The project was originally entitled Bug Hunt at Outpost 9, and had been in production before the producers bought the rights to Starship Troopers. The film was directed by Paul Verhoeven, who found the book too boring to read, and released in 1997. The screenplay, by Ed Neumeier, shared character names and some plot details with the novel. The film contained several elements that differed from the book, including a military that is completely integrated with respect to gender. It had the stated intention of treating its material in an ironic or sarcastic manner, in order to undermine the political ideology of the novel.

Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles.

40|$|The {{concept of}} soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> is recent in {{economic}} analysis.

Since Mises, like other Austrian economists, is virtually ignored in Brazilian courses of Economic Thought, this article intends to show his importance as a forerunner of the concept of soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint,</b> and will try to link these two theoretical views of economic systems.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the incentive {{effects of the}} soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> on the investment behavior of firms in general and on the investment-cash flow sensitivity in particular. To this end, we develop a simple model of moral hazard that takes the soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> into account.

We further show that the presence of the soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> deteriorates the moral hazard problem, thereby making the investment level less sensitive to the amount of internal funds. This is the case irrespective of whether the soft <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> renders the firm more or less liquidity constrained.
