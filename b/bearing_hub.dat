The flash geometry is very important in hot forging process because the flash geometry effects on the metal flow, material losses, forging load, die pressure and so on. In this study, the problem of designing the flash geometry is studied with flash thickness and width considering the maximum die pressure to apply an automatic transfer system in hot forging process for <b>bearing</b> <b>hub.</b> The numerical analysis was conducted by means of the commercial S/W DEFORM. On the basis of numerical analysis the flash geometry of hot forging die was redesigned, and experiment was conducted. From the experimental results, it was possible to produce <b>bearing</b> <b>hub</b> with an automatic transfer system without any deterioration of die lifetime...|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} {{scientists}} have been utilizing stratospheric balloons as low-cost platforms on which to conduct space science experiments. A major hurdle in extending the range of experiments for which these vehicles are useful has been the imposition of the gondola dynamics on the accuracy with which an instrument can be kept pointed at a celestial target. A significant number of scientists have sought the ability to point their instruments with jitter in the arc-second range. This paper presents the design and analysis of a stratospheric balloon borne pointing system that is able to meet this requirement. The foundation for a high fidelity controller simulation is presented. The flexibility of the flight train is represented through generalized modal analysis. A multiple controller scheme is introduced for coarse and fine pointing. Coarse azimuth pointing is accomplished by an established pointing system, with extensive flight history, residing above the gondola structure. A pitch-yaw gimbal mount is used for fine pointing, providing orthogonal axes when nominally on target. Fine pointing actuation is from direct drive dc motors, eliminating backlash problems. An analysis of friction nonlinearities and {{a demonstration of the}} necessity in eliminating static fiction are provided. A unique <b>bearing</b> <b>hub</b> design is introduced that eliminates static fiction from the system dynamics. A control scheme involving linear accelerometers for enhanced disturbance rejection is also presented. Results from a linear analysis of the total system and the high fidelity simulation are given. This paper establishes that the proposed control strategy can be made robustly stable with significant design margins. Also demonstrated is the efficacy of the proposed system in rejecting disturbances larger than those considered realistic.

40|$|Load Sensing Bearing (LSB) {{units are}} based on the {{measurement}} of the elastic deformation of the outer ring of the bearing unit usually using strain gauges which are placed along the circumference of the bearing. The master thesis is aimed at estimating the lateral tire force of a vehicle wheel using the vehicle wheel <b>bearing</b> <b>hub</b> unit which is instrumented to become a LSB and is placed in a BMW E 60 lab vehicle. Calibration of the LSB is needed to obtain a strain-force model. In situ calibration is expensive, time consuming and not always possible. Therefore a calibration system, the Bearing Test System (BETSY) has been used. Sensor responses of the LSB are greatly influenced by differences in bearing housing compliance where on one hand the LSB is mounted on the machine {{and on the other hand}} in the vehicle. It will be shown how it is possible to use BETSY as calibration system when the LSB is mounted to machine via the actual knuckle and ball joints found in the vehicle. Next, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is used to obtain a strain-force model to estimate the lateral force. However, the strain gauges are subjected to thermal influences of a low frequent nature and can therefore only be used to estimate the ‘high’- frequent lateral force. Besides that, it is not possible with the specific compact wheel hub unit of the BMW E 60 lab vehicle to determine, with the strain gauges, whether the vehicle is turning left or right. To overcome these two issues, two Eddy-current sensors measuring the tilting movement of the ABS-ring, which is integrated in the seal of the bearing, are used to determine the direction and to estimate the low frequent content of the lateral force. Calibration and validation experiments are performed to show the accuracy and precision of the lateral force estimation.
