50|$|Some {{derivatives}} (especially swaps) expose {{investors to}} counterparty risk, or risk {{arising from the}} other party in a financial transaction. Different types of derivatives have different levels of counter party risk. For example, standardized stock options by law require the party at risk {{to have a certain}} amount deposited with the exchange, showing that they can pay for any losses; banks that help <b>businesses</b> <b>swap</b> variable for fixed rates on loans may do credit checks on both parties. However, in private agreements between two companies, for example, there may not be benchmarks for performing due diligence and risk analysis.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. DartMail {{realizes the}} concept of {{transferring}} digital information with physical surrogates. In a lightweight manner, it allows users to easily associate information with augmented physical darts, transfer that information, then retrieve the information. One of the principle activities in group interaction is exchanging information between collaborators. People <b>swap</b> <b>business</b> cards and vacation photos, and coauthors exchange evolving versions of a paper. Computers system equivalents allow people to store and forward digital documents by email, file transfers, web links, or through shared file servers. Yet these conventional methods of transferring information assume the exchange of either electronic or physical information. This distinction is limiting, since physical and electronic information can be linked (Ishii, 2003). For example, digital vacation photos are intimately related to a hand-written postcard: both are linked but we normally send them separately. If instead the pictures were “linked ” to the postcard, the recipient could view the pictures as they read the postcard...|$|R
50|$|Upon arrival, {{the three}} {{brothers}} established {{a business in}} Ennis, Texas, peddling junk. Jim bought a blind white mule and peddled from the mule cart in towns between Ennis and Dallas. By 1914 the brothers relocated their junk business to Austin. When World War I broke out in Europe that year, scrap metal prices skyrocketed. The brothers hit it big and became wealthy. So while still a teenager with very little English skills, Novy struck it rich in America. When World War I ended in 1918, Scrap metal prices tanked. Novy got into other ventures, {{one of which was}} movie theaters. His brother Sam died that year from the Influenza epidemic of 1918. His other brother Louis remained struggling in the scrap metal business. By the mid-1920s scrap metal prices recovered, but Louis's credit was no good. So the two <b>swapped</b> <b>businesses</b> - Louis took over the theater business and Jim became a scrap metal dealer again, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|R
40|$|Through time swap meets have changed. Not {{only the}} number of swap meets in the area under study has increased, but the social {{relations}} between vendors and consumers, the kind of goods sold and the channels through which they are supplied have also changed. Around the 1970 s Mexican migrants tried their luck as vendors at the swap meets, first selling used merchandise and slowly introducing new goods used by the Mexican population. Now a day in every swap meet we find stands with Mexican music and films, exotic boots, belts and hats, Mexican handcrafts, toys, herbs and vitamins from Mexico, t-shirts with Mexican symbols, blankets with the virgin of Guadalupe and flags, religious paraphernalia {{with all sorts of}} virgins and saints including the migrant saint; dresses for quinceañera (15 th year parties), baptisms, first communions. All sorts of chilies, beans and corn are being sold at the swap meets. However, swap meets have grown to be vibrant markets, especially the larger ones, where migrant families can find almost everything they need for their households: from linen clothes to furniture, from fruits and vegetables to garden flowers and plants, from electric appliances to work tools, from cosmetics and accessories for young girls to gold jewelry for the whole family and decorations for all sorts of parties. This article has two related objectives. The first is to describe the swap meets’ main characteristics and how they have changed in the last decades, paying special attention to changes introduced by Mexican vendors and consumers. The second is to explore how Mexican immigrants have been able to become self employed and open a <b>business</b> at the <b>swap</b> meet. I discuss how Mexican vendors use their social, human and financial capital to start their businesses and the strategies they follow. The study of ethnic entrepreneurship has been mainly concentrated on urban settings. The importance of ethnic businesses for the urban economies in the Unite...|$|R
