5|$|Omphalotus species cause a {{white rot}} by {{breaking}} down lignin in their tree hosts. The fungus infiltrates the heartwood {{of the tree}} via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or mistletoe, or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in <b>blackbutt</b> (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River peppermint (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, <b>Blackbutt</b> and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed sightings in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. Sightings in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot, the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Xerochrysum bracteatum {{occurs in}} all Australian {{mainland}} states and territories, {{as well as}} Tasmania. Widespread, it is found from North Queensland across to Western Australia, and in all habitats excluding densely shaded areas. It grows as an annual in patches of red sand in Central Australia, responding rapidly to bouts of rainfall to complete its lifecycle. It is common among granite outcrops in southwest Western Australia, and is found on heavier and more fertile soils in the Sydney region, such as basalt-, shale-, or limestone-based soils, generally in areas with a high water table. Associated species in the Sydney Basin include <b>blackbutt</b> (Eucalyptus pilularis) in open forest, and the shrubs Empodisma minus and Baloskion australe in swampy areas. It has been reported growing in disturbed soil, along roadsides and in fields in the New England region in the United States.|$|E

A parade up High Street and a farewell social had been held in the Boonah School of Arts Hall the previous evening. These recruits were taken by car to Ipswich to join the Dungarees the same day.|$|E
25|$|Less than 100 {{years after}} Captain Cook's landing, {{most of the}} {{original}} vegetation had been cleared and burnt, larger trees had been ring barked or simply cut down. Thomas Holt {{who was the first}} owner of the area (and who also owned most of what is today the Sutherland Shire) planned to use the dunes for farming sheep, this industry failed more or less. To promote grass growth he destroyed as many of the oldest trees as was viable and to his dismay all that regrew was dense impenetrable thorny scrub. By 1868 the forests of <b>blackbutt</b> and ironbark were cut down for houses and bridge construction whilst the remaining vegetation was cleared for grazing.|$|E
25|$|Logging on {{the island}} began in 1863, {{initiated}} by American Jack Piggott (known as 'Yankee Jack'). <b>Blackbutt</b> trees (Eucalyptus pilularis), Queensland kauri (Agathis robusta) and satinay or Fraser Island turpentine (Syncarpia hillii) were extensively exploited as they provided excellent timber. Satinay logs were sent to Egypt {{to be used in}} the construction of the Suez Canal. For the first 70 years of logging, bullock drays were used to haul the timber to loading points on the beach. Railway tracks were laid through the forest to facilitate logging, but were later removed. The logging industry continued until 1991, ceasing following concerns raised by the Commission of Inquiry into the Conservation, Management and Use of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region, appointed by the Goss Labor government and chaired by Justice Tony Fitzgerald.|$|E
50|$|The town of Ourimbah, {{with its}} blue gums, <b>blackbutts,</b> round leaved gum, spotted gum and white {{mahogany}} trees, was an ideal {{place for the}} milling of timber to support a Sydney building boom between 1840 and 1870.

Attracted by the availability of work cutting timber, {{a great number of}} young couples moved all through the Central Coast, gradually forming settlements at which many began to put down roots.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Europeans, the area now known as Croydon was part of the land which the Wangal tribe hunted and lived having {{migrated}} down from northern Australia and before that Asia. Their focus of tribal land was believed to be centred on Concord and stretched east to the swampland of Long Cove Creek. The land was heavily wooded at the time with tall eucalypts, <b>blackbutts</b> and turpentines covering the higher ground and mangroves, swamp oaks and swamp mahoganies in the lower swampy ground of Iron Cove Creek. The diet of the Wangal was primarily fish so they spent most of their time living near the shores of the Parramatta River and fishing in canoes. The land away from the river shores provided fruits, berries and edible plants as well as possums and kangaroos, which were killed both for food and their skins.|$|R

25|$|Impressive {{groves of}} {{turpentine}} (Syncarpia glomulifera) and <b>blackbutt</b> (Eucalyptus pilularis) trees {{may be seen}} growing straight {{up into the sky}} forming an open canopy with widely spaced trunks. In these characteristic areas they are generally considered open forest, they may have a grassy understory, a sclerophyll shrubbery or alternatively they may have a rainforest subcanopy or a rainforest understory with growth being densest nearest to the valley floor or permanent watercourses. In these turpentine forests often hundreds of cabbage palms (Livistona australis) may be seen growing in dense tall thickets which are rarely touched by fire or they may exist as young plants in open grassy spaces which are burnt regularly enough not to form visible trunks. Rainforest pockets are dominated by jackwood and sassafras. The lilli pilli (Acmena smithii) produces a fruit edible raw. Another common species is the coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum) which were used extensively from Australian rainforests to manufacture horse-drawn coaches.|$|E
500|$|Adults {{are present}} from November to early March, {{prolific}} {{in some years}} and absent in others. They are found in dry sclerophyll forest, preferring to alight and feed on large eucalypts with diameters over [...] and sparse foliage concentrated at a height between , particularly rough-barked species, apples (Angophora) and Tristania. Associated trees include the grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana), snappy gum (E. racemosa) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. At Hawks Nest in coastal swampy sclerophyll woodland, adults were observed mainly on swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta) and sometimes <b>blackbutt</b> (E. pilularis), as well as Allocasuarina littoralis and introduced pine (Pinus radiata).

It grows in sunny to lightly shaded areas in open forest or woodland with a shrubby understory. In the Sydney Basin, it is associated with such trees as Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), silvertop ash (E.sieberi), blue-leaved stringybark (E.agglomerata), <b>blackbutt</b> (E.pilularis), grey ironbark (E.paniculata), snappy gum (E.rossii), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), narrow-leaved stringybark (E.sparsifolia) and smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata) and shrubs such as Grevillea obtusiflora, G.phylicoides, Kowmung hakea (Hakea dohertyi), long leaf smoke bush (Conospermum longifolium) and stiff geebung (Persoonia rigida). In the vicinity of Nowra and Jervis Bay, it is an understory component of the widespread Currambene Lowlands Forest community, alongside such plants as gorse bitter pea (Daviesia ulicifolia), bearded heath (Leucopogon juniperinus) and native daphne (Pittosporum undulatum) with spotted gum (Corymbia maculata), white stringybark (Eucalyptus globoidea) and woollybutt (E.longifolia) as the dominant trees. The tall dry sclerophyll forest is on hilly terrain with good drainage. The underlying soil is a yellow loam originating from mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the main ecological and morphological {{attributes of the}} eucalypts and related genus Corymbia using Pryor and Johnson's taxonomic classification (1971) and other recent works by Johnson (1976) and Hill and Johnson (1995) as guidelines. The main thrust is on what taxonomy can teach us on 'natural grouping'and 'evolution pathways' within the large and extremely diverse genus Eucalyptus. The description goes from the more primitive forms i. e. the bloodwoods (subgenus Blakella), to those natural groups which are better adapted to new environmental conditions i. e. the subgenus Symphyomyrtus (e. g. section Transversaria) and the stringybarks, <b>blackbutts,</b> ashes and peppermints (section Renantheria) of the Monocalyptus subgenus. Several examples show how the capacity of certain species {{to survive in a}} changing environment has been enhanced by the progressive transformation of key morphological attributes. Modern works on the systematics of eucalypts integrate the knowledge on ecology, chemistry, palaeontology, floral biology and genetics in addition to the more conventional studies on morphological traits and their adaptive values. The authors' conclusion is that more attention should be given to taxonomy when the purpose is to explore species' natural variation. Furthermore, it is the authors' opinion that the adaptive capacity of certain Eucalyptus species known for their good performances in plantations could {{have much to do with}} the geological history of their natural habitat. This is based on field observations. It seems that the best performing natural populations of several important tropical eucalypts, in terms of adaptation to new environments, are located in mountainous regions affected by the most recent geological events rather than in the geologically unchanged peneplains of northern Australia...|$|R
