40|$|Agents {{with perfect}} introspection may have {{incomplete}} {{beliefs about the}} world, but they possess complete knowledge about their own beliefs. This fact suggests that the beliefs of introspective agents should be completely determined by their objective beliefs, that is, those beliefs that are only about the domain in question and not about other beliefs. Introspection and logical reasoning alone should suffice to reconstruct all other beliefs from the objective ones. While this property {{has been shown to}} hold for proposi-tional <b>belief</b> <b>logics,</b> there have so far only been negative results in the case of first-order <b>belief</b> <b>logics</b> with quantifying-in.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a formal}} approach for establishing theories of trust for authentication systems {{which can be}} used to reason about how agent beliefs evolve through time. The goal of an authentication system is to verify and authorise users in order to protect restricted data and information, so trust is a critical issue for authentication systems. After authentication, two principals (people, computers, services) should be entitled to believe that they are communicating with each other and not with intruders. So, it is important to express such beliefs precisely and to capture the reasoning that leads to them. In this paper, we focus on analysis of agent beliefs in dynamic environments using a temporalised <b>belief</b> <b>logic,</b> obtained by adding a temporal logic onto a <b>belief</b> <b>logic.</b> Working through a well-known authentication protocol, namely Kerberos, we discuss how to express principal beliefs involved in authentication protocols and the evolution of those beliefs based on a series of observations of agents as a consequence of communication.
