5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E

Wałęsa defeated Mazowiecki {{and in the second}} round Stanisław Tymiński, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> his presidency economic policy remained unchanged.|$|E

5|$|Similarly to {{the rest}} of Dorset, Bournemouth's economy is {{primarily}} in the service sector, which employed 95% of the workforce in 2010.

Of particular importance are the financial and public service sectors which through 2011 continued to show sustained growth.

5|$|The 400-series {{highways}} are {{a network}} of controlled-access highways throughout the southern portion of the Canadian province of Ontario, forming a special subset of the provincial highway system. They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, <b>but</b> <b>under</b> provincial jurisdiction and regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). Although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior, 400-series designations were introduced in 1952.
