30|$|Changes {{in ambient}} {{temperature}} seriously affect physiological regulation and biochemical reactions in ectotherms. However, transient elevation in oceanic temperature occurs naturally during the day. Short-term elevation in the ambient temperature affects different physiological responses in marine fish, including cellular protein stability and osmotic {{balance of the}} internal environment. Since fish gills are vital osmoregulatory organ which directly contacts external environment, activation of cytoprotective responses to maintain gill cell viability and biological function is essential for fish survival under challenging environmental conditions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the short-term effects of elevated temperature on physiological regulation in the gills of a marine teleost, <b>blue</b> green damselfish (<b>Chromis</b> viridis).|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 63 - 69) In {{marine organisms}} with complex life histories {{it is possible}} for events occurring during earlier life stages to affect an individual???s subsequent survival. In fishes, it has been proposed that settlement, the transition from a pelagic habitat to a benthic one, is a critical period in determining survivorship. Selection (i. e., non-random mortality) may occur on specific larval traits, which could influence an individual???s probability of survival after settlement. Herein I examine the effects of larval traits on the survival of juveniles shortly after settlement in two temperate and two tropical reef fishes. This was achieved by comparing traits of individuals sampled just after settlement with those of individuals from the same cohort sampled one month later, which evaluated selective mortality occurring over a cohort???s first month of life on the reef. The two temperate species studied were se??orita, Oxyjulis californica, and blackeye goby, Rhinogobiops nicholsii. Collections were completed at four sites at Santa Catalina Island, California, and two times between June and August of 2009. For se??orita, I examined four larval traits: planktonic larval duration (PLD), size at settlement, metamorphosis band width, and pre-settlement growth rates. For the blackeye goby I examined two traits: size at settlement and pre-settlement growth rates. This study revealed that selection was inconsistent in both species. There were differences in both the direction and intensity of selection between the different sites as well as times. Differences in selection intensity were not related to variation in habitat characteristics or conspecific densities. Unlike selection, I found some consistent differences in larval traits between cohorts in se??orita. For the se??orita I found that individuals settling earlier in the summer had longer PLDs and slower growth rates than those settling later in the summer. In Moorea, French Polynesia I studied the <b>blue</b> green <b>chromis,</b> Chromis viridis, and the Gnatholepis species complex, Gnatholepis scapulostigma/anjerensis. This study was conducted at two sites on the North side of the island. Unlike the temperate study, only one cohort was examined due to logistical constraints. I examined three larval traits for both ???species???: PLD, size at settlement, and pre-settlement growth rates. For the Gnatholepis species complex, I did not find any evidence of selection or any differences between the two study sites for any of the larval traits measured. For Chromis viridis, I found that there was selection for larger sizes at settlement at both sites. However, selection on the other two larval traits was inconsistent between the two sites, with one site showing selection for faster pre-settlement growth rates and the other showing selection for longer PLDs. For this study I also explored whether differences in habitat characteristics or predator densities between the two sites might be influencing these patterns. These two sites were not significantly different in terms of habitat or predator densities and therefore these factors could not explain differences in selection between sites. These two studies reveal that selection on larval traits can vary greatly on relatively small scales: with sites less than 3 km apart exhibiting differences in the direction or strength of selection on a larval trait. This small-scale variation in selection may be one reason why variability in larval traits is maintained in these species. Understanding the causes of variation in larval traits in these populations and how variation is being maintained, through processes such as selective mortality, will help to understand and predict recruitment dynamics and ultimately community structure...|$|R

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of 50 ornamental fish species from shallow water habitats on coral reefs were investigated using visual census techniques, between latitudes 11 − 29 °N in the Red Sea, in Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, and in the adjacent Gulf of Aden in Djibouti. One hundred eighteen transects (each 100 × 5 m) were examined in 29 sites (3 − 8 sites per country). A total of 522, 523 fish individuals were counted during this survey, with mean abundance of 4428. 2 ± 87. 26 individual per 500 m² transect. In terms of relative abundance (RA), the most abundant species were <b>Blue</b> green damselfish, <b>Chromis</b> viridis (RA= 54. 4 %), followed by Sea goldie, Pseudanthias squamipinnis (RA= 34. 7), Whitetail dascyllus, Dascyllus aruanus (RA= 2. 6 %), Marginate dascyllus, Dascyllus marginatus (RA= 2. 0), Red Sea eightline flasher Paracheilinus octotaenia (RA= 1. 0), and Klunzinger’s wrasse, Thalassoma rueppellii (0. 7 %). The highest number of species (S) per 500 m² transect was found on reefs at the latitude 20 ° in Saudi Arabia (S= 21. 8), and the lowest number of species was found at the latitude 15 ° in Djibouti (S= 11. 11). The highest mean abundance (8565. 8) was found on reefs at latitude 20 ° in Saudi Arabia and the lowest mean abundance (230) was found on reefs at latitude 22 °, also in Saudi Arabia. Whereas, the highest Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index was found in reefs at the latitude 22 ° (H`= 2. 4) and the lowest was found in reefs at the latitude 20 ° (H`= 0. 6). This study revealed marked differences {{in the structure of}} ornamental fish assemblages with latitudinal distribution. The data support the presence of two major biogeographic groups of fishes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden: the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden group and the group in the northern and central Red Sea. Strong correlations were found between live coral cover and the number of fish species, abundance and Shannon-Wiener Diversity indices, and the strength of these correlations varied among the reefs. A conclusion was done that environmental differences among the reefs and the habitats investigated were important components of abundance variations and species diversity of ornamental fish along latitudinal gradients in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden...|$|R

50|$|Being {{a shallow}} water fish, the <b>blue</b> <b>chromis</b> is {{commonly}} found at depths of 3 to 5 m, {{but it can}} reach depths of 25 m below sea level. It's also been recorded {{at a depth of}} 60 m below sea level. It lives on the surface of reefs, but often swims in the water columns above the reefs to feed on plankton. It's a rather solitary species, seen alone or in small groups, and tends to stay close to the reefs. The younger fish stay near the bottom in order to avoid predators. The males maintain a solitary breeding territory. After breeding with multiple females, they guard the eggs until the planktonic larvae hatch.|$|E
50|$|The {{marine life}} found here {{consists}} of anemones, urchins, sea cucumbers, and eels, which all {{live on the}} reefs along with turtles, conch and many varieties of marine fishes.

40|$|Mesophotic coral {{ecosystems}} (MCEs; reefs 30 - 150 m depth) are {{of increased}} research interest {{because of their}} potential role as depth refuges from many shallow reef threats. Yet few studies have identified patterns in fish species composition and trophic group structure between MCEs and their shallow counterparts. Here we explore reef fish species and biomass distributions across shallow to upper-MCE Caribbean reef gradients (5 - 40 m) around Utila, Honduras, using a diver-operated stereo-video system. Broadly, we found reef fish species richness, abundance and biomass declining with depth. At the trophic group level we identified declines in herbivores (both total and relative community biomass) with depth, mostly driven by declines in parrotfish (Scaridae). Piscivores increased {{as a proportion of}} the community with increased depth while, in contrast to previous studies, we found no change in relative planktivorous reef fish biomass across the depth gradient. In addition, we also found evidence of ontogenetic migrations in the blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus), striped parrotfish (Scarus iserti), <b>blue</b> <b>chromis</b> (Chromis cyanea), creole wrasse (Clepticus parrae), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus), with a higher proportion of larger individuals at mesophotic and near-mesophotic depths than on shallow reefs. Our results highlight the importance of using biomass measures when considering fish community changes across depth gradients, with biomass generating different results to simple abundance counts...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a result of {{long-term}} fish monitoring studies supported by the National Park Service (NPS) at the Virgin Islands National Park since 1988 and is now a joint NPS and NOAA collaboration. Reef fish monitoring data collected from 1988 to 2006 within Virgin Islands National Park (VINP) and adjacent reefs around St. John, U. S. Virgin Islands (USVI) were analyzed to provide information on the status of reef fishes during the monitoring period. Monitoring projects were initiated by the National Park Service (NPS) in the 1980 s to provide useful data for evaluation of resources and for development of a long-term monitoring program. Monthly monitoring was conducted at two reef sites (Yawzi Point and Cocoloba Cay) starting in November 1988 for 2. 5 years to document the monthly/seasonal variability in reef fish assemblages. Hurricane Hugo (a powerful Category 4 storm) struck the USVI in September 1989 resulting in considerable damage to the reefs around St. John. Abundance of fishes was lower at both sites following the storm, however, a greater effect was observed at Yawzi Point, which experienced a more direct impact from the hurricane. The storm affected species differently, with some showing only small, short-term declines in abundance, and others, such as the numerically abundant <b>blue</b> <b>chromis</b> (Chromis cyanea), a planktivorous damselfish, exhibiting a larger and longer recovery period. This report provides: 1) an evaluation of sampling methods, sample size, and methods used during the sampling period, 2) an evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability in reef fish assemblages at selected reef sites inside and outside of VINP, and 3) an evaluation of trends over 17 years of monitoring at the four reference sites. Comparisons of methods were conducted to standardize assessments among years. Several methods were used to evaluate sample size requirements for reef fish monitoring and the results provided a statistically robust justification for sample allocation...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 115 - 120). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Species composition and relative abundance of ichthyofaunal assemblages on reefs surrounding Guanaja, Bay Islands, Honduras were censused from June through December 1996. Transect and random swim surveys were used to characterize community structure across patch, fringing, barrier, and wall reef types at five permanent study sites (transect surveys) and 24 randomly visited sites (random swim censuses). Overall, 170 species were documented during transect and random swim censuses. One hundred and one species representing 32 families and 23, 512 individuals were sighted during 216 transect surveys of reef crest and wall habitats. Four species, masked goby (Coryphopterus personatus), <b>blue</b> <b>chromis</b> (Chromis cyanea), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), and fairy bassist (Gramma loreto) represented 54. 7 % of the individuals recorded during transect surveys. Reef crest transects at permanent study sites yielded 83 species representing 26 families dominated by Families Pomacentridae, Labridae, and Scaridae. Adjacent wall transects produced higher totals (92 species representing 31 families) dominated by Gobiidae and Grammatidae. Wall transects also yielded higher species/census (2 of 4 sites) and individuals/census (3 of 4) sites statistics. Reef type and topographical characteristics (i. e. depth and habitat complexity) were major factors in structuring reef fish assemblages at each of the five permanent study sites surrounding Guanaja. Species totals at respective sites only varied from 66 (Bayman Drop) to 72 (Rainbow Reef); however, differences in community composition were notable across sites. Steep wails and overhangs at Bayman Drop (wall reel) provided preferred habitat for masked goby and fairy bassist, and thus facilitated this site exhibiting peak CPUE (1. 48 individuals/m?) recorded among sites. Conversely, lack of habitat complexity at Bayman Drop limited species/census statistics to the lowest across sites. Blacktip Slumberland reef site, in exhibiting increased depth and decreased habitat complexity, yielded the lowest CPUE (0. 79 individuals/m?) among all sites. Random swim censuses conducted in conjunction with transect surveys targeted three habitats (wall reef crest, and sandy bottom), and provided a more complete species listing of fishes. One hundred fifty-nine species representing 44 families were sighted at 24 reef sites in 143 daytime random swims, while 79 species from 30 families were observed during 26 nighttime random swims. Day and nighttime random swims revealed 58 species not recorded during transect surveys...|$|E
