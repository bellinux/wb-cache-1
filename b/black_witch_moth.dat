5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>witch</b> <b>moth</b> {{is found}} {{throughout}} Central America and Mexico, with its distribution extending from Brazil {{to the southern}} United States. [...] Adults feed on overripe rainforest fruit, especially bananas, and larvae consume the leaves of plants. Most of its host plants are legumes. It favors Acacia species, Kentucky Coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus), and Candle Bush (Senna alata). It attacks mesquite and edible fig, and can be an agricultural pest.|$|E

5000|$|In Paraguay {{people are}} afraid of the <b>Black</b> <b>witch</b> <b>moth,</b> as there is a mistaken belief about the moth urinating over their human [...] "victims" [...] and thereby inoculating their eggs, which then develop into maggots {{developing}} under the skin. Some also believe, if it touches your eyes, you can go blind. The maggots referred to are the myiasis-causing larvae of the human botfly (Dermatobia hominis). As a consequence of that belief, both the moth and the maggot are called with the common name [...] "Ura". Both the name and folk belief are of unknown origin.|$|E
5000|$|In Spanish, the <b>Black</b> <b>Witch</b> <b>moth</b> {{is known}} as [...] "Mariposa de la muerte" [...] (Mexico & Costa Rica), [...] "Pirpinto de la Yeta" [...] (Argentina), [...] "Tara Bruja" [...] (Venezuela) or simply [...] "Mariposa negra" [...] (Colombia); in Nahuatl (Mexico) it is [...] "Miquipapalotl" [...] or [...] "Tepanpapalotl" [...] (miqui = death, black + papalotl = moth); in Quechua (Peru) it is [...] "Taparaco"; in Mayan (Yucatán) it is [...] "X-mahan-nah" [...] (mahan = to borrow + nah = house); Other names for the moth include the Papillion-devil, La Sorcière Noire, or the Mourning or Sorrow moth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Witch</b> <b>moth</b> is {{considered}} a harbinger of death in Mexican and Caribbean folklore. In many cultures, one of these moths flying into the house {{is considered}} bad luck: e.g., in Mexico, when there is sickness in a house and this moth enters, it is believed the sick person will die, though a variation on this theme (in the lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas) is that death only occurs if the moth flies in and visits all four corners of one's house (in Mesoamerica, from the prehispanic era until the present time, moths {{have been associated with}} death and the number four). In some parts of Mexico, people joke that if one flies over someone's head, the person will lose his hair.|$|E

40|$|After {{publication}} {{we discovered}} {{an error in}} the identification of the origin of the cell line reported in our article in BMC Biotechnology (2010, 10 : 50), entitled "Ao 38, a new cell line from eggs of the <b>black</b> <b>witch</b> <b>moth,</b> Ascalapha odorata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is permissive for AcMNPV infection and produces high levels of recombinant proteins". Upon analysis of primary A. odorata cultures, we found that they were contaminated with cells of Trichoplusia ni origin. The origin of the Ao 38 cell line was determined as T. ni using three marker genes and the Ao 38 cell line was renamed BTI-Tnao 38. References to the origin of the cell line as Ascalapha odorata should be replaced with "a cell line of Trichoplusia ni origin". The absence of TNCL virus detection in the BTI-Tnao 38 (Ao 38) cell line was confirmed using a highly sensitive RT-PCR protocol capable of detecting TNCL virus RNA at approximately 0. 018 copies/cell. Because of these observations, we have revised the title of the original article to "Correction: BTI-Tnao 38, a new cell line derived from Trichoplusia ni, is permissive for AcMNPV infection and produces high levels of recombinant proteins" and two additional authors were added to reflect their contributions to the analysis of this cell line...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The insect {{cell line}} is a {{critical}} component {{in the production of}} recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression system and new cell lines hold the promise of increasing both quantity and quality of protein production. Results Seventy cell lines were established by single-cell cloning from a primary culture of cells derived from eggs of the <b>black</b> <b>witch</b> <b>moth</b> (Ascalapha odorata; Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). Among 8 rapidly growing lines, cell line 38 (Ao 38) was selected for further analysis, based on susceptibility to AcMNPV infection and production of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) from a baculovirus expression vector. In comparisons with low-passage High Five (BTI-Tn- 5 B 1 - 4) cells, infected Ao 38 cells produced β-galactosidase and SEAP at levels higher (153 % and 150 %, respectively) than those measured from High Five cells. Analysis of N-glycans of SEAP produced in Ao 38 cells revealed two N-glycosylation sites and glycosylation patterns similar to those reported for High Five and Sf 9 cells. Glycopeptide isoforms consisted of pauci- or oligomannose, with and without fucose on N-acetylglucosamine(s) linked to asparagine residues. Estimates of Ao 38 cell volume suggest that Ao 38 cells are approximately 2. 5 × larger than Sf 9 cells but only approximately 74 % of the size of High Five cells. Ao 38 cells were highly susceptible to AcMNPV infection, similar to infectivity of Sf 9 cells. Production of infectious AcMNPV budded virions from Ao 38 cells peaked at approximately 4. 5 × 10 7 IU/ml, exceeding that from High Five cells while lower than that from Sf 9 cells. Ao 38 cells grew rapidly in stationary culture with a population doubling time of 20. 2 hr, and Ao 38 cells were readily adapted to serum-free medium (Sf- 900 III) and to a suspension culture system. Analysis of Ao 38 and a parental Ascalapha odorata cell line indicated that these lines were free of the alphanodavirus that was recently identified as an adventitious agent in High Five cell lines. Conclusions Ao 38 cells represent a highly productive new insect cell line that will be useful for heterologous protein expression and other applications in biotechnology. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The Erebinae are a {{subfamily}} of moths in the Erebidae family. Erebine moths {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, but reach their greatest {{diversity in the}} tropics. While {{the exact number of}} species belonging to the Erebinae is not known, the subfamily is estimated to include around 10,000 species. Some well-known Erebinae include Underwing <b>moths</b> (Catocala), and <b>Witch</b> <b>moths</b> (Thermesiini). Many of the species in the subfamily have medium to large wingspans (7 to 10 cm, 3 to 4 inches), up to nearly 30 cm in the White <b>Witch</b> <b>moth</b> (Thysania agrippina), which has the widest wingspan of all Lepidoptera. Erebine caterpillars feed on a broad range of plants; many species feed on grasses and legumes, and a few are pests of castor bean, sugarcane, rice, as well as pistachios [...] and blackberries.|$|R
