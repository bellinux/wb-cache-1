5|$|From 2005 to 2006, Clarkson {{embarked}} on three concert tours to promote Breakaway: the Hazel Eyes Tour, the <b>Breakaway</b> World Tour, and the Addicted Tour. The Hazel Eyes tour {{took place in}} various theaters throughout North America, with the concert at UCF Arena being streamed live on AOL and AOL Radio. The <b>Breakaway</b> World Tour, {{which took place in}} between the Hazel Eyes Tour, marked Clarkson's first world tour, visiting theaters and arenas throughout Europe and Oceania. Upon returning to the United States, she then {{embarked on}} the Addicted Tour, performing at various amphitheaters across North America.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} <b>breakaway</b> group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) {{broke away from the}} lead group to try for the victory. As if the success of the <b>breakaway</b> wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Breakaways</b> Conservation Park (prior to July 2013 called The <b>Breakaways</b> Reserve or {{just simply}} The <b>Breakaways)</b> is a {{protected}} area in northern South Australia, {{just off the}} Stuart Highway 33 km north of Coober Pedy. The <b>Breakaways</b> CP is managed under a co-management agreement by the Department of Environment, Water, and Natural Resources {{in conjunction with the}} Antakirinja Matu-Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal Corporation and the District Council of Coober Pedy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Breakaways</b> were an English female vocal trio, {{formed in}} 1962. Britain's premiere session vocalists {{throughout}} the 1960s, The <b>Breakaways</b> also recorded {{a handful of}} little-known girl group singles.|$|R
50|$|After the Kemmelberg, the {{ultimate}} battle between <b>breakaways</b> formed on the bergs and the chasing peloton unfolds on the 35-kilometre flat roads towards the finish. Despite {{its reputation as}} a spinter's classic, Gent-Wevelgem’s notoriously unpredictable terrain has shown <b>breakaways</b> frequently holding off their pursuers.|$|R
5|$|The early <b>breakaway</b> {{included}} four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the <b>breakaway,</b> now just a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other <b>breakaway</b> riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake on a corner and ended up in a field. On the climb, Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb, but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E

5|$|The sixteenth leg was a {{downhill}} stage from the Swiss Alps. A <b>breakaway</b> did form but was caught before the {{run into the}} finish as the peloton prepared for a sprint finish. The stage was initially won by Giovanni Lombardi, but he was deemed by race judges to have had an irregular sprint and the victory was awarded to the second placed rider Giuseppe Citterio. The next day consisted of a climbing time trial to Selvino. Rominger extended his advantage over all his competitors by winning the stage {{by a margin of}} one minute and thirty-nine seconds over Berzin. The eighteenth stage was plagued by rainy conditions throughout the undulating course. The day's <b>breakaway</b> consisted of sixteen riders, which Tony Rominger's Mapei team chose not to chase down. Denis Zanette and Giuseppe Guerini formed an attack group from the <b>breakaway</b> and rode into the finish where Zanette managed to edge out Guerini for the win. The main contenders did not have any time gaps during the stage, leaving the general classification unchanged.|$|E

50|$|After {{the second}} rest-day, the peloton {{did not want}} to spend too much {{energies}} on a flat stage, so it was easy for a break-away of eighteen men to gather an advantage of 10 minutes. Amongst these <b>breakaways,</b> there was Crédit Agricole rider Christophe Le Mével, who outpowered his fellow <b>breakaways</b> to notch up his first pro victory.|$|R

5|$|When it {{came down}} to the final sprint, Wegmuller could only watch as Demol sprinted past him to take the victory. Laurent Fignon {{finished}} third after a late <b>breakaway</b> from the chasing peloton.|$|E
5|$|After the stage, Boucher {{was thrown}} out of the race by his team. He had {{recently}} been told that his contract would not be renewed and had disobeyed team orders not to go in the day's <b>breakaway.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the <b>breakaway.</b> The <b>breakaway</b> was caught soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|<b>Breakaway</b> {{has also}} enjoyed {{commercial}} success internationally; it became her first album to chart in over nineteen regions. By {{the end of}} 2005, the album became the world's seventh best-selling release of the year according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In the United Kingdom, it debuted on the Official UK Albums Chart at number ten with 17,631 copies. At the beginning of 2006, the album ascended to number three on the chart. As of 2012, it has sold over 1,571,278 copies in the region. In Australia, <b>Breakaway</b> debuted on the ARIA Albums Chart at number twenty-nine, and also spent its entire year on the top fifty, peaking at number two. In Ireland, the album debuted on the IRMA Artist Albums chart at number twenty-one, and topped the chart in 2006. Together with the Australian Recording Industry Association, the Irish Recorded Music Association certified the record as 7× multi-platinum, its highest certification overall. In the Netherlands, the album debuted on the Mega Album Top 100 at number forty-seven and topped the chart for three weeks. Additionally, <b>Breakaway</b> peaked {{in the top five}} in the national charts of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal, and Switzerland; and has attained top twenty positions in six additional regions worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breakaway</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on November 30, 2004, by RCA Records. The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Executive produced by Clive Davis, <b>Breakaway</b> sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, {{in pursuit of a}} pop rock direction. This also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. <b>Breakaway</b> is predominately a pop rock album with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.|$|E

5000|$|Two <b>breakaways</b> {{were formed}} at {{different}} times. The first riders to attack were 's Marek Rutkiewicz and 's Eduard Grosu, attacking after 2 kilometers had passed before 's Marco Bandiera, 's Alessandro Malaguti and 's Alan Marangoni joined them after 20 kilometers. [...] had hoped the {{someone in the}} break could take Alberto Contador's pink jersey but the sprinters' teams, namely , , [...] and , worked hard to keep the break under control. The <b>breakaway's</b> lead maxed at around five minutes before it started {{to go down to}} around three minutes at the final intermediate sprint. At this point, news of headwinds and side winds broke out {{and as a result of}} the winds, the <b>breakaway's</b> lead quickly went down and with 14 kilometers left in the stage, all riders were together again.|$|R
50|$|In {{relatively}} flat mass start {{stages and}} races, time trialists often work as domestiques for their team leaders, or participate in <b>breakaways.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1929, the VNQDD split when a faction led by Nguyen The Nghiep {{began to}} disobey party orders and was {{therefore}} expelled from the Central Committee. Some sources claim that Nghiep had formed a <b>breakaway</b> party and had begun secret contacts with French authorities.|$|E
5|$|On the descent, Valverde and Rodríguez {{attacked}} and {{were joined by}} teammates from the <b>breakaway.</b> They had a 40-second advantage over a group containing Dumoulin and Fabio Aru. Aru's teammate Dario Cataldo {{was able to bring}} him back to Valverde and Rodríguez; Dumoulin was then also able to return to the group.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{small number}} of stages were {{expected}} to end in a sprint, barring a successful <b>breakaway.</b> Sprinters in the event included Mark Cavendish, Alessandro Petacchi, Allan Davis, Filippo Pozzato, Robert Hunter, Robert Förster, Tyler Farrar, Juan José Haedo, and Oscar Gatto.|$|E

5|$|Rubén Plaza (Lampre-Merida) led the <b>breakaway</b> {{over the}} second climb of the day, with Fraile second. The <b>breakaway</b> was around two minutes {{ahead of the}} peloton. Imanol Erviti (Movistar) {{attacked}} on the descent and led the race solo for some distance; he was first to reach {{the summit of the}} next climb, the Coll de la Rabassa, with Fraile again second. He was eventually brought back by work from Mikel Landa (Astana) on the descent. On the Coll de la Gallina the <b>breakaway</b> broke up: the lead group was formed of Landa and Fraile, along with Ian Boswell (Sky), Romain Sicard (Europcar), Nelson Oliveira (Lampre-Merida), Darwin Atapuma (BMC) and Paweł Poljański (Tinkoff-Saxo). Fraile was first over the summit. The climb also caused difficulty in the main group: Chris Froome was unable to stay in the group; his injured shoulder was treated at the medical car and he was then guided {{through the rest of the}} stage by Geraint Thomas. Froome lost two minutes on the climb. Nicolas Roche was also dropped from the lead group and Mikel Nieve took over the leadership of Team Sky.|$|E
5|$|Russian part of Caucasus: Bats {{collected}} in the Russian part of the Caucasus and in Abkhazia (a <b>breakaway</b> part of Georgia) from 2003 to 2009 may represent M.alcathoe. They are small and morphometrically distinct from other local Myotis mystacinus-like bats. The affinity of these bats to M.alcathoe has recently been confirmed by the genetic and morphological analyses.|$|E
5|$|Selca-Ciclolinea, Ceramiche Ariostea, Gewiss-Bianchi and Atala-Ofmega won {{one stage}} apiece. Ceramiche Ariostea rider Stephan Joho took stage 3 in a sprint finish, as did Gewiss-Bianchi rider Rosola in stage 10, and Selca-Ciclolinea 's Patrizio Gambirasio in stage 17. Atala-Ofmega's Podenzana won stage 4a after a solo <b>breakaway.</b>|$|E
40|$|The commercially lucrative {{aspect of}} sport {{presents}} regulators {{with the threat}} of <b>breakaways</b> by entities focused on profits, which may not be {{in the best interest of}} the sport. Simon Boyes, Director of the Centre for Sports Law at Nottingham Trent University, discusses the threat faced by sports regulators across different sports and asks whether rather than protecting traditional regulators the law may actually be providing a further obstacle to asserting any degree of control in preventing possible <b>breakaways...</b>|$|R
40|$|Peer reviewedThis {{article will}} address the {{historical}} tensions that the impoverished state of many African Independent Churches (AICs) caused in South Africa. Such tensions have often led to divisions and <b>breakaways</b> within the AIC denominational structures. Of note here {{is the fact that}} many such <b>breakaways</b> were the result of, among other things, spiritual doctrinal differences, internal politics, hunger, status issues and financial squabbles. This article investigates the reasons for division. Accordingly, the article notes that {{many of the people who}} were at the centre of these splits joined the church with ulterior motives, both spiritual and physical, depending on their interests. In time, even major AICs in South Africa were not immune to the divisions resulting from internal conflict. This article considers questions such as: Can divisions be viewed as a problem or a way of life for the AICs? Can <b>breakaways</b> be prevented? What effect do divisions among the AICs have on their growth, bearing in mind that they are the fastest growing churches in Africa today? The article will consider these important questions in order to ascertain whether, historically, money has been the main factor in their <b>breakaways...</b>|$|R
