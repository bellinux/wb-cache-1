5|$|He also {{continued}} his critical {{work and in}} 1860 reviewed On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin. He {{was one of the}} few contemporary critics to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for {{the continued existence of}} the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with foreign powers they believed to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic.</b> Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E

5|$|Some on-street {{track was}} laid {{in a special}} {{foundation}} with cobbled road surfacing designed to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> with the style of Edinburgh streets but was removed in many places due to objections from cyclists. The trams are powered by overhead cables attached to purpose-built poles or mounted {{on the sides of}} buildings. Nine electrical sub-stations were planned for the line to Newhaven, both underground and above-ground but only five were built after the line was truncated at York Place.|$|E
5|$|With {{the support}} of the population, Van der Noot {{launched}} a persecution of Vonckists known as the Statist Terror (Statistisch Schrikbewind). Verlooy and Vandermersh were arrested and imprisoned. Vonck and his remaining supporters forced into exile in Lille where they tried to raise opposition to the Statists but in vain. Faced with an increasingly reactionary government in the United Belgian States, many of the exiled Vonckists felt that they had more to gain from negotiating with Leopold II than with the revolutionaries. Amid rumours of Austrian military forces nearing Belgium, the Statists put their faith in a foreign military intervention and began lobbying the Prussians, who were believed to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic,</b> for support.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Germans.|$|E

25|$|Antisemitism in Armenia has {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} Israel's reluctance {{to recognize the}} Armenian Genocide due to its close ties with Turkey, a subject which many Armenians believe Jews and Israel should relate and <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to, since both share a similar national history and fate. Excluding the aforementioned, Armenian and Jews relations have historically been benevolent, respectful, and at times, competitive/rivaling.|$|E
25|$|On {{a second}} trip two years later, he {{collected}} information on mining and brought home costumes and artifacts, including cowboy and Indian clothing. His early {{trips to the}} western United States inspired a period of images of cowboys and Native Americans that dramatized the Old West. His depictions of Native Americans tended to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic,</b> showing them in harmony with their environment, as demonstrated by In the Crystal Depths (1906).|$|E

25|$|Elst {{is known}} to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to Hindutva, a Hindu {{nationalist}} movement. In Ram Janmabhoomi vs Babri Masjid, Elst makes the case for an enduring historical tradition associating the Ram Janmabhoomi site with the birthplace of Rama, the Hindu god/king.

Advani, {{the leader of the}} Bharatiya Janata Party.|$|E
25|$|Kuhn {{found himself}} faced by an {{estimated}} 3,000 of Reymond's insurgents, against {{whom he had}} a contingent of only 400French troops at his disposal, some of whose officers were said to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Vaudois cause. Kuhn met Reymond and asked for his terms; Reymond demanded the abolition of feudal taxes and a general amnesty. At the conclusion of their negotiations the Bourla-papey returned to their positions outside the city, and Kuhn travelled to Bern with their demands.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the use of}} {{terrorism}} can be an aspect of guerrilla warfare. Terrorism is used to focus international attention on the guerrilla cause, kill opposition leaders, extort money from targets, intimidate the general population, create economic losses, and keep followers and potential defectors in line. As well, the use {{of terrorism}} can provoke the greater power to launch a disproportionate response, thus alienating a civilian population which might <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the terrorist's cause. Such tactics may backfire and cause the civil population to withdraw its support, or to back countervailing forces against the guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|Although {{alienated from}} Stalinism, Padmore {{remained}} a socialist. He sought {{new ways to}} work for African independence from imperial rule. Relocating to France, where Garan Kouyaté was an ally from his Comintern days, Padmore began to write a book: How Britain Rules Africa. With the help of former American heiress Nancy Cunard, he found a London agent and, eventually, a publisher (Wishart). It published the book in 1936, the year the publisher became Lawrence and Wishart, known to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to communists. Publication of books by black men {{at that time was}} rare in the United Kingdom. A Swiss publisher distributed a German translation in Germany.|$|E
25|$|One {{morning in}} 1948, soon after Burma gained her {{independence}} from Britain, however, the Kyipwa Yay Press in Mandalay was dynamited to rubble by government troops who were angry that the Ludu couple appeared to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the Communists. This {{was a time}} when regime change happened quite often with the city falling into the hands, in turn, of the Karen rebels, Communists and the new Socialist government under U Nu. The entire family, including two pregnant women, was thrown out into the street, lined up and was about to be gunned down when a number of monks and locals successfully intervened to save their lives.|$|E
25|$|More's {{persecution}} {{is made to}} seem {{even more}} unjust by the inclusion of Eustace Chapuys, the long-time Imperial ambassador to England, into the story. Chapuys recognises More as a stout man of the church, and in Act II, after More's resignation from the Chancellorship, he informs More of a planned rebellion along the Scottish border, expecting More to <b>be</b> <b>sympathetic.</b> Instead, More informs Norfolk of the plot, showing him to be patriotic and loyal to the King. This, along with More's refusal to actually speak out against the King, shows {{him to be a}} loyal subject, and thus Cromwell appears to prosecute him out of personal spite and because he disagrees with the King's divorce.|$|E
