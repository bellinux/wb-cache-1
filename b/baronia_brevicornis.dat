50|$|<b>Baronia</b> <b>brevicornis,</b> {{commonly}} known as the short-horned baronia, is a species of butterfly in the family Papilionidae. It is monotypic within the genus Baronia. It is endemic to a very small area of Mexico, where the distribution is patchy and restricted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Baronia</b> <b>brevicornis</b> is of {{particular}} importance due to its relict nature and uncertain relationship to other subfamilies such as the Parnassiinae. It is now considered to represent the monotypic subfamily Baroniinae. The butterfly is considered as the most primitive extant papilionid taxon and shares some features with the fossil taxon Praepapilio.|$|E
