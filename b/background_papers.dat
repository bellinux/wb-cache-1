2500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Wrong Question", Sachs further argued that: [...] "The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus {{was asked to}} {{allocate}} an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world’s biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum — {{a tiny fraction of}} global income — the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the <b>background</b> <b>papers</b> that such interventions require broader improvements in health services." ...|$|E
