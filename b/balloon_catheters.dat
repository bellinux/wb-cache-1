50|$|<b>Balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> used in {{angioplasty}} {{are either}} of Over-the-Wire(OTW) or Rapid Exchange(Rx) design. Rx catheters nowadays are about 90% of the Coronary Intervention market. While OTW Catheters {{may still be}} useful in highly tortuous vascular pathways, they sacrifice deflation time and pushability. When a balloon catheter is used to compress plaque within a clogged coronary artery it {{is referred to as}} a plain old balloon angioplasty or POBA. <b>Balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> are also utilized in the deployment of stents during angioplasty. <b>Balloon</b> <b>catheters</b> are supplied to the cath lab with a stent premounted on the balloon. When the cardiologist inflates the balloon it expands the stent. When the cardiologist subsequently deflates the balloon the stent stays behind in the artery and the balloon catheter can be removed. Stents that are used in conjunction with a balloon catheter are known as balloon expandable stents.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{possibility}} to use a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> as hemostatic method in pregnancies at high risk for hemorrhage as an alternative to less conservative surgical procedures. In 4 pregnancies at risk for hemorrhage, a compressive endouterine or endocervical method, consisting of a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> filled of warm saline solution, was used in order to stop or to prevent otherwise uncontrollable bleeding. In the cases treated the use of the <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> was safe and effective both in the treatment of hemorrhage due to abnormal placentation and in the prevention of hemorrhagic complications due to abnormal implantation of pregnancy. Among novel medical and surgical approaches developed to control obstetric hemorrhage, tamponade using a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> could be considered a valid option. Moreover, this procedure, by avoiding radical surgical treatments, such as hysterectomy, which are frequently performed in unstable patients, could offer the advantage of preserving fertility...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} use of a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> device with {{the use of}} a {{cervical}} vacuum cup device in performing hysterosalpingography (HSG). Design Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. Setting Tertiary infertility center. Patient(s) Two hundred twenty-nine infertile women undergoing HSG. Intervention(s) Subjects were randomized to undergo HSG using a cervical vacuum cup (n = 115) or a <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> (n = 114). Randomization was performed according to Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Main Outcome Measure(s) The degree of pain experienced during and after the HSG, evaluated using a 100 -mm visual analogue scale. The length of the procedure, the fluoroscopic time, the volume of contrast used, the difficulty of performing HSG, and the percentage of complications were also evaluated. Result(s) Women in the cervical-cup group experienced more pain than those in the <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> group during the contrast injection (median visual analogue scale pain scores, 13. 0 vs. 6. 5). The placement of the <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> in comparison with the cervical cup was slightly easier to perform, although it required a somewhat longer time. The HSG using the cervical cup required less fluoroscopic time (median, 0. 6 vs. 0. 8 min). Conclusion(s) The <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> appears to be better tolerated than the cervical cup, but the difference is minimal. The use of the cervical cup allows shortening of the patient radiation exposure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{technical}} performance and immediate procedure outcome of a new <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> in the treatment of calcified lesions in infrainguinal arterial disease. Seventy-five patients with infrainguinal arterial disease were prospectively entered into the registry. The catheter (ReeKross Clearstream, Ireland) is a 5 - to 6 -Fr <b>balloon</b> <b>catheter</b> with a rigid shaft intended for enhanced pushability. Only technical procedural outcome was recorded. Treated calcified lesions (range: 5 – 30 cm), assessed angiographically, were located in the superficial femoral, popliteal, and crural arteries. In 67 patients the lesion was an occlusion. Guidewire passage occurred subintimally in 68 patients.
