5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s. Research spurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of an impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary, however, there is debate ongoing between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg boundary, and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of developing an attack).|$|E
5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of doing away {{with much of the}} complexities of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E

5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had already been a target for the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were concerned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.|$|E
5|$|Briseis, {{at least}} for now, is equally {{affected}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of separation from her lover. Troilus goes {{to her room and}} they spend the night together, trying to comfort each other. Troilus is part of the escort to hand her over the next day. Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Chad is {{a member}} of the Crane family. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch Alistair Crane, Chad is {{introduced}} as a music producer from Los Angeles who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters Whitney and Simone Russell. His romance with Whitney is complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his sexual identity, and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter Vincent Clarkson. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, Ethan Winthrop.|$|E

I began to enjoy the crisp purr of the graver as it furrowed the polished surface. I began to appreciate the cleanness of the white line that it incised: even the simplest silhouettes had an austere quality, a dignity, {{that could not be}} achieved by other means. Clear, precise statement, that was what it amounted to. Near enough wouldn't do: it had to be just right.|$|R

5|$|Construction was financed {{through a}} loan of NOK218 million from Handelsbanken, which was secured on the revenue {{which would be}} {{generated}} {{from the sale of}} Hamar stadion and Fuglsetmyra. However, the bank was not willing to lend money secured on the basis of sales price of Hamar stadion being based on the re-regulation of the lot. The municipality was pressed on time <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of NFF denying Ham-Kam the right to play at Briskeby. Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million. Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK60 million in March and NOK25 million in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of {{reviving}} an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: {{the crew of the}} Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliament}} first authorized approximately 871million Swiss francs {{to build}} 100Mirage IIIS under license. But this procurement was soon crushed under massive budget overruns {{and the government}} asked for an additional CHF 576million. The cost overruns {{were the result of}} fitting U.S. electronics to the French platform, installing hardpoints for moving the aircraft inside of the caverns by cranes, structural reinforcements for jet-assisted takeoffs, and other extras to improve the off-the-shelf Mirage IIIC. The wish to procure the Mirage IIIS was also boosted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that the Swiss could acquire aircraft-delivered nuclear weapons, either from France or by producing them themselves.|$|E

50|$|The Laser {{was officially}} opened in 1998 {{together}} with the new planetarium show ‘Mars, back to the red planet’. As expected the visitors were impressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> of such a laser. The installation of this laser lasted about 5 months.|$|R
50|$|Von Holst was {{lured to}} Florida <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> for work {{there during the}} land boom {{as well as the}} relief from Chicago winters. Practicing in Boca Raton, he was engaged in {{architecture}} and land development from the late 1920s onward.|$|R
5|$|The plan seemed ill-conceived and {{suggests}} that Narborough was obsessed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of treasure. It {{is also possible that}} Phips was being used in a complex way, with the sly intention that HMS Rose would act as a noisy decoy for his more important treasure hunt. Unlike the Falcon and Bonetta, Phips was not sent directly to search near Hispaniola where Narborough (correctly) believed a great treasure lay buried. Phips' instructions were not kept secret but were signed by the entire crew, thereby broadcasting their designs through the harbor and shipyards. On July 13, 1683, the articles of agreement (see image) were signed by Phips and seven other crew members, in the presence of Narborough and Haddock.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Thomas Paine for seditious libel {{was held on}} 18 December 1792, in {{response}} to his publication of {{the second part of the}} Rights of Man. The government of William Pitt, worried <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that the French Revolution might spread to England, had begun suppressing works that espoused radical philosophies. Paine's work, which advocated the right of the people to overthrow their government, was duly targeted, with a writ for his arrest issued on 21 May. Paine fled to France in September, having been elected a member of the National Convention in France. He was instead represented in absentia by Thomas Erskine, a noted lawyer and orator who was severely criticised by government supporters in the months leading up to the trial.|$|E
5|$|However, Sparta {{was then}} thrown into disarray by {{internal}} machinations. The citizens of Aegina had {{submitted to the}} Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene. Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king Demaratus, who supported their stance. Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, {{with the help of}} the priests at Delphi (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin Leotychides. Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour. However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city. He then sought to rally the northern Peloponnesus to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him back to the city. By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day. Cleomenes was succeeded by his half-brother Leonidas I.|$|E

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E

50|$|As {{soon as the}} Commodore 64 was {{released}} in 1982, Kawasaki immediately bought one, paying $600 for it at an electronics store on 45th street in Manhattan. Kawasaki was fascinated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>the</b> system afforded him and in two years he taught himself to program and wrote four programs in machine code using SuperMon (a tool created by Jim Butterfield) that he released commercially on 5¼-inch floppy for $49.95 each {{as well as an}} unpublished 8-track real-time MIDI recorder called Midi-Workstation.|$|R

25|$|Third, 2Thessalonians, like Colossians, is {{questioned}} by some on stylistic grounds, with some noting, among other peculiarities, a dependence on 1Thessalonians– yet a distinctiveness in language from the Pauline corpus.
