40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is {{characterized}} by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin and is associated with suppressed uninvolved immunoglobulins and dysfunctional T-cell responses. The biologic basis of this dysfunction remains ill defined. Because T regulatory (Treg) cells {{play an important role in}} suppressing normal immune responses, we evaluated the potential role of Treg cells in immune dysfunction in MM. We observed a significant increase in CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>and</b> in patients with MM compared with healthy donors (25 % and 26 %, respectively, vs 14 %); however, Treg cells as measured by FOXP 3 expression are significantly decreased in patients with <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> MM compared with healthy donors. Moreover, even when they are added in higher proportions, Treg cells in patients with MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> <b>are</b> unable to suppress anti-CD 3 –mediated T-cell proliferation. This decreased number and function of Treg cells in <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> in MM may account, at least in part, for the nonspecific increase in CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells, thereby contributing to dysfunctional T-cell responses...|$|R
40|$|Background. Immunophenotyping by multiparameter {{flow cytometry}} (MFC) {{provides}} relevant information about prognosis and {{minimal residual disease}} detection in multiple myeloma (MM) and {{might be used to}} distinguish MM from monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS).</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods. We evaluated a possible usage of MFC to predict the differential diagnosis between MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS.</b> One hundred consecutive patients were studied at diagnosis and underwent conventional diagnostic procedures. We carried out a double-blind study. Immunophenotyping was performed on samples from myeloaspirates before establishing diagnosis, while the final clinical diagnosis was established independently from MFC results. A five- or six-color method was carried out by means of monoclonal antibody combinations able to identify abnormal plasma cells (CD 19 -) and the most relevant immunophenotypic aberrations (loss of CD 27; overexpression of CD 117, CD 56, CD 28; asynchronous expression of CD 20). MFC was applied following the indications of the European Myeloma Network. When abnormal plasma cells were [...] 3 % of the global plasma cell population, MM was predicted; when abnormal plasma cells were [...] 3. 1 %, <b>MGUS</b> <b>was</b> predicted. Results. MFC results predicted 63 cases of MM and 37 cases of MGUS. At the end of our study, 61 cases of MM and 39 cases of <b>MGUS</b> <b>were</b> diagnosed. Therefore, 4 % of patients were misdiagnosed by MFC parameters alone, with sensitivity and specificity of 0. 983 and 0. 92, respectively. Conclusions. Only a small proportion of patients with MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> <b>were</b> misdiagnosed by MFC alone and a possible systematic application of MFC in all patient with MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> at diagnosis might be proposed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The {{neuropathy}} {{associated with}} monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>is</b> typically a predominantly demyelinating process {{that may have}} additional features of axonal degeneration. Sixteen patients with <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> a pure or predominantly axonal neuropathy are reported and compared with 20 consecutive patients with demyelinating neuropathy <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> who <b>were</b> seen during the same period.  METHODS—Retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients with neuropathy <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> evaluated during a five year period.  RESULTS—The axonal group had mild, symmetric, slowly progressive, predominantly sensory neuropathy, usually limited to the legs. There were no differences {{in the age of}} onset or duration of symptoms at the time of presentation, initial symptoms, or the severity of weakness between the axonal and demyelinating cases. However, the axonal process was associated with less vibration and proprioceptive loss, did not include leg ataxia (present in 55 % of patients with demyelinating type), less often had generalised areflexia (19 % v 70 %), IgM gammopathy (19 % v 80 %), and anti-MAG antibodies (0 % v 40 %), and had lower CSF protein concentrations (mean, 49 v 100 mg/dl). The illness was also generally milder with less disability (mean Rankin score 2. 1 v 2. 8). Fewer patients with axonal neuropathy improved with immunomodulating therapy (27 % v 75 %).  CONCLUSION—There is an axonal neuropathy associated with <b>MGUS</b> that <b>is</b> clinically <b>and</b> electrophysiologically distinct from the more typical demyelinating pattern. ...|$|R

40|$|Pesticides are {{associated}} with excess risk of multiple myeloma, albeit inconclusively. We included 678 men (30 - 94 years) from a well-characterized prospective cohort of restricted-use pesticide applicators to assess the risk of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Serum samples from all subjects were analyzed by electrophoresis performed on agarose gel; samples with a discrete or localized band were subjected to immunofixation. Age-adjusted prevalence estimates of <b>MGUS</b> <b>were</b> compared with <b>MGUS</b> prevalence in 9469 men from Minnesota. Associations between pesticide exposures <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> prevalence <b>were</b> assessed by logistic regression models adjusted for age and education level.

5000|$|Myeloma is a {{malignancy}} of plasma cells. Plasma cells produce immunoglobulins, {{which are}} commonly called antibodies. There {{are thousands of}} different antibodies, each consisting of pairs of heavy and light chains. Antibodies are typically grouped into five types: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. When someone contracts myeloma, a malignant clone, a rogue plasma cell, reproduces in an uncontrolled fashion, resulting in overproduction of the specific antibody the original cell was generated to produce. Each type of antibody has a different number of light chain and heavy chain pairs. As a result, there is a characteristic normal distribution of these antibodies in the blood by molecular weight. When there is a malignant clone, there is usually overproduction of a single antibody, resulting in a [...] "spike" [...] on the normal distribution (sharp peak on the graph), which is called an M spike (or monoclonal spike). People will sometimes develop a condition called MGUS (Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), where there is overproduction of one antibody but the condition is benign (does not threaten the patient's health).

To investigate {{the extent to which the}} B and T lymphoid components are involved in progression and/or control of disease. METHODS [...] Blood lymphocytes from 15 patients with multiple myeloma, 10 patients with <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> 10 healthy adults were analysed using a sequential double immunoenzymatic staining technique. Antibodies directed against Ki 67 were used to detect cells in cycle, CD 3, CD 4, and CD 8 to identify T cells, HLA-Dr as a marker for B cells and activated T cells, and CD 11 b as a marker for natural killer cells. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains were also used to detect B cells. RESULTS [...] The proportion of proliferating (Ki 67 +) lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with multiple myeloma (6. 8 +/- 2. 6) <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> (3. 5 +/- 1. 1) compared with the normal controls (1. 69 +/- 0. 3); this was also true when multiple myeloma <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> cases <b>were</b> compared. In multiple myeloma <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> over 50 % of the Ki 67 + cells were activated T lymphocytes (CD 3 +/HLA-Dr+); a minority (11 %) were non-clonal B lymphocytes. In contrast to controls (6. 7 +/- 1. 9), in patients with multiple myeloma <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> the proportion of proliferating T cells expressing CD 8 (23. 6 +/- 12. 5 and 15. 3 +/- 7. 7, respectively) and CD 11 b (13 +/- 8. 7 and 11. 6 +/- 3. 9, respectively) was higher. In multiple myeloma there was a positive correlation between the proportion of Ki 67 + lymphocytes, beta- 2 -microglobulin concentrations and disease stage. CONCLUSIONS [...] Although the number of patients investigated is small, this study suggests that Ki 67 expression in blood lymphocytes from patients with multiple myeloma may be a good prognostic indicator for aggressive disease and may help to distinguish multiple myeloma from MGUS.

Patients and Methods: Frosen sera from 102 untreated MM patients, 18 subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>and</b> 27 healthy individuals (HI) were studied. Cytokines were determined by commercially available ELISA. Results: In HI, median s-synd- 1 was 15 ng/ml (7 - 64), MIP- 1 α 28 pg/ml (15 - 60), OPG 1600 pg/ml (450 - 8000), sRANKL 6 pg/ml (2. 6 - 12. 4), IGF- 1 96 ng/ml (46 - 210), VEGF 110 pg/ml (10 - 300) and TGF-β 1 57500 pg/ml (30000 - 110000). In MM patients, pretreatment median s-synd- 1 was 64 ng/ml (7 - 3500), MIP- 1 α 32 pg/ml (14 - 100), OPG 3100 pg/ml (820 - 25000), sRANKL 3. 75 pg/ml (1. 6 - 200), IGF- 1 86 ng/ml (13 - 260), VEGF 275 pg/ml (8 - 4000) and TGF-β 1 61500 pg/ml (1350 - 99000). In MGUS, median s-synd- 1 was 16. 5 ng/ml (10 - 175), MIP- 1 α 35 pg/ml (17 - 149), OPG 2500 pg/ml (1500 - 6200), sRANKL 3. 8 pg/ml (3. 2 - 5. 6), IGF- 1 86 ng/ml (50 - 190), VEGF 540 pg/ml (250 - 1700) and TGF-β 1 68250 pg/ml (29400 - 90000). Differences between HI and MM patients levels <b>and</b> between <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> MM patients levels were both significant for s-synd- 1 (p< 0. 001 and 0. 01 respectively). Differences between HI and MM patients and between HI <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> <b>were</b> as well significant for OPG (p< 0. 001 and 0. 04 respectively) and VEGF (p= 0. 001 and p< 0. 001 respectively). No statistical significant difference was observed between HI, <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> MM patients with regard to MIP- 1 α, sRANKL, IGF- 1 and TGF-β 1 levels. Overall survival was decreased in patients with elevated serum s-synd- 1 levels (p= 0. 009). There was a trend for longer survival in patients with OPG levels lower than median (p= 0. 06), serum MIP- 1 α levels had a weak impact, while serum sRANKL, IGF- 1, VEGF and TGF-β 1 levels had no impact. In multivariative analysis, s-synd- 1 was an independent prognostic factor of survival. Further analysis of survival of patients stratified according to the ISS system showed a difference in survival within groups according to s-synd- 1 levels (mainly for stage 1 and 2). Conclusions: Serum s-synd- 1 levels at diagnosis constitute an independent prognostic factor of survival, able to further differentiate patients within the ISS stages. In our experience, there was a trend for shorter survival in patients with elevated OPG or MIP- 1 α levels but sRANKL, IGF- 1, VEGF and TGF-β 1 levels had no impact. ...|$|R

This type of MGUS has low but persistent tendency to transform to malignant disease, mainly multiple myeloma (MM), with frequency of about 1 % per year. Using known risk stratification models based on clinical parameters, {{it is possible to}} identify patients' groups with average rates of progression as low as 0. 26 % and as high as 12 % per year. However, {{due to the lack of}} clear genetic and/or phenotypic markers distinguishing MGUS from MM, we are not able to predict if <b>and</b> when <b>MGUS</b> will progress to MM in individual patients. There are partially overlapping molecular pathogenic events shared by <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> MM. Better understanding of pathogenesis of <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> MM using molecular-genetic approaches will help disclose the mechanisms of myeloma genesis; it can be also useful for identification of novel molecular targets. The ultimate goal for the near future is to develop better markers for definition of high-risk MGUS patients who will be candidates for early treatment intervention...|$|R
40|$|The age-adjusted {{prevalence}} rate of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>is</b> three-fold {{higher in}} African Americans than whites.

40|$|In a {{retrospective}} cohort {{of more than}} 4 million white and black male United States (US) veterans, we explored the role of specific prior autoimmune, infectious, inflammatory, and allergic disorders in the etiology of multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS).</b> Patients <b>were</b> selected from computerized inpatient discharge records at US Veterans Affairs hospitals. The analysis included 4641 patients (3040 white, 1601 black) and 2046 patients (1312 white; 734 black) with a discharge diagnosis of MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS,</b> respectively. Using Poisson regression, we calculated age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) {{for the relationship between}} MM, <b>MGUS,</b> <b>and</b> specific prior medical conditions. Significantly elevated risks of MM were associated with broad categories of autoimmune (RR, 1. 15; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 28), infectious (RR, 1. 29; 95 % CI, 1. 20 - 1. 38), and inflammatory disorders (RR, 1. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 10 - 1. 27) and specific prior autoimmune (polymyositis/dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia, and ankylosing spondylitis), infectious (pneumonia, hepatitis, meningitis, septicemia, herpes zoster, and poliomyelitis), and inflammatory (glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and osteoarthritis) disorders.

40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} {{is a possible}} predisposing factor for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), but the association has been uncertain. We investigated the relationship between radiation exposure <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> prevalence by {{using data from the}} M-protein screening for Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors between 1988 and 2004. Radiation exposure was assessed by exposure distance from the hypocenter and exposure radiation dose. We computed prevalence ratios (PRs) and the 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for exposure age and sex. A total of 1082 cases of <b>MGUS</b> <b>were</b> identified from 52 525 participants. <b>MGUS</b> prevalence <b>was</b> significantly higher in people exposed at distance within 1. 5 km than beyond 3. 0 km (PR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 1. 9) among those exposed at age 20 years or younger, but it was not found among those exposed at age 20 years or older. <b>MGUS</b> prevalence <b>was</b> also significantly higher in people exposed to more than 0. 1 Gy than those exposed to less than 0. 01 Gy (PR, 1. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 2. 8) among those exposed at age 20 years or younger. Thus, people exposed at younger age exhibited a significantly high risk of MGUS when exposed to a high radiation dose. There was no clear association between radiation exposure and the malignant progression of MGUS. Further detailed analysis is needed...|$|R
40|$|Although polyneuropathies {{associated}} with IgM and IgG monoclonal gam-mopathies {{have been well}} described, polyneuropathy with IgA monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>is</b> less commonly seen {{and has not been}} well studied. We reviewed the clinical and electrodiag-nostic features of 5 such patients, and the sural nerve biopsy findings in 4 of them. One patient was diabetic, while 4 were free of other diagnoses commonly {{associated with}} neuropathy. Clinical presentations were varied. Electrodiagnostic and histological studies ranged from primary demyelina-tion to primary axon loss to a mixed axonaVdemyelinating picture. Three patients who were treated appeared to respond to prednisone or intrave-nous gamma globulin, despite clear clinical, electrodiagnostic, and histolog-ical differences. We conclude that the polyneuropathy associated with IgA <b>MGUS</b> <b>is</b> heterogeneous, similar to that in IgM <b>and</b> IgG <b>MGUS.</b> A trial of immunomodulating therapy appears to be warranted in such patients if the neuropathy is sufficiently severe. 0 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Monoclonal gammopathies such as {{multiple}} myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>are</b> lymphoproliferative B cell diseases. B cells/plasma cells produce the monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) {{which can be}} detected in plasma and/or urine. Such Ig have unique variable regions of the heavy and light chains and may be regarded as tumour-specific antigens and as such potential targets for immune regulation of the tumour cell clone, by anti-idiotype (Id) immune reactions. The production of anti-Id Ab against the M-component by primary B cell lines of Epstein-Barr virus transformed PBMC was analysed in patients with MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS.</b> Patients with advanced disease (MM stage III) had a low and patients with MM stage I <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> a high production of such anti-ld Ab (p< 0. 0 1). Anti-Id B cells were studied in patients with MM, <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> in healthy controls using an ELISPOT assay. All patients had B cells producing Ab to F(ab+) 2 fragments of autologous and allogeneic M-components. There {{was no difference between}} patients with MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> with regard to the number of B cells producing Ab against autologous M-component. <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> MM patients had autoreactive B cells more frequently than alloreactive B cells (p< 0. 00 1). The number of alloreactive B cells did not differ between patients and controls. T cells reactive with F(ab+) 2 fragments of autologous and allogeneic M-components were analysed in patients with MM, <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> in healthy controls using an ELISPOT assay. In patients, the number of T cells that were stimulated by autologous M-component was higher (p< 0. 01), than the number of cells activated by allogeneic Ig. Subpopulations of Id-reactive T cells were defined by demonstrating Th cells with different cytokine-secreting patterns after stimulation by F(ab+) 2 fragments of autologous M-components using ELISPOT assays. ThI -type cells (secreting IFN-y and IL- 2) were more frequent in patients with a low tumour burden. Th 2 -type cells (secreting IL- 4) dominated in patients with MM stage II-III. The T cell response was MHC class II-restricted. Id-reactive T cells were also demonstrated in MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> patients with 3 H-thymidine-incorporation. The proliferation of cells was higher when stimulating PBMC with F(ab+) 2 fragments of autologous M-component (p< 0. 05) than with allogeneic M-components. Injection of autologous M-component suspended in alum into five MM patients induced an in vitro Id-specific response in both T and B cells. The response was reduced during repeated immunisations. In conclusion, the results indicate a presence of immunity against Id determinants on monoclonal Ig. Ab, B and T cells with reactivity against F(ab+) 2 fragments of autologous M-components exist in both MM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS.</b> Their presence in these disorders may indicate a regulatory function. These findings form a basis for further studies aiming at identifying new ways to enhance a specific anti-tumour response in MM...|$|R
40|$|Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), a {{distinctive}} subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that features overproduction of immunoglobulin M (IgM), clearly has a familial component; however, no susceptibility genes have yet been identified. We performed a genomewide linkage analysis in 11 high-risk families with WM that were informative for linkage, {{for a total}} of 122 individuals with DNA samples, including 34 patients with WM and 10 patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (IgM MGUS). We genotyped 1, 058 microsatellite markers (average spacing 3. 5 cM), performed both nonparametric and parametric linkage analysis, and computed both two-point and multipoint linkage statistics. The strongest evidence of linkage was found on chromosomes 1 q and 4 q when patients with WM <b>and</b> with IgM <b>MGUS</b> <b>were</b> both considered affected; nonparametric linkage scores were 2. 5 (P=. 0089) and 3. 1 (P=. 004), respectively. Other locations suggestive of linkage were found on chromosomes 3 and 6. Results of two-locus linkage analysis were consistent with independent effects. The findings from this first linkage analysis of families at high risk for WM represent important progress toward identifying gene(s) that modulate susceptibility to WM and toward understanding its complex etiology...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{evaluate}} the clinicohematologic variables at diagnosis that are prognostically related to neoplastic progression {{in patients with}} immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS),</b> <b>and</b> indolent Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (IWM), and propose a scoring system to identify subsets of patients at different risk. Patients and Methods We evaluated 217 patients with IgM <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> 201 with IWM (male-female ratio, 131 : 86 and 117 : 84; mean ago, 63. 7 and 63. 6 years, respectively) diagnosed {{on the basis of}} serum monoclonal component (MC) levels and bone marrow lymphoplasmacytic infiltration degree.

Results After a median follow-up of 56. 1 and 60. 2 months, 15 of 217 <b>MGUS</b> <b>and</b> 45 of 201 IWM patients, respectively, required chemotherapy for symptomatic WM (13 and 36), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2 and 6) and amyloidosis (0 and 3).

40|$|Malignant {{transformation}} is a multistep process that may involve dysregulation of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to be}} a precursor of multiple myeloma. To investigate whether aberrant promoter methylation might be involved in the evolution of MGUS to multiple myeloma, we examined the p 16, protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 6 (SHP 1), death-associated protein (DAP) kinase, E-cadherin and oestrogen receptor genes, most being tumour suppressor genes, by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. In 32 cases of multiple myeloma and 19 cases of MGUS, significantly more frequent methylation of p 16 (p = 0. 001), SHP 1 (p ≤ 0. 001) and E-cadherin (p ≤ 0. 001) genes was found in multiple myeloma than in MGUS. Methylation of DAP kinase and oestrogen receptor genes was comparable in multiple myeloma <b>and</b> <b>MGUS.</b> In conclusion, methylation of p 16, SHP 1 and E-cadherin genes might be involved in the progression of MGUS to multiple myeloma. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), and {{monoclonal}} gammopathy of undetermined significance (<b>MGUS)</b> <b>are</b> B cell conditions {{associated with}} suppressed immune functions and susceptibility to infection. Severe pneumococcal disease is common not least in MM patients and vaccination is considered important, although the protective efficacy is debated. The {{aims of the}} first two studies of this thesis were to investigate humoral immunity to a spectrum of prevalent pathogens, and responses to pneumococcal vaccination with either a 23 -valent polysaccharide vaccine or a 7 -valent conjugated vaccine in elderly patients with MM, WM, <b>and</b> <b>MGUS.</b> We further compared two methods for evaluation of pneumococcal vaccine responses, serotype-specific ELISA and opsonophagocytosis (OPA) in the same groups of patients, and retrospectively examined the prevalence of respiratory viruses in MM. Background antibody levels to pathogens were the most depressed in MM but low antibody levels were also seen in WM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> compared to age-matched controls. Pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus, varicella zoster virus, and fungi (Candida, Aspergillus) were identified as risk pathogens, while immunity to Haemophilus influenzae and most viruses was retained in all study groups. Likewise, responses to pneumococcal vaccination were suppressed in all three patient categories. No differences between the vaccine types given as single doses were found. Pneumococcal antibody titers as measured by ELISA and OPA correlated very poorly in MM and WM patients, and our data indicate that ELISA measurements may overestimate anti-pneumococcal immunity in these patients. Rhinovirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most commonly detected respiratory viruses in the investigated MM cohort. Patients with virus-positive tests were younger and had shorter disease duration than patients with negative analyses. In summary, patients with MM, WM <b>and</b> <b>MGUS</b> have a suppressed humoral immunity to many common pathogens, foremost bacteria. Reduced responses to pneumococcal vaccination can be expected in these patients. The use of an OPA method should be preferred for evaluating pneumococcal vaccine responses in B cell malignancies...|$|R
