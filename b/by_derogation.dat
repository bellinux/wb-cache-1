Bonnet published around fifty scientific papers before 1945. They {{were the result of}} very many observations on hundreds of specimens which he preserves in bred, sometimes for many years. He thus studied the life cycle of Philaeus chrysops (Salticidae), Latrodectus geometricus and Theridion tepidariorum (two Theridiidae), of Physocyclus simoni (Pholcidae), Filistata insidiatrix (Filistatidae), etc. In 1945, he published the first volume of Bibliographia Araneorum. The last appeared in 1961. In this he analyses all the literature on spiders prior to 1930. He indexed all the scientific names, lists the errors and misinterpretation made by their original authors and establishes strict synonymies. In addition to biographies of the principal arachnologists in the first part, he gives an analysis of the themes of this literature. This work, which would be simple today with data processing, was carried out entirely manually. He testifies that he sometimes recopied whole works, lent by various institutions. Bonnet sent in 1947 a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature asking it to accept, <b>by</b> <b>derogation,</b> the scientific names created by Carl Alexander Clerck (v. 1710-1765) in 1757. These names were made admissible even though they were published before the tenth edition of Systema Naturae of Carl von Linné (1707-1778).He was with his wife, Camille, a professor of Spanish, an authority on Spanish culture and published several articles on the nationality of Christopher Columbus.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{performance}} and efficiency of the VAT system in B&H and explore the effects of internal and external factors influencing VAT collection. The VAT system in B&H is a consumption-type, single-rate and broad-based system. Ever since its implementation, VAT collection in B&H has been subject to strong oscillations, from an extremely high performance in the first two years after the introduction, to a sharp drop at the beginning of the crisis. After a temporary recovery, VAT collection declined in the last quarter of 2012 and has been negative ever since, although a weak recovery of the B&H economy was observed in 2013. The key hypothesis is that the high efficiency of the broadbased and single-rate structured VAT system may be neutralized by the country’s specific circumstances and VAT policy design. Applying a set of indicators for VAT efficiency analysis, developed by IMF, OECD and EU, we find a deterioration of the components of the policy gap caused <b>by</b> <b>derogations</b> of the VAT Law, and an increasing compliance gap, due to an increase of the VAT debt and tax evasion, in consequence of poor policy design in the field of excises. As a result of the influence of the country’s specific circumstances and its VAT policy design the identifiable current net losses on VAT in 2013 amount to 4 % of net VAT collection or 0. 4 % of GDP. The analysis presented in the paper proves the main hypothesis that a VAT design, even when it is close to theoretically ideal concept, cannot on its own produce a high level of VAT efficiency and performance...|$|R

40|$|Paper I. Reference Pricing: Making Parallel Trade in Pharmaceuticals Work This paper {{shows that}} {{parallel}} trade makes pharmaceutical manufacturers reduce their {{prices in the}} home (importing) country more when it is combined with the healthcare reimbursement policy of reference pricing, requiring consumers to pay the full extra cost if they don’t buy cheaper parallel imported drugs. On the other hand, contrary to intuition, reference pricing leaves price unchanged in the foreign (exporting) country. By and large, a change from coinsurance to reference pricing results in a pure transfer of wealth from the pharmaceutical manufacturers to the insurance providers without affecting consumers’ pharmaceutical consumption or their out-of-pocket costs. Paper II. Compassion and Cost: The Dual Role of Reference Pricing Providing health insurance involves a trade-off between the benefits from risk spreading and the costs due to moral hazard. Focusing on pharmaceuticals consumption, this paper examines theoretically whether reference pricing, requiring individuals {{to pay the price}} difference if, in this case, they don’t buy the cheaper parallel imported drug, can ease this trade-off – an issue which has not previously been pointed out in the debate on health insurance. The results indicate that, if individuals are extremely risk-averse, a policy shift from coinsurance to reference pricing would do this by providing more insurance while decreasing moral hazard. Paper III. Parallel Imports and Mandatory Substitution Reform: A Kick or A Muff for Price Competition in Pharmaceuticals (with David Granlund) What has been the effect of competition from parallel imports on prices of locally-sourced on-patent drugs? Did the 2002 Swedish mandatory substitution reform increase this competition? To answer these questions, we carried out difference-in-differences estimation on monthly data for a panel of all on-patent prescription drugs sold in Sweden during the 40 months from January 2001 through April 2004. On average, facing competition from parallel imports caused a 15 - 17 % fall in price. While the reform increased the effect of competition from parallel imports, it was only by 0. 9 %. The reform, however, did increase the effect of therapeutic competition by 1. 6 %. Paper IV. EU Enlargement, Parallel Trade and Price Competition in Pharmaceuticals: What’s to Blame? Derogation or Perception? (with David Granlund) Given the cost of trade and availability of pharmaceuticals, the driving force for parallel trade is the price difference between the source (exporting) and the destination (importing) country. An increase in the price difference or in the availability of pharmaceuticals for parallel trade should increase price competition in the destination country. Using 2003 - 2007 data from Sweden we investigated whether EU enlargement in 2004, when new countries with low pharmaceutical prices joined the EU, increased competition from parallel imports. Drugs facing competition from parallel imports are found to have on average 17 % to 21 % lower prices than they would have had if they had never faced such competition. But, contrary to expectation, EU enlargement is not found to have increased this effect, which might be explained <b>by</b> <b>derogations</b> and changes in consumer perceptions of parallel imports...|$|R

The article focuses on ‘legally disruptive experiments’, either as concretizations of factual or legal acts. The relations between such experiments and various basic types of (non) experimental legislative arrangements are mapped. The scope for experimenting is defined in terms of legal liberty and ability space, on the basis of normative positions within either rules of conduct or rules of power. A distinction is suggested between three scopes of permissiveness to (i. e., as freedom, full and partial permissiveness), and five types of permissive norms (i. e., mere silence, eloquent silence, with toleration, with rights, and with enabling rights) – all of which are potentially relevant to experimentation. Departing from the idea of legal disruption, the article goes on to focus on exceptional permissiveness to experiment <b>by</b> temporary <b>derogation.</b> Such exceptions can be arranged through limiting an obligatory legal norm upon a ‘subset’ scope of application, defined by operative facts or by legal acts.

Recognizing the difficulties in securing sufficient admissible evidence to prosecute terrorists within the tight time limits imposed by international law, the Article nonetheless suggests that indefinite detention, solely or primarily for purposes of intelligence interrogation, is probably not lawful under U.

Preventive detention for security purposes, on the other hand, is generally permitted by international law, provided {{it is based on}} grounds and procedures previously established by law; is not arbitrary, discriminatory or disproportionate; is publicly registered and subject to fair and effective judicial review; and the detainee is not mistreated and is compensated for any unlawful detention. In Europe, however, even with these safeguards, preventive detention for security purposes is generally not permitted, unless a State in time of national emergency formally derogates from its obligation to respect the right to liberty under the European Convention on Human Rights.

Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative case study approach was used, interviewing 18 respondents over two case study organisations. Line managers, personnel specialists, employees and trade union representatives were interviewed in each case. Findings – Both case studies were largely unaffected by the WTR. This was due to both the high amount of numerical and temporal flexibility afforded by large part‐time workforces and to harmonious employment relations. The design of the Regulations also brings the Government’s commitment to the WTR into doubt. On rare occasions where there was a departure from the basic regulations these were generally accounted for <b>by</b> the many <b>derogations</b> contained within the legislation and were with the full consent of employees. Research limitations/implications – It is hard to generalise from this research alone which is relatively small‐scale. The study suggests reasons for the unproblematic nature of the WTR which could be tested using large‐scale statistically representative methods. The occurrence of “accidental compliance” is of particular interest for future research. Practical implications – Identifies {{the way in which the}} WTR allow “accidental compliance” and would be useful for review by policy makers. Originality/value – The WTR remains relatively under‐researched and the study draws interesting comparisons with earlier research. The qualitative approach allows the role of the actors to be identified in determining the effect of the dynamics of the employment relationship on compliance patterns, which covers an empirical “gap” in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{work here}} {{presented}} {{deals with the}} effects that N, applied with manure, and the water regimes had in a cropping maize system. The study want to evaluate the N leaching trough groundwater and the potential greenhouse gas emission affecting global warming. Two different water regimes were studied: soil in free drainage conditions with different irrigation levels and two shallow water table conditions. The {{study was conducted in}} the Experimental Farm of Padua University. Continuous maize was cropped in lysimeters fertilized with manure and urea according to the limit imposed by Nitrates Directive and the recent derogation of Directive obtained by Italy. Analysis of crop yield, N leaching and GHGs were done to compute a N balance. GHGs were obtained through direct measurements in the field. The thesis is composed by five chapter. Chapter 1. is a general introduction to the topics discussed. Chapter 2, entitled “Interaction between irrigation and N fertilization in an area subject to the Nitrates Directive. Effects on N Balance”, analyzed data come from a five years study conducted in 2006 - 2010 and aimed to identify the effect of four different irrigation and four N input in N leaching, crop yield and N uptake by crop. In the chapter is processed a simple metamodel able to predict the leaching of nitrogen. Chapter 3, entitled “N balance and Nitrous Oxide emission in soil subject to derogation from the Nitrates Directive in free drainage and shallow groundwater conditions”. aimed to evaluate the effect of derogation of Nitrates Directive, quantifying the effect of three different N input combined with three water table conditions in two years, 2011 and 2012. The lower N input was the limit for nitrates vulnerable zones (NVZs) and the other two input were relative to the new limits that can be used due to the derogation of Nitrate Directive. We consider a free drainage and two shallow water table conditions. We performed analysis of maize yield, N uptake, N leaching and N 2 O emissions.. Chapter 4, entitled “Carbon (CO 2 and CH 4) emissions from soil with shallow water table and approach to GHGs modeling” we performed analysis of CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes for the experimental layout described in Chapter 2. The aim was to quantify the emissions as affected by free drainage or shallow water table conditions, considering the N limit imposed in NVZs by Nitrates Directive and <b>by</b> the <b>derogation.</b> Finally a little part was dedicated at an approach in the use of a terrestrial ecosystem model for the simulation of data obtained in chapter 2 and 3. Chapter 5, is a general conclusion of the work. ...|$|R
30|$|In Southern Europe the {{hierarchical}} layering of agreements {{based on the}} favourability principle has usually found strict legal application (Sciarra 2006). However, under heavy international pressure, recent legal changes have opened Pandora’s box. In Italy lowering sectorally agreed pay norms had been possible from 2001 in some ‘underdeveloped’ regions with high unemployment {{if there is a}} tripartite employment pact. The tripartite national pact of 2009, without approval of the largest union confederation, conceded the possibility to suspend the sectoral wage increase in firms that had fallen on hard times. In 2010 Fiat tested the pact by a round of concession bargaining including radical changes in working practices and dismissal protection in two of its plants, on threat of closure and relocation. Workers voted in favour in ballots organized by the company and the two plants were removed from the sector agreement. Soon after Fiat withdrew from the sector agreement. In June 2011 a new central agreement, with the signature of all three union confederations, stipulated that enterprise agreements can introduce temporary and experimental modifications of provisions in sector agreements within established limits and with approval by a majority of union delegates at the local level. These new rules have been applied in a few industry agreements since. When in August 2011 the government introduced, under pressure of the ECB, a decree-law with the possibility of <b>derogation,</b> <b>by</b> collective agreement, from legally-established dismissal protection guarantees, the main employers’ confederation could only rescue the central agreement it had just signed by promising not to use the new law. This has prompted Fiat to leave the confederation.|$|R
