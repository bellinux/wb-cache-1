25|$|During a mission, Eren is {{swallowed}} by a Titan when he sacrifices himself {{to save his}} friend Armin Arlert. Inside the Titan, however, he suddenly transforms into a 15-meter class Titan that attacks the other Titans and disregards humans before the Titan collapses and his real body is exposed, unconscious, {{at the back of}} the neck. Though he is distrusted initially by the military, especially due to his inability to control himself in Titan form, Eren earns a place in the Special Operations Squad, a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>Survey</b> Corps under Levi assigned to watch over him. Shortly after joining, Eren finds himself hunted by a female Titan who kills all of his squadmates to get to him. With help of Levi and Mikasa, Eren is saved from the Titan who is later revealed to be Annie Leonhart. Though Eren defeats Annie alongside his allies, they are unable to get answers as they watch her encase herself using her Titan's hardening ability.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to find sites, one example can be through surveys. Surveys involve walking around {{analyzing}} the land looking for artifacts. It can also involve digging, according to the Archaeological Institute of America, “archaeologists actively search areas that were likely to support human populations, or in places where old documents and records indicate people once lived.” This helps archaeologists in the future. In case there was no time, or money during the finding of the site, archaeologists can come back and visit the site for further digging to find out the extent of the site. Archaeologist can also sample randomly within a given area of land as another form of conducting surveys. Surveys are very useful, according to Jess Beck, “it can tell you where people were living at different points in the past.” Geophysics is a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> becoming more and more popular in archaeology, because it uses different types of instruments to investigate features below the ground surface. It is not as reliable, because although they can see what is under the surface of the ground it does not produce the best picture. Archaeologists have to still dig up the area in order to uncover the truth. There are also two most common types of geophysical survey, which is, magnetometer and ground penetrating radar. Magnetometry is the technique of measuring and mapping patterns of magnetism in the soil. It uses an instrument called a magnetometer which is required to measure and map traces of soil magnetism. The ground penetrating radar is a method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. It uses electro magnetic radiation in the microwave band of the radio spectrum, and detects the reflected signals from subsurface structures.|$|E
