5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin. When the syndicated version was being developed, the production team {{felt that it was}} not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting, as the show recorded four episodes in a single day, and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host: it had to <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them. Rosie O'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition, but declined the opportunity almost immediately. Eventually Meredith Vieira, who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version, was named host of the new syndicated edition.|$|E

We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E

500|$|With his {{aggressive}} running style which favored {{running over}} players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. [...] "He runs {{with a lot}} of reckless abandon," [...] said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. [...] "You can run like that in college. But you can't do that for 10 years and hope to survive." [...] Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said [...] "Knocking over people can look very good but you can't do it forever. Sometimes it's going to <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn't to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you're healthy enough to play." [...] Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell's running style. [...] "I've been looking for a back like Earl," [...] he said. [...] "I'm not going to change his style. Why would I? You don't want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife {{thought it}} best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E

500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

500|$|Giving a {{partially}} negative {{review of the}} film was Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who said the [...] "movie has a centerfold sheen to it—and some lesbianic soft-core flirtation to match—as its plot dives deeply into Twilight-esque heavy-melo meltdown in the last act" [...] and that [...] "Cody throws one too many losses at Needy; the screenwriter loses her satiric way about halfway through. But for a while, this has real fangs". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post said, [...] "There's a certain kooky, kinky fun to be had with Jennifer's Body" [...] but that [...] "dmittedly, this {{is the stuff of}} lurid adolescent distraction, not great cinema" [...] and [...] "is strictly a niche item but provides a goofy, campy bookend to Drag Me to Hell on the B-movie shelf. Watch it, forget it, move on". San Francisco Chronicle Peter Hartlaub stated, [...] "Enjoy the film for its witty dialogue and fun performances, but know that there isn't a single good scare. An episode of Murder, She Wrote has more thrills." [...] Hartlaub felt the film is not bad, is [...] "almost always pleasing" [...] and that Fox [...] "proves that she has some [...] range" [...] but [...] "the chances that it will <b>be</b> <b>somebody</b> else's pop culture reference 27 years from now are slim to none". Joe Neumaier of New York Daily News said, [...] "Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil, which the Transformers boy-toy does spookily well" [...] but [...] "ords and story are still the lifeblood of a movie, and Jennifer's Body is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas". Disagreeing with Fox's performance, Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips called Fox [...] "a pretty bad actress" [...] who [...] "doesn't seem to get Cody's sense of humor. At all". He reasoned the [...] "movie's partially redeemed by Seyfried, who makes her character more than a repository for audience sympathy" [...] and [...] "her make-out scene with Fox is handled with more suspense and care than anything else in the movie".|$|E
