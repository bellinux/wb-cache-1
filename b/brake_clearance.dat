5000|$|Levers {{evolved over}} time from being all {{aluminum}} with non-drilled lever arms to using resin bodies and drilled lever arms in some later models. Two varieties of hoods were supplied: half-hoods covering {{only the top}} of the lever assembly, or full-hoods covering the entire body of the lever assembly. Both included the built-in adjusters that allowed riders to adjust <b>brake</b> <b>clearance</b> while riding. MAFAC also supplied rubber lever arm covers as an option.|$|E
5000|$|Cyclocross Cantilever brake bosses {{are more}} often {{equipped}} with traditional center-pull cantilever brakes than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull brakes ("V-brakes") due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient brake cable pull) {{with the majority of}} drop-bar brake levers; and the cantilever brake's greater <b>brake</b> pad-to-rim <b>clearance,</b> which minimizes drag in muddy conditions. [...] "Mini-V's" [...] are gaining in popularity as they have both the native cable pull, and some of the increased power of traditional linear-pull brakes over cantilever brakes.|$|R
50|$|In operation, {{the maximum}} weight for takeoff {{may be limited}} to values less than the maximum takeoff weight due to {{aircraft}} performance, environmental conditions, airfield characteristics (takeoff field length, altitude), maximum tire speed and <b>brake</b> energy, obstacle <b>clearances,</b> and/or en route and landing weight requirements.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a magnetorheological (MR) brake design by using additional squeeze working mode to an existing conventional rotational shear. The MR brake was designed with consideration {{given to a}} new concept of braking mechanism {{with the help of}} magnetic simulation. Important parameters such as disc <b>brake</b> dimensions, <b>clearance</b> gap and electromagnetic coil configuration were taken into account when constructed the MR brake. Simulation results showed that the magnetic field strength was at best by having the magnetic coil beside the non-magnetic material, which was located {{at the end of the}} outer diameter. Meanwhile, the value of magnetic field was greater than when a small squeeze gap was applied. Eventually, the design will provide an opportunity to study and consequently understand on how the MR fluids react to such operating condition in order to be realized in the MR brake...|$|R
50|$|Brake {{failure is}} also caused by brake drum thermal {{expansion}} in which <b>brake</b> shoe <b>clearance</b> becomes excessive from wear. This was largely remedied in the 1950s by self-adjusting brakes. Maladjustment with wear {{is still a}} factor in trucks with drum air brakes. A Canadian survey of randomly stopped heavy trucks found over 10% of trucks using self-adjusting brakes {{had at least one}} brake out of adjustment, due either to failure of the self-adjust mechanism or wear beyond the capacity of the self adjuster. Newer brake pistons ("cans") extend stroke from about 65 mm to about 75 mm; since about 30 mm of stroke is used just putting the pads in contact with the drum, the added 10 mm of stroke is over 25% increase in useful stroke. Longer stroke reduces especially wear-related fade, but drum brakes are still fundamentally prone to fade when hot.|$|R
2500|$|When {{compared}} to other U.S. mid-size truck offerings for 2016 through 2018, the second generation Honda Ridgeline's published specifications has its pros and cons. Car and Driver magazine conducted an in-depth review of the 2017/2018 Ridgeline comparing it to the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier, and GM's Colorado/Canyon of the same model years. [...] The numerical comparison revealed the Ridgeline has best in class gasoline fuel economy, best cornering performance, best rear-seat passenger space and volume, lowest sound levels, best seat height, better visibility, and best in class safety features. [...] For the [...] "cons," [...] the 2017/2018 Ridgeline has the lowest tow rating, worst in class <b>braking,</b> lowest ground <b>clearance,</b> and the poorest rated infotainment system. [...] The other criteria used by Car and Driver to compare the Ridgeline showed the truck falling {{in the middle of}} its competition.|$|R
50|$|Textron's Survivable Combat Tactical Vehicle (SCTV) is a {{protective}} capsule that can increase Humvee survivability to MRAP levels while significantly improving mobility; the modifications come in five kits, but all five {{need to be}} installed before the vehicle can be properly called an SCTV. The vehicle features a monocoque V-shaped hull and angled sides to help deflect rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) with scalable levels of protection. It has greater engine power, replacing the 6.5 liter diesel engine with a Cummins 6.7 liter diesel and Allison 6-speed transmission, {{as well as a}} stronger transmission and suspension, improved <b>brakes,</b> higher ground <b>clearance,</b> and new onboard instrumentation. Fuel capacity is increased from 27 gallons to 40 and the battery and fuel cells are moved from under the rear seat {{to the rear of the}} vehicle. Also included are a powerful air conditioner and heating system, run-flat tires, a thermal guard liner under the roof, sharp edges removed from inside the cabin, blast attenuating seats, and a folding gunner's turret allowing rapid deployment from a cargo aircraft or shipboard below deck. Although heavier than the Humvee, the SCTV is half the weight and costs $150,000 less than a comparably survivable MRAP. The basic version is a four-passenger armament carrier, but it can be configured as a nine-passenger troop carrier, air-defense vehicle, flatbed cargo truck, or field ambulance depending on the type of Humvee it is converted from.|$|R
