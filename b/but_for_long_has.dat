40|$|Laser-induced Plasma {{spectroscopy}} (LIPS) is {{a useful}} method for determining the elemental composition of various materials <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>long</b> time it <b>have</b> been mainly restricted to qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples material. Recently LIPS is applied in addition to depth-profile analysis. In this paper {{we were trying to}} investigate the differences in the depth profile, obtained adopting femtosecond LIPS, that may occur on changing the spectral lines chosen for the analysis. The used femtosecond laser has pulse duration of 130 fs, wave length of 795 nm and pulse energy 200 μJ. It was found that the differences observed were not significant as long as the spectral lines chosen are fulfilling the LIPS spectral lines conditions. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

5000|$|M. fascicularis is {{also used}} {{extensively}} in medical experiments, in particular those connected with neuroscience and disease. Due to their close physiology, they can share infections with humans. Some cases of concern have been an isolated event of Reston ebolavirus found in a captive-bred population shipped to the US from the Philippines, which was later {{found to be a}} strain of Ebola that has no known pathological consequences in humans, unlike the African strains. Furthermore, they are a known carrier of monkey B virus (Herpesvirus simiae), a virus which has produced disease in some lab workers working mainly with rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). [...] Nafovanny, the largest facility for the captive breeding of nonhuman primates in the world, houses 30,000 macaques [...] The crab-eating macaque is one of the species used as space test flight animals. Plasmodium knowlesi, which causes malaria in M. fascicularis, can also infect humans. A few cases have been documented in humans, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> how <b>long</b> humans <b>have</b> been getting infections of this malarial strain is unknown. It is, therefore, not possible to assess if this is a newly emerging health threat, or if just newly discovered due to improved malarial detection techniques. Given the long history of humans and macaques living together in Southeast Asia, it is likely the latter.|$|R
6000|$|What an intimacy, what an {{intensity}} of relation, I said to myself, so successful a process implied! It {{was of course}} familiar enough that when people were so deeply in love they rubbed off on each other--that a great pressure of soul to soul usually left on either side a sufficient show of tell-tale traces. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>Long</b> to <b>have</b> been so stamped as I found him, how the pliant wax must have been prepared and the seal of passion applied! What an affection the woman working such a change in him must have managed to create as a preface to her influence! With what a sense of her charm she must have {{paved the way for}} it! Strangely enough, however--it was even rather irritating--there was nothing more than usual in Lady John to assist my view of the height at which the pair so evoked must move. These things--the way other people could feel about each other, the power not one's self, in the given instance, that made for passion--were of course at best the mystery of mysteries; still, there were cases in which fancy, sounding the depths or the shallows, could at least drop the lead. Lady John, perceptibly, was no such case; imagination, in her presence, was but the weak wing of the insect that bumps against the glass. She was pretty, prompt, hard, and, {{in a way that was}} special to her, a mistress at once of [...] "culture" [...] and of slang. She was like a hat--with one of Mrs. Briss's hat-pins--askew on the bust of Virgil. Her ornamental information--as strong as a coat of furniture-polish--almost knocked you down. What I felt in her now more than ever was that, having a reputation for [...] "point" [...] to keep up, she was always under arms, with absences and anxieties like those of a celebrity at a public dinner. She thought too much of her [...] "speech"--of how soon it would have to come. It was none the less wonderful, however, that, as Grace Brissenden had said, she should still find herself with intellect to spare--have lavished herself by precept and example on <b>Long</b> and yet <b>have</b> remained for each other interlocutor as fresh as the clown bounding into the ring. She cracked, for my benefit, as many jokes and turned as many somersaults as might have been expected; after which I thought it fair to let her off.
