Fatigue tests and stress analysis by the CSIR showed that both sizes of blades failed due to fatigue at the sharp fillets {{as a result of the}} repeated changes in the centrifugal load due to variations in the turbine rotational speed. The solution was arrived at when it was realised that none of the single [...] "lock" [...] blades, which were supported by two conical pins, of any rotor had ever failed. When such conical pins were also introduced between all the other blades in the rotors, fatigue tests showed that this made them considerably stronger. Some time later it was found that welding the blades onto the rotor edge proved to be a good cheaper alternative. The design was eventually amended with the redesigned exhaust fan being manufactured from manganese steel and the problem was solved.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presented}} herein comprises of {{the work}} undertaken to research novel methods of Phased array ultrasonic inspection of complex steam turbine <b>blade</b> <b>roots</b> as found in the power generation industry. The research was conducted {{as part of the}} Engineering Doctorate scheme, administered by the Research Centre for Non-Destructive Evaluation (RCNDE), in conjunction with RWE npower and the University of Warwick. Steam turbine blades, and in particularly last stage blades of low pressure steam turbines, are amongst the most highly stressed components on a power generating plant. Two of the most common blade root fixing types include ‘curved axial entry fir tree roots’ (CAEFTR), and axial pinned roots, both of which are prone to cracking due to the high stresses to which they are subjected under operating conditions. Failure of the blade root fixings of such components, leading to the release of the blades, has historically led to the catastrophic failure and destruction of the whole turbine; the cost of collateral damage to plant components and the loss in generating income are seconded only by the risk these failures pose to life. Due to the high price of failure, NDT plays a critical part in the support and management of engineering maintenance, offering insight into the condition and integrity of turbine components through regular planned inspection regimes. It will be shown in this thesis how the invention of a novel continuous wedge, used to refract ultrasound into the critical regions of the <b>blade</b> <b>roots,</b> has significantly improved the ability to detect defects. Combined with the development of bespoke scanning frames these wedges facilitate the efficient and accurate acquisition of scanned data to assess the integrity of the component.

40|$|By {{applying}} adaptronics to helicopters, i. e. {{by use of}} self-adapting structural components, noise can be suppressed, vibration {{reduced and}} aerodynamic efficiency increased. This thesis investigates two concepts, the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> and the adaptive blade tip, allowing direct adaptive shape control of the main rotor areas that are the main sources of helicopter noise and vibration. Both concepts {{are based on the}} introduction of a local twist into the rotor blades. Since non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and their interaction with the elastic helicopter structure are the main sources for flight envelope boundaries as well as vibration and noise, the comprehension of aerodynamics is essential to effectively influence local airflow conditions and finally evaluate the investigated concepts. With respect to these relations the adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> and the adaptive blade tip are described and evaluated. The adaptive <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> represents a torsional actuator integrated in the rotor <b>blade</b> <b>root</b> that mainly introduces rigid body blade torsion. A torsional actuator integrated in the rotor blade tip is realized by the adaptive blade tip. This concept influences the blade twist distribution close to the blade tip and leads to higher aerodynamic efficiency due to this approach. (orig.)
