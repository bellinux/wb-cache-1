Coulthard was delighted as securing victory at the Grand Prix which he considered {{as one of the}} races he wanted to win during his career because of the challenges the drivers take on the circuit. He also commented that he wanted to wait until the pit stop stages to get ahead of Michael Schumacher and Trulli to prevent unnecessary repairs to his car. Barrichello revealed that he was conserving his tyres and fuel, as well as being informed by Ferrari technical director Ross <b>Brawn</b> to reduce his pace towards the race's latter stages.

5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that his early pit stop was down to a possible sensor failure which caused his team to receive misinformation. He also added that the wet-weather conditions forced him to change the entire brake balance towards {{the front of his}} car. Barrichello said that he informed Ferrari technical director Ross <b>Brawn</b> that it would be quicker to make an extra pit stop had it rained for ten more laps. Nevertheless, he stated that he trusted his team in their judgement and revealed his car developed an clutch issue during the Grand Prix. Fisichella stated that he was driving a conservative race as he was on a one-stop strategy.

5|$|Following Operation Tungsten, British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{would be}} repaired within six months. Accordingly, Cunningham directed Fraser on 13 April to launch another {{attack on the}} battleship. While Cunningham {{did not believe that}} Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. Fraser initially resisted Cunningham's order, arguing that the prospects for a successful raid were poor as the Germans would have reinforced the defences around Tirpitz and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. He eventually relented, and Moore sailed from Scapa Flow on 21 April to attack Kaafjord again. This raid, designated Operation Planet, was called off on 24 April due to bad weather over the target area. Two other attacks, Operation <b>Brawn</b> and Operation Tiger Claw, also had to be cancelled on 15 and 28 May respectively because of adverse weather. Further carrier raids were attempted in July and August after Allied intelligence determined that the repairs to Tirpitz were nearing completion. During Operation Mascot a force of 42 Barracudas and 40 fighters attacked Tirpitz on 17 July, but did not score any hits as the battleship was hidden by a smokescreen. A further four carrier raids were conducted against Kaafjord between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but these caused only light damage to the battleship.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the limited}} budget and {{development}} time, only three chassis were ever made (larger teams, such as McLaren build {{as many as}} eight): one for each driver and a spare. The spare was used by Rubens Barrichello in Singapore, while Jenson Button used the second <b>Brawn</b> chassis BGP 001-02 in every practice, qualifying session and race between the 2009 Australian Grand Prix and the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix. This meant that he won the championship in the oldest car on the grid. Chassis BGP 001-02 is owned by Ross <b>Brawn</b> and was demonstrated at the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed. Chassis 02 was painted silver after 2009 for the 2010 launch of Mercedes GP and used as a demonstration car for 2 years before being returned to its previous <b>Brawn</b> livery.|$|E

5|$|Andretti {{made his}} Champ Car debut on April 19, 1964 at the New Jersey State fairgrounds in Trenton, New Jersey. He started sixteenth and {{finished}} eleventh.

Chris Economaki recommended Andretti to <b>Brawner,</b> so <b>Brawner</b> watched Andretti race at Terre Haute, Indiana. <b>Brawner</b> was convinced {{that he had found}} the new driver for his team. The two stayed together for six years. Andretti finished eleventh in the USAC National Championship that season. Andretti won his first championship car race at the Hoosier Grand Prix on a road course at Indianapolis Raceway Park in 1965. His third-place finish at the 1965 Indianapolis 500 in the <b>Brawner</b> Hawk (a mechanical copy of the current Brabham Formula 1 design) earned him the race's Rookie of the Year award, and contributed towards Andretti winning the series championship. He was the youngest national champion in series history at age 25. He repeated as series champion in 1966, winning eight of fifteen events. He also won the pole at the 1966 Indianapolis 500. Andretti finished second in the IndyCars in 1967 and 1968. He also won a single non-championship drag race in 1967 in a Ford Mustang.
