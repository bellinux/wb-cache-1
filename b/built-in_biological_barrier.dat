Therefore how to efficiently store, retrieve and modify protein data is becoming a challenging issue that most biological scientists have to face and solve. Traditional data models such as relational database lack of support for complex data types, which is a big issue for protein data application. Hence many scientists switch to the object-oriented databases since object-oriented nature of life science data perfectly matches the architecture of object-oriented databases, but there are still a lot of problems that need to be solved in order to apply OODB methodologies to manage protein data.

30|$|Cancer {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most difficult global healthcare problems. Although there is a large library of drugs that can be used in cancer treatment, the problem is selectively killing all the cancer cells while reducing collateral toxicity to healthy cells. There are several <b>biological</b> <b>barriers</b> to effective drug delivery in cancer such as renal, hepatic, or immune clearance. Nanoparticles loaded with drugs can be designed to overcome these <b>biological</b> <b>barriers</b> to improve efficacy while reducing morbidity. Nanomedicine has ushered in a new era for drug delivery by improving the therapeutic indices of the active pharmaceutical ingredients engineered within nanoparticles. First generation nanomedicines have received widespread clinical approval over the past two decades, from Doxil® (liposomal doxorubicin) in 1995 to Onivyde® (liposomal irinotecan) in 2015. This review highlights the <b>biological</b> <b>barriers</b> to effective drug delivery in cancer, emphasizing the need for nanoparticles for improving therapeutic outcomes. A summary of different nanoparticles used for drug delivery applications in cancer are presented. The review summarizes recent successes in cancer nanomedicine in the clinic. The clinical trials of Onivyde leading to its approval in 2015 by the Food and Drug Adminstration are highlighted as a case study in the recent clinical success of nanomedicine against cancer. Next generation nanomedicines need to be better targeted to specifically destroy cancerous tissue, but face several obstacles in their clinical development, including identification of appropriate biomarkers to target, scale-up of synthesis, and reproducible characterization. These hurdles need to be overcome through multidisciplinary collaborations across academia, pharmaceutical industry, and regulatory agencies in order to achieve the goal of eradicating cancer. This review discusses the current use of clinically approved nanomedicines, the investigation of nanomedicines in clinical trials, and the challenges that may hinder development of the nanomedicines for cancer treatment.|$|R

The route of exposure (pulmonary, gastrointestinal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, dermal), and the portal of entry of nanoparticles into the body, is of critical importance. Different physico-chemical properties, not only size, may determine the ability of nanoparticles to breach biological barriers; the situation is further compounded by the formation of a so-called corona of biomolecules on the surface of nanoparticles, the composition of which may vary depending on the route of exposure and the “history” of the nanoparticles as they translocate from one biological compartment to another.

30|$|In recent years, {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of {{mortality}} rate. One of the major causes behind rise in death rate is inability to deliver the drug to target-specific site without inducing any toxicity to the normal tissue. Current treatment regimes of cancer mainly rely on chemotherapy. So there is an essential need to develop a drug delivery system which could overcome <b>biological</b> <b>barriers</b> and selectively target the cancerous cell. The development of targeted nanotechnology-based drug delivery improves the drug/gene delivery and overcome multiple physiological, physical and <b>biological</b> <b>barriers</b> which are associated with conventional chemotherapy. For instance, nanoparticles via either passive or active targeting enhance the intercellular concentration of drugs/genes in cancer cells while avoiding adverse effect to normal cells. In addition, targeted nanoparticles can be fabricated as either pH-sensitive or temperature-sensitive carriers. The pH-sensitive drug delivery systems are controlled to deliver and release drugs within the more acidic environment of the cancer cells or within cancer cells [151]. The temperature-sensitive system are designed to release drugs with changes in temperature locally in the tumor region provided by sources such as ultrasound waves, magnetic fields and so on.
