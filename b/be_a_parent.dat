Furmint has also been confirmed to be the same grape as the Croatian white variety Moslavac.|$|E
25|$|Ferdinand Regner {{has argued}} that pinot noir is a cross between Pinot Meunier (Schwarzriesling) and Traminer, but this claim has since been refuted. In fact Pinot Meunier {{has been shown to}} be a chimerical {{mutation}} (in the epidermal cells) which makes the shoot tips and leaves prominently hairy-white and the vine a little smaller and early ripening. Thus Pinot Meunier is a chimera with two tissue layers of different genetic makeup, both of which contain a mutation making them non-identical to, and mutations of, Pinot noir (as well as of any of the other color forms of Pinot). As such, Pinot Meunier cannot <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> of Pinot noir, and, indeed, it seems likely that chimerical mutations which can generate Pinot gris from other Pinots (principally blanc or noir) may in turn be the genetic pathway for the emergence of Pinot Meunier.|$|E

In addition, she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed he was the one in need of parenting. Jackson explained to his wife over breakfast one morning that she did not have to be the biological mother if she so desired.

500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent.</b> You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between work and home for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

They had never been separated." [...] Heaven and Earth had {{children}}, who grew up and lived in this thick night, and they were unhappy {{because they could not}} see. Between the bodies of their parents they were imprisoned, and there was no light. The names of the children were Tumatuenga, Tane Mahuta, Tutenganahau, and some others. So they all consulted as to what should be done with their parents, Rangi and Papa. [...] "Shall we slay them, or shall we separate them?" [...] "Go to," [...] said Tumatuenga, [...] "let us slay them." [...] "No," [...] cried Tane Mahuta, [...] "let us rather separate them. Let one go upwards, and become a stranger to us; let the other remain below, and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> to us." [...] Only Tawhiri Matea (the wind) had pity on his own father and mother. Then the fruit-gods, and the war-god, and the sea-god (for all the children of Papa and Rangi were gods) tried to rend their parents asunder. Last rose the forest- god, cruel Tutenganahau. He severed the sinews which united Heaven and Earth, Rangi and Papa. Then he pushed hard with his head and feet. Then wailed Heaven and exclaimed Earth, [...] "Wherefore this murder? Why this great sin? Why destroy us? Why separate us?" [...] But Tane pushed and pushed: Rangi was driven far away into the air. [...] "They became visible, who had hitherto been concealed between the hollows of their parents' breasts." [...] Only the storm-god differed from his brethren: he arose and followed his father, Rangi, and abode with him in the open spaces of the sky.' ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{extracts}} {{are obviously}} speculative {{rather than in}} any sense mythological The element of myth just shows itself when {{we are told that}} the sky dwelt with the earth and produced certain islands. But myth of a familiar character is very fully represented among the Maoris. Their mythical gods, though [...] "mixed up with the spirits of ancestors," [...] are great natural powers, first Heaven and Earth, Rangi and Papa, the parents of all. These are conceived as having originally been united in such a close embrace, the Heaven lying on the Earth, that between their frames all was darkness, and in darkness the younger gods, Atua, O-te-po, their children, were obliged to dwell. These children or younger gods (answering to the Cronidæ) were the god of war (Tumatauenga), the forest-god (Tane Mahuta), in shape a tree, the wind-god (Tawhiri Matea), the gods of cultivated and natural fruits, the god of ocean (Tangaroa). These gods were unable to endure the dungeon and the darkness of their condition, so they consulted together and said: [...] "Let us seek means whereby to destroy Heaven and Earth, or to separate them from each other". The counsel of Tane Mahuta prevailed: [...] "Let one go upwards and become a stranger to us; let the other remain below and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> to us". Finally, Tane Mahuta rent asunder Heaven and Earth, pushing Heaven up where he has ever since remained. The wind-god followed his father, abode with him in the open spaces of the sky, and thence makes war on the trees of the forest-god, his enemy. Tangaroa went, like Poseidon, to the great deep, and his children, the reptiles and fishes, clove part to the waters, part to the dry land. The war-god, Tu, was more of a human being than the other gods, though his [...] "brethren" [...] are plants, fish and reptiles. Still, Tu is not precisely the first man of New Zealand.|$|E
