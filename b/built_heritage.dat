5|$|The castle {{deteriorated}} {{through the}} 18th century, and by 1800 Doune was a roofless ruin. It remained so until the 1880s, when George Stuart, 14th Earl of Moray (1816–1895) began repair works. The timber roofs were replaced, and the interiors, including the panelling in the Lord's Hall, were installed. The castle is now maintained by Historic Scotland, having been donated to a predecessor organisation by Douglas Stuart, 20th Earl of Moray, in 1984, and {{is open to}} the public. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and is a Category A listed building, the highest levels of protection for nationally important <b>built</b> <b>heritage</b> in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, danger listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger. Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in danger without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the danger list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in Danger is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on <b>Built</b> <b>Heritage,</b> University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in Danger (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the role played by <b>built</b> <b>heritages</b> and {{cultural}} environments, alongside other locational factors, in explaining the growth of human capital in Sweden. We distinguish between urban, natural and cultural qualities as different sources of regional attractiveness and estimate their influence on the observed growth of individuals with at least three years of higher education during 2001 – 2010. Neighborhood-level data are used, and unobserved heterogeneity and spatial dependencies are modeled by employing random effects estimations and an instrumental variable approach. Our findings indicate that the local supply of <b>built</b> <b>heritages</b> and cultural environments explain a significant part of human capital growth in Sweden. Results suggest that these types of cultural heritages are important place-based resources with a potential to contribute to improved regional attractiveness and growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} {{preserving}} historic buildings is increasingly accepted by society, {{which not only}} recognizes <b>built</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> {{as a part of}} its identity but is also more cognizant of its economic value. In Europe, for example, tourism accounts for 10 percent of the GDP in the EU and 12 percent of employment. 1 <b>Built</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> is a fundamental element of what draws tourists to European destinations. To a great extent, the value of historic buildings rests in the integrity of their components as unique products of the technology of their time and place. Unfortunately, cultural heritage buildings are particularly vulnerable to disasters, for a variety of reasons. They are often damaged or in a state of deterioration; they were built with materials with low resistance; they are heavy; and the connections among their various structural components are frequently insufficient. The main causes of damage are lack of maintenance, water-induced deterioration (from rain or rising damp), soil settlement, and extreme events such as earthquakes. Earthquakes have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last decade, in addition to the tremendous losses in <b>built</b> cultural <b>heritage...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Brazil as {{in other}} {{developing}} countries, the predominant approach used for the cultural conservation institutions in decision-making processes in historic towns is “top-down ” and rarely considers key groups of people using and living in the urban area. As a result, concerns and relationships about the local residents are neglected and not fully integrated in development processes. The outcome {{is a series of}} conflicting relationships and negative impacts on <b>built</b> cultural <b>heritage.</b> The prevalent concerns regarding the conservation management of <b>built</b> cultural <b>heritage</b> in historic towns are related to three questions: how have key stakeholders been involved through the management approach?; what are the important socio-economic and cultural issues affecting people’s lives?; and thirdly, what is the impact of tourism on the built environment? This paper discusses how collaborative and communicative planning approaches can address the involvement of key stakeholders in the conservation management process in small Brazilian historic towns. The research undertaken explores how project results could be improved through collaboration between public institutions, local residents and university students, illustrated through the case study of Ouro Preto, Brazil. It argues that addressing local environmental and social concerns will maintain improvements in local people’s relationship with cultural heritage and result in sustaining the integrity of the <b>built</b> cultural <b>heritage...</b>|$|R
