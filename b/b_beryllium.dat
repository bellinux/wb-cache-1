40|$|Based on {{experiments}} and numerical simulations, a study {{is carried out}} pertaining to the conversion of dose-to-graphite to dose-to-water in a carbon ion beam. This conversion is needed to establish graphite calorimeters as primary standards of absorbed dose in these beams. It is governed by the water-to-graphite mass collision stopping power ratio and fluence correction factors, which depend on the particle fluence distributions {{in each of the}} two media. The paper focuses on the experimental and numerical determination of this fluence correction factor for an 80 MeV/A carbon ion beam. Measurements have been performed in the nuclear physics laboratory INFN-LNS in Catania (Sicily, Italy). The numerical simulations have been made with a Geant 4 Monte Carlo code through the GATE simulation platform. The experimental data are in good agreement with the simulated results for the fluence correction factors and are found to be close to unity. The experimental values increase with depth reaching 1. 010 before the Bragg peak region. They have been determined with an uncertainty of 0. 25 %. Different numerical results are obtained depending on the level of approximation made in calculating the fluence correction factors. When considering carbon ions only, the difference between measured and calculated values is maximal just before the Bragg peak, but its value is less than 1. 005. The numerical value is close to unity at the surface and increases to 1. 005 near the Bragg peak. When the fluence of all charged particles is considered, the fluence correction factors are lower than unity at the surface and increase with depth up to 1. 025 before the Bragg peak. Besides carbon ions, secondary particles created due to nuclear interactions have {{to be included in the}} analysis: boron ions (10 B and 11 <b>B),</b> <b>beryllium</b> ions (7 Be), alpha particles and protons. At the conclusion of this work, we have the conversion of dose-to-graphite to dose-to-water to apply to the response of a graphite calorimeter in an 80 MeV/A carbon ion beam. This conversion consists of the product of two contributions: the water-to-graphite electronic mass collision stopping power ratio, which is equal to 1. 115, and the fluence correction factor which varies linearly with depth, as kfl, all = 0. 9995 + 0. 0048 zw-eq. The latter has been determined on the basis of {{experiments and}} numerical simulations. © 2013 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of {{the natural}} {{radionuclides}} 7 Be and 210 Pb were determined in aerosol samples collected {{in the western hemisphere}} Arctic during the recent NOAA Arctic Gas and Aerosol Sampling Program (AGASP 3) and NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment/Arctic Boundary Layer Expeditions (GTE/ABLE 3 A and ABLE 3 <b>B)</b> missions. <b>Beryllium</b> 7 showed a free tropospheric concentration maximum between 4 and 5 km in the summer of 1990. Previous 7 Be data obtained in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s also indicated a similar vertical distribution of 7 Be near 70 °N. Injection of stratospheric air through tropopause folds associated with the Arctic jet near 70 °N appears to explain the presence of a layer of air near 4 – 5 km in the high Arctic free troposphere with elevated 7 Be concentrations. The vertical distribution of 210 Pb showed a distinct difference between the high-Arctic and sub-Arctic in the summer of 1988. At latitudes greater than 65 °N, 210 Pb concentrations at 3 – 6 km were elevated compared to those below 1 km. The reverse of this trend was observed near 60 °N. These same vertical distributions were also apparent in aerosol SO 42 −, determined in separate aerosol samples collected on the same flights (Talbot et al., this issue). The results for 210 Pb suggest that some of the difference between the summer troposphere in the high- and sub-Arctic is also due to enhanced stratosphere-troposphere exchange {{in the vicinity of the}} Arctic jet. These observations, and other findings from ABLE 3 A presented in this issue, suggest that for some species the stratosphere may be a principal source influencing their distribution in the Arctic summer troposphere. For example, intrusions of stratospheric air constitute the dominant source term for tropospheric budgets of 7 Be and ozone, and may be important in the 210 Pb, SO 42 −, and NOybudgets. Further investigation, including determination of detailed 7 Be and 210 Pb distributions, is needed to quantify the stratospheric impact on the chemistry of the Arctic troposphere during the summer...|$|R
