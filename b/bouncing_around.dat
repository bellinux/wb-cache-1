5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> {{a room with a}} slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by director duo Ne-o and shot in 16 mm film in various places in Budapest, Hungary. The visual, which features a basketball <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> the streets with its owner running to catch it, drew comparisons with the 1956 short film The Red Balloon. Another visual, created by director Adam Smith for an alternate version of the song, was donated to the charity group Good for Nothing's 50/50 Make or Break campaign in 2011. The track also received a remix from DFA, whose version received much acclaim from critics.|$|E

After Mars graduated in Hawaii he moved to L.A., and there he found that he could only pay rent by DJing.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Brendan Malloy. It premiered on February 23, 2010, on Vevo. Both members of 3OH!3 make an appearance in the video. Kesha told MTV that the video primarily involves men (described as [...] "douchey") hitting on Kesha, while she declines their advances. [...] "At one point," [...] Kesha says [...] "I get to be strapped to this harness and <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> everywhere, {{and it was really}} cool [...] The whole concept of the video was a bunch of douche-y guys macking on me as usual, and me making them eat their toupees or other various items". Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard said that the clip was [...] "thoroughly entertaining".|$|E

500|$|... "Night of Your Life" [...] is a future-soul song. According to Melinda Newman from HitFix, {{the opening}} of the song {{features}} beats that are [...] "lightly <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> like colorful dancing polka dots", before the song switches into a [...] "retro-sounding twirler with Hudson belting loud and clear." [...] Tom Ewing from The Guardian noted the song bears similarities to Rihanna's [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010). Genevieve Koski from The A.V. Club wrote that on the song, [...] "Jennifer Hudson manage to keep [...] head above the waves of synths...by amping up [...] vocals to match the outsized beats." [...] Kerri Mason from Billboard magazine wrote that the song [...] "takes a structure usually reserved for breathy chanteuses—the big-room trance vocal—and adds the firepower of Jennifer Hudson." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{features}} a leather-clad Yankovic [...] "expanding to 800 pounds and <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> a subway set." [...] To find suitable back-up dancers, ads were placed in Los Angeles newspapers for [...] "Very Fat Dancers". One of the men used in the video was actually a pizza delivery man who had delivered food to the casting offices. Due to the music video, [...] "Fat" [...] became one of Yankovic's biggest hits. Although only managing to peak at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100, the song's music video got extensive play on MTV, which helped the album attain platinum status. In addition, [...] "Fat" [...] was later nominated and won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards, at the time, Yankovic's second Grammy Award.|$|E
500|$|... "Jessica" [...] was co-written by Betts and Dudek, {{although}} only Betts receives credit. Betts first created the song as an experiment, {{to test whether}} or not he could write a song that could be played with just two fingers, in honor of Gypsy jazz guitar virtuoso Django Reinhardt, who played with two left fingers due to severe burns. When his baby daughter Jessica entered the room and began <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> to the melody, Betts attempted to capture her mood with the song. Dudek created the song's bridge when Betts became frustrated with the piece. Dudek was disappointed when he was told he would only be recording the acoustic guitar opening, as Betts felt Dudek performing the harmonies to both [...] "Ramblin' Man" [...] and [...] "Jessica" [...] would lead critics to assume {{he was a member of}} the band. Leavell also contributed heavily to [...] "Jessica", mostly on the arrangement.|$|E

500|$|There {{were also}} a few {{positive}} reviews. One such review came from Fraser McAlpine of BBC, who opened, [...] "It's {{one of the fundamental}} laws of pop, anything which tips a nod to 'You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)' by Dead Or Alive is going to be worth a listen." [...] He continued, [...] "Even though this is just a song written {{from the perspective of a}} randy man watching a pole-dancer and bragging about how much money he has [...] in a manner which would make Akon blush, there's just something kind of cute about the whole thing." [...] McAlpine attributed this to the song's [...] "Tigger-beat", explaining, [...] "How can anything too sordid be going on when everyone is <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> like they're on spacehoppers?" [...] Bill Lamb of About.com commented, [...] "You will hear echoes of another pop classic, but the new song stands on its own feet." [...] However, he noted that while pop music fans would appreciate it, hip hop listeners would likely dismiss it, and he added that [...] "t's not groundbreaking by any means".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] was filmed in New York City by director, Isaac Ravishankara. The song's music video is {{relative}} to the song's theme: kissing. Foreman explained, [...] " [...] the video is a play on kissing in general, and lips, and getting close up {{to a bunch of}} lips, and people coming out of mouths and just, like, really cool transitions." [...] The video follows a similar theme that is {{relative to the}} song's title, [...] "My First Kiss". It features a lot of people (punks, teachers, sailors, soldiers, lesbians, nerds, an elderly couple and hirsute rockers) [...] "smooching, kissing, and making out." [...] The video is made up of different scenes all using multi-colored backdrops as the video's dominant backing. The main scenes present are of [...] "3OH!3 <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> and throw punches at the camera" [...] while singing their versus and occasional close-ups of different pairs of lips that are mouthing different lyrics of the song. Kesha is also present throughout the video, mainly on her verses where she is seen in close-ups of her lips and dancing around the screen on the chorus.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts <b>bouncing</b> <b>around,</b> which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

500|$|Reception of the character's {{sex appeal}} has been mostly positive, though with {{a share of}} {{criticism}} {{as well as her}} design evolved through the series. Joystiq bemoaned her appearance in Soulcalibur IV, describing it as an extreme in lieu of games such as Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball and noting that while a full redesign was unnecessary, [...] "At least [...] keeps its breasts in context." [...] MSNBC described her attire as [...] "the pinnacle of preposterous", noting that while it revolved around her femme fatale design, it appeared physically painful and made little sense to wear into combat. Former GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann described the alterations to her appearance for Soulcalibur IV as unnecessary, stating [...] "boobs are awesome, but there's a line. Ivy is over this line." [...] GamesRadar content editor David Houghton described her alongside similar characters as [...] "festering adolescent wank-fantasies", adding directly regarding Ivy [...] "his is not female empowerment". The subject was later brought up again at the 2011 PAX East convention, in which an all-female journal panel led by The Escapists Susan Arendt agreed that while the character was strong and difficult but rewarding to master in the original Soulcalibur, she was reduced to [...] "a nice ass <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> the room" [...] in later games.|$|E
500|$|Gotcha is a two-player maze game {{in which}} one player {{attempts}} to catch the other. The maze is composed of a repeating pattern of elements set in multiple columns on the screen. The [...] "Pursuer" [...] is represented by a square, while the [...] "Pursued" [...] is identified by a plus sign. As the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, an electronic beeping sound plays at an increasing rate until the Pursuer reaches the Pursued. Whenever the Pursued is caught, the Pursuer scores a point, the maze disappears for a brief moment, and the Pursuer is moved to a random position {{on the right side}} of the screen. There is no score for the Pursued, so determining who won is left to the players. The maze itself is continually changing, with two invisible lines half a screen apart scanning down the maze and overwriting maze elements. Above the maze is the Pursuer's score and the time elapsed in the game. Each game is for a set period of time. When time runs out, the game enters attract mode, where the score resets and the square and plus sign begin <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> the maze in a diagonal pattern as the maze continues to change. Each game costs a quarter. The time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|A pull is a cross-batted shot {{played to}} a ball <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> waist height by {{swinging}} the bat in a horizontal arc {{in front of}} the body, pulling it around to the leg side towards mid-wicket or square leg. The term hook shot is used when the shot is played against a ball bouncing at or above chest high to the batsman, the batsman thus [...] "hooking" [...] the ball around behind square leg, either along the ground or in the air. Pull and hook shots can be played off front or back foot, with back foot being more typical.|$|E

2500|$|Based on the {{preceding}} work on electromagnetic mass, Friedrich Hasenöhrl suggested {{that part of}} the mass of a body (which he called apparent mass) {{can be thought of as}} radiation <b>bouncing</b> <b>around</b> a cavity. The [...] "apparent mass" [...] of radiation depends on the temperature (because every heated body emits radiation) and is proportional to its energy. Hasenöhrl stated that this energy-apparent-mass relation only holds as long as the body radiates, i.e., if the temperature of a body is greater than 0 K. At first he gave the expression [...] for the apparent mass; however, Abraham and Hasenöhrl himself in 1905 changed the result to , the same value as for the electromagnetic mass for a body at rest.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Friedrich Hasenöhrl {{specifically}} associated inertia {{with radiation}} {{by studying the}} dynamics of a moving cavity.

Abraham concluded that Hasenöhrl's formula of the apparent mass of radiation is not correct, and on the basis of his definition of electromagnetic momentum and longitudinal electromagnetic mass Abraham changed it to , the same value for the electromagnetic mass for a body at rest. Hasenöhrl recalculated his own derivation and verified Abraham's result. He also noticed the similarity between the apparent mass and the electromagnetic mass. However, Hasenöhrl stated that this energy-apparent-mass relation only holds as long a body radiates, i.e. if the temperature of a body is greater than 0 K.|$|E
