5000|$|In her 2007 book Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, Sherry Boschert {{argues that}} large-format NiMH {{batteries}} (i.e., 25 amp-hours or more) are commercially viable but that Cobasys would only accept very large orders (more than 10,000) for these batteries. The effect {{is that this}} policy precludes small companies and individuals from buying them. It also precludes larger auto manufacturers from developing test fleets of new PHEV and EV designs. Toyota employees complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV4 EVs. Since no other companies were willing to make large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing nor licensing any large format NiMH battery technology for automotive purposes. Boschert quotes Dave Goldstein, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of Washington D.C., as saying this policy is necessary because the cost of setting up a multimillion-dollar <b>battery</b> <b>assembly</b> line could not be justified without guaranteed orders of 100,000 batteries (~12,000 EVs) per year for 3 years. Boschert concludes that, [...] "it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{current state}} of the art in the field of the {{mechanical}} behavior of electric vehicle (EV) battery cells is limited to quasi-static analysis. The lack of published data in the dynamic mechanical behavior of EV battery cells blinds engineers and scientists with the uncertainty of what to expect when EVs experience such unexpected events as intrusions to their battery systems. To this end, the recent occurrences of several EVs catching fire after hitting road debris even make this topic timelier. In order {{to ensure the safety of}} EV battery, it is critical to develop quantitative understanding of battery cell mechanical behavior under dynamic compressive loadings. Specifically, the research focuses on the dynamic mechanical loading effect on the standard “ 18650 ” cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells. ^ In the study, the force-displacement and voltage-displacement behavior of the battery cells were analyzed experimentally at two strain rates, two state-of-charges, and two unit-cell configurations. The results revealed the strain rate sensitivity of their mechanical responses with the solid sacrificial elements. When the hollow sacrificial cells are used, on the other hand, effect was negligible up to the point of densification strength. Also, the high state-of-charge appeared to increase the stiffness of the battery cells. ^ The research also revealed the effectiveness of the sacrificial elements on the mechanical behavior of a unit cell that consists of one battery cell and six sacrificial elements. The use of the sacrificial elements resulted in the delayed initiation of electric short circuit. Based on the analysis of battery behavior at the cell level, granular <b>battery</b> <b>assembly,</b> a battery pack, was designed and fabricated. The behavior of the granular <b>battery</b> <b>assembly</b> was analyzed both quasistatically and dynamically. Building on the results of the research, various research plans were proposed. ^ Through conducting the research, we sought to answer the following research questions: Could we use battery cells and packs as a part of vehicle structures? Could we use battery cells and packs as a part of vehicle impact energy absorption structure? Based on the research results, the answer to the first question is “yes. ” However, the granular <b>battery</b> <b>assembly</b> configuration is not suitable as a load-bearing battery structure since the main purpose of granular <b>battery</b> <b>assembly,</b> apart from energy storage for vehicle propulsion, is to work as a kinetic energy dissipation device. The answer to the second question is also “yes. ” However, the kinetic energy dissipation is mainly performed by the sacrificial elements surrounding the battery cells. ...|$|E

To identify and determine the mass of lithium-ion battery components, we modeled batteries with LiMn{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } as the cathode material using Argonne's Battery Performance and Cost (BatPaC) model for hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and electric vehicles. As input for GREET, we developed new or updated data for the cathode material and the following materials that are included in its supply chain: soda ash, lime, petroleum-derived ethanol, lithium brine, and lithium carbonate.

40|$|In battery applications, every {{electrical}} connection of battery cells {{is important because}} it influences functionality, efficiency, and safety. Increased contact resistances generate more heat at the affected terminals and if contact resistances of parallel-connected battery cells differ the current divides unequally. Amongst different techniques, detachable connections are easy to handle and have advantages for service, repair and recycling. Usually, detachable {{electrical connection}}s are based on the functional principle of press contacts. So, press contacts are frequently used for consumer batteries in electronic devices, for pouch battery cells in scientific tests, and for large battery cells with screw connections. This paper focusses on the electrical contact resistance of press contacts for battery cells. A novel measuring method to assess the contact resistance itself is presented. Common terminal and connector metals for battery cells and the dependence of their contact resistances on the contact pressure, surface roughness, and contact area are investigated and compared with welding techniques. Only if these dependencies are considered, contact resistances as low as for welded connections are achieved. Furthermore, due to its hard passivating Al 203 surface film, aluminum contacts need a certain surface roughness.

40|$|Soldering {{has a high}} {{potential}} for electrically connecting single battery cells even for multicellular <b>battery</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This work evaluates soldered connections for battery cells by assessing the electrical connection resistance with a special measuring and calculation method. Due to the solder layer in between the joint partners, the current paths differ from welded connections. A resistance network and a finite element model (FEM) simulation are applied to understand these current paths. For the chosen test scenario, simulation predicts a reduction of the total connection resistance by the solder layer. Measured connection resistances and tensile strength are compared to series of measurements with resistance spot welding, ultrasonic welding, laser beam welding and press connections. Not only the connection resistances are lower for soldered brass samples but also the tensile strength is higher. For iron soldering on lithium-ion battery cells, the solder’s liquidus temperature should be below ca. 150 °C. Other heating techniques, such as laser soldering, seem more promising, because the heat input is rapid and extremely localized. As a conclusion, soldering is a good option for connecting battery cells. If the right heating technique is chosen and the parameters are optimally adjusted, soldering could overtrump other connection techniques in some aspects...|$|R
