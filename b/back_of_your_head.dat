2500|$|I {{have taken}} up unconstitutional action at this time because of the {{abnormal}} circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a socialist, and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society {{for the benefit of}} all. I am proud of my conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place. I act square and clean for my principles. .... No matter what your accusations against me may be, no matter what reservations you keep at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> my appeal is to the working class. I appeal exclusively to them because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{less common}} types of McGillivray syndromes are: Metopic {{synostosis}} (trigonocephaly). The metopic suture runs from your baby's {{nose to the}} sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the scalp a triangular appearance. Another one is Lambdoid synostosis (posterior plagiocephaly). This rare form of craniosynostosis involves the lambdoid suture, which runs across the skull near the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head. It may cause flattening <b>of</b> <b>your</b> baby's <b>head</b> on the affected side. A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> baby's <b>head</b> appears flattened, {{it could be the}} result of birth trauma or your baby's spending too much time on his or her back. This condition is sometimes treated with a custom-fit helmet that helps mold <b>your</b> baby's <b>head</b> back into a normal position.|$|R
50|$|While the <b>back</b> cover <b>of</b> Flex <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> has {{remained}} almost the same, its front cover has changed throughout the years. When {{the album was}} first released, featured a stock photography of {{a painting of a}} violin, roses, and sheet music. The second pressing, released almost immediately, came with a stock image of stalks of wheat. A third early cover, designed by Jeff Nelson and used for the British pressing of the album, displayed a black and white version of the flag of Washington, D.C. with the stars replaced by Xs. Later, in 1985, the record was re-released with a new cover featuring a blurry photo of a man in a hat, which was used until 2008. The most recent version, a variation in red and white of the D.C. flag cover from 1982, came in 2010 on a remastered LP re-release.|$|R

There's always the {{thousand}} to one chance, you know. I might get brain fever in a German hospital and begin to babble. Tear it up, old fellow." ...|$|E

"An {{abrasion}} on your forehead, and {{a bruise}} on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> which should apparently have been sufficient to produce concussion of the brain," [...] the doctor said.

I almost think that is quite enough." ...|$|E

[...] "You think that I sent for you {{probably}} to try and steal one by one all those wonderful secrets which I suppose you have stored up at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> One cannot be Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs without knowing things.

[...] "The more I {{think it}} over, the more I feel {{impressed}} by it; but, do you know, there's {{something about the}} proposition I can't quite cotton to! Seems to me you've some little scheme of your own at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> You haven't got it in your mind, have you, that you're sort of putting us on our honor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fiddlesticks! The {{fashion is}} always {{beautiful}}.

He was as brave as a lion, was Jack, but he was afraid o’ that little shrivelled-up Burmese. They’ll follow me to the ship to-night.

6000|$|... "And {{now let me}} {{give you}} a word of advice that will be of use to you as long as you live," [...] said Cashel, impressively. [...] "You did a very silly thing to-day. You threw a man down--a fighting-man--and then stood looking at him like a fool, waiting for him to get up and kill you. If ever you do that again, fall on him as heavily as you can the instant he's off his legs. Drop your {{shoulder}} well into him, and, if he pulls you over, make play with the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> If he's altogether too big for you, put your knee on his throat as if by accident. But, on no account, stand and do nothing. It's flying in the face of Providence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a room {{back here}} that you can only get into by a ladder {{put up on the}} outside. I knew all about it, so I went to the {{ice-house}} and got a ladder and climbed into the room. I put my valise under my head, and prepared to take a good sleep on the floor, but in three minutes I found the place was full of wasps. I couldn't stay there, you know, and I was just getting ready to go down the ladder again when I happened to look out of a window that opened on the roof, and saw you in here. I could see only the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> but although it was pretty well lighted, I couldn't judge very well by that what sort of a person you were. But I saw you were smoking, and it struck me that a man who smokes is generally a pretty good fellow, and so I came over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, my dear," [...] he said quite kindly, {{but very}} decisively. [...] "If {{you have any}} idea at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> that I, personally, have any {{influence}} at my command with regard to Luke de Mountford's fate, then the sooner you get that idea out of your head the better. If you came here to-night with the notion that by pleading with me you could save Luke from the consequences of his crime, then get that notion out of your head, my dear, and save us both from a very painful interview. Luke de Mountford was not arrested by my orders: I am only an automaton of the law, which takes its own course, without any personal interference on my part. Officially I--as an automaton--did just as duty and the law of this country directs. Personally, I sent through your father some sound advice to Luke de Mountford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But not a hair <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> shall they hurt, lady," [...] said Heinz. [...] "This fellow's limbs {{shall be}} thrown to {{them over the}} battlements. On, Koppel!" ...|$|R

6000|$|He paused, then continued: [...] "As it began, so it {{has gone}} on. It is always like that, is it not? The {{beginning}} is everything, the end must follow. And now it has come out, as I was fully determined {{that it should not}} do half an hour ago, when suddenly you developed eyes in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> and--oh! dearest, I love you. No, please be quiet; I have not done. I have told you what I am, and really there isn't much more to say about me, for I have no particular vices except the worst of them all, idleness, and not the slightest trace of any virtue that I can discover. But I have a certain knowledge of the world acquired in a long course of shooting parties, and as a man of the world I will venture to give you a bit of advice. It is possible that to you my life and death affair is a mere matter of board-ship amusement. Yet it is possible also that you might take another view of the matter. In that case, as a friend and a man of the world, I entreat you--don't. Have nothing to do with me. Send me about my business; you will never regret it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{way that}} you use it is this: You get in a boat, and put the box in the water, glass bottom down. Then you lean over and put your head into the open end, and if you will lay {{something}} over the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> as a man does when he is taking photographs, so as {{to keep out the}} light from above, it will be all the better. Then, miss, you'd be perfectly amazed at what you could see through that glass {{at the bottom of the}} box! Even in northern regions, where the water is heavy and murky, you can see a good way down; but all about the tropics, where the water is often so thin and clear that you can see the bottom in some places with nothing but your naked eyes, it is perfectly amazing what you can see with a water-glass! It doesn't seem a bit as if you were looking down into the sea; it is just like gazing about in the upper air. If it isn't too deep, things on the bottom--fishes swimming about, everything--is just as plain and distinct as if there wasn't any water under you and you were just looking down from the top of a house.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] {{said the}} guide, leading him up-stairs and opening a door, [...] "is a {{specimen}} of the apartments reserved for these princes of the blood." [...] There were four empty beds on iron legs, and, {{with the air}} of a showman, the Frenchman twitched away a dingy quilt. [...] "They go out in the mornings, earn enough to make them drunk, sleep it off, and then begin again. That's their life. There are people who think they ought to be reformed. 'Mon cher monsieur', one must face reality a little, even in this country. It would be a hundred times better for these people to spend their time reforming high Society. Your high Society makes all these creatures; there's no harvest without cutting stalks. 'Selon moi'," [...] he continued, putting back the quilt, and dribbling cigarette smoke through his nose, [...] "there's no grand difference between your high Society and these individuals here; both want pleasure, both think only of themselves, which is very natural. One lot have had the luck, the other--well, you see." [...] He shrugged. [...] "A common set! I've been robbed here half a dozen times. If you have new shoes, a good waistcoat, an overcoat, you want eyes in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> And they are populated! Change your bed, and you'll run all the dangers of not sleeping alone. 'V'la ma clientele'! The half of them don't pay me!" [...] He, snapped his yellow sticks of fingers. [...] "A penny for a shave, twopence a cut! 'Quelle vie'! Here," [...] he continued, standing by a bed, [...] "is a gentleman who owes me fivepence. Here's one who was a soldier; he's done for! All brutalised; not one with any courage left! But, believe me, monsieur," [...] he went on, opening another door, [...] "when you come down to houses of this sort you must have a vice; it's as necessary as breath is to the lungs. No matter what, you must have a vice to give you a little solace--'un peu de soulagement'. Ah, yes! before you judge these swine, reflect on life! I've been through it. Monsieur, it is not nice never to know where to get your next meal. Gentlemen who have food in their stomachs, money in their pockets, and know where to get more, they never think. Why should they--'pas de danger'! All these cages are the same. Come down, and you shall see the pantry." [...] He took Shelton through the kitchen, which seemed the only sitting-room of the establishment, to an inner room furnished with dirty cups and saucers, plates, and knives. Another fire was burning there. [...] "We always have hot water," [...] said the Frenchman, [...] "and three times a week they make a fire down there"--he pointed to a cellar--"for our clients to boil their vermin. Oh, yes, we have all the luxuries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{considered}} you out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> {{and said}} so. It is true they pitied {{you for being}} in such misfortune, but still they held you to be mad." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{consideration}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head's</b> thickness, then," [...] said Thorward, [...] "would be {{an additional}} element of comfort, no doubt, {{to the women}} in case of things going against us." ...|$|R
