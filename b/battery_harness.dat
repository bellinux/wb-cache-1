In the late 1990s, the use of aluminium for <b>battery</b> cable <b>harnesses</b> was made production-ready and patented.

The country currently generates 20% of its electric power from wind energy, {{but much of}} it is exported because there is currently no way for utilities to store the excess power.

40|$|High {{performance}} computing {{is becoming an}} essential tool for the development and optimal deployment of renewable energy generation and storage technologies. The Energy oriented Centre of Excellence (EoCoE) brings together four different scientific communities (meteo 4 energy, water 4 energy, materials 4 energy and fusion 4 energy) which already rely heavily on HPC to make advances in, for example, wind-, solar-, hydro- and geothermal power, nuclear fusion and high-capacity <b>batteries.</b> <b>Harnessing</b> its full potential, on the other hand, requires making efficient use of the upcoming exascale computers (hierarchical architectures {{with a large number}} of multicore nodes), and this in turn means that applications need to be significantly modified if they are to reach the expected performance level. A key paradigm in EoCoE is to foster close, sustainable collaborations between HPC experts and scientists from the four energy application domains. This is achieved through a combination specialized workshops, brokered bilateral links ('code teams') and shared collaborative platforms. In most cases this begins with a performance evaluation of the application using the in-house benchmarking package JUBE to automate the extraction of key metrics in a strictly reproducible manner. Performance can then be periodically re-evaluated after optimisation or more substantial refactoring - such as the introduction of a new linear algebra solver - in order to monitor the impact of these developments on the application in realistic production scenarios...|$|R

These {{are said to}} be better suited for particular types of environments, e.g., hotels and resorts, manufacturing facilities. <b>Harnessing</b> <b>battery</b> power is an old idea, going back to the nineteen hundreds.

40|$|Fast {{charging}} {{strategies have}} gained an increasing interest towards {{the convenience of}} battery applications but may unduly degrade or damage the <b>batteries.</b> To <b>harness</b> these competing objectives including safety, lifetime, and charging time, this paper proposes a health- aware fast charging strategy synthesised from electrochemical system modelling and advanced control theory. The battery charging problem is formulated in a linear- time-varying model predictive control algorithm. In this algorithm, a control-oriented electrochemical-thermal model is developed to predict the system dynamics. Constraints are explicitly imposed on physically meaningful state variables to protect the battery from hazardous operations. A moving horizon estimation algorithm is employed to monitor battery internal state information. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed charging strategy is able to largely reduce the charging time from its benchmarks while ensuring the satisfaction of health-related constraints...|$|R

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} uses {{a standard}} hang glider wing, made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The wing {{is supported by}} a single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. The engine is a two-stroke, single cylinder Radne Raket 120 of [...] that mounts a tuned exhaust, controlled by a foot pedal. Electric starting is provided via a 12-cell Nickel-metal hydride <b>battery.</b> The <b>harness</b> mounts the engine and the 4.6 L fuel tank. Each harness was custom made for the individual pilot to provide an exact fit and improve comfort. The harness incorporates a shaped carbon backplate, with a 10 mm foam insert, neoprene shoulder inserts, an adjustable prone angle and a multi-setting rotation point. Dual retractable cable-braced skids are provided to protect the two, or optionally three-bladed propeller, during take-off and landing.|$|R
40|$|Decreasing power {{requirements}} for wireless sensors {{coupled with the}} abundant supply of electromagnetic energy available within an electrical substation opens up the possibility of self-powered condition monitoring sensors that operate {{without the use of}} a <b>battery</b> by <b>harnessing</b> energy from the surrounding electric field. This paper investigates the feasibility of powering a wireless sensor by scavenging energy from an ambient electric field. Theoretical calculations are presented regarding the short circuit current and open circuit voltage available from the device. Practical measurements have also been carried out using a high voltage test rig. A prototype device has been built and the short circuit current extracted from the electric field measured directly using a small panel-mount ammeter located within the device. Two parallel plates of radius 10 cm separated be a distance of 10 cm and placed within a 200 kVm- 1 electric field have the potential to supply about 300 mW to a sensor circuit. Although there is useful power available, the high output impedance of the device renders it inherently inefficient. More efficient means of converting the available power into a useful form are discusse...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedWireless distributed microsensor systems offer reliable {{monitoring and control}} of a myriad of applications ranging from machine state and perimeter security to nuclear/chemical/biological and other military applications. Historically, batteries have supplied power to mobile, embedded, and ultra-low power microsensors. While there are many obvious short-term advantages of using batteries, {{they do have a}} long-term negative environmental impact. An alternative to <b>batteries</b> exists in <b>harnessing</b> the ambient energy surrounding the system and subsequently converting it into electrical energy. Once a long-established concept, energy harvesting offers an inexhaustible replacement for batteries. Energy-harvesting systems scavenge power from optical, acoustic, thermal, and mechanical energy sources. The proliferation of and advances in wireless technology, particularly wireless sensor nodes and mobile electronic devices, has increased the volume of energy harvesting research as of late. This thesis reviews the principles {{of the state of the}} art in energy harvesting systems. We focus on generating electrical power from mechanical energy in a vibrating environment due to its dominant scalability. We explore microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), including electromagnetic, electrostatic, and piezoelectric transduction. Further, power management, trends, suitable applications, and possible future developments are discussed. US Marine Corps (USMC) author...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{low-power}} microelectronics and sensor {{technologies have}} enabled {{the creation of}} sophisticated environmental monitoring systems capable of operating on battery power. Independence from a power outlet connection opens up many new potential applications, but limited battery life still imposes significant restrictions on a monitoring system’s capabilities {{and the number of}} systems that can be economically deployed and maintained. These restrictions have motivated much research into reducing monitoring system energy usage, increasing <b>battery</b> capacity, and <b>harnessing</b> alternative energy sources. While most of the research focuses on new system design, {{there is a need for}} techniques to extend the battery-powered operating time of existing environmental monitoring systems without compromising their sensor data quality. This thesis explores and develops methods for extending the operating time of an existing airquality monitoring system. The system contains seven environmental sensors that create a substantial energy demand and make long-term battery operation challenging. The resulting hardware and firmware modifications doubled the system’s battery-powered operating time without significantly reducing its environmental measurement data quality. The addition of an external battery sized to match the system’s form factor increased operating time well past the goal for the intended application. Although the modifications and results presented in this thesis are specific to one environmental monitoring system, the same techniques could be applied to other monitoring systems and to embedded systems in general...|$|R
