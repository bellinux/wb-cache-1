5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> was unconstitutional. Although agitation {{for an end to}} racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|The suit {{called for}} the school {{district}} to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by {{the leadership of the}} Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.|$|E

We could not agree more {{with the statement that}} the values of derived variables, such as group differences, will depend on how the scale is constructed through the weights assigned to the different component skill subscales. This is similar to what one sees in stock market indices: Different companies from different segments of the economy are included or excluded, and indices will be differentially sensitive to different events that may trigger market reactions.|$|R
25|$|Berea College, {{located at}} the extreme {{southern}} edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau, was the first coeducational college in the South to admit both <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students,</b> doing so from its very establishment in 1855. This policy was successfully challenged in the United States Supreme Court in the case of Berea College v. Kentucky in 1908. This decision effectively segregated Berea until the landmark Brown v.

25|$|When the city's Board of Education began {{building}} the John Phillip Sousa Junior High, {{a group of}} parents from the Anacostia neighborhood petitioned to have the school admit <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students.</b> When it was constructed, the board declared that only whites could enroll. The parents sued in a case decided in the landmark Supreme Court ruling Bolling v. Sharpe. Partly due to the District's unique status under the Constitution, the court decided unanimously that all of D.C.'s public schools had to be integrated. In the wake of this and the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education, the Eisenhower administration decided to make D.C. schools the first to integrate, as an example {{to the rest of}} the nation.|$|E

500|$|A 2006 study titled An Empirical Analysis of [...] "Acting White" [...] by Roland G.

Fryer has also written that, in contrast to Fordham and Ogbu's theory, [...] "acting white" [...] prejudices are actually more common the more integrated the school, with historically black schools free of any effects. He found that groups such as Italian immigrants in Boston’s West End and the Maori of New Zealand display similar behaviors. He concluded that there is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.|$|E
500|$|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>students</b> to be unconstitutional. The decision overturned the [...] Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation, insofar as it applied to public education. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Warren Court's unanimous (9–0) decision stated that [...] "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." [...] As a result, de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement, and a model for many future impact litigation cases. However, the decision's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II, [...] only ordered states to desegregate [...] "with all deliberate speed".|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} study {{is to examine the}} leadership behaviors and career paths of <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>student</b> service administrators. The careers of female administrators are impeded by a myriad of factors which hinder their professional development <b>and</b> advancement. <b>Black</b> women, in particular, face a number of obstacles {{as a result of their}} marginal status; ambiguity regarding the characterization of black women in society, gender and racial discrimination in the workplace, limited access to positions of authority, and a perception that black women lack adequate leadership skills. ^ The research questions addressed in this study are: (1) Are there differences in the leadership behaviors exhibited by <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>student</b> service administrators? (2) Are there differences in the leadership behaviors exhibited by junior and senior student service administrators, regardless of race? (3) Assuming these differences exist, what factors in the career paths of junior <b>and</b> senior administrators (<b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white)</b> may account for them?^ An exploratory research method was utilized to examine the leadership behaviors and career paths of 203 female student service administrators employed by four-year, private, predominantly <b>white</b> colleges <b>and</b> universities. The Leadership Opinion Questionnaire was used to assess the leadership behavior of the respondents, and a career path survey was utilized to yield data concerning their career experiences and personal background. ^ Statistical analysis revealed that position-type was the most accurate predictor of structured leadership behavior. The data suggest that administrators who hold senior administrative positions are more likely to exhibit highly structured leadership behavior. When delineated by race, the data did not reveal a statistically significant association between race and leadership behavior. Gender discrimination, lack of an advanced degree, and family obligations were revealed as the primary barriers to career advancement. ^ The study 2 ̆ 7 s results suggest that colleges and universities need to make a concerted effort to remove the barriers which impede the careers and leadership development of <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> women in higher education administration. Affirmative environments must be created and opportunities must be provided in order to promote and enhance their professional development. ...|$|R
