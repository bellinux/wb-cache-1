It has been observed that when children are working in a group with their peers and face difficulty, they will scan the room for an adult to assist or turn to their close fellows to either ask for help. Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant.

One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince.

They were married when Michael was about five years old, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> elected to continue to use their [...] "Vick" [...] surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a public housing project in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the East End section of the port city.

One resident {{said that there was}} drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and other killings in the neighborhood, and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many.

500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> are hesitant and do not answer.

500|$|Jeffrey Jerome Cohen {{proposes that}} the story is about racial difference, and [...] "allows William to write obliquely about the Welsh": the green {{children}} are a memory of England's past and the violent conquest of the indigenous Britons by the Anglo-Saxons followed by the Norman invasion. William of Newburgh reluctantly includes {{the story of the}} green children in his account of a largely unified England, which Cohen juxtaposes with Geoffrey of Monmouth's The History of the Kings of Britain, a book that according to William is full of [...] "gushing and untrammeled lying". Geoffrey's history offers accounts of previous kings and kingdoms of various racial identities, whereas William's England is one in which all peoples are either assimilated or pushed to the boundaries. According to Cohen, the green children represent a dual intrusion into William's unified vision of England. On one hand they are a reminder of the racial and cultural differences between Normans and Anglo-Saxons, given the children's claim to have come from St Martin's Land, named after Martin of Tours; the only other time William mentions that saint is in reference to [...] in Hastings, which commemorates the Norman victory in 1066. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> also embody the earlier inhabitants of the British Isles, the [...] "Welsh (and Irish and Scots) who [...] forcibly anglicized... The Green Children resurface another story that William had been unable to tell, one in which English paninsular dominion becomes a troubled assumption rather than a foregone conclusion." [...] The boy in particular, who dies rather than become assimilated, represents [...] "an adjacent world that cannot be annexed... an otherness that will perish to endure".|$|E
