The capillary restrictor and <b>bearing</b> <b>disk</b> {{are made of}} elastomer like silicone and PU. The viscoelasticity of elastomer helps the capillary expand for more air flux {{and at the same}} time, allows conicity of the bearing surface to form when the air pressure is enhanced. Therefore the bearing has the better ability of passive compensation. In the present example, as compared with the typical model, the new designs can nearly double the load capability and offer four times static stiffness.

A compensator is introduced in a sliding mode using a fre-quency-shaped performance index with linear quadratic optimal and sliding mode control. As an actuator, a piezoelectric bender is {{used in this study}} to complement an air bearing at the head/disk interface. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed controller performs better in flying height control than an optimal sliding mode controller. Accordingly, the controller can achieve stable flying height control in the presence of certain frequency vibration of optical disks.

We report here IRAC/MIPS observations for 115 confirmed members and 41 photometric candidates of the ~ 10 Myr 25 Orionis aggregate in the OB 1 a subassociation, and 106 confirmed members and 65 photometric candidates of the 5 Myr region located in the OB 1 b subassociation. The 25 Orionis aggregate shows a disk frequency of 6 % while {{the field in the}} OB 1 b subassociation shows a disk frequency of 13 %. Combining IRAC, MIPS and 2 MASS photometry we place stars <b>bearing</b> <b>disks</b> in several classes: stars with optically thick disks (class II systems), stars with an inner transitional disks (transitional disk candidates) and stars with "evolved disks"; the last exhibit smaller IRAC/MIPS excesses than class II systems. In all, we identify 1 transitional disk candidate in the 25 Orionis aggregate and 3 in the OB 1 b field; this represents ~ 10 % of the <b>disk</b> <b>bearing</b> stars, indicating that the transitional disk phase can be relatively fast. We find that the frequency of disks {{is a function of the}} stellar mass, suggesting a maximum around stars with spectral type M 0. Comparing the infrared excess in the IRAC bands among several stellar groups we find that inner disk emission decays with stellar age, showing a correlation with the respective disk frequencies. The disk emission at the IRAC and MIPS bands in several stellar groups indicates that disk dissipation takes place faster in the inner region of the disks. Comparison with models of irradiated accretion disks, computed with several degrees of settling, suggests that the decrease in the overall accretion rate observed in young stellar groups is not sufficient to explain the weak disk emission observed in the IRAC bands for <b>disk</b> <b>bearing</b> stars with ages 5 Myr or older.

40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, blade carrier <b>bearings</b> and crank <b>disk.</b> In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade carrier bearings and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade carrier <b>bearings,</b> crank <b>disk</b> and blade carrier bearings. Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, blade carrier <b>bearings</b> and crank <b>disk,</b> the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|R

If the magnitude of the applied voltage is changed, a slight contact between the slider and the disk can be realized. Simultaneous measurement of the induced slider displacement using a laser vibrometer allows the quantification of the mechanical clearance. The effect of disk roughness and microwaviness on the mechanical clearance was investigated. Principle: L...|$|R

One {{of the most effective}} methods which is used because of its precision and correctness is the application of the transfer matrix. By use of this method the entire continuous system is subdivided and the corresponding differential equation can be stated in matrix form. So to analyze shaft that is this paper issue the rotor is divided as several elements along the shaft which each one has its own mass and moment of inertia, which this work would create possibility of defining the named matrix. By Choosing more elements number, the size of matrix would become larger and as a result more accurate answers would be earned. In this paper the dynamics of a rotor-bearing system is analyzed, considering the gyroscopic effect. To increase the accuracy of modeling the thickness of the <b>disk</b> and <b>bearings</b> is also taken into account which would cause more complicated matrix to be solved. Entering these parameters to our modeling would change the results completely that these differences are shown in the results.

For the boundary condition of these elements, bearings at the end of the shaft are modeled as equivalent spring and dampers for the discretized system. Also, continuous model is used for the shaft in the system. By above considerations and using transfer matrix, exact results are taken from the calculations. Results Show that, by increasing thickness of the bearing the amplitude of vibration would decrease, but obviously the stiffness of the shaft and the natural frequencies of the system would accompany growth.

40|$|The {{gas turbine}} {{industry}} {{used a variety}} of sealing mechanisms to contain and direct secondary flows into and around components for cooling, and to limit leakage into and from <b>bearing</b> and <b>disk</b> cavities. The function of these seals is very important to the component efficiencies and attendant engine performance. Most of these seals are labyrinth seals, which are high-leakage seals that are costly to manufacture. In recent years, brush seals have been introduced which have demonstrated significantly reduced leakage, although they are still expensive and have exhibited wear and hysteresis difficulties. A new innovative concept called finger seal, patented by AlliedSignal, has demonstrated leakage similar to brush seals and is cheaper. The finger seal is comprised of a stack of precision photo-etched sheet metal elements, which allows intricate features to be made at very low cost and with the potential to resist wear and provide the compliance necessary to accomodate rotor excursions. Initial testing in the high-speed/high-temperature seal test facility, at the NASA Lewis Research Center, has corroborated the finger seal performance. The testing also revealed hysteresis problems with the current design. A NASA funded research project is in progress to correct the functional deficiencies of the finger seal and to refine its features to provide sufficient seal life for commercial transport engines and other long-life applications. This research will benefit the aeronautical gas turbine industry as a whole in terms of fuel consumption, operational characteristics, and cost. The first phase of this research to reduce finger seal hysteresis has been in progress for the last one year. This paper presents the results of this research to date.

40|$|The {{roughness}} of machined surfaces such {{as those}} in bearings and gears is characterized by asperities which cover a wide spectrum of wavelengths and heights. When the height of the asperities becomes comparable to the lubricant film thickness, the roughness is known to influence friction and wear behaviour. This thesis reports an experimental investigation into the effect of roughness on the film thickness and friction in EHD contact. This work focuses on the particular roughness case of ridges oriented parallel to the rolling-sliding direction, such as the ones produced on raceways during the manufacturing process of rolling element bearings. To carry-out this research a ball-on disk test rig was used to model the contact between the ball and the ring of a ball <b>bearing.</b> The <b>disks</b> were made of glass to enable the lubricant film thickness to be measured through an optical technique based on optical interferometry. The ball specimens were made of AISI 52100 steel and they were roughened with a cutting tool, resulting in longitudinally oriented roughness ridges showing a dominant wavelength and amplitude. The friction was measured through a torque meter attached to the ball shaft. A duo-chromatic system using two LEDs was developed {{in order to be able}} to measure the film thickness over a wider range of film thickness. A novel procedure was also introduced to enable the film thickness in rough EHD contacts to be measured accurately. The film thickness and the friction produced by specimens with various amplitude and wavelength were measured under pure rolling and rolling-sliding conditions. The roughness was found to have a big influence on both film build-up and friction. In particular, under the same operating condition, a rough specimen will generate a thinner minimum film and a higher friction compared to a smooth specimen. At the top of the asperities, a micro-EHD film was found to form. As suggested by friction and pressure measurements, the conditions in this micro film are severe enough to reach the limiting shear stress of the lubricant. Open Acces...|$|R
