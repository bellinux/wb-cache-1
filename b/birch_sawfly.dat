50|$|Craesus septentrionalis, the flat-legged tenthred or <b>birch</b> <b>sawfly,</b> is {{a species}} of insect in the order Hymenoptera, the {{suborder}} Symphyta and the family Tenthredinidae. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The adult sawflies are black and brown with transparent wings and the larvae are yellowish-green and resemble caterpillars. The larvae feed on the leaves of various species of deciduous tree.|$|E
40|$|The <b>birch</b> leaf-mining <b>sawfly,</b> Fenusa pusilla (Lep.), {{has been}} a major pest of birch trees in Canada since its {{introduction}} into North America in 1923 (Britton, 1924 a, 1924 b). From that date onwards, serious infestations of leaves of most species of birch have been reported, particularly from the maritime provinces. The species was first noted in the province of Quebec in 1929 by Dr. Lionel Daviault of Quebec City (Daviault, 1937) who observed it developing on seven birch species at Berthier. [ [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Birch</b> leafminers are <b>sawflies,</b> {{which are}} closely related to bees and wasps. They are among the most common insect pests {{affecting}} Birch trees (Betula spp.) in North America. Areas inside the leaves are consumed by the larvae affecting the leaves' ability to produce food. Yearly browning of birch leaves are noticed in mid July and August, but the leafminers have been feeding inside the leaf tissue since early spring.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} flavonoids, a {{subgroup}} of phenolic compounds produced by plants, {{and how they}} affect the herbivorous larvae of lepidopterans and sawflies. The {{first part of the}} literature review examines different techniques to analyze the chemical structures of flavonoids and their concentrations in biological samples. These techniques include, for example, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The second part of the literature review studies how phenolic compounds function in the metabolism of larvae. The harmful oxidation reactions of phenolic compounds in insect guts are also emphasized. In addition to the negative effects, many insect species have evolved the use of phenolic compounds for their own benefit. In the experimental part of the thesis, high concentrations of complex flavonoid oligoglycosides were found in the hemolymph (the circulatory fluid of insects) of <b>birch</b> and pine <b>sawflies.</b> The larvae produced these compounds from simple flavonoid precursors present in the birch leaves and pine needles. Flavonoid glycosides were also found in the cocoon walls of sawflies, which suggested that flavonoids were used in the construction of cocoons. The second part of the experimental work studied the modifications of phenolic compounds in conditions that mimicked the alkaline guts of lepidopteran larvae. It was found that the 24 plant species studied and their individual phenolic compounds had variable capacities to function as oxidative defenses in alkaline conditions. The excrements of lepidopteran and sawfly species were studied to see how different types of phenolics were processed by the larvae. These results suggested that phenolic compounds were oxidized, hydrolyzed, or modified in other ways during their passage through the digestive tract of the larvae...|$|R
