5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release, particularly for its gameplay, graphical design, and sound. Gary Barrett of ST/Amiga Format {{wrote that the}} game is the best shoot 'em up game on the Amiga. Zzap!64 listed <b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> as the best Amiga game of the 1980s, and ST Format named it the second-best shoot 'em up game of 1990. The game sold 40,000 copies, which is double the sales of Menace.|$|E
5|$|The game began {{development}} immediately after Menace, and borrowed similar gameplay elements. The development team used advanced hardware to develop <b>Blood</b> <b>Money,</b> utilising improved graphical and technological processes. The game {{was inspired by}} the presentation of Mr. Heli, and the animations of <b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> would later inspire the development of Lemmings. The game was released to positive reviews; praise was given to the game's graphics and gameplay. The game was also commercially successful, selling over 40,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|With <b>Blood</b> <b>Money,</b> Jones was {{determined}} to utilise the full colour range of the Amiga, opting to use the blitter {{as opposed to the}} hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on Menace, produced the graphics for <b>Blood</b> <b>Money,</b> while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his own game, Talisman, Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into <b>Blood</b> <b>Money.</b> The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, Walker (1993). The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones took from a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} ported to the PC by Tim Ansell of Creative Assembly, and to Atari ST by Jones' friend Wayne Smithson, while Dailly began porting {{the game to}} the Commodore 64 {{following}} the Personal Computer World Show in September 1989. Dailly used the code from the Talisman demo, and wrote a new sprite system. He also re-worked the multi-directional scrolling, and wrote his own tape loading routines, wanting one that allowed players to play a simple game while <b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> loaded. Smith designed the graphics for the port, and became confused by {{the limitations of the}} hardware: he had to draw double pixels in Deluxe Paint, and was limited to sixteen colours. Dailly finished developing the Commodore 64 version of <b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> on 12 March 1990.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> is a side-scrolling shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by DMA Design. It {{was published by}} Psygnosis in 1989 for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS, and in 1990 for the Commodore 64. The game is set in four different locations on a planet, where players are tasked with attacking the enemies and defeating the bosses.|$|E
5|$|DMA Design founder David Jones began {{developing}} Walker {{following the}} release of <b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> in 1989. The inspiration for the game's mech originated in a sprite from Lemmings (1991) originally designed for <b>Blood</b> <b>Money.</b> The graphics and animation for Walker were designed by Scott Johnston, who later worked on Hired Guns (1993). Johnston, a freelancer at the time, wrote a small program to correctly render the walker's head in position, which could then be altered in Deluxe Paint. In early 1990, Jones scrapped Walker because the design was not coming together, and began development on a new game called Gore!; this was soon scrapped. Following {{the completion of the}} Commodore 64 and TurboGrafx-16 ports of Shadow of the Beast, Jones hired Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy to continue working on Walker; Glancy redesigned the game. Raymond Usher wrote the game's soundtrack.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{sales for}} Lemmings on the Amiga topped 55,000 copies {{on the first}} day of sales; in comparison, Menace sold 20,000 copies and <b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> sold 40,000 copies cumulatively. With all the ports included, Mike Daily estimated that 15 million copies of Lemmings were sold between 1991 and 2006. In 2017, Luke Plunkett from Kotaku placed the figure at over 20 million.|$|E

5|$|Walker is a side-scrolling shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by DMA Design {{and published by}} Psygnosis. It was released for the Amiga in February 1993. The player control a bipedal mech and are tasked with killing advancing enemies in stages set in multiple time periods. Development of the game began {{after the release of}} <b>Blood</b> <b>Money,</b> but was scrapped in 1990 because the game was not coming together. By the end of the year, development had recommenced with a redesign, inspired by sprites originally intended for <b>Blood</b> <b>Money.</b> Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy designed the game, and Raymond Usher wrote its soundtrack. The game was released to positive reviews with praise directed at the game's graphics and sound, but reviewers were critical towards the repetitiveness of the gameplay. Amiga Power ranked it among their top 100 Amiga games of 1993.|$|E

5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or <b>blood</b> <b>money,</b> by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures have criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|The truce of Hudaybiyyah was {{enforced}} for two years. The {{tribe of}} Banu Khuza'a had {{good relations with}} Muhammad, whereas their enemies, the Banu Bakr, had allied with the Meccans. A clan of the Bakr made a night raid against the Khuza'a, killing a few of them. The Meccans helped the Banu Bakr with weapons and, according to some sources, a few Meccans also {{took part in the}} fighting. After this event, Muhammad sent a message to Mecca with three conditions, asking them to accept one of them. These were: either the Meccans would pay <b>blood</b> <b>money</b> for the slain among the Khuza'ah tribe, they disavow themselves of the Banu Bakr, or they should declare the truce of Hudaybiyyah null.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>Money</b> is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, players can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E

60|$|When we {{consider}} the American Revolution, we are apt {{to think of it}} as a great war in which all the inhabitants of the Colonies rose up against Great Britain, determined, no matter what might be the hardships and privations, no matter what the cost in <b>blood</b> and <b>money,</b> to achieve their independence and the right to govern themselves.|$|R
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kings {{built up}} a set of written laws, issued either as {{statutes}} or codes, but these laws were never written down in their entirety and were always supplemented by an extensive oral tradition of customary law. In {{the early part of}} the period local assemblies called moots were gathered to apply the laws to particular cases; in the 10th century these were replaced by hundred courts, serving local areas, and shire moots dealing with larger regions of the kingdom. Many churchmen and thegns were also given permission by the king to hold their own local courts. The legal system depended on a system of oaths, in which the value of different individuals swearing on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant varied according to their social status - the word of a companion of the king, for example, was worth twelve times that of a churl. If fines were imposed, their size similarly varied accord to the oath-value of the individual. The Anglo-Saxon authorities struggled to deal with the bloodfeuds between families that emerged following violent killings, attempting to use a system of weregild, a payment of <b>blood</b> <b>money,</b> as a way of providing an alternative to long-running vendettas.|$|E
5|$|While {{the killing}} of Hálfdan by the Orkney islanders is {{recorded}} independently in the Historia Norvegiæ, the manner of his death is unspecified. The blood eagle sacrifice may be a misunderstanding or an invention of the sagawriters as it does not feature directly in the earlier skaldic verses, which instead indicate that Hálfdan {{was killed by a}} volley of spears. The verses do mention the eagle as a carrion bird, and this may have influenced the saga writers to introduce the blood eagle element. The sagas then relate that Harald sought vengeance for his son's ignoble death, and set out on campaign against Einarr, but was unable to dislodge him. Eventually, Harald agreed to end the fight in exchange for a fine of 60 gold marks levied on Einarr and the allodial owners of the islands. Einarr offered to pay the whole fine if the allodial landowners passed their lands to him, to which they agreed. Einarr's assumption of control over the islands appears well-attested and was considered by later commentators to be the moment at which the Earls of Orkney came to own the entire island group in fee to the King of Norway. Others have interpreted the payment of 60 gold marks as wergild or <b>blood</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
