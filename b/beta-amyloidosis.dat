40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the aberrant polymerization of Abeta in the early pathogenic cascade of Alzheimer's disease, {{little is known about the}} induction of Abeta aggregation in vivo. Here we show that induction of cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> can be achieved in many different brain areas of APP 23 transgenic mice through the injection of dilute Abeta-containing brain extracts. Once the amyloidogenic process has been exogenously induced, the nature of the induced Abeta-deposition is determined by the brain region of the host. Because these observations are reminiscent of a prion-like mechanism, we then investigated whether cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> also can be induced by peripheral and systemic inoculations or by the intracerebral implantation of stainless steel wires previously coated with minute amounts of Abeta-containing brain extract. Results reveal that oral, intravenous, intraocular, and intranasal inoculations yielded no detectable induction of cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> in APP 23 transgenic mice. In contrast, transmission of cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> through the Abeta-contaminated steel wires was demonstrated. Notably, plasma sterilization, but not boiling of the wires before implantation, prevented the induction of <b>beta-amyloidosis.</b> Our results suggest that minute amounts of Abeta-containing brain material in direct contact with the CNS can induce cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis,</b> but that systemic cellular mechanisms of prion uptake and transport to the CNS may not apply to Abeta...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} transgenic mice that constitutively overproduce the signal sequence and the 99 -amino-acid carboxyl-terminal {{region of the}} human beta-amyloid precursor protein. The transgenic mice strongly expressed the transgene in multiple tissues {{under the control of}} a cytomegalovirus enhancer/chick beta-actin promoter. There were exceptionally high levels of beta-amyloid peptides in the plasma (approximately 17 times or more compared with the human plasma level). Although some transgenic mice from one founder line developed amyloidosis in the intestine, no neuropathology was found in transgenic mice up to age 29 months. Given the absence of cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> despite extremely high levels of circulating beta-amyloid peptides in the transgenic mice, the results suggest that local cerebral metabolism of beta-amyloid precursor protein may play a predominant role in cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> in transgenic mice. Such transgenic mice may be useful for the investigation of the etiology of the disease and for the establishment of therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|Deposition of {{aggregated}} amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide {{in brain}} {{is an early}} event and hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral Abeta angiopathy. Experimental evidence supports the concept that Abeta multimers can act as seeds and structurally corrupt other Abeta peptides by a self-propagating mechanism. Here we compare the induction of cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> by intraperitoneal applications of Abeta-containing brain extracts in three Abeta-precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse lines that differ in levels of transgene expression in brain and periphery (APP 23 mice, APP 23 mice lacking murine APP, and R 1. 40 mice). Results revealed that <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> induction, which could be blocked with an anti-Abeta antibody, was dependent {{on the amount of}} inoculated brain extract and on the level of APP/Abeta expression in the brain but not in the periphery. The induced Abeta deposits in brain occurred in a characteristic pattern consistent with the entry of Abeta seeds at multiple brain locations. Intraperitoneally injected Abeta could be detected in blood monocytes and some peripheral tissues (liver, spleen) up to 30 d after the injection but escaped histological and biochemical detection thereafter. These results suggest that intraperitoneally inoculated Abeta seeds are transported from the periphery to the brain in which corruptive templating of host Abeta occurs at multiple sites, most efficiently in regions with high availability of soluble Abeta...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Transgenic mice expressing mutated amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) and presenilin (PS) - 1 or - 2 have been successfully used to model cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis,</b> one of the characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the use of many transgenic lines is limited by premature death, low breeding efficiencies and late onset and high inter-animal variability of the pathology, creating a need for improved animal models. Here we describe the detailed characterization of a new homozygous double-transgenic mouse line that addresses most of these issues. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The transgenic mouse line (ARTE 10) was generated by co-integration of two transgenes carrying the K 670 N/M 671 L mutated amyloid {{precursor protein}} (APP(swe)) and the M 146 V mutated presenilin 1 (PS 1) both under control of a neuron-specific promoter. Mice, hemi- as well as homozygous for both transgenes, are viable and fertile with good breeding capabilities and a low rate of premature death. They develop robust AD-like cerebral beta-amyloid plaque pathology with glial inflammation, signs of neuritic dystrophy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Using our novel image analysis algorithm for semi-automatic quantification of plaque burden, we demonstrate an early onset and progressive plaque deposition starting at 3 months of age in homozygous mice with low inter-animal variability and 100 %-penetrance of the phenotype. The plaques are readily detected in vivo by PiB, the standard human PET tracer for AD. In addition, ARTE 10 mice display early loss of synaptic markers and age-related cognitive deficits. By applying a gamma-secretase inhibitor we show a dose dependent reduction of soluble amyloid beta levels in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: ARTE 10 mice develop a cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> closely resembling the beta-amyloid-related aspects of human AD neuropathology. Unifying several advantages of previous transgenic models, this line particularly qualifies for the use in target validation and for evaluating potential diagnostic or therapeutic agents targeting the amyloid pathology of AD...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{detection of}} glia, vessels and neurons facilitates {{insights into the}} complex chemoarchitecture of the central nervous system. Here, we present a simple, robust and versatile approach for the carbocyanine triple fluorescence labelling of neuronal, vascular and glial markers. The usefulness of this procedure is shown for rat brain tissue under physiological conditions, after traumatic brain injury caused by controlled cortical impact injury, and after stroke following middle cerebral artery occlusion. Moreover, the versatility of the method is verified by its application to sections from old triple transgenic mice with age-dependent <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus, modelling neuropathological alterations in Alzheimer‘s disease. To exemplify {{the usefulness of the}} approach for analysis of the enteric nervous system, it was applied to whole mounts from the horse intestine. The biotinylated lectin from potato (Solanum tuberosum) is presented as an excellent tool to detect both vessels and microglia. Furthermore, this lectin revealed macrophages after experimental insults, and senile plaques in aged triple transgenic mice. A large portion of astroglia was demonstrated by immunolabelling of glial fibrillary acidic protein. Neurons were detected by monoclonal antibodies directed against neuronal nuclei and, in horse tissues, mouse-anti-HuC/D recognizing a conserved nuclear protein. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy elucidated spatial relationships of the relevant markers and their pathological alterations after experimental insults and in transgenic mice with Alzheimer-like lesions...|$|E
40|$|The {{brains of}} three {{marmosets}} (Callithrix jacchus) injected intracerebrally 6 - 7 years earlier with brain tissue {{from a patient}} with early onset Alzheimer's disease were found to contain moderate numbers of amyloid plaques with associated argyrophilic dystrophic neurites and cerebral amyloid angiopathy but no neurofibrillary tangles. The plaques and vascular amyloid stained positively with antibodies to beta (A 4) -protein. The brains of three age-matched control marmosets from the same colony did not show these neuropathological features. The brain of one of two marmosets injected with brain tissue from a patient with prion disease with concomitant beta-amyloid plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy also showed beta-amyloid plaques and angiopathy but no spongiform encephalopathy. An occasional plaque {{was found in the}} brains of two of four marmosets injected with brain tissue from three elderly patients with age-related pathology, two of whom had an additional diagnosis of possible prion disease. Neither plaques nor cerebral amyloid angiopathy were found in six other marmosets who were older than the injected animals, in 12 further marmosets who were slightly younger but who had been injected several years previously with brain tissue which did not contain beta-amyloid, or in 10 younger marmosets who had been subjected to various neurosurgical procedures. These results suggest that cerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> may be induced by the introduction of exogenous amyloid beta-protein...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analysed}} the axonal sorting {{signals of}} {{amyloid precursor protein}} (APP). Wild-type and mutant versions of human APP were expressed in hippocampal neurons using the Semliki forest virus system. We show that wild-type APP and mutations implicated in Alzheimer's disease and another brain <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> are sorted to the axon. By analysis of deletion mutants {{we found that the}} membrane-inserted APP ectodomain but not the cytoplasmic tail is required for axonal sorting. Systematic deletions of the APP ectodomain identified two regions required for axonal delivery: one encoded by exons 11 - 15 in the carbohydrate domain, the other encoded by exons 16 - 17 in the juxtamembraneous beta-amyloid domain. Treatment of the cells with the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin induced missorting of wild-type APP, supporting the importance of glycosylation in axonal sorting of APP. The data revealed a hierarchy of sorting signals on APP: the beta-amyloid-dependent membrane proximal signal was the major contributor to axonal sorting, while N-glycosylation had a weaker effect. Furthermore, recessive somatodendritic signals, most likely in the cytoplasmic tail, directed the protein to the dendrites when the ectodomain was deleted. Analysis of detergent solubility of APP and another axonally delivered protein, hemagglutinin, demonstrated that only hemagglutinin formed CHAPS-insoluble complexes, suggesting distinct mechanisms of axonal sorting for these two proteins. This study is the first delineation of sorting requirements of an axonally targeted protein in polarized neurons and indicates that the beta-amyloid domain {{plays a major role in}} axonal delivery of APP. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The drastic loss of {{cholinergic}} projection neurons in the {{basal forebrain}} is {{a hallmark of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD), and drugs most frequently applied {{for the treatment of}} dementia include inhibitors of the acetylcholine-degrading enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This protein is known to act as a ligand of beta-amyloid (A(beta)) in senile plaques, a further neuropathological sign of AD. Recently, we have shown that the fluorescent, heterodimeric AChE inhibitor PE 154 allows for the histochemical staining of cortical A beta plaques in triple-transgenic (TTG) mice with age-dependent <b>beta-amyloidosis</b> and tau hyperphosphorylation, an established animal model for aspects of AD. In the present study, we have primarily demonstrated the targeting of A beta-immunopositive plaques with PE 154 in vivo for 4 h up to 1 week after injection into the hippocampi of 13 - 20 -month-old TTG mice. Numerous plaques, double-stained for PE 154 and A(beta) -immunoreactivity, were revealed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Additionally, PE 154 targeted hippocampal A(beta) deposits in aged TTG mice after injection of carboxylated polyglycidylmethacrylate nanoparticles delivering the fluorescent marker in vivo. Furthermore, biodegradable core-shell polystyrene/polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles were found to be suitable, alternative vehicles for PE 154 as a useful in vivo label of A(beta). Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that PE 154 targeted A(beta), but neither phospho-tau nor reactive astrocytes surrounding the plaques. In conclusion, nanoparticles appear as versatile carriers of AChE inhibitors and other promising drugs for the treatment of AD...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCerebral <b>beta-amyloidosis,</b> {{one of the}} {{pathological}} {{hallmarks of}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD), elicits a well-characterised, microglia-mediated local innate immune response. In contrast, {{it is not clear}} whether cells of the adaptive immune system, in particular T-cells, react to cerebral amyloidosis in AD. Even though parenchymal T-cells have been described in post-mortem brains of AD patients, it is not known whether infiltrating T-cells are specifically recruited to the extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid, and whether they are locally activated into proliferating, effector cells upon interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). To address these issues we have analysed by confocal microscopy and flow-cytometry the localisation and activation status of both T-cells and APCs in transgenic (tg) mice models of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis. Increased numbers of infiltrating T-cells were found in amyloid-burdened brain regions of tg mice, with concomitant up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1, compared to non-tg littermates. The infiltrating T-cells in tg brains did not co-localise with amyloid plaques, produced less interferon-gamma than those in controls and did not proliferate locally. Bona-fide dendritic cells were virtually absent from the brain parenchyma of both non-tg and tg mice, and APCs from tg brains showed an immature phenotype, with accumulation of MHC-II in intracellular compartments. These results indicate that cerebral amyloidosis promotes T-cell infiltration but interferes with local antigen presentation and T-cell activation. The inability of the brain immune surveillance to orchestrate a protective immune response to amyloid-beta peptide might contribute to the accumulation of amyloid in the progression of the disease...|$|E

40|$|Different {{types of}} amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) -containing plaques occur in brains of Alzheimerrsquos disease (AD) patients. Diffuse plaques seen during {{early stages of}} AD differ from neuritic plaques in later stages both {{with respect to the}} length of the Abeta {{peptides}} and the presence of other proteins, e. g., apolipoprotein-E (apoE). Since apoE is involved in Abeta transport and clearance, and the epsi 4 -allele of the apolipoprotein-E gene (APOE) is a major risk factor for sporadic AD, it is plausible to speculate that apoE plays a pathophysiological role in the initiation of Abeta deposition. To address the issue of whether binding of apoE to Abeta is involved in initial Abeta deposition, we studied the human medial temporal lobe of 60 autopsy cases encompassing the full spectrum of AD-related pathology. In temporal lobe regions, which become involved {{for the first time at}} a given stage of <b>beta-amyloidosis,</b> all plaques represent newly formed plaques, and these were studied with immunohistochemical methods. ApoE was present in 36 cases, and was frequently co-localized with newly formed Abeta deposits detectable with anti-Abeta 42 but not with antibodies raised against N-terminal epitopes of Abeta. In 10 additional cases, immunoreactivity against apoE was completely lacking in newly formed plaques, which, at the same time, displayed immunoreactivity against N-terminal epitopes of Abeta. The failure of N-terminal epitopes of Abeta to co-localize with apoE in newly formed plaques indicates that these deposits presumably contain apoE-Abeta complexes, in which the N-terminal epitopes of Abeta are often concealed after complexing with apoE, thus preventing subsequent binding of antibodies. Moreover, apoE-positive newly formed plaques were seen more frequently in APOE epsi 4 / 4 cases than in non-APOE epsi 4 / 4 individuals, thereby underlining the potentially crucial role of apoE for the development of Abeta deposits...|$|E
40|$|The {{filamentous}} brain lesions {{that define}} Alzheimer disease (AD) consist of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Undulated pathological filaments [...] curly fibers or neuropil threads [...] also {{occur in the}} neuropil. Beta-amyloid precursor proteins are synthesized by many cells outside {{the central nervous system}} and recently, deposition of beta-amyloid-protein was reported to occur in non-neuronal tissues. In addition, increasing data claim the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD. These observations suggest that AD may be a widespread systemic disorder. Here we report that pathological argyrophilic filaments with histochemical properties of amyloid showing striking morphological similarity to curly fibers and/or tangles accumulate not only in ependymal layer and in epithelial cells of choroid plexus, but also in several other organs (e. g. liver, pancreas, ovary, testis, thyroid) in AD. The ependyma, choroid plexus, and various organs of 39 autopsy cases were analyzed. In search of curly fiber and tangle-like changes in organs other than brain, 395 blocks from 21 different tissues of 24 AD cases, 5 cases with discrete or moderate AD-type changes, and 10 control cases were investigated. We found in non-neuronal cells "curly fibers" or "tangles" immunoreactive with antibodies to P component, Tau-protein, ubiquitin, fibronectin, and Apolipoprotein-E, but lacking immunoreactivity with antibodies to neurofilament proteins. Ultrastructurally they consist of densely packed straight and paired helical filaments and closely resemble neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. These observations indicate that the formation of "curly fibers" and "tangles" is not unique to the central nervous system. The results suggest that AD might be a systemic disorder or that similar fibrillary changes to tangles and curly fibers may also be associated with other amyloidosis than <b>beta-amyloidosis.</b> Further investigations are necessary to understand the pathogenetic interest of these fibrillary changes outside the CNS...|$|E
40|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is heavily}} affected by progressive neurodegeneration and beta-amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus {{is also one}} of the few brain regions that generate new neurons throughout adulthood. Because hippocampal neurogenesis is regulated by both endogenous and environmental factors, we determined whether it benefits from therapeutic reduction of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) -related toxicity induced by passive A beta immunotherapy. A beta immunotherapy of 8 - 9 -month-old mice expressing familial AD-causing mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin- 1 genes with an antibody against A beta decreased compact beta-amyloid plaque burden and promoted survival of newly born neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. As these neurons matured, they exhibited longer dendrites with more complex arborization compared with newly born neurons in control-treated transgenic littermates. The newly born neurons showed signs of functional integration indicated by expression of the immediate-early gene Zif 268 in response to exposure to a novel object. A beta immunotherapy was associated with higher numbers of synaptophysin-positive synaptic boutons. Labeling dividing progenitor cells with a retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that A beta immunotherapy restored the impaired dendritic branching, as well as the density of dendritic spines in new mature neurons. The presence of cellular prion protein (PrPc) on the dendrites of the GFP(+) newly born neurons is compatible with a putative role of PrPc in mediating A beta-related toxicity in these cells. In addition, passive A beta immunotherapy was accompanied by increased angiogenesis. Our data establish that passive A beta immunotherapy can restore the morphological maturation of the newly formed neurons in the adult hippocampus and promote angiogenesis. These findings provide evidence for a role of A beta immunotherapy in stimulating neurogenesis and angiogenesis in transgenic mouse models of AD, and they suggest the possibility that A beta immunotherapy can recover neuronal and vascular functions in brains with <b>beta-amyloidosis...</b>|$|E
