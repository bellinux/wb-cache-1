5|$|In {{addition}} to Lee, the police arrested {{a friend of}} Phagan's for the crime. Gradually, the police became convinced that these were not the culprits.

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E

5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E

The <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> her nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it.
