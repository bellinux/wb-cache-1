50|$|In {{heavy-duty}} applications, such as screw jacks, {{a square}} thread or <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> is used, {{because it has}} the lowest friction and wear.|$|E
50|$|In {{oil field}} tubing, <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> is a {{pipe thread form}} {{designed}} to provide a tight hydraulic seal. The thread form {{is similar to that of}} Acme threadthe force is transmitted almost parallel to the axis and thread is about the same strength as standard v threads.|$|E
50|$|The image gallery below {{shows some}} {{of the types of}} <b>buttress</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Buttress</b> <b>threads</b> {{have often}} {{been used in the}} {{construction}} of artillery, particularly with the screw-type breechblock. They are also often used in vises, because great force is only required in one direction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buttress</b> <b>threads</b> {{are of a}} {{triangular}} shape. These are used where the load force on the screw is only applied in one direction. They are as efficient as square threads in these applications, but are easier to manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|... (f) <b>Buttress</b> <b>thread</b> - This {{is used in}} high-load {{applications}} in which the load force is applied in only one direction, such as screw jacks. [...] With a 0° angle of the bearing surface it is as efficient as the square thread but stronger and easier to manufacture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> form, {{also known}} as the breech-lock thread form, refers to two {{different}} thread profiles. One is a type of leadscrew and the other is a type of hydraulic sealing thread form. The leadscrew type is often used in machinery and the sealing type is often used in oil fields.|$|E
50|$|In machinery, the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> form is {{designed}} to handle extremely high axial thrust in one direction. The load-bearing thread face is perpendicular to the screw axis. or at a slight slant (usually no greater than 7°) The other face is slanted, often at 45°. The resulting thread form has the same low friction properties as a square thread form but at about twice the shear strength due to the long thread base. This thread form also is easy to machine on a thread milling machine, unlike the difficult to machine square thread form. It can also compensate for nut wear using a split nut, much like the Acme thread form.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{triangular}} threadforms {{are based}} on an isosceles triangle. These are usually called V-threads or vee-threads because of {{the shape of the}} letter V. For 60° V-threads, the isosceles triangle is, more specifically, equilateral. For <b>buttress</b> <b>threads,</b> the triangle is [...]|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} mean Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement factor characteristics in a circular tube with different types of internal threads of 120 mm pitch under uniform wall heat flux boundary conditions. In the experiments, measured data are taken at Reynolds number in range of 7, 000 to 14, 000 with air as the test fluid. The experiments were conducted on circular tube with three different types of internal <b>threads</b> viz. acme, <b>buttress</b> and knuckle <b>threads</b> of constant pitch. The heat transfer and friction factor data obtained is compared with the data obtained from a plain circular tube under similar geometric and flow conditions. The variations of heat transfer and pressure loss {{in the form of}} Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f) respectively is determined and depicted graphically. It is observed that at all Reynolds number, the Nusselt number and thermal performance increases for a circular tube with <b>buttress</b> <b>threads</b> as compared with a circular tube with acme and knuckle threads. These are because of increase in strength and intensity of vortices ejected from the <b>buttress</b> <b>threads.</b> Subsequently an empirical correlation is also formulated to match with experimental results with ± 8 % and ± 9 %, variation respectively for Nusselt number and friction factor.

50|$|Threaded Coupling {{interconnect}} mating designs use a {{threaded nut}} on the plug, and a corresponding set of threads on the receptacle,to mate {{the pair of}} components. The coupling nut is usually equipped with flats or knurling for easy assembly. Different thread types, profiles andgeometries provide different functionality. <b>Buttress</b> <b>Threads,</b> for example, are often specified on plastic connectors due to their enhanced tensile strength.The MIL-C-38999 connector incorporates a triple-start threaded coupling mechanism for greater vibration protection and faster mating and unmating.|$|R
50|$|The jack is {{rigid and}} robust. The upright column is {{fabricated}} and welded to the cast steel Gear Box. The elevating screw {{is provided with}} <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> supported with single-acting thrust ball-bearing having a spherical seating {{at the top and}} self-aligning ball-bearing at the bottom. This imparts self-aligning properties to the screw under loaded condition. The elevating screw is under tension when loaded and hence there is no chance of distortion due to buckling.While lifting the load, the Jack rests firmly on its base. For movement from one place to another, the lifting carriage is to be lowered by pressing the yoke which lifts the base and the Jack rests on the three wheels with a ground clearance of 20 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The torque {{required}} to lift or lower a load {{can be calculated}} by [...] "unwrapping" [...] one revolution of a thread. This is most easily described for a square or <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> as the thread angle is 0 and has no bearing on the calculations. The unwrapped thread forms a right angle triangle where the base is [...] long and the height is the lead (pictured to the right). The force of the load is directed downward, the normal force is perpendicular to the hypotenuse of the triangle, the frictional force is directed {{in the opposite direction}} of the direction of motion (perpendicular to the normal force or along the hypotenuse), and an imaginary [...] "effort" [...] force is acting horizontally in the direction opposite the direction of the frictional force.

The design conception of <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> casing {{comes from the}} {{offshore drilling}}’s demands {{and this kind of}} casing is mainly used as surface casing. This paper has taken material mechanical experiment, numerical simulation analysis and field test, the research results show that the various parameters of <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> casing fully complies with the drilling design requirements and the offshore oilfield production demands. This product can reduce drilling cost effectively, improve working efficiency and safety, and realize manufacture domestically. Meanwhile, the development of this project will fill the blank of the ERW (Electrical Resistance Weld) casing in CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Corporation), and have a broad prospect of application...|$|E
50|$|A {{screw jack}} {{consists}} of a heavy-duty vertical screw with a load table mounted on its top, which screws into a threaded hole in a stationary support frame with a wide base resting on the ground. A rotating collar {{on the head of}} the screw has holes into which the handle, a metal bar, fits. When the handle is turned clockwise, the screw moves further out of the base, lifting the load resting on the load table. In order to support large load forces, the screw usually has either square <b>threads</b> or <b>buttress</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
40|$|Threaded and coupled {{connections}} generally {{present a}} non-uniform stress distribution, which {{is related to}} the higher stiffness of the box when compared to the pin. The non-uniform stress distribution can contribute to fatigue cracks and other failure modes in high pressure oil wells. An API 5 CT P 110 steel obtained from a seamless pipe was mechanically characterized. FEA models were carried out to investigate and compare two API casing connections under make-up torque and tensile efforts. A parametric study was performed using numerical models to determine the influence of some geometric features on the behavior of the API <b>Buttress</b> <b>threaded</b> connection. The API Buttress connection supported higher tensile loads than the API Short Round, however both standard connections showed high stress concentration in the last engaged thread and a non-uniform stress distribution. The manufacturing of grooves at the first and the last engaged threads proved to be an efficient way to reduce the stress concentration of Buttress casing connection and could be an alternative to the development of new products...|$|R
40|$|Background/purposeStable osseointegration between implant threads and the {{surrounding}} marginal bone provides the mechanical base of an implant for daily chewing activity. The contact area of implant-bone interfaces and the concentrated stresses on the marginal bones are principal concerns of implant designers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of thread shape and taper on the initial stability of the implant-bone structure. Materials and methodsThe thread design was parameterized by shape and taper. Thread shapes included symmetrical, square, and <b>buttressed.</b> <b>Thread</b> tapers were divided into cylindrical and conical profiles. Nine variations of the thread design were developed to numerically evaluate their geometric and mechanical effects on the marginal bone. ResultsAmong the three thread shapes with the same pitch, the contact area of the square thread was the highest. Among all implant models, it was found that the site with the greatest stress in {{the surrounding}} jaw bone was consistently concentrated at the root radii of the first thread. The maximal stress of the square thread was the least. For the same thread shape and taper, a finer pitch resulted in a remarkable increase in the contact area and a decrease in the peak stress. The contact areas and peak stresses of the conical and cylindrical implants were nearly equal. ConclusionTaking wall thickness and stress concentrations into consideration, the square thread with a 0. 60 -mm pitch possessed the optimal contact area and stress values compared to the others...|$|R
40|$|The screw stress {{concentration}} for six nut-bolt connections embodying three different thread profiles and two nut shapes is measured photoelastically. Buttress (nearly zero flank angle), trapezoidal (15 -deg flank angle), and triangular (30 -deg flank angle) thread forms are examined {{in combination with}} standard and lip-type nuts. The effect of the thread profile on the screw {{stress concentration}} appears to be dependent upon the kind of nut considered. If the fastening incorporates a standard nut, the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> is stronger than the triangular one, which, in turn, behaves better than the trapezoidal contour. The improvement is roughly a 20 -percent reduction in the stress concentration factor from the trapezoidal to the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread.</b> In the case of lip nut, conversely, this tendency is somewhat reversed, with the trapezoidal thread performing slightly (but not decidedly) {{better than the other}} two shapes. Finally, averaged over all three thread forms, the lip nut exhibits a stress concentration factor which is about 50 percent lower than that of the standard nut...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Success {{of dental}} implant {{treatment}} depends on number of patient related and procedure dependent parameters. Various {{studies have shown}} that bone quality and implant design are two important factors in the success of dental implant treatment. Today, many implant systems are coming up with variable thread patterns. There is not much literature available on the effects of such variable thread patterns within different bone densities. Aim: The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of two different implant thread patterns in two different bone densities using three dimensional finite element analyses. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional finite element model of a mandibular section of bone and an implant was developed. 4. 2 x 12 mm screw type dental implants with two different thread designs (<b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> design and variable thread design) and a metal ceramic crown using Co-Cr and feldspathic porcelain were modelled. The model was developed with finite element software and two types of bone qualities were prepared (D 2 and D 4). A load of 450 N was applied in a vertical direction and in an oblique direction to the central fossa, buccal cusp and distal fossa of the mandibular first molar crown. Results: For the variable thread design, von Mises stresses developed within bone were 109. 89 MPa and 257. 46 MPa for vertical and oblique loading respectively, in D 2 type of bone. While in D 4, the stresses were 243. 91 MPa and 371. 81 MPa for vertical and oblique loading respectively. Similarly, for <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> design, stresses were 113. 51 MPa and 176. 14 MPa for vertical and oblique loading respectively in D 2 type of bone; while in D 4 type of bone the stresses were 290. 99 MPa and 481. 27 MPa respectively within the bone. Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} showed that the von Mises stresses were more in D 4 type of bone as compared to D 2 type of bone for both, the variable and <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> designs. The study also compared the two thread designs. Less stresses were seen with the variable thread pattern than in the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> pattern particularly in D 4 type of bone...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Clinical {{success of}} implant {{prosthodontics}} is dependent in part upon {{the type of}} implant thread design. The selection of implant thread design {{plays an important role}} in the outcome of the treatment. This study was undertaken to evaluate the pattern of stress distribution using a finite element analysis; hence, the area which would be bearing maximum load for a given design would be arrived. Materials and Methods: Three implants with different thread designs, namely V-thread, buttress, and reverse <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> designs were considered and dimensions were standardized. The site considered was the mandibular molar region with cortical and trabecular bone assuming to be isotropic and homogeneous. The implant modeling was done with the CATIA software. Vertical loads of 100 N were applied. The stresses were calculated as Von Mises stress criterion. Results: Maximum stresses were seen at the cortical bone and were transferred to the implant. Minimum Von Mises stresses were seen with reverse <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> design at the cortical bone. The stresses were observed least at the cancellous bone and maximum at the implant. Conclusion: Hence, within the limitations of this study the results obtained can be applied clinically for appropriate selection of implant thread design for a predictable success of implant therapy...|$|E
40|$|When {{the thermal}} {{stresses}} induced in a geothermal well’s casing string exceed the yield {{strength of the}} casing material, the fatigue behavior of the latter {{can be defined as}} low cycle fatigue (LCF). The connection threads in the casing body amplify the local stress distribution and lower LCF resistance. A theoretical approach is presented to evaluate LCF resistance and compared with preliminary results from experiments on a large diameter buttress connection. The latter is commonly used in geothermal well completions. This paper shows that, under extreme loads, the LCF resistance of the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> connection can be as low as 10 cycles...|$|E

30|$|The {{external}} morphology of {{the dental}} implant {{is a factor}} {{which leads to the}} mechanical engagement of the implant with the bone. Three-thread-design dental implants consist of three different thread designs. The first design is the micro-thread, or supra-fine thread, which is on the coronal third of the implant fixture and is attached to the cortical bone. These small, fine threads are designed for force distribution, an increase in the bone-implant contact area and a decrease in the force concentration at the abutment-implant connection area. The second design is the reverse <b>buttress</b> <b>thread,</b> which is on the middle third of the implant fixture. This design increases the retention between the implant and spongy bone and produces resistance to compressive force. The third design, the condensed thread, is located at the apical third of the implant fixture. The thinness {{at the beginning of this}} thread and an increase in thickness along the implant fixture are designed for the soft spongy bone condensability [2].|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of variations in thread shape on the axial pullout strength of orthodontic miniscrews. Methods: A total of 35 miniscrews, 7 of each design being considered, were tested by performing pullout tests on a synthetic bone support. We used self-tapping and self-drilling miniscrews having a diameter of 2 mm and a thread shaft length of 12 mm (the longest and the largest supplied by the manufacturer). A buttress reverse thread shape served as the control design and was tested against 4 experimental designs, each manufactured with a modification in thread shape while maintaining all other characteristics. The experimental groups had the following thread designs: buttress, 75 ° joint profile, rounded, and trapezoidal. Results: The control group with a buttress reverse thread shape had consistently higher pullout strength values than did the other designs. A statistically significant reduction in pullout force was found between the buttress reverse and the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> miniscrews. Conclusions: Thread design influenced the resistance to pullout of the orthodontic miniscrews. The buttress reverse thread shape provided the greatest pullout strength. © 2012 by the American Association of Orthodontists...|$|E
40|$|The {{finite element}} models of contact {{problems}} about connectors of buttress and round threads of casing were established with the elasto-plastic FEM of ANSYS software. Under the three flank angles 30, 50 and 100 for the buttress casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. With the three tapers 1 / 14, 1 / 16 and 1 / 17, for the round casing connector, the curves that the jump-out loads varied with the loading process were obtained. At the same time, the jump-out process of the buttress and round thread connectors was studied, respectively. The average jump-out force of the buttress connector is 594. 1 ton, and however, the average jump-out force of the round connector is 342. 5 ton. That is to say, under the same casing and the same casing size, the connector of the <b>buttress</b> <b>thread</b> {{is not so easy}} to jump out, but the connector of the round thread is very easy to jump out. It provides the theoretical supports for the selection of the casing connectors in the extra-deep well and complex well...|$|E

In addition, the effect of external axial and pressure loading is examined to identify the effects and critical areas. As a result, it is observed that pressure loading and make-up tend to have similar effects and {{in order to determine the}} optimal make-up torque, the pressure ratings of the assembly should be taken into account to prevent overtorqueing the connection. For the case of axial loading, a critical zone is visible near the last engaged thread and excessive loading of this thread can cause premature failure within this zone.
