5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|The Karashishi is {{most notably}} found in Japan at the {{entrance}} of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward-off bad spirits or welcome good spirits. The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum of a young boy. Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

25|$|The last chord is the {{dominant}} (V) turnaround, marking {{the transition to the}} beginning of the next progression. The lyrics generally end on the last <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tenth bar or the first <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11th bar, and the final two bars are given to the instrumentalist as a break; the harmony of this two-bar break, the turnaround, can be extremely complex, sometimes consisting of single notes that defy analysis in terms of chords.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn eye fundus is an {{only part}} where a blood vessel can be {{observed}} directly from <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human body. An elasticity of a blood vessel on an eye fundus is lost according as <b>the</b> progression <b>of</b> arteriosclerosis. <b>The</b> elasticity can be evaluated by observing <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood vessel. We propose in this paper a method <b>of</b> a <b>beat</b> detection <b>of</b> blood vessel from SLO (Scanning Laser Opthalmoscope) eye fundus moving image. The proposed method consists of a blur correction and a vessel diameter evaluation. In <b>the</b> experiments, <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood vessel has been successfully detected from the SLO moving image...|$|R
25|$|Kalpanaswaras have a {{somewhat}} predictable rhythmical structure; the swaras are sung {{to end on}} the samam (the first <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhythmical cycle).

50|$|Generally, {{the bass}} drum {{provides}} a steady pulse, {{playing on the}} downbeat and on <b>the</b> strong <b>beats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bar, and the tenors support that pulse, often adding supporting beats, accents and dynamic interest.|$|R
50|$|Bararean {{marriage}} {{also has}} some complex procedures that must be followed with accuracy to disallow humiliation.

25|$|Pair sticks, {{sometimes}} called clapsticks or bilma, establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies. The {{rhythm of the}} didgeridoo and the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clapsticks are precise, and these patterns have been handed down for many generations. In the Wangga genre, the song-man starts with vocals and then introduces blima {{to the accompaniment of}} didgeridoo.|$|E
25|$|The excerpt below, bars 7–12 of J. S. Bach's Fugue no. 2 in C minor, BWV 847, {{from the}} Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} most of the characteristics described above. The fugue is for keyboard and in three voices, with regular countersubjects. This excerpt opens at last entry of the exposition: the subject is sounding in the bass, the first countersubject in the treble, while the middle-voice is stating a second version of the second countersubject, which concludes with the characteristic rhythm of the subject, and is always used together with the first version of the second countersubject. Following this an episode modulates from the tonic to the relative major by means of sequence, {{in the form of an}} accompanied canon at the fourth. Arrival in E-flat major is marked by a quasi perfect cadence across the barline, from the last quarter note <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first bar to the first <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second bar in the second system, and the first middle entry. Here Bach has altered countersubject 2 to accommodate the change of mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{of music in}} the Royal Marines is inextricably linked with the evolution of British military bands. Lively airs and the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drum enabled columns of marching men to keep a regular step. The drum was the normal method of giving signals on the battlefield or in camp. As long ago as the days of Drake and Hawkins the drummer's rhythm would advertise the changing watches or beat the men to quarters.|$|E
50|$|A {{pacemaker}} (or artificial pacemaker, {{so as not}} to {{be confused}} with the heart's natural pacemaker) is a medical device which uses electrical impulses, delivered by electrodes contracting the heart muscles, to regulate <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart.|$|R
50|$|Although modern {{surveying}} techniques {{make the}} ceremony obsolete, {{at least for}} its secular purpose, many English parishes carry out a regular <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bounds, as a way <b>of</b> strengthening <b>the</b> community and giving it a sense of place.|$|R

25|$|The {{melodic line}} of the morna varies a lot through the song, with {{ascending}} and descending note sequences, and within a bar the notes generally {{do not have the}} same length. One frequent characteristic of the morna is the syncopation, more precisely, one note at the end of a bar is extended to the strong <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next bar. The melody is accentuated on the first beat and the last half-beat of the bar.|$|E
25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|E
25|$|After {{singing the}} opening kriti, usually, the {{performer}} sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The performer must improvise {{a string of}} swaras in any octave {{according to the rules}} of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses or lapses in the <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.|$|E
50|$|Although {{corporal}} punishment {{is no longer}} practised, for a while the school displayed the old canes in the Great Hall and the Head Master's study. These canes, along with special whips, were used in <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bounds celebration.|$|R
2500|$|The Statesman [...] writes [...] "Durga Puja {{does not}} assume the festive aura without <b>the</b> maddening <b>beats</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dhak, the large drum that men hang {{around their necks}} and play with two thin sticks to infuse the frenzied rhythm into listeners. Those enchanting beats are enough to conjure up the sights and smells of Durga Puja." ...|$|R
