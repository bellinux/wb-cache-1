They commented on the example of Élizabeth Teissier, who claimed that, [...] "The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year," [...] as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>claims</b> that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, [...] "There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years," [...] and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.|$|E

In 1964, with Wohlforth laying the evidentiary <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>claims</b> of [...] "party disloyalty" [...] against Robertson, the tendency was expelled from the party.

5000|$|This book {{claims that}} {{consciousness}} {{can be considered}} separately from the brain, which provides a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>claims</b> of reincarnation. Tucker discusses objections to reincarnation: the paucity of persons who actually claim to remember a past life, the fragility of memories, the population explosion, the mind—body problem, fraud, and others. Tucker states {{that none of the}} cases examined are perfect, and that [...] "faulty memory by informants" [...] is seen to be the [...] "best normal explanation for many of the cases" [...] reviewed in the book. The version of reincarnation discussed is typically incompatible with common religious beliefs around reincarnation, specifically in relation to karma.|$|E
50|$|Classically, immobility in {{the second}} test has been {{interpreted}} as a behavioral correlate of negative mood, representing a kind of hopelessness in the animal. Rodents given antidepressants swim harder and longer than controls (which forms the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>claims</b> of the test's validity). However, there is some debate between scientists whether increased immobility instead demonstrates learning or habituation, and would therefore be a positive behavioral adaptation: the animal is less fearful because it is now familiar with {{the environment of the}} test. This interpretation is supported by the fact that even rats who are first put into a container from which they can escape (and therefore do not experience despair) show reduced mobility {{in the second}} test.|$|E
5000|$|Within the SWP, {{some members}} who had studied {{the meaning of the}} 1953 split opposed the reunification. These were {{gathered}} around Tim Wohlforth and James Robertson in the Revolutionary Tendency. They echoed the SWPs Open Letter, arguing that the leaders' turn to Pabloism coincided with the introduction of Stalinist ideas, followed by an expulsion of those members who exposed the leadership's lack of principles. The SWP had supported the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro. However, Robertson's followers embarrassed Wohlforth and the SLL by suggesting that the SWP could not be saved. With Wohlforth laying the evidentiary <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>claims</b> of [...] "party disloyalty" [...] the RT leaders were expelled from the party, forming Spartacist.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} Israelis and Jews regard the East Bank of the Jordan river (which is today the Kingdom of Jordan) as the eastern {{parts of the}} Land of Israel (following the revisionist idea) because, {{according}} to the Bible, the Israelite tribes of Menasseh, Gad, and Reuben settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and because that area was designated a Jewish national home by the League of Nations in the Mandate for Palestine based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land.

For example, if they view children as helpless and unable to understand, adults tend to interact with children less than if they believe that children are capable of learning and understanding. Often, cultures lacking a form of CDS make up for it in other ways, such as involving the children more in everyday activities, though the reverse might also be a valid assessment.|$|E
