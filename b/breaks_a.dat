40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the use of}} Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to attack the {{classical}} ciphers. We use frequency analysis as our basic tool. First we investigate the MCMC algorithm to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> simple substitution cipher. Then the algorithm is modified to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> simple transposition cipher. Our results on the transposition cipher are better than the existing methods such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithm and tabu search. We also extend the algorithms to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> simple substitution-transposition cipher up to key length 40. ...|$|R
5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the air}} and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of the}} French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|In P. fimbriata from Queensland and in {{some other}} species, {{contests}} between males usually last only 5 to 10seconds, and only their legs make contact. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and in P. fimbriata from Queensland these often including grappling that sometimes <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> leg. A victor may evict a loser, and then eat the loser's eggs and take over the loser's web. Unlike in some other Portia species, victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losers.|$|E

5|$|During {{a festival}} honoring Spider-Man, Peter kisses Gwen Stacy, infuriating Mary Jane. The superpowered Marko robs an armored car, and Peter confronts him. Marko easily subdues Peter, and escapes. NYPD Captain George Stacy informs Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's true killer; the {{deceased}} Dennis Carradine was Marko's accomplice. While a vengeance-obsessed Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit, the symbiote assimilates his suit. Peter later awakens and discovers his costume changed and his powers enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out Peter's dark side. Wearing the new suit, Peter locates Marko and battles {{him in a}} subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Peter <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> water pipe, causing water to reduce Marko into mud, washing him away and believing him to be dead.|$|E
5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short side where he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle <b>breaks,</b> <b>a</b> try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E

5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the stage floor. Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial <b>breaks.</b> <b>A</b> gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand <b>breaks.</b> <b>A</b> typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E

5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E
