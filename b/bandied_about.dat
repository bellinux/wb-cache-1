5|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{who worked}} with {{numerous}} Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been <b>bandied</b> <b>about</b> among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in The Guardian in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.|$|E

In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco. She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem. Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100-point run, [...] "without a miss she smiled and bowed to the applauding crowd, stepping away from the spotlight, and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage." [...] Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister, Noriko, where she said she planned to live out her days. Katsura died in 1995.

500|$|Resonance of Fate {{was first}} hinted at prior to April 2009, then {{announced}} as an untitled [...] "mystery" [...] RPG {{at the beginning}} of the month. According to Shimano, its codename [...] "Project Cobra" [...] had been <b>bandied</b> <b>about</b> prior to the reveal, but no-one had suspected anything about its true nature. Its official Japanese title, along with details such as tri-Ace's partnership with Sega, were unveiled on April 8, 2009. Resonance of Fate marked the first collaboration between tri-Ace and Sega—most of tri-Ace's previous games had been published by Square Enix. The reason for the choice was two-fold: tri-Ace wanted a different publisher due to the radical nature of their new game, and Sega wanted a title to break into the RPG market. As Resonance of Fate seemed unique enough to stand out in the market, Sega agreed to take up publishing duties. According to staff, the Japanese title was originally going to be either Resonance of Fate or Resonance of Time, but Sega asked it to be changed to End of Eternity. This fell in line with a trend among many Japanese games of referencing endings in their titles. It was officially announced for a Western release in May 2009. The game debuted in Japan on January 28, 2010 with a March release in North America and PAL regions. The European version came with text localization in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.|$|E
500|$|The idea {{of private}} {{nuisance}} has been criticised by academics {{for at least}} 50 years. Criticism centres on the free rein given to the judiciary {{and the lack of}} concrete definitions for legal principles; the idea of [...] "reasonableness", for examples, is frequently <b>bandied</b> <b>about,</b> but [...] "rarely examined in detail, {{and it would be a}} brave person who would attempt to draw out a definition". While a definition for private nuisance is easy to find, the regularly accepted one does not consider that most private nuisance cases involve two occupiers of land; the [...] "nuisance" [...] has moved from the defendant's land to the claimant's land. Some judicial rationes decidendi, such as that of Lord Wright in Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan, seem to indicate that private nuisance is only valid in situations where there are two occupiers of land. Despite this, definitions of private nuisance fail to include any reference. Academics also assert that the tort of private nuisance has [...] "lost its separate identity as a strict liability tort and been assimilated in all but name into the fault-based tort of negligence". Conor Gearty supports the assertion that private nuisance is confused, and also claims that private nuisance is significantly different from public nuisance; [...] "they have little in common except the accident of sharing the same name... Private nuisance has, if anything, become even more confused and confusing. Its chapter lies neglected in the standard works, little changed over the years, its modest message overwhelmed by the excitements to be found elsewhere in tort. Any sense of direction which may have existed in the old days is long gone".|$|E

These charges rest on the premise that terms have specific correct usages that correspond with Slaney and Maraun’s sense of everyday linguistic practice. I challenge this premise.

Chancellor George Osborne said that the increased spending on ESA would bring substantial benefits to the UK adding that the private sector had already identified projects worth up to £1bn that “will flow” from the investment.

2500|$|Many other {{film critics}} <b>bandied</b> <b>about</b> {{the term in}} their reviews prior to the 2010s but seldom {{in a way that}} gave the social thriller its own status as a codified genre in cinema. Prior to 2017, most writers used the term only once, in a single review, and to {{characterize}} an individual film. In his biography on William Wyler, Axel Madsen calls the 1937 Humphrey Bogart picture Dead End a social thriller. TLA Video reviewer David Bleiler described the 1950 Sidney Poitier film No Way Out as [...] "an exceptionally made, tense drama which succeeds both as medical soap opera and social thriller." [...] Douglas Brode called Spencer Tracy [...] "the alienated anti-hero of the social thriller" [...] for his 1955 performance in Bad Day at Black Rock. Another Poitier film, 1967's [...] In the Heat of the Night, got tagged as social thriller by Leonard Maltin. Both Tracy and Poitier also appeared in 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a film that would later be identified as a key [...] "non-thriller" [...] example of the social thriller genre.|$|E

[...] "When the government {{was asked by the}} court what the words 'substantially supported' mean, it was unable to provide a definition; the same was true for 'directly supported,'" [...] she wrote in her order, which makes the preliminary injunction permanent. [...] "There can be no doubt, then, these terms are vague." [...] That vagueness does not put citizens on notice, in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, she ruled. A key question throughout these proceedings has been..precisely what the statute means—what and whose activities it is meant to cover. That is no small question <b>bandied</b> <b>about</b> amongst lawyers and a judge steeped in arcane questions of constitutional law; {{it is a question of}} defining an individual's core liberties. The due process rights {{guaranteed by the}} Fifth Amendment require that an individual understand what conduct might subject him or her to criminal or civil penalties. Here, the stakes get no higher: indefinite military detention—potential detention during a war on terrorism that is not expected to end in the foreseeable future, if ever. The Constitution requires specificity—and that specificity is absent from Section 1021(b)(2). Understanding the scope of Section 1021(b)(2) requires defining key terms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{employment}} of the disenfranchised female as visual icon within {{the art world}} {{is a fact that}} feminist critics have diagnosed, as the avant-garde's testing of cultural limits, where the female body, as symptomatic of a visual regime where [...] "Woman" [...] serves as [...] "the very ground of representation, both object and support of a desire which, intimately bound up with power and creativity, is the moving force of culture and history." [...] The ability of male artists to form new expressive modes of representation filled with dynamic power is not a new concept within art history; Duncan in particular emphasizes and exposes the relationship between art historians and the avant-garde painters of the post modern era in that art historians emphasize the notion: “that avant-garde art consists of so many movements of individual artistic freedom, a freedom evidenced in the artist’s capacity for innovation” and in this freedom both artist and historian are freed to analyze and construct work in a larger structure without recognizing the social constraints and responsibilities of the past and their impact on contemporary society. Duncan questions where does this innovation arise? Is it completely unmotivated? A gift from God? We may never know. Picasso in discussing the work was often resistant to acknowledge any guidance in context; favouring instead to address it in a way which ranged from vague, humorous and sarcastic.

Richter remembers that Mac Rauch wrote several Banzai stories and that he [...] "would get thirty or forty pages into a script, abandon its storyline and write a new one". Mac Rauch recalled, [...] "It's so easy to start something and then—since you're really not as serious about it as you should be—end up writing half of it ...
