5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03. It was recognized as a potential planet after a study into the system confirmed Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, but follow-up studies had to be completed to verify that it was indeed a planet, and that the apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in the aperture of Kepler's photometer. Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> but a planet, and their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. Follow-up observations were conducted by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, as well as the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California.|$|E

He also wanted to show 23rd-century Earth for the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him if there had <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> {{he wanted to do}} on The Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E

25|$|The Police Central E-Crime Unit arrested an 18-year-old {{man from}} Shetland on 27 July 2011 {{suspected}} of being LulzSec member Topiary. They also searched {{the house of a}} 17-year-old from Lincolnshire possibly connected to the investigation, interviewing him. Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Yell, Shetland resident Jake Davis. He was charged with unauthorized access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977. Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that ran 16 different virtual machines. Details relating to an attack on Sony {{and hundreds of thousands of}} email addresses and passwords were found on the computer. A London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his parents and have no access to the internet.

500|$|After {{conducting}} {{extensive research}} on the topography of Japan, an [...] scale model (1 foot: 1 mile) of target areas was fabricated complete with mountains, buildings, railroads and the rice paddies. It also depicted clouds and fog. The films were produced using a specially mounted overhead camera. The camera was motorized and could be moved to simulate an airplane's flight over the model. According to the New York Sun, [...] "the camera recorded what the crew of a B-29 would see from 30,000 feet." [...] Using the films, pilots of the 20th Air Force easily found their targets and were amazed {{at the level of}} detail and the accuracy that the unit was able to produce.

Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it [...] "defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> like this before." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as [...] "like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel... ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie". The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style".|$|E

500|$|Billings met Louis Saekow {{through a}} string of friends but was {{hesitant}} to hire him. Inspired by Avalon Hill's games, Billings wanted SSI's games to look professional and include maps, detailed manuals, and excellent box art. Two months prior, Saekow had postponed medical school to pursue his {{dream of becoming a}} graphic designer. To secure the job, Saekow told Billings that he could withhold pay if the work was unsatisfactory. In creating the box art, Saekow used a stat camera; his roommate worked for a magazine company and helped him sneak in to use its camera after hours. Saekow's cousin then handled printing the packaging. Without any storage for the complete products, Billings stored the first [...] in his bedroom. In February 1980, he distributed [...] to [...] owners, and displayed the game at the Applefest exposition a month later. SSI purchased a full-page advertisement in the March 1980 BYTE which stated [...] "Now there's a true historical wargame for your home computer ... There's never <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> like it". It mentioned the ability to play against the computer or another person, and save a game in progress. The [...] version was $59.95, and the advertisement promised future support for the TRS-80 and other computers.|$|E
500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> but a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben-Hur {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews {{upon its}} release. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, called Ben-Hur [...] "a remarkably intelligent and engrossing human drama". While praising the acting and William Wyler's [...] "close-to" [...] direction, {{he also had}} high praise for the chariot race: [...] "There has seldom <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> in movies to compare with this picture's chariot race. It is a stunning complex of mighty setting, thrilling action by horses and men, panoramic observation and overwhelming use of dramatic sound." [...] Jack Gaver, writing for United Press International, also had praise for the acting, calling it full of [...] "genuine warmth and fervor and finely acted intimate scenes". Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "magnificent, inspiring, awesome, enthralling, {{and all the other}} adjectives you have been reading about it." [...] He also called the editing [...] "generally expert" [...] although at times abrupt. Ronald Holloway, writing for Variety, called Ben-Hur [...] "a majestic achievement, representing a superb blending of the motion picture arts by master craftsmen," [...] and concluded that [...] "Gone With the Wind, Metro's own champion all-time top grosser, will eventually have to take a back seat." [...] The chariot race [...] "will probably be preserved in film archives as the finest example of the use of the motion picture camera to record an action sequence. The race, directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, represents some 40 minutes of the most hair-raising excitement that film audiences have ever witnessed." ...|$|E

While the shooting of Daniel at the end was stunning, I expected something much more {{from the rest of}} the episode than learning the identity of Daniel's parents." [...] A reviewer for TVoholic.com thought the episode was good, though not as good as [...] "The Constant", and he thought [...] "it came with lots of answers and references to past episodes from this season and the ones before it, making it all the more exciting." [...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work. There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible, but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain." [...] Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind said that as an internal character piece, [...] "The Variable" [...] was not [...] "so much a great ending for Daniel. We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mercedes storyline was {{met with}} widely {{divergent}} reactions, though her musical numbers were generally given high marks. In addition to Urban, many reviewers were unhappy {{with the return of}} the Rachel versus Mercedes rivalry, including Bell, who lamented that it had [...] "been done every season". Nearly as many expressed the hope that Mercedes was not pregnant given her nausea in the first [...] "booty camp" [...] scene, including Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger, BuddyTV John Kubicek, and West. Benigno felt Mercedes was acting [...] "wildly out of character" [...] in the episode. Michael Slezak of TVLine was also puzzled at her change, and asked, [...] "When has Mercedes ever <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> other than a team player and New Directions MVP? Seriously, nobody's going to cut her slack for a bad week?" [...] Canning agreed, and wrote: [...] "Schue's tough love with Mercedes came out of left field", and felt it added to the [...] "inconsistency of these characters", even though [...] "it ultimately made sense" [...] in the context of setup for [...] "It's All Over". Time James Poniewozik wrote that having the story [...] "turn on her resentment at being overlooked by the glee club is an apt meta-touch, since she's been overlooked by the show for some time now." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was the most enthusiastic about her storyline, and called it [...] "the best part of the episode": it was [...] "all about how she now feels appreciated—because she has a boyfriend, sigh—and so she's willing to take on Rachel for the role of Maria (and, actually, beat her) and push for what she feels is rightfully hers, which involves more respect from New Directions." ...|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of what really matters during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> but. Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E
