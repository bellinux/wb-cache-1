25|$|Models such as Boolean {{circuits}} and sorting {{networks are}} used. A <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuit</b> {{can be seen}} as a computer network: each gate is a computer that runs an extremely simple computer program. Similarly, a sorting network {{can be seen as}} a computer network: each comparator is a computer.|$|E
25|$|Logic {{sentences}} {{that can be}} expressed in classical propositional calculus have an equivalent expression in Boolean algebra. Thus, Boolean logic is sometimes used to denote propositional calculus performed in this way. Boolean algebra {{is not sufficient to}} capture logic formulas using quantifiers, like those from first order logic. Although the development of mathematical logic did not follow Boole's program, the connection between his algebra and logic was later put on firm ground in the setting of algebraic logic, which also studies the algebraic systems of many other logics. The problem of determining whether the variables of a given Boolean (propositional) formula can be assigned {{in such a way as}} to make the formula evaluate to true is called the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), and is of importance to theoretical computer science, being the first problem shown to be NP-complete. The closely related model of computation known as a <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuit</b> relates time complexity (of an algorithm) to circuit complexity.|$|E
40|$|We present partial {{results of}} a {{research}} project in which we use <b>boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> as a parallel computation model {{for the expression of}} queries to relational databases. For that purpose, we use the well-known equivalence between First Order Logic (FO) and a class of restricted families of <b>boolean</b> <b>circuits.</b> First, we translate a given query, expressed through a FO formula, into a uniform family of <b>boolean</b> <b>circuits.</b> Then we analyse the depth of the <b>boolean</b> <b>circuits,</b> in order to optimize parallel time. For this sake, we work on the expression tree of the formula, looking for its transformation into an equivalent family of <b>boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> of minimum depth.

40|$|AbstractWe {{compare the}} two {{computational}} models of <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> and arithmetic circuits in cases where they both apply, namely the computation of polynomials over the rational numbers or over finite fields. Over Q and finite fields, <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> can simulate arithmetic circuits efficiently with respect to size. Over finite fields of small characteristic, the two models are equally powerful when size is considered, but <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> are exponentially more powerful than arithmetic circuits with respect to depth.

40|$|<b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> were {{introduced}} in complexity theory to provide a model for parallel computation. A big advantage of studying <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> {{is that they can}} be viewed as simple combinatorial objects and thus allow us to use many algebraic and combinatorial techniques to derive upper and lower bounds on their computational power. The relationship between <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> and the traditional Turing machine model helps us to translate the bounds obtained for circuits into bounds for the Turing machine model which is otherwise hard to analyze. In this thesis we study the power of certain kinds of uniform constant depth circuits and provide upper and lower bounds.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that DNA computers can simulate <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> {{with a small}} overhead. <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> embody the notion of massively parallel signal processing and are frequently encountered in many parallel algorithms.

This paper shows that DNA chemistry allows one to simulate large semi-unbounded fan-in <b>Boolean</b> <b>circuits</b> with a logarithmic slowdown in computation time. Also, for the class NC 1, the slowdown can be reduced to a constant. In this algorithm we have encoded the inputs, the Boolean AND gates, and the OR gates to DNA oligonucleotide sequences.
