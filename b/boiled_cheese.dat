2500|$|A special Swedish type of smörgåsbord is the julbord (literally [...] "Christmas table"). The classic Swedish julbord {{is central}} to {{traditional}} Swedish cuisine, often including bread dipped in ham broth and continuing {{with a variety of}} fish (salmon, herring, whitefish and eel), baked ham, meatballs, pork ribs, head cheese, sausages, potato, Janssons frestelse, <b>boiled</b> potatoes, <b>cheeses,</b> beetroot salad, various forms of boiled cabbage, kale and rice pudding.|$|R
50|$|One version {{involves}} <b>boiling</b> cottage <b>cheese,</b> paneer or goats cheese, (rather than a cheesecake, {{which is}} based on cream cheese) with a sugar syrup, then adding extra ingredients such as pistachios or soft fruits such as cherries or cranberries, and freezing. Unlike a cheesecake, it is frozen or served at room temperature rather than chilled. Paneer Kheer is an Indian cheese pudding, made with sugar and milk.|$|R

50|$|Each kitchen {{operated}} {{individually and}} had different practices. However, menus were largely standardized across the colonies {{to prevent any}} residents from receiving more than their fair share. Saturday night would offer pork sausages or pork rinds, <b>boiled</b> potatoes, cottage <b>cheese</b> with chives, bread with cream cheese, and streusel. The noon meal on Sunday was rice soup, fried potatoes, creamed spinach, boiled beef, streusel, and tea or coffee. Menus changed with the seasons; for example, more beef and pork was served in the autumn and winter because {{it was easier to}} keep fresh meat.|$|R
5000|$|Polish pierogi {{are often}} filled with fresh curd <b>cheese,</b> <b>boiled</b> and minced potatoes, and fried onions.

Ruskie pierogi {{are probably the}} most popular kind of pierogi in North America. This variety is not necessarily the most popular in Europe, although very much liked. More popular in Poland are pierogi filled with ground meat, mushrooms and cabbage, or for dessert an assortment of fruits (berries, with strawberries or blueberries the most common).|$|R

50|$|A {{salad bar}} is a buffet-style table or counter at a {{restaurant}} or food market on which salad components are provided for customers to assemble their own salad plates. Most salad bars provide lettuce, chopped tomatoes, assorted raw, sliced vegetables (such as cucumbers, carrots, celery, olives and green or red bell peppers), dried bread croutons, bacon bits, shredded cheese, and various types of salad dressing. Some salad bars also have additional food items such as cooked cold meats, (turkey, chicken, ham, or tuna), cooked beans (e.g., chick peas, garbanzo beans or kidney beans), <b>boiled</b> eggs, cottage <b>cheese,</b> cold pasta salads, tortilla chips, bread rolls, soup, and fresh cut fruit slices.|$|R
50|$|Börek is {{the general}} name for salty {{pastries}} made with yufka (a thicker version of phyllo dough), which consists of thin layers of dough. Su böreği, made with <b>boiled</b> yufka/phyllo layers, <b>cheese</b> and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. Çiğ börek (also known as Tatar böreği) is fried and stuffed with minced meat. Kol böreği is another well-known type of börek that {{takes its name from}} its shape, as do fincan (coffee cup), muska (talisman), Gül böreği (rose) or Sigara böreği (cigarette). Other traditional Turkish böreks include Talaş böreği (phyllo dough filled with vegetables and diced meat), Puf böreği. Laz böreği is a sweet type of börek, widespread in the Black Sea region.|$|R
50|$|Lasagne {{originated}} in Italy during the Middle Ages and {{has traditionally been}} ascribed {{to the city of}} Naples (Campania). The first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough, flattened into a thin sheet, <b>boiled,</b> sprinkled with <b>cheese</b> and spices, and theneaten {{with the use of a}} small pointed stick. Other recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in a chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat, or in one case walnuts, in a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast.|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Boiled</b> white brined <b>cheese</b> (Nabulsi cheese) &# 13; is {{the mostly}} {{consumed}} cheese in Jordan; this cheese should show meltability and &# 13; high stretchability {{in order to}} fit {{in the production of}} high quality Kunafa and &# 13; other popular local sweets and pastries. However, these characteristics are rarely &# 13; available when usual processing and preservation method were used. Approach: &# 13; This study was based on the hypothesis that {{it would be possible to}} imply &# 13; meltability and stretchability to the cheese by proteolytic enzymes to the original &# 13; brine that may specifically act on cross linking bonds of casein. In this study, &# 13; six commercial proteases were used. It was found that Nabulsi cheese treated with &# 13; papain developed an outstanding fibrous structure, this gave superiority in the &# 13; application in kunafa, pizza and pastries. Results: The meltability &# 13; and stretchability of Nabulsi cheese treated with papain were still excellent &# 13; after 4 weeks of storage; this indicated the restricted enzyme action, probably &# 13; due to high salt concentrations (18 %) in storage brine. Conclusion: The &# 13; meltability and stretchability of Nabulsi cheese treated with papain were still &# 13; excellent after 4 weeks of storage. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{objective}} and subjective hardness of selected common foods with a wax cube used as a test item in a mixing ability test. Objective hardness was determined for 11 foods (cream <b>cheese,</b> <b>boiled</b> fish paste, boiled beef, apple, raw carrot, peanut, soft/hard rice cracker, jelly, plain chocolate and chewing gum) and the wax cube. Peak force (N) to compress each item was obtained from force-time curves generated with the Tensipresser. Perceived hardness ratings of each item were made by 30 dentate subjects (mean age 26. 9 years) using a visual analogue scale (100 mm). These subjective assessments were given twice with a 1 week interval. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for test-retest reliability were seen for all foods (ICC > 0. 68; P < 0. 001). One-way ANOVA found a significant effect of food type on both the objective hardness score and the subjective hardness rating (P < 0. 001). The wax cube showed significant lower objective hardness score (32. 6 N) and subjective hardness rating (47. 7) than peanut (45. 3 N, 63. 5) and raw carrot (82. 5 N, 78. 4) P < 0. 05; Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch (REGW) -F. A significant semilogarithmic relationship was found between the logarithm of objective hardness scores and subjective hardness ratings across twelve test items (r = 0. 90; P < 0. 001). These results suggest the wax cube has a softer texture compared with test foods traditionally used for masticatory performance test, such as peanut and raw carrot. The hardness of the wax cube could be modified to simulate a range of test foods by changing mixture ratio of soft and hard paraffin wax.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with a chemical and microbiological characterisation of cheese made using milk from Algarvian goat breed. Seasonal variation of the microbiota and the gross chemical composition of the raw and <b>boiled</b> milk and <b>cheese</b> during the lactation period were studied. The cardoon microbiota and the variation of microbiota during ripening were studied also. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated, identified to genus level and their technological properties such as bacteriocin production, acidifying capacity, proteolysis and lipolysis were studied. The results showed that boiling milk does not represent a cause of variation in its gross composition and almost all the gross components of the milk and cheese register no variation during the studied period, except for fat, which increased {{until the middle of}} the lactation period and decreased after that. In cardoon, the microorganisms that are able to produce spores are the most important, thus analysis of yeasts and moulds was carried out which allowed the arrangement of the tested samples into three groups. Most of the identified moulds from the cardoon samples are from the genus Aspergillus. During the study period, differences in the microbiota of the raw milk were not observed, with Lactococcus and Lactobacillus being the prevalent groups. All the tested microorganisms increased approximately by two orders of magnitude from milk to cheese. Lactobacillus was the predominant group during the maturation period. Total coliforms tended to diminish {{in the early stages of}} ripening. Isolates from Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera showed fast acidification capacity, which could be an indicator of good potential for their use as starter bacteria. Some Lactobacillus produced bacteriocin which can contribute to the removal of other bacteria. Aerococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus presented high proteolytic activity, which mean they could be used as adjunct cultures to improve proteolysis. Only one isolate (Pediococcus) showed lipolytic activity. In conclusion, by their technological characteristics some isolates could be selected as starter cultures, however, further research of their pathogenesis is necessary before using them in pilot plant production.
