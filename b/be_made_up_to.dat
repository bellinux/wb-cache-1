25|$|During filming, {{considerable}} publicity {{was given}} to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her look {{the same age as}} Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.|$|E
25|$|In August 2011 {{the company}} {{announced}} that, due to financial losses {{and a decline in}} market share, major structural changes would <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 jobs would be lost in Australia, and a new Asia-based premium airline would be set up, operating under a different name. It would also launch a budget airline, called Jetstar Japan, in partnership with Japan Airlines and Mitsubishi Corporation. The change became necessary because of losses in the airline's international operations, due to airlines such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines becoming more competitive and because of the deregulation of Australian international routes during the mid-to-late 1980s. Included in the changes was the cessation of services to London via Hong Kong and Bangkok; Qantas still operated to these cities, but with onward flights to London via its Oneworld partner British Airways under a code-share service.|$|E

500|$|Gloria Stuart as Rose Dawson Calvert: Rose narrates {{the film}} in a modern-day framing device. Cameron stated, [...] "In order to see {{the present and the}} past, I decided to create a fictional {{survivor}} who is [...] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history." [...] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She tells the story of her time aboard the ship, mentioning Jack {{for the first time since}} the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, [...] "My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties." [...] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. [...] "But [...] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [...] spirit," [...] stated Cameron. [...] "I saw this joie de vivre in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person." [...] Stuart died on September 26, 2010, at age 100, approximately the same age elder Rose was in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous {{return of condensate}} to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages have to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water {{is added to the}} boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|E
