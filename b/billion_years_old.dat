5|$|Most {{stars are}} between 1 billion and 10 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Some stars {{may even be}} close to 13.8 billion years old—the {{observed}} age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with {{the age of the}} Universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 ± 0.021).|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> depending on the theoretical model used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is between 0.1–5 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b>|$|E

50|$|More {{research}} is needed before the Maniitsoq structure can be definitely confirmed as an impact crater because present diagnostic tools used to identify impacting in the upper crust are inadequate for giant, deeply eroded structures. If confirmed as an impact crater, this crater would be older than other old impact craters such as the much smaller 16 km wide, 2.4 <b>billion</b> <b>year</b> <b>old,</b> Suavjärvi crater in Russia and the larger 300 km wide, 2.0 <b>billion</b> <b>year</b> <b>old,</b> Vredefort crater in South Africa.|$|R

5|$|Mount Elbert is {{composed}} largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, {{as well as}} bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which {{can be attributed to}} its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Ireland is diverse. Different regions contain rocks {{belonging}} to different geologic periods, dating {{as far back}} almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> and is found on Inishtrahull Island off the north coast of Inishowen and on the mainland at Annagh Head on the Mullet Peninsula. The newer formations are the drumlins and glacial valleys {{as a result of}} the last ice age, and the sinkholes and cave formations in the limestone regions of Clare.|$|E
5|$|Located {{mostly in}} Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud extends into Hydrus. The {{globular}} cluster NGC 1466 is an outlying {{component of the}} galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type variable stars. It has a magnitude of 11.59 and {{is thought to be}} over 12 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. NGC 602 is composed of an emission nebula and a young, bright open cluster of stars that is an outlying component on {{the eastern edge of the}} Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less than a <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|Southeast of Theta and {{southwest}} of Eta lies the open cluster ESO 281-SC24, which {{is composed of}} the yellow 9th magnitude star GSC 7914 178 1 and five 10th to 11th magnitude stars. Halfway between Theta Coronae Australis and Theta Scorpii is the dense globular cluster NGC 6541. Described as between magnitude 6.3 and magnitude 6.6, it is visible in binoculars and small telescopes. Around 22000 light years away, it is around 100 light years in diameter. It {{is estimated to be}} around 14 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> NGC 6541 appears 13.1 arcminutes in diameter and is somewhat resolvable in large amateur instruments; a 12-inch telescope reveals approximately 100 stars but the core remains unresolved.|$|E

5|$|The Milky Way covers {{much of the}} constellation's area. Of the {{deep-sky objects}} in Apus, there are two {{prominent}} globular clusters—NGC 6101 and IC 4499—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a globular cluster of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> it contains {{a high concentration of}} massive bright stars known as blue stragglers, thought {{to be the result of}} two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose globular cluster in the medium-far galactic halo; its apparent magnitude is 10.6.|$|E
5|$|The star is {{estimated}} to be less than a <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.|$|E
5|$|The triple {{system is}} {{just outside the}} core of the {{globular}} cluster Messier 4. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.7 billion years, and because all stars in a cluster form at about the same time, and planets form together with their host stars, it is likely that PSR B1620-26 b is also about 12.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> This is much older than any other known planet, and nearly three times as old as Earth. It has been undergoing many stages through its lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Lying {{approximately}} 264 light-years (81 parsecs) {{away with}} an apparent magnitude of 4.39, HD 66141 is 6.8 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> and {{has evolved into}} an orange giant of spectral type K2III with a diameter around 22 {{times that of the}} Sun, and weighing 1.1 solar masses. It is 174 times as luminous as the Sun, with an absolute magnitude of −0.15. HD 66141 was mistakenly named 13 Puppis, as its celestial coordinates were recorded incorrectly when catalogued and hence mistakenly thought to be in the constellation of Puppis; Bode gave it the name Lambda Canis Minoris, which is now obsolete. The orange giant is orbited by a planet, HD 66141b, which was detected in 2012 by measuring the star's radial velocity. The planet has a mass around 6 times that of Jupiter and a period of 480 days.|$|E
5|$|North of Sirius lie Theta and Mu Canis Majoris, Theta {{being the}} most northerly star with a Bayer {{designation}} in the constellation. Around 8 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> it is an orange giant of spectral type K4III that is around as massive as the Sun but has expanded to 30 times the Sun's diameter. Mu is a multiple star system located around 1244 light-years distant, its components discernible in a small telescope as a 5.3-magnitude yellow-hued and 7.1-magnitude bluish star. The brighter star is a giant of spectral type K2III, while the companion is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. Nu Canis Majoris is a yellow-hued giant star of magnitude 5.7, 278 light-years away; {{it is at the}} threshold of naked-eye visibility. It has a companion of magnitude 8.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Indian plate survives as peninsular India, {{the oldest}} and geologically most stable part of India.

These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coal-rich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east. To the south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the Deccan Plateau, is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats; the plateau contains the country's oldest rock formations, some over one <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Constituted in such fashion, India lies {{to the north of the}} equator between 6° 44' and 35° 30' north latitude and 68° 7' and 97° 25' east longitude.|$|E

5|$|The second-brightest {{globular}} cluster {{in the sky}} after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) lies {{just west of the}} Small Magellanic Cloud. Only 14,700 light-years distant from Earth, it is thought to be around 12 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> Mostly composed of old, yellow stars, it does possess a contingent of blue stragglers, hot stars that are hypothesized to form from binary star mergers. 47 Tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3.9, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye; it is a Shapley class III cluster, which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus. Near to 47 Tucana on the sky, and often seen in wide-field photographs showing it, are two much more distant {{globular cluster}}s associated with the SMC: NGC 121, 10 arcminutes away from the bigger cluster's edge, and Lindsay 8.|$|E
5|$|The station's geology is {{dominated}} by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some claystone and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include claypans, while to the west are stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.|$|E
