In {{the present}} study, {{aerodynamic}} noise from a forward-facing step is numerically investigated for Reynolds number {{based on the}} step height, Reh= 8, 000 and flow Mach number, M= 0. 03. A three-dimensional flow over the forward-facing step is calculated by the incompressible large eddy simulation (LES), while its acoustic field is solved by the linearized compressible perturbed equations (LPCE). The space-time characteristics of the surface pressure over the step and the flow strucuture low-dimensionalized by a filtered proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method indicate two different noise generation mechanisms at St= 0. 1 & 0. 4 ~ 0. 8. The low frequency noise is generated by a flapping motion of the shear layer. The high frequency noise is, however, generated by the <b>breaking-off</b> <b>of</b> the shear layer, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. A dominant noise source for the forward-facing step with an extended span {{will be expected to}} be around the step-corner (step front-face and leading-edge over the step) rather than near the shear layer reattachment point because the spanwise coherence length for the shear layer flapping mode is much longer than that for the shear layer breaking-off mode...|$|R

Spin-orbit coupling is taken into account by the state interaction approach with the full Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. Very good agreement is achieved between our computed spectroscopic properties and the available experimental data. The transition properties of the B- 3 Sigma(-) -X- 3 Sigma(-) and (4) 1 -X 0 (+) transitions are predicted, and our computed Franck-Condon factors and radiative lifetimes match the experimental results very well. The predissociation mechanisms are investigated, and various new predissociation channels are located. We present a new interpretation on the <b>breaking-off</b> <b>of</b> the rotational levels of the B- 3 Sigma(-) lower vibrational states observed in experiment, and propose that the predissociation is induced by the Coriolis coupling between the B- 3 Sigma(-) rovibrational levels and the A(3) Pi state. Our calculations indicate that, at nu' = 9, the B- 3 Sigma(-) state predissociates via the C- 3 Pi state; around nu' = 14, three spin-orbit-induced predissociation pathways via (1) (5) Sigma(+), (2) (5) Pi, and e(1) Pi would be open; around nu' = 17, the pathways via (2) (1) Sigma(+), (2) (3) Sigma(+) and (2) (5) Sigma(+) would contribute. These satisfactorily explain the experimental results about the diffuseness of the B- 3 Sigma(-) bands.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{theoretical}} basis of precontractual liability for the unilateral <b>breaking-off</b> <b>of</b> negotiations, by undertaking a comparative study between three selected jurisdictions (Germany, France and Chile). It defines a 'paradigm case' {{and focuses on}} {{it in order to}} find the theoretical basis of this liability. Traditionally, precontractual liability for breaking off negotiations has been founded upon or at least linked with the notion of good faith. This thesis, however, argues that in the selected jurisdictions the true basis of this liability is the notion of 'reliance' and distinguishes two dimensions of reliance (referring to them as 'trust-based' and 'expectation-based'). It analyses the relationship between these dimensions arguing that in the selected jurisdictions the trust-dimension merges with the general principle of good faith and that the expectation-dimension emanates from the trust-dimension. This thesis argues that this innovative approach to the theoretical analysis of the foundation of this liability could have important practical consequences in jurisdictions which do not embrace a general principle of good faith. It focuses on English law, as a contrasting jurisdiction to the selected jurisdictions, in that it rejects a general principle of good faith and, especially, the notion of a duty to negotiate in good faith, which is generally considered to lead necessarily to the rejection of a general principle of precontractual liability. This thesis demonstrates that while English law can provide protection for certain cases of precontractual liability, it currently does not protect the paradigm case. It argues that if the analysis is shifted from good faith to the notion of reliance, English law could develop one or more of its particular solutions {{in order to protect the}} paradigm case, if it desired to do so, and explores how such a development could be implemented without establishing a general principle of precontractual liability. </p...|$|R

In this essay I have referred to his American Notes (1842) which I already discussed in the Bulletin of Nagasaki College of International Economics in 1967, because Dickens often used A. N. and his letters sent to his friends during his stay in the United States in many pages of the American part of Martin Chuzzlewit.

His satiric descriptions in American scenes emanating from his keen observations of American institutions and individuals mingled with his tremendous power of creative imagination constitute the main point of discussions in this essay. Among the Americans portrayed in M. C. is discussed the characterization of Colonel Diver, Mrs. Hominy, and Scadder, all humorously caricaturized, except for Mr. Bevan, the only "good" American. I have found the essential quality of Dickens in Mark Tapley whowent to the desolate Eden with Martin, whose spirits rise in adversity, being always on the outlook for greater misery that he can be the more "jolly". Discussions are also made, though in a sketchy manner, about the Americanisms found in the chapters of American interlude in M. C. The copious use of Americanisms, it seems to me, is aimed at enhancing Dickens's satirical effect of American vulgarity. I owe the study of Americanisms found here to the two most searching books on the Language of Dickens ever published: Sanki Ichikawa (1912) and G. L. Brook (1970).

Thus, at some point after the establishment of the Roman army at Sanitja, the civilian settlement would have started to be created, and as the population grew, it would have started to adopt some sort of organization at the eastern side of the port. The wide chronology of the city shows that it became a stable and permanent settlement which ended up adopting the status of a city, and in which economic and subsistence activities of different nature, such as farming, herding and fishing, were developed. The archaeological investigations have been able to determine an area measuring approximately 14 acre of perimeter, which would represent the largest expansion of the city in its peak period (which could have taken place around the 1st and 3rd centuries AC). An important factor for the development of the city of Sanisera was its coastal location in an excellent natural port, which made it become a Roman portuary city protected from bad weather conditions, and that it could have held a relevant role in the maritime trade of the western basin of the Mediterranean. This transportation of goods from and to the city is attested by pottery and other artifacts produced in places out of the island of Menorca, which have been found both in the city and the port’s seabed. During and after the Crisis of the Third Century which affected all the territories belonging to the Roman Empire, Sanisera started to decay as well, shrinking both its perimeter and population, and, probably modifying the distribution of the different spaces still in use, which would have caused major changes in the urbanism. Among some of those, it would have been possible to find in areas of domestic use the introduction of zones of production for the self-sufficiency and/or supplying and distribution of products on a small scale. Nevertheless, this decay would have not meant a total <b>breaking-off</b> <b>of</b> the relations with other parts of the Mediterranean, since the site presents different types of pottery dating from that late Empire period which arrived from places such as Northern Africa.|$|R

The annual low-pressure area induced by heat above Tibet as a motor of the summer monsoon was lacking. The glaciation thus caused a <b>breaking-off</b> <b>of</b> the summer monsoon with all the global-climatic consequences, e.g. the pluvials in the Sahara, the expansion of the Thar desert, the heavier dust influx into the Arabian Sea etc., and also the downward shifting of the timber line and all forest-belts from the alpine-boreal forests as far down as to the semi-humid mediterranean forest which has replaced the Holocene monsoon-tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent. But also the movements of animals including the Javan Rusa far into South Asia are a consequence of this glaciation.Despite a great evaporation ablation caused by heavy insolation, the discharge of the glaciers into the Inner-Asian basins was sufficient for the creation of meltwater lakes in the Qaidam Basin, the Tarim Basin and the Gobi Desert. The drop in temperature (see above) was in favour of their development. Thus, the clay fraction produced by the ground scouring of the important glaciation was ready to be blown-out. The blow-out of the limnites and the Aeolian long-distance transport were connected to the katabatic winds. Accordingly, the Tibetan glaciation was the actual cause of the enormous loess production and the transport of the material into the Chinese middle- and lowlands continuing to the east. During the Ice Age the katabatic air current - the name 'winter monsoon' is not quite correct - blew all year round. The enormous uplift of Tibet by approx. 10 mm/y measured by triangulations since the 19th century and confirmed by glaciogemorphological findings as well as by seismological investigations equals the uplift of the Himalaya. However, these amounts of uplift are far too important as to a primarily tectonic uplift of the high plateau which only takes place epirogenetically. Actually they can be understood the better by a superimposed glacioisostatic compensation movement of Tibet about 650 m.|$|R
