40|$|Versatile {{computational}} tools {{with up to}} date {{capabilities are}} needed to assess current nuclear fuel cycles or {{the transition from the}} current status of the fuel cycle to the more advanced and sustainable ones. This work is intended to cross check the new capabilities of the fuel cycle scenario code TR_EVOL. This process has been divided in two stages. The first stage is dedicated to check the improvements in the nuclear fuel mass balance estimation using the available data for the Spanish nuclear fuel cycle. The second stage has been focused in verifying the validity of the TR_EVOL economic module, comparing results to data published by the ARCAS EU project. A specific analysis was required to evaluate the <b>back-end</b> <b>cost.</b> Data published by the waste management responsible institutions was used for the validation of the methodology. Results were highly satisfactory for both stages. In particular, the economic assessment provides a difference smaller than 3 % regarding results published by the ARCAS project (NRG estimations). Furthermore, concerning the <b>back-end</b> <b>cost,</b> results are highly acceptable (7 % difference for a final disposal in a once-through scenario and around 11 % for a final disposal in a reprocessing strategy) given the significant uncertainties involved in design concepts and related unit costs...|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} growth in concern about climate change, advocates of nuclear {{electricity}} {{have claimed that}} this technology offers an attractive option for carbon abatement in the developed world. This paper discusses whether privately owned new reactors, subject to current nuclear technology, could have market chances in the next decades in the UK liberalised electricity supply industry, when current generation capacity will start being decommissioned and UK CO 2 emissions may be priced. We discuss key parametric assumptions that condition the future cost competitiveness of nuclear power vis-à-vis gas-fired generation. We explore where greater cost uncertainties lie and which key economic and political tradeoffs are involved. Our discussion is based on well-documented sources of expected costs for nuclear and gas-fired generation. On the nuclear side, we concentrate on capital and <b>back-end</b> <b>costs.</b> By considering different scenarios for future gas prices in Europe, we analyse the levels of carbon taxation that {{would be needed to}} make current gas-fired and nuclear power technologies equally dear. Considering the political acceptability of expected triggered increases in the end-user cost of energy services, our results suggest that, for the case of carbon or energy taxation, it seems unlikely that current nuclear technology could win market space within liberalised electricity industries for new reactors in the coming decades. This diagnosis is further validated by the financial and political costs associated with significant uncertainties surrounding the valuation of nuclear <b>back-end</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

Past (or upfront) costs are initial investments necessary to implement services such as the acquisition of vehicles, equipment, or facilities.

25|$|The company faced {{financial}} trouble from 2002, {{when it first}} approached the British government for financial aid. This followed a slump in wholesale energy prices, a failure to obtain relaxations on the Climate Change Levy, and renegotiations of its <b>back-end</b> fuel <b>costs</b> with BNFL, as well as issues {{with a number of}} its reactors (resulting in much capacity being offline during critical periods of the company financial crisis) and a failure to complete a timely sale of its joint-venture share in AmerGen. Parties to the resulting talks included bondholders, significant but unsecured creditors, power purchase agreement counterparties, and a group of secured creditors known as the Eggborough banks; who had provided financing for the purchase of the Eggborough coal-fired power plant in 2000.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{performance}} reaction of investors {{in a small}} market context. Instead of the asymmetrical investors’ reaction to winners and losers, as usually documented for the US, an absence of risk-adjusted performance reaction was observed. The absence of reaction {{can be attributed to}} either lower investor sophistication, conflicts of interests {{in the context of the}} Portuguese universal banking industry, or the existence of relevant <b>back-end</b> load <b>cost</b> which prevent investors from reacting. A high persistence of net investment flows was also noted. Our results are consistent with the idea that the financial groups with larger market shares have the capacity “to drive” their customers to funds with larger fees. This practice emerges as a non-transparent means of increasing prices. Mutual Funds, Performance Reaction, Investor Behaviour, Small Markets and Regulation...|$|R
40|$|In {{most studies}} aiming at the {{economic}} assessment of nuclear fuel cycles, a primary concern is to keep scenarios economically comparable. For Uranium Oxide (UOX) and Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuels, a traditional way to achieve this is to evaluate both fuels on the deterministic premise that the fuel {{will be sent to}} geologic disposal once spent. This methodology often leads to higher costs for cycles using MOX fuel. Geologic disposal is not the sole possible ending for spent LightWater Reactor (LWR) fuel. Fast Reactors (FRs), which feed on transuranics (TRUs) extracted from LWR spent fuel, are seriously considered as a future technology. If it is cheaper to extract TRUs from spent MOX than from UOX, then the relative cost of a fuel cycle using MOX fuel may be less than in the case of their geologic disposal. However, the commercial development of FR cycles is uncertain. The value of UOX and MOX is therefore not the deterministic value in case of geologic disposal or in case of reprocessing into FRs. This thesis develops a method to assess the cost of thermal reactor fuel cycles in the presence of uncertainties in back-end management. The representation of future progress in FR technology through a resulting value of TRUs exhibits the properties of MOX as a financial option on the marginal TRU extraction cost. The framework establishes a significant modification of the <b>back-end</b> <b>costs</b> for countries using MOX, compared to traditional valuations. However, these savings do not completely offset the higher costs of recycling in the reference case. by Guillaume De Roo. Thesis (S.

40|$|Semi-dense phase {{pneumatic}} {{delivery and}} injection of calcium and sodium sorbents, and microfine powdered coal, at various sidewall elevations of an online operating coal-fired power plant, was investigated {{for the express}} purpose of developing an in-furnace, economic multi-pollutant reduction methodology for NO{sub x}, SO{sub 2 } & Hg. The 154 MWe tangentially-fired furnace that was selected for a full-scale demonstration, was recently retrofitted for NO{sub x} reduction with a high velocity rotating-opposed over-fire air system. The ROFA system, a Mobotec USA technology, has a proven track record of breaking up laminar flow along furnace walls, thereby enhancing the mix of all constituents of combustion. The knowledge gained from injecting sorbents and micronized coal into well mixed combustion gases with significant improvement in particulate retention time, should serve well the goals of an in-furnace multi-pollutant reduction technology; that of reducing <b>back-end</b> cleanup <b>costs</b> on a wide variety of pollutants, on a cost per ton basis, by first accomplishing significant in-furnace reductions of all pollutants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractShort-loop process {{monitoring}} structures (usually simple device I V, C V measurements made after M 1 fabrication) are commonly put in wafer scribe-lines. These test structures {{are almost always}} design independent and measured/monitored by the foundry {{to keep track of}} process deviations. We propose a design-dependent {{process monitoring}} strategy which can accurately predict design performance based on simple Ieff-based delay and Ioff-based leakage power estimates. We show that our strategy works much better (0. 99 correlation vs. 0. 87) compared to conventional design-independent monitors. Further, we use the predicted delay and leakage power for early yield estimation for pruning bad wafers to save test and <b>back-end</b> manufacturing <b>costs</b> We show that wafer pruning based on our approach can achieve upto 98 % of the maximum achievable benet/prot. We design the measurement and prediction schemes so as to minimize data as well as computation that needs to be kept track of during wafer fabrication. Such design-dependent process monitoring can help target process control/optimization effort, enable quicker yield ramp besides saving test and manufacturing costs. I...|$|R

The thesis {{describes the}} implementation and gives detailed information about how a Timber program is translated into a LLVM program {{and how it is}} represented. Furthermore the thesis compares the existing C based back-end with the new LLVM based back-end in terms of implementation complexity and the performance of programs that were compiled with the respective back-ends. When compared to each other, the LLVM based back-end was found to have a performance that was equal or better than the C based <b>back-end,</b> with the <b>cost</b> of increased complexity of the compiler {{in the form of an}} abstract syntax to represent LLVM assembly code and an interface to the abstract syntax.

40|$|The Advanced Fuel Cycle Economic Analysis of Symbiotic Light-Water Reactor and Fast Burner Reactor Systems, {{prepared}} {{to support the}} U. S. Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI) systems analysis, provides a technology-oriented baseline system cost comparison between the open fuel cycle and closed fuel cycle systems. The intent is to understand their overall cost trends, cost sensitivities, and trade-offs. This analysis also improves the AFCI Program’s understanding of the cost drivers that will determine nuclear power’s cost competitiveness vis-a-vis other baseload generation systems. The common reactor-related costs consist of capital, operating, and decontamination and decommissioning costs. Fuel cycle costs include front-end (pre-irradiation) and <b>back-end</b> (post-iradiation) <b>costs,</b> as well as costs specifically associated with fuel recycling. This analysis reveals that there are large cost uncertainties associated with all the fuel cycle strategies, and that overall systems (reactor plus fuel cycle) using a closed fuel cycle are about 10 % more expensive in terms of electricity generation cost than open cycle systems. The study concludes that further U. S. and joint international-based design {{studies are needed to}} reduce the cost uncertainties with respect to fast reactor, fuel separation and fabrication, and waste disposition. The results of this work can help provide insight to the cost-related factors and conditions needed to keep nuclear energy (including closed fuel cycles) economically competitive in the U. S. and worldwide. These results may be updated over time based on new cost information, revised assumptions, and feedback received from additional reviews...|$|R
40|$|Recently we have {{developed}} a direct View reflective CMOS active matrix (AM) polymer dispersed (PD) liquid crystal (LC) display. A 3 mu m 15 V CMOS technology for the silicon backplane was chosen for its voltage compatibility with PDLC. The main features of this display ape: 1 / 16 VGA resolution, pixel size 80 mu m, response time suited for all video applications, integrated analog scanner circuits and fully integrated row drivers, a low <b>cost</b> <b>back-end</b> module for defining the pixel pads and light shielding, and a non-vacuum PDLC filling assembly technology. A LVDS (low voltage differential signalling) link was chosen for the interfacing. Therefore a ceramic package was developed which contains the display chip plus other electronic components, including a LVDS receiver, a voltage step-up converter, a {{digital to analog converter}} and a video amplifier. This very simple interfacing (one 5 V voltage supply and 3 signal pairs) and the low power consumption (750 mW) for the whole light weight package, makes this display system compatible with personal and mobile IT applications...|$|R
40|$|Current fuel {{management}} strategies for light water reactors (LWRs), {{in countries with}} high <b>back-end</b> <b>costs,</b> progressively extend the discharge burnup {{at the expense of}} increasing the 235 U enrichment of the fresh UO 2 fuel loaded. In this perspective, standard non-destructive assay (NDA) techniques, which are very attractive because they are fast, cheap, and preserve the fuel integrity, in contrast to destructive approaches, require further validation when burnup values become higher than 50 GWd/t. This doctoral work has been devoted to the development and optimisation of non-destructive assay (NDA) techniques based on gamma-ray emissions from irradiated fuel. It represents an important extension of the unique, high-burnup related database, generated in the framework of the LWR-PROTEUS Phase II experiments. A novel tomographic measurement station has been designed and developed for the investigation of irradiated fuel rod segments. A unique feature of the station is that it allows both gamma-ray transmission and emission computerised tomography to be performed on single fuel rods. Four burnt UO 2 fuel rod segments of 400 mm length have been investigated, two with very high (52 GWd/t and 71 GWd/t) and two with ultra-high (91 GWd/t and 126 GWd/t) burnup. Several research areas have been addressed, as described below. The application of transmission tomography to spent fuel rods has been a major task, because of difficulties of implementation and the uniqueness of the experiments. The main achievements, in this context, have been the determination of fuel rod average material density (a linear relationship between density and burnup was established), fuel rod linear attenuation coefficient distribution (for use in emission tomography), and fuel rod material density distribution. The non-destructive technique of emission computerised tomography (CT) has been applied to the very high and ultra-high burnup fuel rod samples for determining their within-rod distributions of caesium and europium fission-product radionuclides. As indicated above, results provided by the transmission tomography measurements were employed in the emission tomography reconstruction phase, together with a calculated global efficiency matrix and input sinograms derived from the processing of measured projections. Different tomographic algorithms were tested and "tuned", on the basis of known test distributions, before being applied to the actual fuel rod measurements. Amongst the various possibilities, the Paraboloidal Surrogates Coordinate Ascent (PSCA) penalised likelihood method has been chosen for presentation of the final results, because it ensures high precision, especially in resolving the most difficult peripheral regions of the rods. The results of the emission tomography have indicated large central depressions in the caesium distributions, but of varying extent from sample to sample. Particularly interesting is the case of the 126 GWd/t sample, showing a very deep central depression (a factor of ∼ 2. 5 for 137 Cs, a factor of ∼ 3 for 134 Cs). Differences in the relative activity distributions of 137 Cs and 134 Cs have, in fact, been observed for all the samples. The depression of 134 Cs is more marked than that of 137 Cs, probably due to the different origins of the two isotopes. In contrast, the europium shows an almost flat distribution. In order to support the tomographically measured caesium distributions, the results of destructive chemical techniques applied on samples from the same fuel rod (126 GWd/t sample) were examined and found to show reasonably good agreement with the tomography, thus confirming the depressed distributions at the centre of the rod. In addition to the tomographic reconstructions, the present research has also investigated the possibility to use single isotope activities, and/or isotopic concentration ratios from 134 Cs, 137 Cs, and 154 Eu, as burnup indicators at very high and ultra-high burnups. The corresponding non-destructive measurements, performed using three different approaches, have been compared with chemical assays, as well as with reactor physics calculations (CASMO). Whereas the chemical results confirm the current gamma-spectroscopic measurements within uncertainties, the agreement between measurements and calculations is not satisfactory. It has been shown that certain indicators, well established for application at low and medium burnups, suffer a serious loss of reliability at high burnup. Nevertheless, the possibility of successfully employing other burnup monitors has been clearly highlighted. Considering that the overall effort required for the destructive chemical analysis of fuel samples is much greater, the current investigations have clearly demonstrated that non-destructive gamma spectrometry, in conjunction with corresponding transmission and emission tomography measurements, can indeed be considered a valid approach for characterising fuel burnup in the high/ultra-high range...|$|R
40|$|RFID {{technology}} {{emerged as}} the promising technology for its ease of use and implementation in the ubiquitous computing world. RFID is deployed widely in various applications that use automatic identification and processing for information retrieval. The primary components of an RFID system are the RFID tag (active and passive), the reader and the <b>back-end</b> server (database). <b>Cost</b> is the main factor that drove RFID tags to its immense utilization in which passive tags dominate in today's widely deployed RFID practice. Passive tags are low cost RFID tags conjoined to several consumer products (like clothes, smart cards and devices, courier, container, etc) {{for the purpose of}} unique identification. Readers on the other hand act as a source to track and record the passive RFID tag's activities (like modifications, updates and authentication). Due to the rapid growth of RFID practice in the past few years, measures for consumer privacy and security has been researched. The uncertainties that arise with the passive RFID tags are handling of user's private information (like name, ID, house address, credit card number, health statement, etc) which are posed to considerable threat from the adversary. Passive tags are inexpensive and contain less overhead and are considered good performers and consequently lack in providing security and privacy. Lightweight cryptography is an area of cryptography developed for low cost resourced environment. Mutual authentication is defined as the process of verifying an authorized tag and a reader (reader and server respectively) by an agreed algorithm to mutually prove their legitimacy with each other. Adversary is a third party who tries to hear the ongoing communication between the tag and the reader (reader and server respectively) anonymously. In this thesis, symmetric lightweight ciphers like Present and Grain are introduced as mutual authentication protocols to rescue the privacy aspects and properties of the RFID tags. These ciphers are simple, faster and suitable to implement within the passive RFID network and reasonably lay a foundation for the preservation of privacy and security of the RFID system. Lightweight ciphers use hash functions, pseudo random generators, SP networks and linear feedback shift registers to randomize data while mutual authentication scheme uses lightweight ciphers to manage authorize the legitimacy of every device in the RFID network...|$|R
