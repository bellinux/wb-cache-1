5|$|The silicon-directed Nazarov {{cyclization}} {{reaction was}} subsequently {{employed in the}} synthesis of the natural product Silphinene, shown below. The cyclization takes place before elimination of the <b>benzyl</b> alcohol moiety, so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether.|$|E
25|$|Protection: Potassium hydride, tetra-n-butylammonium iodide, and <b>benzyl</b> bromide.|$|E
25|$|DOM has {{traditionally}} been applied to tertiary anilines and <b>benzyl</b> amines.|$|E
25|$|Reduction to {{benzaldehyde}} and <b>benzyl</b> {{alcohol is}} possible using DIBAL-H, LiAlH4 or sodium borohydride.|$|E
25|$|The base-induced {{disproportionation}} of benzaldehyde, the Cannizzaro reaction, affords {{equal amounts}} of benzoate and <b>benzyl</b> alcohol; the latter can be removed by distillation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzyl</b> {{alcohol is}} refluxed with {{potassium}} permanganate or other oxidizing reagents in water. The mixture is hot filtered to remove manganese dioxide and then allowed to cool to afford benzoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Agaricus subrufescens is {{a choice}} edible, with a {{somewhat}} sweet taste and fragrance of almonds. The almond smell of the mushroom is mostly due {{to the presence of}} benzaldehyde, <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, benzonitrile, and methyl benzoate.|$|E
25|$|Secondary alcohol 2.2 was {{protected}} as the <b>benzyl</b> ether {{so that the}} reduction of lactone 2.3 could occur. Protection was removed much later in the synthesis to form alcohol 5.7, which was reprotected as the triethylsilyl ether.|$|E
25|$|DCC {{has also}} been {{prepared}} from dicyclohexylurea using a phase transfer catalyst by Jaszay et al. The disubstituted urea, arenesulfonyl chloride, and potassium carbonate react in toluene {{in the presence of}} <b>benzyl</b> triethylammonium chloride to give DCC in 50% yield.|$|E
25|$|The {{method has}} also been applied to the {{synthesis}} of enantiopure <b>benzyl</b> amines in scheme 3, which involves ortho-lithiation of tert-butyl phenyl sulfoxide. On approach to the lithium intermediate, the bulky tosyl group on the imine electrophile {{is responsible for the}} asymmetric induction taking place.|$|E
25|$|Benzoic acid is a {{precursor}} to benzoyl chloride, C6H5C(O)Cl by treatment with thionyl chloride, phosgene {{or one of the}} chlorides of phosphorus. Benzoyl chloride is an important starting material for several benzoic acid derivates like <b>benzyl</b> benzoate, which is used in artificial flavours and insect repellents.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatments}} include lindane, <b>benzyl</b> benzoate, crotamiton, malathion, and sulfur preparations. Lindane is effective, but {{concerns over}} potential neurotoxicity have limited its availability in many countries. It is banned in California, {{but may be}} used in other states as a second-line treatment. Sulfur ointments or <b>benzyl</b> benzoate are often used in the developing world due to their low cost; Some 10% sulfur solutions {{have been shown to be}} effective, and sulfur ointments are typically used for at least a week, though many people find the odor of sulfur products unpleasant. Crotamiton has been found to be less effective than permethrin in limited studies. Crotamiton or sulfur preparations are sometimes recommended instead of permethrin for children, due to concerns over dermal absorption of permethrin.|$|E
25|$|As of 1999, 7000 tonnes of {{synthetic}} and 100 tonnes of natural benzaldehyde were produced annually. Liquid phase chlorination and oxidation of toluene {{are the main}} routes. Numerous other methods have been developed, such as the partial oxidation of <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, alkali hydrolysis of benzal chloride, and the carbonylation of benzene.|$|E
25|$|Contact lens {{solutions}} often contain preservatives such as {{benzalkonium chloride}} and <b>benzyl</b> alcohol. Preservative-free products usually have shorter shelf lives, but are {{better suited for}} individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, thiomersal {{was used as a}} preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses. As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.|$|E
25|$|There exists no theory elucidating {{correlations}} among L-amino acids. If one takes, for example, alanine, {{which has a}} small methyl group, and phenylalanine, which has a larger <b>benzyl</b> group, a simple question is in what aspect, L-alanine resembles L-phenylalanine more than D-phenylalanine, {{and what kind of}} mechanism causes the selection of all L-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was L and phenylalanine was D.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is {{performed in the}} presence of an organopalladium catalyst. The halide (Br, Cl) or triflate is an aryl, <b>benzyl,</b> or vinyl compound and the alkene contains at least one hydrogen and is often electron-deficient such as acrylate ester or an acrylonitrile.The catalyst can be tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), palladium chloride or palladium(II) acetate. The ligand is triphenylphosphine, PHOX or BINAP. The base is triethylamine, potassium carbonate or sodium acetate.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{process is}} {{demonstrated}} in Wiesner’s synthesis of 13-desoxydelphinone (Scheme c). The {{first step of}} this synthesis is the generation of a conjugated dienone 112 from 111 in 4 steps. This {{is followed by the}} addition of a <b>benzyl</b> vinyl ether to produce 113. In 11 steps, this compound is converted to ketal 114. The addition of heat, DMSO and o-xylene rearranges this ketol (115), and after 5 more steps (±)-13-desoxydelphinone (15) is formed.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of fragment A, alkyl iodide, applied the Evans' acyl oxazolidinone method. After hydroxyl protection and reductive {{removal of the}} chiral auxiliary, an iodination was carried out to afford fragment A. The preparation of fragment B began with TBS protection and DIBAL reduction. The resulting aldehyde {{can be converted to}} desired Z-trisubstituted vinyl halide with 6:1 selectivity. The key feature of the {{synthesis of}} fragment C was the addition of the anion derived from dithiane to <b>benzyl</b> glycidyl ether.|$|E
25|$|Dominant {{native plants}} {{are capable of}} {{inhibition}} of EcM fungi on the roots of neighboring plants through the release of chemical compounds or through competitive interactions. Some invasive plants are capable of inhibiting the growth of native ectomycorrhizal fungi through similar mechanisms, especially if they become established and dominant. Invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, and its allelochemical <b>benzyl</b> isothiocyanate were shown to inhibit the growth of three species of EcM fungi grown on white pine (Pinus strobus) seedlings. Changes in EcM communities can have drastic effects on nutrient uptake and community composition of native trees, which can in turn have far-reaching ecological ramifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of enantiopure tryptophan or its short-chain alkylesters leads to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-'-carbolines {{in which a}} new chiral center at C-1 adopts either a cis or trans configuration towards the C-3 carboxyl group. The cis conduction is kinetically controlled, i.e. it is performed at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures the reaction becomes reversible and usually favours racemisation. 1,3-trans dominated products can be obtained with Nb-benzylated tryptophans, which are accessible by reductive amination. The <b>benzyl</b> group can be removed hydrogenolytically afterwards. As a rough rule, 13C NMR signals for C1 and C3 are downfield shifted in cis products relative to trans products (see steric compression effect).|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of brain uptake of acetamide, antipyrine, <b>benzyl</b> alcohol, butanol, caffeine, cytosine, phenytoin, ethanol, ethylene glycol, heroin, mannitol, methanol, phenobarbital, propylene glycol, thiourea, and urea in ether-anesthetized newborn vs. adult rabbits shows that newborn rabbit and adult rabbit brain endothelia are functionally similar {{with respect to}} lipid-mediated permeability. These data confirmed that no differences in permeability could be detected between newborn and adult BBB capillaries. No difference in brain uptake of glucose, amino acids, organic acids, purines, nucleosides, or choline was observed between adult and newborn rabbits. These experiments indicate that the newborn BBB has restrictive properties {{similar to that of}} the adult. In contrast to suggestions of an immature barrier in young animals, these studies indicate that a sophisticated, selective BBB is operative at birth.|$|E
25|$|The final {{efforts were}} {{directed}} at placing methyl groups at position 5 and 15. With position 10 sufficiently shielded reaction with chloromethyl <b>benzyl</b> ether produced the di(chloromethyl) adduct which was further converted to the dithiophenyl compound 63 using thiophenol, isolation of which required thin layer chromatography. Desulfurisation took place with Raney nickel and the reduction reaction also opened the lactone ring to the carboxylic acid which was converted to the ester 64 by reaction with diazomethane. At this stage {{the number of}} isomers in the mixture was reduced by HPLC to just two with the racemic propionic acid ester group at C13 (ring C) remaining in 65. Reaction with sulfuric acid converted the cyano group to the amide group in 66, again destroying stereochemistry at C13. The correct isomer 67 (minor yield) was isolated again by HPLC.|$|E
500|$|A {{large number}} of {{alternative}} synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions. One example is the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene by allyl chloride to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method2). [...] Another example employs the Ritter reaction (method3). [...] In this route, allylbenzene is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate {{which in turn is}} treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate. A third route starts with [...] which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by <b>benzyl</b> chloride can be converted into [...] acid. This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement (method4).|$|E
2500|$|Formulations of {{amiodarone}} {{that contain}} <b>benzyl</b> alcohol {{should not be}} given to neonates, because the <b>benzyl</b> alcohol may cause the potentially fatal [...] "gasping syndrome".|$|E
2500|$|The {{phosphine}} is also easily alkylated. [...] For example, <b>benzyl</b> chloride {{gives the}} phosphonium salt: ...|$|E
2500|$|Benzoic acid can be {{prepared}} by oxidation of <b>benzyl</b> chloride {{in the presence of}} alkaline KMnO4: ...|$|E
2500|$|Phenylalanine (Phe or F) is an α-amino acid {{with the}} formula [...] It {{can be viewed}} as a <b>benzyl</b> group {{substituted}} for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the <b>benzyl</b> side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins, coded for by DNA. The codons for L-phenylalanine are UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine; the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline); and the skin pigment melanin.|$|E
2500|$|Cannizzaro first {{accomplished}} this transformation in 1853, when he obtained <b>benzyl</b> alcohol and potassium benzoate from {{the treatment of}} benzaldehyde with potash (potassium carbonate). [...] More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium or potassium hydroxide: ...|$|E
2500|$|Selected {{patients}} may {{be treated with}} a relatively shorter course of treatment (2 weeks) with <b>benzyl</b> penicillin IV if infection is caused by viridans group streptococci or Streptococcus bovis {{as long as the}} following conditions are met: ...|$|E
2500|$|Pethidine can be {{produced}} in a two-step synthesis. The first step is reaction of <b>benzyl</b> cyanide and chlormethine {{in the presence of}} sodium amide to form a piperidine ring. [...] The nitrile is then converted to an ester.|$|E
2500|$|Extending {{the scope}} of this {{reaction}} towards ketones or rather enones requires fine tuning of the catalyst (add a <b>benzyl</b> group and replace the t-butyl group by a furan) and of the Hantzsch ester (add more bulky t-butyl groups): ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{presence}} of UV light, oxidation of this polymer yields compounds such as ketones, phenols, o-phenoxybenzoic acid, <b>benzyl</b> alcohol and [...] other unsaturated compounds. This has been suggested through kinetic and spectral studies. The yellow color formed after long exposure to sun can also be related to further oxidation of phenolic end group ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of eprosartan {{is the one}} that differs most from the other ARBs, the usual biphenyl-methyl group {{has been replaced by a}} carboxy <b>benzyl</b> group that mimics more closely the phenolic moiety of Tyr4 group of Ang II. This change results in a stronger binding to the receptor but the biochemical and physiological effects are not significantly improved.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 a joint Swedish-Danish {{research}} team found a statistical association between allergies {{in children and}} indoor air levels of DEHP and BBzP (butyl <b>benzyl</b> phthalate), which is used in vinyl flooring. In December 2006, the European Chemicals Bureau of the European Commission released a final draft risk assessment of BBzP which found [...] "no concern" [...] for consumer exposure including exposure to children.|$|E
2500|$|Chlorinated {{drinking}} water releases chloroform when hot water {{is used in}} the home. [...] Benzene is emitted from fuel stored in attached garages. Overheated cooking oils emit acrolein and formaldehyde. A meta-analysis of 77 surveys of VOCs in homes in the US found the top ten riskiest indoor air VOCs were acrolein, formaldehyde, benzene, [...] hexachlorobutadiene, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, <b>benzyl</b> chloride, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, carbon tetrachloride, acrylonitrile, and vinyl chloride. [...] These compounds exceeded health standards in most homes.|$|E
2500|$|... 1) Insecticides and Repellents: These may {{be applied}} to the horse or its environment. The most {{commonly}} used and effective are permethrins. and <b>benzyl</b> benzoate Citronella has been used, with variable effect. Some sources advocate draining of any stagnant water or pools, to reduce the local breeding potential of the insects. Midge numbers are often larger near water sources, for example ponds, bogs, and slow moving water. Moving the horse away from these areas may help to prevent further problems.|$|E
