5|$|Originally {{created for}} deer hunting, Richmond Park now has 630 red and fallow deer that roam freely within {{much of the}} park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Some deer are also killed in road accidents, through ingesting litter such as small items of plastic, or by dogs; three deer were killed by dogs in 2012. Many of the deer in Richmond Park are {{infected}} with a <b>bacterium</b> <b>called</b> Borrelia burgdorferi which can be transmitted to humans through a tick bite causing Lyme disease.|$|E

25|$|Lyme Disease {{was first}} {{described}} in Europe in 1883, the 1970s in North America and 1982 in Australia. It is an illness {{caused by a}} spiral <b>bacterium</b> <b>called</b> a spirochaete. The most common name for this spirochaete is Borrelia burgdorferi, but many different Borrelia species cause Lyme Disease worldwide. An Australian spirochaete has not been found in humans yet, and may be quite different from Borrelia burgdorferi. Despite clinical case reports, it is still controversial as to whether Lyme disease can be contracted in Australia. Some doctors and health authorities believe it does, while others are adamant that it does not. Until the controversy is resolved patients with suspected Lyme-like Disease should be treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics because early treatment of Lyme Disease invariably results in a complete cure.|$|E

50|$|The DUF84 {{region is}} found in the genome of a <b>bacterium</b> <b>called</b> Vibrio cholerae. The region {{consists}} of approximately 183 amino acid residues. V. cholorae causes cholera and stomach flu in humans. The DUF84 region alone is about 160 amino acid residues. It is the only other protein that consists of DUF84 other than PRCC1.|$|E
50|$|Early Mortality Syndrome {{disease has}} been linked to a strain of a <b>bacterium</b> <b>called</b> Vibrio parahaemolyticus which affects the Giant Tiger Prawn and the Whiteleg Shrimp, both shrimp that are {{commonly}} farmed around the world.

50|$|Psittacosis — {{also known}} as parrot fever, and ornithosis — is a {{zoonotic}} infectious disease caused by a <b>bacterium</b> <b>called</b> Chlamydophila psittaci and contracted from infected parrots, such as macaws, cockatiels and budgerigars, and pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of bird.

25|$|Certain plants, namely Fabaceae, form root nodules {{in order}} to {{associate}} and form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing <b>bacteria</b> <b>called</b> rhizobia. Due to the high energy required to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, the bacteria take carbon compounds from the plant to fuel the process. In return, the plant takes nitrogen compounds produced from ammonia by the bacteria.|$|R
25|$|Another {{example of}} a TAA is the NadA protein.

50|$|Until 1906 American foulbrood was not {{differentiated}} from European foulbrood, and {{the condition}} was simply {{referred to as}} foulbrood. Thereafter, the terms European and American were used to distinguish the diseases. However the designations do not refer to the geographical distributions but to the areas where they were first investigated scientifically. In 1907 it was demonstratedconclusively that a <b>bacterium</b> <b>called</b> Bacillus larvae {{was the cause of}} American foulbrood disease by fulfilling Koch's postulates. The geographical origin of AFB is unknown, but it is found almost worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Cord colitis {{syndrome}} is a diarrheal illness in recipients of umbilical cord blood transplant. It causes a granulomatous {{inflammation of the}} upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and responds to antimicrobial treatment including metronidazole. It was first described in 2011. In 2013, a sequencing study identified a newly discovered <b>bacterium,</b> <b>called</b> Bradyrhizobium enterica, in biopsy samples from two patients. That this bacterium is responsible for this syndrome can be suggested, but not yet confirmed. Subsequent studies showing that Bradyrhizobium species are common contaminants of laboratory kit reagents have thrown this connection into doubt.|$|E

25|$|Phosphorus can {{be removed}} biologically in a process called {{enhanced}} biological phosphorus removal. In this process, specific <b>bacteria,</b> <b>called</b> polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells (up to 20 percent of their mass). When the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from the treated water, these biosolids have a high fertilizer value.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which Agrobacterium inserts materials into the host cell by a type IV secretion system {{is very similar to}} mechanisms used by pathogens to insert materials (usually proteins) into human cells by type III secretion.
