This approach requires modification and subcloning of BAC-DNA by recombineering technologies in Escherichia coli. Most current protocols rely on commercial kits or isolation of BACs, their transfer between different host strains, and their restriction.

A targeting cassette was successfully integrated into a BAC and 42 kb of this construct were subcloned.

Similar to P1 vectors, they contain a plasmid and a lytic replicon as described above. Unlike P1 vectors, {{they do not}} need to be packaged into bacteriophage particles for transduction. Instead they are introduced into E. coli as circular DNA molecules through electroporation just as BACs are. Also similar to BACs, these are relatively harder to prepare due to a single origin of replication.|$|R

50|$|Before {{analyzing}} target genome {{structural aberration}} and copy number variation (CNV) with ESP, the target genome is usually amplified and conserved with artificial chromosome construction.

40|$|Abstract Background The Blau {{syndrome}} (MIM 186580), an {{autosomal dominant}} granulomatous disease, was previously mapped to chromosome 16 p 12 -q 21. However, inconsistent physical {{maps of the}} region and consequently an unknown order of microsatellite markers, hampered us from further refining the genetic locus for the Blau syndrome. To address this problem, we constructed our own high-resolution physical map for the Blau susceptibility region. Results We generated a high-resolution physical map that provides more than 90 % coverage of a refined Blau susceptibility region. The map consists of four contigs of sequence tagged site-based <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with a total of 124 <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and spans approximately 7. 5 Mbp; however, three gaps still exist in this map with sizes of 425, 530 and 375 kbp, respectively, estimated from radiation hybrid mapping. Conclusions Our high-resolution map will assist genetic studies of loci in the interval from D 16 S 3080, near D 16 S 409, and D 16 S 408 (16 q 12. 1 to 16 q 13) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{assembly}} of the genome sequence in M. truncatula was based on <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (BACs). This is the same approach used to sequence the genomes of humans, the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. In July 2013, version 4.0 of the genome was released. This version combined sequences gained from shotgun sequencing with the BAC-based sequence assemblies, which has helped {{to fill in the}} gaps in the previously mapped sequences.|$|R
5000|$|Gaps often remain {{after initial}} BAC contig construction. These gaps occur if the <b>Bacterial</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosome</b> (BAC) library {{screened}} has low complexity, meaning {{it does not}} contain {{a high number of}} STS or restriction sites, or if certain regions were less stable in cloning hosts and thus underrepresented in the library. [...] If gaps between contigs remain after STS landmark mapping and restriction fingerprinting have been performed, the sequencing of contig ends can be used to close these gaps. This end-sequencing strategy essentially creates a novel STS with which to screen the other contigs. Alternatively, the end sequence of a contig {{can be used as a}} primer to primer walk across the gap.|$|E

50|$|BAC (<b>Bacterial</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosome)</b> arrays were {{historically}} {{the first}} microarray platform {{to be used}} for DNA copy number analysis. This platform is used to identify gross deletions or amplifications in DNA. Such anomalies for example are common in cancer and can be used for diagnosis of many developmental disorders. Data produced by such platforms are usually low to medium resolution in terms of genome coverage. Usually, log-ratio measurements are produced by this technology to represent deviation of patient's copy number state from normal. Such measurements then are studied and those that significantly differ from zero value are announced to represent a part of a chromosome with an anomaly (an abnormal copy number state). Positive log-ratios indicate a region of DNA copy number gain and negative log-ratio values mark a region of DNA copy number loss. Even a single data point can be declared an indication of a copy number gain or a copy number loss in BAC arrays.|$|E

5000|$|Alternative {{methods of}} {{creating}} transgenes, such as utilizing yeast <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> lead to unpredictable problems. The genetic material introduced by these vectors not only leads to different expression levels, but the inserts also disrupt the original genome. HACs differ in this regard, {{as they are}} entirely separate chromosomes. This separation from existing genetic material assumes that no insertional mutants would arise. This stability and accuracy makes HACs preferable to other methods such as viral vectors, YACs and BACs. [...] HACs allow for delivery of more DNA (including promoters and copy-number variation) than is possible with viral vectors.|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, Oxford University geneticists Simon Fisher, Anthony Monaco, Cecilia S. L. Lai, Jane A. Hurst, and Faraneh Vargha-Khadem {{identified}} an {{autosomal dominant}} monogenic inheritance that is localized {{on a small}} region of chromosome 7 from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members. The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes. The locus was given the official name [...] "SPCH1" [...] (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed {{with the aid of}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> clones. Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family, but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a translocation) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region.|$|E
5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology, {{a library}} {{is a collection}} of DNA fragments that is stored and propagated in a population of micro-organisms through the process of molecular cloning. There are different types of DNA libraries, including cDNA libraries (formed from reverse-transcribed RNA), genomic libraries (formed from genomic DNA) and randomized mutant libraries (formed by de novo gene synthesis where alternative nucleotides or codons are incorporated). DNA library technology is a mainstay of current molecular biology, and the applications of these libraries depends on the source of the original DNA fragments. There are differences in the cloning vectors and techniques used in library preparation, but in general each DNA fragment is uniquely inserted into a cloning vector and the pool of recombinant DNA molecules is then transferred into a population of bacteria (a <b>Bacterial</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosome</b> or BAC library) or yeast such that each organism contains on average one construct (vector + insert). As the population of organisms is grown in culture, the DNA molecules contained within them are copied and propagated (thus, [...] "cloned").|$|E
50|$|Recent {{advances}} in biotechnology {{gave rise to}} many important techniques that are of extremely high genomic resolution and as a result, {{an increasing number of}} copy number variations in the genome have been reported. One of these {{advances in}}volve using <b>bacterial</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> (BAC) array with around 1 megabase of intervals throughout the entire gene, BACs can also detect copy number variations in rearrangement hotspots allowing for the detection of 119 novel copy number variations. Throughout the past decade or so, high throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of human genomics and in silico studies have been performed to detect copy number variations in the genome. Reference sequences have been compared to other sequences of interest using fosmids by strictly controlling the fosmid clones to be 40kb. Sequencing end reads would provide adequate information to align the reference sequence to the sequence of interest, and any misalignments are easily noticeable thus concluded to be copy number variations within that region of the clone. This type of detection technique offers a high genomic resolution and precise location of the repeat in the genome, and it can also detect other types of structural variation such as inversions.In addition, another way of detecting copy number variation that can ensure high genomic resolution is using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Since the International HapMap project had begun, common SNPs that occur between four different populations from different continents have been sequenced and located. Due to the abundance of the human SNP data, the direction of detecting copy number variation has changed to utilize these SNPs. Relying on the fact that human recombination is relatively rare and that many recombination events occur in specific regions of the genome known as recombination hotspots, linkage disequilibrium can be used to identify copy number variations. Efforts have been made in associating copy number variations with specific haplotype SNPs by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium, using these associations, one is able to recognize copy number variations in the genome using SNPs as markers. One drawback of this method is that because SNPs in the International HapMap are not optimized for detecting copy number variations, therefore the data is biased towards large copy number variations. Next-generation sequencing has also been used recently to detect copy number variations with high genomic resolutions. Using whole-genome shot-gun sequencing data, assays have been developed to accurately detect and identify regions of duplications. On the other hand, it is very challenging to detect CNAs in targeted sequencing because it is extremely unlikely that breakpoints will occur inside the scant number of regions captured by a gene panel. Thus, soft-clipped reads and discordant reads are unlikely to be found in targeted sequencing. On average, there is about 1 SNP per 800 bit/s, so over a long enough region, B-allele frequencies (BAF) can be used to detect copy number changes. However, in targeted sequencing, there are not enough heterozygous variants within a short region to detect deviations from the expected 50% BAF. Lastly, high resolution microarrays that have copy number probes as well as SNP probes are the gold standard for detecting copy number changes down to 50 kbs with whole genome coverage.Accurately detecting, identifying, and categorizing copy number variations is extremely important because of the complications they bring to DNA sequencing. Traditionally, DNA sequencing relied heavily on sequencing short reads from a large genome and using any overlapping regions of the reads to combine the short reads to form longer reads. This will eventually be mapped together to give the sequence of the entire genome. However, the issues related to copy number variations arise in linking the overlapping regions together. By definition, copy number variation is a region of the genome duplicated a variable number of times in the population and due to the large variation between the number of times portions of the genome are duplicated, when mapping overlapping sequences, it becomes unclear whether or not a region is an overlap or a duplicated region. With all the challenges faced by sequencing to detect copy number variations, high resolution microarrays are the technology of choice.|$|E
