25|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus brunneus) is {{commonly}} found in the Pacific Ocean, ranging from the northern Pacific waters {{off the coast of}} British Columbia and south to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico. They may live as far south as Ecuador and Peru. Brown catsharks are deep-water sharks that live on the outer continental shelf and the upper slope. They have been known to live at depths ranging from 30 to 650 m and live on the bottom, usually in muddy or sandy areas.|$|E
2500|$|German naturalists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider {{originally}} {{described the}} blind shark as Squalus waddi, in their 1801 Systema Ichthyologiae. However, there is uncertainty over whether their account {{was referring to}} this species or the brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum), as {{it was based on}} a painting by John Latham that could not be located by subsequent authors. In 1907, James Douglas Ogilby coined the genus Brachaelurus for this species, from the Greek brachys meaning [...] "short", and ailouros meaning [...] "cat". In 1973, Leonard Compagno placed it and the bluegrey carpetshark in their own family. This shark may also be referred to as the <b>brown</b> <b>catshark</b> or dusky dogfish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> feed on many bottom-dwelling species, {{including}} small shrimp, euphausiids, squid, {{and small}} fish. It is unknown whether <b>brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> are important predators within their ecosystem.|$|R
25|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> are {{not listed}} as {{endangered}} on the IUCN Red List or the CITES list. They {{are not known}} to be a vulnerable or threatened species. They are, however, listed on the IUCN list as needing to be reclassified. The only known negative impact that <b>brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> have on humans is the frequent bycatch of deep-water fishing trawlers, which while not economically significant, can cause damage to nets, as well as time lost in removing the bycatch from the viable catch.|$|R
25|$|Communication {{specific}} to <b>brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> is unknown. However, {{as with most}} other sharks, including {{other members of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, they are believed to have a well-developed sense of smell, and are electroreceptive, which allows them to detect electricity emitted by other animals, and may also allow them to detect magnetic fields, which aides in navigation.|$|R

50|$|The mud {{catshark}} or <b>brown</b> <b>catshark,</b> Bythaelurus lutarius, is {{a species}} of catshark in the Scyliorhinidae family. It is found in Mozambique and Somalia. Its natural habitat is the open seas of the western Indian Ocean, from Mozambique to Somalia, between latitudes 13° N and 29° S, at depths between 340 and 765 m. It can grow up to 34 cm long.|$|E

25|$|Reproduction in <b>brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> is oviparous, with {{a single}} egg at a time per oviduct. Egg cases are usually about 5cm long and 2.5cm wide. The egg cases are {{transparent}} and have long tendrils that are probably used to attach them to hard structures. The incubation period is possibly a year. In Canadian waters, females carry egg cases from February to August; however, the carrying time for warmer waters is unknown.|$|R
25|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>catsharks</b> have long, slender {{bodies with}} broad, {{bell-shaped}} snouts. They are dark brown with light-colored markings on the posterior margins of their fins. Their bodies {{are soft and}} flabby, with a weak skin that can easily be harmed. Brown catsharks' two dorsal fins are {{the same size and}} do not have spines. The first dorsal fin originates {{to the front of the}} pelvic fin and the second dorsal fin is located in front of the anal fin's insertion. They typically reach a maximum size of 68cm in total length, but they average between 30 and 60cm.|$|R
