5|$|When {{reporting}} to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River (which {{led to its}} naming), and he feared an imminent reprisal attack. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the U.S. victory clear. When no second attack came, {{the defeat of the}} Shawnee was more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks. Harrison countered <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War that continued into the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Beata {{reveals that}} {{they are aware of}} four male {{survivors}} of the Odin who have caused disruption in their society, and are considered fugitives. Beata requests Riker stay with her (and later requests that he order Troi, Data, and Yar to track down the survivors' camp and their leader Ramsey (Sam Hennings), while staying and dining with her). After some back and forth, Data concludes Ramsey and the survivors of the Odin would have platinum with them, and Angel One is naturally devoid of platinum, allowing the Enterprise to easily detect them. Meanwhile, Riker dresses in the garb given to him for his dinner with Beata, Troi and Yar taunt him for dressing in clothes that sexualize him and in some ways demean him, and he is only doing it to win favor with Beata. He responds <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> is honoring the local customs, and acknowledges Beata's beauty, and that the garb is rather comfortable.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the clarity of the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E

25|$|An {{unresolved}} contradiction was J. B. McNamara’s {{knowledge of}} the gas pipes in the Times building. After he confessed to the bombing, he insisted {{that he had not}} known of the gas pipes.

25|$|After Attlee and Greenwood left, Chamberlain asked whom {{he should}} {{recommend}} to the King as his successor. The {{version of events}} given by Churchill is that Chamberlain's preference for Halifax was obvious (Churchill implies that the spat between Churchill and the Labour benches the previous night {{had something to do}} with that); there was a long silence which Halifax eventually broke <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> did not believe he could lead the government effectively as a member of the House of Lords instead of the House of Commons. Churchill's version gets the date wrong, and he fails to mention the presence of David Margesson, the government Chief Whip.|$|E
25|$|The player {{enters the}} central chamber, {{resisting}} the Dark Fall, and recites the incantation, imprisoning it, and releasing the trapped souls. Timothy thanks him, {{and before he}} departs, tells him things may not have turned out as he thinks. All evidence of the spirits trapped by the Dark Fall throughout history disappear. The game then cuts back to the opening scene, as the player receives a message from Pete. In the message, Pete begins <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> has something very important to tell his brother, but then forgets why he rang, and says the redevelopment of the hotel is going well, {{and he will be}} home shortly.|$|E

Wilson realises what Mainwaring is implying, but the latter plays on the moment <b>by</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> was sure everything would be sorted out ... and then says nonchalantly, [...] "Perhaps you'd like to borrow my penknife!" ...|$|R
