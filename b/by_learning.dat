40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{economic}} model with wealth accumulation and human capital accumulation. The economic system consists of one production sector and one education sector. We {{take account of}} three ways of improving human capital: <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> producing, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> education, and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> consuming. The model describes a dynamic interdependence between wealth accumulation, human capital accumulation, and division of labor under perfect competition. We simulate the model to demonstrate existence of equilibrium points and motion of the dynamic system. We also examine effects {{of changes in the}} propensity to receive education, efficiency of learning, and efficiency of education upon dynamic paths of the system.

Pursued by Azula, Zuko and Iroh lead new {{lives in the}} Earth Kingdom as wanderers and refugees {{in the capital city}} of Ba Sing Se. At a library guarded by the spirit Wan Shi Tong, Aang and his group learn that an imminent solar eclipse could let them stop the Fire Nation before Sozin's Comet arrives. They journey to Ba Sing Se to inform the Earth King of this information. In the city, they find that the Earth King Kuei is being manipulated by Long Feng, leader of the Dai Li secret police. After Aang's group exposes Long Feng's political machinations, Toph is captured but manages to escape <b>by</b> <b>learning</b> to bend metal. The Dai Li join Azula to instigate a coup d'Ã©tat of Ba Sing Se, and Zuko, who has spent his time in Ba Sing Se trying {{to come to terms with}} his identity, ultimately sides with his sister Azula. During a face off in the catacombs underneath the ancient city, Azula nearly kills Aang, forcing the protagonists to retreat with help from Iroh, leaving the Earth Kingdom under the control of the Fire Nation.|$|E

The learning models compared were learning model of the Numbered Heads Together (NHT) with scientific approach, Pairs Check (PC) with scientific approach, and classical with scientific approach. This research was a quasi-experimental research. The population of the research was all of the eighth grade students of the State Junior High School in Sukoharjo. The instruments used to collect data were mathematics knowledge aspect test, mathematics skill aspect test and adversity quotient questionnaire. Technique of analyzing data that used was unbalanced two ways multivariat analysis of variance. From the research, it can be concluded that: (1) <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge and skill aspect with <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of PC with scientific approach, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge and skill aspect with <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using classical <b>learning</b> with scientific approach, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of PC with scientific approach gave better knowledge and skill aspect than <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using classical <b>learning</b> with scientific approach, (2) students who have adversity quotient of Climber gave better knowledge and skill aspect than students who have adversity quotient of Camper and Quitter, students who have adversity quotient of Camper gave the same knowledge and skill aspect with the students who have adversity quotient of Quitter, (3) on each learning model, students who have adversity quotient of Climber gave better knowledge and skill aspect than students who have adversity quotient of Camper and Quitter, students who have adversity quotient of Camper gave the same knowledge and skill aspect with the students who have adversity quotient of Quitter, (4) on each adversity quotient, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge and skill aspect with <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of PC with scientific approach, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of NHT with scientific approach gave the same knowledge and skill aspect with <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using classical <b>learning</b> with scientific approach, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using cooperative <b>learning</b> model of PC with scientific approach gave better knowledge and skill aspect than <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> using classical <b>learning</b> with scientific approach...|$|R
5|$|Cantonese people, {{like the}} Hakka, were well known {{throughout}} Southeast Asia as mineworkers.

They migrated to Java {{about the same time as}} the Hakka, but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities they became artisans, machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago, and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.|$|E

Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter <b>by</b> <b>learning</b> that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E

His military successes spared his life, but cost him his command; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557. It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars, who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before {{the rise of the}} GÃ¶ktÃ¼rks, asked for imperial protection and for land to settle on. Justin forwarded them to Constantinople, where they arrived in December. Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian, the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561/562. There they again encountered Justin, who had just been transferred to the command of the quaestura exercitus covering the lower Danubian limes (the Limes Moesiae). At this time, the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor, whose defences had been devastated by a recent Kotrigur invasion led by Zabergan. Here, Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame, <b>by</b> <b>learning</b> of the Avars' intentions and warning Justinian. Consequently, the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order. With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river, the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium, and left the Empire in peace for some years to come.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Machine learning, a {{cornerstone}} of intelligent systems, has typically been studied {{in the context of}} specific tasks, including clus-tering (unsupervised learning), classification (supervised learning), and control (reinforcement learning). This paper presents a learning archi-tecture within which a universal adaptation mechanism unifies a rich set of traditionally distinct learning paradigms, including <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> matching, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> association, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> instruction, and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> reinforcement. In accordance with the notion of embodied intelli-gence, such a learning theory provides a computational account of how an autonomous agent may acquire the knowledge of its environment in a real-time, incremental, and continuous manner. Through a case study on a minefield navigation domain, we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model, the learning paradigms encompassed, and the various types of knowledge learned. ...|$|R
