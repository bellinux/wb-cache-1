40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic {{economic}} model with wealth accumulation and human capital accumulation. The economic system consists of one production sector and one education sector. We {{take account of}} three ways of improving human capital: <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> producing, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> education, and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> consuming. The model describes a dynamic interdependence between wealth accumulation, human capital accumulation, and division of labor under perfect competition. We simulate the model to demonstrate existence of equilibrium points and motion of the dynamic system. We also examine effects {{of changes in the}} propensity to receive education, efficiency of learning, and efficiency of education upon dynamic paths of the system.

Eleanor later learned that FDR's mistress Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd had been {{with him when he}} died, a discovery made more bitter <b>by</b> <b>learning</b> that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the President and Rutherfurd. It was Anna who told her that Franklin had been with Lucy when he died; in addition, she told her that Franklin had continued the relationship for decades, and people surrounding him had hidden the information from Eleanor. After the funeral, Eleanor temporarily returned to Val-Kill. Franklin left instructions for Eleanor in the event of his death; he proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum, and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer. After FDR's death, Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village. In 1950, she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel (202 West 56th Street). She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street. When that lease expired in 1958, she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David Gurewitsch at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated. The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12, 1946, setting a precedent for future presidential libraries.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, an {{imperial}} investigation into Gubazes's murder {{brought to light}} Martin's culpability. His military successes spared his life, but cost him his command; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557. It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars, who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before {{the rise of the}} Göktürks, asked for imperial protection and for land to settle on. Justin forwarded them to Constantinople, where they arrived in December. Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian, the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561/562. There they again encountered Justin, who had just been transferred to the command of the quaestura exercitus covering the lower Danubian limes (the Limes Moesiae). At this time, the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor, whose defences had been devastated by a recent Kotrigur invasion led by Zabergan. Here, Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame, <b>by</b> <b>learning</b> of the Avars' intentions and warning Justinian. Consequently, the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order. With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river, the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium, and left the Empire in peace for some years to come.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Machine learning, a {{cornerstone}} of intelligent systems, has typically been studied {{in the context of}} specific tasks, including clus-tering (unsupervised learning), classification (supervised learning), and control (reinforcement learning). This paper presents a learning archi-tecture within which a universal adaptation mechanism unifies a rich set of traditionally distinct learning paradigms, including <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> matching, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> association, <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> instruction, and <b>learning</b> <b>by</b> reinforcement. In accordance with the notion of embodied intelli-gence, such a learning theory provides a computational account of how an autonomous agent may acquire the knowledge of its environment in a real-time, incremental, and continuous manner. Through a case study on a minefield navigation domain, we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model, the learning paradigms encompassed, and the various types of knowledge learned. ...|$|R
