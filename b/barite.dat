5|$|The {{abundance}} of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is <b>barite</b> (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits {{in many parts}} of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than <b>barite,</b> is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.|$|E
5|$|The <b>barite</b> {{reserves}} are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion tonnes. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, {{was produced in}} 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds. <b>Barite</b> production has risen since {{the second half of}} the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).|$|E

40|$|The Sr isotope {{ratios of}} <b>barites,</b> karst calcites, limestones and schists from four mineralisations of the Palaeozoic Moroccan Meseta were determined. The Sr isotope ratios of <b>barites,</b> ranging from 0. 71077 +/-(4) to 0. 71714 +/-(3), do not {{distinguish}} {{among the four}} mineralizations, indicating a common origin for the radiogenic Sr involved. This latter was derived mainly from leaching of pre-Hercynian schists during the Hercynian orogenesis. The Sr isotope ratios of Primary limestones {{are similar to the}} ratios of the associated <b>barites,</b> showing that these rocks underwent metamorphic recrystallisation during the Hercynian orogenesis and that the radiogenic Sr involved was derived from the same source(s) as for the <b>barites.</b> This conclusion also explains the isotopic signature of karst calcites in Primary limestones, which formed after limestone recrystallisation. Finally, the comparison of the Sr isotope ratios of Moroccan <b>barites</b> and hydrothermal Hercynian <b>barites</b> from Sardinia and Bavaria shows overlapping values, suggesting that the radiogenic Sr involved in the crystallisation of these minerals was mainly derived from pre-Hercynian schists.

40|$|The Paya <b>Barites</b> deposit typifies the {{numerous}} small (hidden) and uninvestigated <b>barites</b> mineralization that abound within the Benue Trough, Nigeria. Geological field studies and geochemical analysis of soils around the mineralized ridge was carried in order understand the general structural trend {{as well as}} assessing the trace elements distribution. Results of field geological investigations indicate <b>Barites</b> mineralization in vein systems, occurring as infillings in joints and fractures within an East – West trending ridge. Trace element geochemistry of soils overlying these veins revealed relative high values of Pb, Mn, Cu and Sr around the zone of mineralization. However, average Ba content of soils overlying the <b>barites</b> veins is similar in content to the regional background values indicating that the soils overlying the mineralized veins are not enriched in barium (Ba).

5|$|Vanadinite is an {{uncommon}} mineral, only occurring {{as the result}} of chemical alterations to a pre-existing material. It is therefore known as a secondary mineral.

5|$|In {{terms of}} mineral resources, the Goat Rocks area {{can be divided}} into three segments, each rich with certain minerals. The first two are named Packwood Glacier–McCall Basin and Glacier Basin, and are located near past {{volcanic}} vents. These areas exhibit anomalous levels of cobalt, copper, lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, well-dispersed levels of pyrite, and sporadic concentrations of silver. Area C corresponds to the Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and lies along the area of contact between Goat Rocks volcano and older volcanoes to the east. It is distinct from the other two study areas, featuring anomalous amounts of barium, cobalt, copper, and manganese, as well as smaller quantities of lead, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc. Other minerals found in Area C include <b>barite,</b> boron, cinnabar, mercury, pyrite, and tin in concentrates taken from stream-sediment. The water has high concentrations of chlorine, copper, fluorine, and molybdenum, and altered rocks contain arsenic, lead, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc at especially high levels. The Goat Rocks vicinity seems to offer large base metal deposits. Outside the area studied, coal has been identified at the Packwood and Cowlitz fields, and building stones and gravel are being quarried to the north and west of the volcano. The Goat Rocks area's potential resources for oil and gas remain unidentified. Because no volcanic activity has occurred during the Holocene (within the past 11,700 years), Goat Rocks has very little potential for geothermal resources.|$|E

25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The <b>barite</b> group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include <b>barite</b> (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and anglesite (PbSO4); anhydrite {{is not part of the}} <b>barite</b> group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E

40|$|Several <b>barites</b> {{from the}} lead-barite {{district}} in southeast Missouri contain between 1, 170 and 1, 688 ppm Sr. Their S 7 Sr/S 6 Sr ratios range from 0. 7098 to 0. 7118, {{in contrast to}} the values of 0. 7082 to 0. 7089 for the host carbonate rocks. The origin of <b>barites</b> is explained in terms of mixing of two isotopically and chemically different fluids. Four galenas from the Viburnum mine in Southeast Missouri provide a Rb-Sr age of 892 + _ 21 m. y. and an initial isotopic composition of 0. 7104 + _ 0. 0004, indicating the period of mineralization to be early Devonian. The Sr isotope data from a galena from the lead-barite district tend to indicate a similar age. Data from calcites in association with galenas from the Viburnum mine suggest that the Sr isotopic composition of the fluids varied appreciably during deposition of the ore...|$|R
