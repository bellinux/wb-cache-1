One preinfusion and 15 postinfusion serum samples and total urine output were collected over one dosing interval between days 3 and 8 of therapy. Cefepime concentrations in serum over time exhibited a multicompartmental profile. Peak and trough concentrations in serum determined by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method were 71. 2 +/- 17. 2 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 6. 0 +/- 4. 9 mg/liter, respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution was 0. 22 +/- 0. 05 liter/kg.

50|$|The total <b>body</b> <b>{{clearance}}</b> will {{be equal}} to the renal clearance + hepatic clearance + lung clearance. Although for many drugs the clearance is simply considered as the renal excretion ability, that is, {{the rate at which}} waste substances are cleared from the blood by the kidney. In these cases clearance is almost synonymous with renal clearance or renal plasma clearance. Each substance has a specific clearance that depends on its filtration characteristics. Clearance is a function of glomerular filtration, secretion from the peritubular capillaries to the nephron, and re-absorption from the nephron back to the peritubular capillaries. Clearance is variable in zero-order kinetics because a constant amount of the drug is eliminated per unit time, but it is constant in first-order kinetics, because the amount of drug eliminated per unit time changes with the concentration of drug in the blood. The concept of clearance was described by Thomas Addis, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School.|$|E

However, besides the numerous advantages of their use for this purpose, some potential drawbacks also exist, including reported poor penetration of drugs into the inner cell layers of slices and loss of metabolic capacity during prolonged incubation, leading to underprediction of metabolic clearance. In the present study, we empirically identified (and quantified) sources of underprediction using rat tissue slices of lung, intestine, kidney, and liver and found that thin liver slices (+/- 100 mu m) metabolized model substrates (7 - hydroxycoumarin, testosterone, warfarin, 7 - ethoxycoumarin, midazolam, haloperidol, and quinidine) as rapidly as isolated hepatocytes. Furthermore, it was found that organ slices remain metabolically active for sufficient periods of incubation, enabling study of the kinetics of low clearance compounds. In addition, we determined the influence of albumin on the clearance prediction of six model substrates.

A high-performance liquid chromatography method {{was used to determine}} AM concentrations in serum. AM pharmacokinetics followed a one-compartment open model. The glomerular filtration rates of all patients were simultaneously studied by means of the 24 -h continuous inulin infusion technique. The elimination half-life, apparent volume of distribution, and total <b>body</b> <b>clearance</b> of AM (mean +/- standard deviation) were 6. 7 +/- 1. 7 h, 584 +/- 173 ml, and 62. 4 +/- 23. 3 ml/h, respectively. The mean (+/- standard deviation) AM peak and trough levels were 53. 6 +/- 9. 1 and 16. 0 +/- 4. 9 mg/liter, respectively. All infants had a serum trough level above 5 mg/liter. The total <b>body</b> <b>clearance</b> and apparent volume of distribution of AM and the clearance of inulin increased significantly with increasing gestational age. The total <b>body</b> <b>clearance</b> of AM (1. 0 +/- 0. 4 ml/min) and the clearance of inulin (1. 0 +/- 0. 3 ml/min) were similar. The total <b>body</b> <b>clearance</b> of AM increased significantly with increasing clearance of inulin. We conclude that an AM dose of 25 mg/kg every 12 h given to preterm infants {{in the first week of}} life with gestational ages of less than 32 weeks results in serum levels well above the MIC for major microorganisms involved in neonatal infections...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the adequate loading and maintenance doses of N-acetylcyseteine (NAC) for patients suffering from acute ROS-induced injury. Methods: Concentrations of extra cellular NAC, cysteine (Cys), cystine (Cyst 2), and methionine (Met) were measured in vitro, at which more than 50 % of the intracellular ROS raised by paraquat were suppressed using Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study followed on a healthy subject to determine the proper loading and maintenance doses of reduced NAC following intravenous administration of 25 mg/kg NAC. Results: In vivo, NAC suppressed ROS in a dose dependant manner. 10 mM of NAC suppressed about 50 % of ROS, and was comparable to 10 μM of Cys and Met and 400 μM of Cys 2. In vitro, the elimination of half‐life was achieved at 2. 88 ± 1. 14 h for NAC and at 3. 68 ± 1. 84 h for total NAC. The <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> were 1. 23 ± 0. 77 L h- 1 kg- 1 and 0. 56 ± 0. 27 L h- 1 kg- 1 and the volumes of distribution were 3. 07 ± 0. 10 L kg- 1 and 3. 00 ± 0. 11 L kg- 1, respectively. The loading and maintenance NAC doses used to reach the target concentration of 10 mM, were 5010 mg. kg- 1 and 2250 mg min- 1 kg- 1, respectively Conclusion: NAC provides an antioxidant effect on ROS produced by paraquat in vivo. However, in vitro, our results showed that the intravenous NAC dose could not be estimated from NAC plasma concentration or it...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of isepamicin following {{administration of}} a 1 -g dose were evaluated for 18 healthy male volunteers {{between the ages}} of 26 and 38. In a randomized crossover fashion, each volunteer received doses of isepamicin by a 30 -min intravenous infusion and as an intramuscular injection. Blood samples were collected at specified times after dosing and assayed for isepamicin by a validated radioimmunoassay method. The individual plasma concentration-time curves were analyzed by noncompartmental methods. In general, the pharmacokinetics after intravenous infusion and intramuscular injection were similar. As expected, the maximum concentration of isepamicin in serum following intramuscular injection (37. 2 microg/ml) was lower than the observed concentration at the end of infusion (66. 7 microg/ml). The areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity following intramuscular and intravenous administration were 164. 8 and 154. 5 microg x hr/ml, respectively, indicating complete absorption following intramuscular administration. The respective mean terminal-phase half-life (t 1 / 2) values were 2. 6 and 3. 6 h. Although t 1 / 2 was slightly longer following intravenous infusion, the small difference in the observed t 1 / 2 values was not considered to be clinically significant. Total <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> following intramuscular injection and intravenous infusion were 1. 3 and 1. 4 ml/min/kg, respectively, which were similar to renal serum creatinine clearances in healthy volunteers (> 1. 14 ml/min/kg). The drug was safe and well tolerated. The {{results of the present study}} clearly show complete absorption of isepamicin following intramuscular administration. The similarity in the pharmacokinetics after intravenous infusion and intramuscular dosing would permit interchangeable administration of isepamicin by either route without compromising clinical efficacy...|$|R
40|$|The major {{determinants}} of urea production were investigated in 26 patients with multiple trauma (300 studies). The <b>body</b> <b>clearances</b> (CLRs) of ten amino acids (AAs) were estimated as {{a ratio of}} muscle-released AAs plus total parenteral nutrition-infused AAs to their extracellular pool. While clinically septic trauma (ST) patients without multiple-organ failure syndrome (MOFS) had {{a higher level of}} urea nitrogen production (25. 6 +/- 13. 4 g of N per day) compared with nonseptic trauma (NST) patients (14 +/- 7. 5 g of N per day) and with ST patients with MOFS (4. 28 +/- 1. 5 g of N per day), in all groups urea N production was found to be a function of muscle protein degradation (catabolism), total parenteral nutrition-administered AAs, and the ratio between leucine CLR and tyrosine CLR (L/T) (r 2 =. 82, P less than. 0001). Since tyrosine is cleared almost exclusively by the liver, the L/T ratio may be regarded as an index of hepatic function. The significant differences between urea N production in ST and NST patients lay in an increased positive dependence on muscle catabolism and increased negative correlation with L/T in the ST group. At any L/T ratio, urea N production was increased in ST patients over NST patients, but in ST patients with MOFS, it fell to or below levels of NST patients. These data show that the ST process is associated with enhancement of ureagenesis, due to increased hepatic CLR of both exogenous and endogenous AAs. In sepsis with MOFS, a marked inhibition of urea synthesis occurs, partially explained by a decreased hepatic CLR of non-branched-chain AAs...|$|R
