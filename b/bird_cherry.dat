5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, <b>bird</b> <b>cherry,</b> and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E
25|$|The bird cherry-oat aphid is {{an example}} of a host-alternating species (as implied by the double name), that starts its life cycle with a large, highly fecund fundatrix. Her {{offspring}} then proceed to grow and produce emigrants which develop on the <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> before flying to the oat species where they continue feeding. The subsequent apterous exules feed solely on the oats and eventually lead to growth of gynoparae which will return to the <b>bird</b> <b>cherry,</b> where they will produce males and oviparae, which in turn will reproduce, giving eggs for the next year.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{the parks}} and {{environment-friendly}} policies, the Pavlovsk area has relatively low level of pollution. In 1978–1983 the Pavlovsk Park contained more than 360,000 trees of 54 species: 16 species of spruce, pine, larch and fir, two species of birch, two species of willow, two of basswood, oaks, elm, alder, aspen, European rowan, <b>bird</b> <b>cherry,</b> 88 shrub species, of which the dominant were yellow acacia, meadowsweet and dogwoods. In 1978, there were 71 species of birds belonging to 28 families and 9 orders. Mammals include squirrels, hares, weasels, stoats, moles, shrews, hedgehogs, red voles and muskrats. In winter, the parks are sometimes visited by fox, wild boar and moose. Amphibians and reptiles are mostly frogs, toads and lizards. There are 87 species of insects belonging to 46 families.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole of}} the island is covered with dense forests, mostly coniferous. The Yezo (or Yeddo) spruce (Picea jezoensis), the Sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinensis) and the Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii) are the chief trees; on the upper parts of the {{mountains}} are the Siberian dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) and the Kurile bamboo (Sasa kurilensis). Birches, both Siberian silver birch (Betula platyphylla) and Erman's birch (B. ermanii), poplar, elm, <b>bird</b> <b>cherry</b> (Prunus padus), Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata) and several willows are mixed with the conifers; while farther south the maple, rowan and oak, as also the Japanese Panax ricinifolium, the Amur cork tree (Phellodendron amurense), the Spindle (Euonymus macropterus) and the vine (Vitis thunbergii) make their appearance. The underwoods abound in berry-bearing plants (e.g. cloudberry, cranberry, crowberry, red whortleberry), red-berried elder (Sambucus racemosa), wild raspberry and Spiraea.|$|E

2500|$|Along a {{gradient}} {{from north}} (Zanavykai) to south (Kapsai and Dzūkija) the stressed first component of mixed diphthongs ul, um, un, ur, il, im, in, and ir, [...] changes from short to semi-long to long (from kúlt to kùlt to kūlc – to thresh, from pírmas to pìrmas to pyrmas – first, from pínti to pìnti to pync – to braid). Kapsai tend to modify word beginnings. If a word starts in ei or e, they often {{replace it with}} ai or a (aik instead of eik – go, ažeras instead of ežeras – lake). Zanavykai also modify vowels, but {{in the other direction}} (ekmuo replaces akmuo – stone, ešis instead of ašis – axis). Kapsai often add a v to words that, in standard Lithuanian, start with uo, u, or o (vuoga instead of uoga – berry, voras instead of oras – air) and j to words that start with i, y, or i.e. (jilgas instead of ilgas – long, jieva instead of ieva – <b>bird</b> <b>cherry).</b> [...] Zanavykai tend to shorten words. They often drop n from verbs (gyvek instead of gyvenk – live!) and truncate the past tense form of verbs (žino instead of žinojo – he [...] knew, galė instead of galėjo – he could, ė instead of ėjo – he walked). Zanavykai also preserved some archaic forms and rules of declension, especially in pronominal pronouns, and of conjugation, especially in dual verbs.|$|E

50|$|Wuchang has {{the largest}} lake within a city in China, the East Lake, {{as well as the}} South Lake. The east lake in Wuhan is 6 {{times the size of the}} west lake in Hangzhou. The total area is more than 80 km2 of which the lake is {{covering}} an area of 33 km2. In the spring time the shores of East Lake become a garden of flowers with the Mei blossoms as the king and the Cherry Blossom as the queen among the species. Another famous flower is the lotus. The lake has a long history and especially the Chu Kingdom is well represented around East Lake. At East Lake you find fascinating gardens like the Mei Blossom Garden, Forest of the <b>Birds,</b> <b>Cherry</b> Blossom Garden and monuments from ancient times, beautiful hills and green nature. Moreover, in the Moshan Botanic Garden there are many types of plum blossoms, as well as lotus flowers.|$|R

25|$|Asian {{black bears}} are omnivorous, and will feed on insects, beetle larvae, invertebrates, termites, grubs, carrion, bees, eggs, garbage, mushrooms, grasses, fruits, nuts, seeds, honey, herbs, acorns, cherries, dogwood, and grain. Though herbivorous {{to a greater}} degree than brown bears, and more {{carnivorous}} than American black bears, Asian black bears are not as specialised in their diet as pandas are: while pandas depend on a constant supply of low calorie, yet abundant foodstuffs, black bears are more opportunistic and have opted for a nutritional boom-or-bust economy. They thus gorge themselves on a variety of seasonal high calorie foods, storing the excess calories as fat, and then hibernate during times of scarcity. Black bears will eat pine nuts and acorns of the previous year in the April–May period. In times of scarcity, they enter river valleys to gain access to hazelnuts and insect larvae in rotting logs. From mid-May through late June, they will supplement their diet with green vegetation and fruit. Through July to September, they will climb trees to eat <b>bird</b> <b>cherries,</b> pine cones, vines and grapes. On rare occasions they will eat dead fish during the spawning season, though this constitutes a much lesser portion of their diet than in brown bears. In the 1970s, black bears were reported to kill and eat Hanuman langurs in Nepal. They appear to be more carnivorous than most other bears, including American black bears, and will kill ungulates with some regularity, including domestic livestock. Wild ungulate prey can include muntjacs, serow, takin, wild boar and adult water buffaloes, which they kill by breaking their necks.|$|R

40|$|Ripening {{cherries}} {{are often}} highly susceptible to damage by {{many species of}} birds. According to a survey conducted by Stone (in press) in 1972, birds damaged about 16 percent of the tart cherry crop in Michigan. Sweet cherries are {{generally considered to be}} even more vulnerable to <b>birds</b> than tart <b>cherries.</b> Since most <b>birds</b> that damage <b>cherries</b> are of desirable species, nonlethal means must be used to protect the crop. However, most of the mechanical or physical techniques used in the past are costly, time-consuming, or effective only for short periods. Recently an experimental insecticide, methiocarb [4 -(methylthio) - 3, 5 -xylyl N-methylcarbamate], proved to be an effective bird repellent for many crops (Guarino, 1972). In 1971, tests were conducted in Michigan to determine whether an insecticidal level of methiocarb (1 1 b. per 100 gal water) would reduce bird damage to ripening sweet cherries of the Mazzard variety (Prunus avium) and ripening European wild tart <b>cherries</b> (P. mahaleb); <b>bird</b> damage was reduced more than 60 percent in treated trees in both orchards (Guarino et al., in press). In 1972, we conducted a follow-up test to determine the effectiveness of a lower concentration of methiocarb on ripening sweet cherries...|$|R

The old Marquis was more sad and melancholy than he had used to be among his beloved <b>birds</b> and <b>cherry</b> trees at Durbellière; and, on this occasion, he was probably the saddest of the party, for {{he was the one who}} would have rejoiced the most that the wedding of his son should be an occasion of joy to relatives, servants, tenants, and the numerous neighbours among whom he had always lived with so much mutual affection.|$|R

60|$|It was a grievous {{thing to}} tell that old man that he must leave the house, where he had spent his quiet life, and go to strange places, to finish the short {{remainder}} of his days amid the turmoil of battles, and the continual troubles and dangers of a moving army.

But his children soon made him understand that it was impossible that they could abandon him, a cripple as he was, unattended, and exposed to the certain fury of the republicans. He yielded, therefore, and when the sad day came, he blamed no one, as they lifted him into the huge carriage, in which he was removed to Chatillon. To the last he was proudly loyal to the King; and, as he was carried over the threshold of his door, he said, that if God would grant him another favour in this world, it would be, that he might return once more to his own home, to welcome there some scion of his royal master's house.|$|R
