Five Design Programs; Communication, Advertising, Environmental and Interior Design, Industrial and Interactive Design, and Fashion; reside permanently in the newly renovated facilities, fittingly called The Warehouse, which was renovated by Gluckman Mayner Architects. <b>Both</b> <b>programs</b> were chosen to {{be located in the}} downtown area because of their history of working on projects directly with the community. The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits, and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls and Huskies {{had been}} {{frequent}} opponents {{during the previous}} decade as <b>both</b> <b>programs</b> made the transition from Division I-AA to Division I-A. The two teams played each other in six consecutive seasons from 1999 to 2005, with Connecticut winning {{five of the six}} contents. The 2005 game, won by UConn 38–0, was the most recent meeting between the two teams. Overall, the Huskies and Bulls had played each other 16 times since their first meeting in 1939, with Connecticut holding a 12–4 advantage in the all-time series. Prior to the 2008 season, Buffalo and UConn had signed a contract to play a four-game, home-and-home series beginning in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Citys {{first season}} {{commenced}} airing on December 29, 2008, {{one week after}} the fourth-season finale of The Hills. The series continued to air on Monday evenings until its midseason finale on March 16, 2009, at which point it had aired thirteen episodes. Rather than ordering an official second season, MTV included an additional ten episodes to the first season. The extension premiered on September 29, 2009, where it was moved to the Tuesday night timeslot, and concluded on December 1, 2009. The second season premiered on April 27, 2010, after the sixth-season premiere of The Hills. <b>Both</b> <b>programs</b> held the Tuesday evening timeslot; both concluded after twelve episodes on July 13, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} first {{broadcast}} in January, {{a month of}} low television activity in Argentina because of the summer vacations. Nevertheless, it was highly successful. The competitor channel Telefe aired the teen comedy Alma Pirata, which was rescheduled because of its low ratings, {{and replaced it with}} the second season of Casados con Hijos. <b>Both</b> <b>programs</b> had similar ratings until the end of Casados con Hijos in August. With an average rating of 26.8 points, Sos mi vida ended as the most watched Argentine television fiction so far; it was displaced by the 2009 telenovela Valientes, which received 27.3 rating points.|$|E

Triple H defeated Flair at Survivor Series after Flair was unable to respond to a ten count. The feud between the Raw and SmackDown! brands continued with Eric Bischoff and Theodore Long deciding on a 5-on-5 elimination match and a singles match between the two at Survivor Series. The teams feuded on <b>both</b> <b>programs.</b> At Survivor Series, Team SmackDown! (Batista, Rey Mysterio, JBL, Bobby Lashley, and Randy Orton) defeated Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Kane, The Big Show, Carlito, and Chris Masters) and Long defeated Bischoff.|$|E
5|$|West Virginia {{has often}} been called Maryland's biggest rival, and the teams have met 51 times since their first game in 1919. The Maryland-West Virginia rivalry had a chance of {{becoming}} an annual game with West Virginia potentially joining the ACC in 2012, but the Mountaineers wound up joining the Big 12 Conference. In 2001, <b>both</b> <b>programs</b> hired new head coaches, with West Virginia being taken over by Rich Rodriguez. Due to their proximity, the schools regularly raid their opponent's recruiting areas. The long-running series was put on hiatus for the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but resumed in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the early years}} of the Big 12, above all when the tenures of Rick Barnes and Eddie Sutton coincided at the two schools, a time when <b>both</b> <b>programs</b> were nationally prominent. From the 1999–2000 season through the 2004–05 season, at least one of the two teams was ranked in 13 of 14 total contests, and both teams were ranked at the time of eight of the 14 meetings. In recent years, the rivalry has {{declined}} in intensity as <b>both</b> <b>programs</b> have receded from the national spotlight.|$|E
