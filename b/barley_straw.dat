60|$|The scene now {{represents}} {{a room of}} ten feet square, the floor of which is sunk a yard or two {{below the level of}} the ground; the walls are covered with a dirty and crumbling plaster, on which appear a crowd of ill-favored and lugubrious faces done in charcoal, and the autographs and poetical attempts of a long succession of debtors and petty criminals. Other features of the apartment are a deep fireplace (superfluous in the sultriness of the summer's day), a door of hard-hearted oak, and a narrow window high in the wall,--where the glass has long been broken, while the iron bars retain all their original strength. Through this opening come the sound of passing footsteps in the public street, and the voices of children at play. The furniture consists of a bed, or rather an old sack of <b>barley</b> <b>straw,</b> thrown down in the corner farthest from the door, and a chair and table, both aged and infirm, and leaning {{against the side of the}} room, besides lending a friendly support to each other. The atmosphere is stifled and of an ill smell, as if it had been kept close prisoner for half a century, and had lost all its pure and elastic nature by feeding the tainted breath of the vicious and the sighs of the unfortunate. Such is the present abode of the man of medicine and politics, and his own appearance forms no contrast to the accompaniments. His wig is unpowdered, out of curl, and put on awry; the dust of many weeks has worked its way into the web of his coat and small-clothes, and his knees and elbows peep forth to ask why they are so ill clad; his stockings are ungartered, his shoes down at the heel, his waistcoat is without a button, and discloses a shirt as dingy as the remnant of snow in a showery April day. His shoulders have become rounder, and his whole person is more bent and drawn together, since we last saw him, and his face has exchanged the glory of wit and humor for a sheepish dulness. At intervals, the Doctor walks the room, with an irregular and shuffling pace; anon, he throws himself flat on the sack of <b>barley</b> <b>straw,</b> muttering very reprehensible expressions between his teeth; then again he starts to his feet, and journeying from corner to corner, finally sinks into the chair, forgetful of its three-legged infirmity till it lets him down upon the floor. The grated window, his only medium of intercourse with the world, serves but to admit additional vexations. Every few moments the steps of the passengers are heard to pause, and some well-known face appears in the free sunshine behind the iron bars, brimful of mirth and drollery, the owner whereof stands on tiptoe to tickle poor Dr. Bullivant with a stinging sarcasm. Then laugh the little boys around the prison door, and the wag goes chuckling away. The apothecary would fain retaliate, but all his quips and repartees, and sharp and facetious fancies, once so abundant, seem to have been transferred from himself to the sluggish brains of his enemies.

40|$|The mesophyllic fungus Trichoderma reesei (anamorph to Hypocrea jecorina) is an important biotechnological tool, {{known for}} its ability to secrete large {{quantities}} of hydrolytic enzymes. Renewable biomass, such as agricultural and forest wastes are used to produce microbial enzymes in various industrial processes such as food, feed and bioethanol industries. In raw biomass materials, such as wheat <b>straws,</b> <b>barley</b> <b>straws</b> and maize stalks, the main polysaccharide is cellulose which is closely associated with hemicelluloses like xylan, manan and xyloguclan. In consequence, the hydrolysis of these materials requires the concerted action of several enzymes, namely cellulases and xylanases. Endo-xylanase (endo- 1, 4 [...] xylanase, EC 3. 2. 1. 8) is the key enzyme involved in xylan hydrolysis, the main hemicellulosic component of plant cell walls. The metabolic activity and enzyme productivity of Trichoderma reesei is influenced by various environmental conditions. In this context, we analysed the effect of pH, cultivation period, the nature of the substrate used and the nitrogen source on enzymatic activity. The maximum xylanase yield was recorded at a initial pH of 4 (116. 189 IU/ml) for barley and 5 for wheat (88. 578 IU/ml), respectively maize (116. 583 IU/ml).

Sewage sludge loading rates higher than three times the recommended plant-available N rate decreased barley stands in the seedling stage. The loss of stand was compensated for by higher tillering later in the season. High sludge loading rates tended to delay maturity, increase tillering and increase straw yield; however, they did not affect grain yield.

These techniques have only partially been studied in an extensive way. This paper describes a floodwater harvesting and spreading system for spate irrigation and field experiments for cultivation of barley. The field experiments were carried out during a three-year period. The area is noteworthy for its erratic and scarce rainfall. Due to the scarce and late rainfall, only in the second year experiment barley yield was achieved. On December 5, 2009, barley was planted in one trial plot and subsequently received spate irrigation on December 8.

It was found that saccharification of cellulose materials, especially of bog-moss is well achieved, if they are removed of humic acid beforehand with diluted ammonia and hydrolysed fractionally. Among various strains of yeasts, a kind of distilley yeast suitable for fermentation of saccharified solution was selected, and no inhibitting substance to the yeast was detected, though 0. 82 g of furfurol, 0. 021 g of hydroxymethylfurfurol and 3. 25 g of volatile acids were produced by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree in the saccharified solutions. Sugars in the solutions were investigated by the method of paper chromatograph {{and the presence of}} glucose, mannose, arabinose and xylose was verified. Thus, in decomposing 100 g of bog-moss by dilute acid at 130 ℃ and 150 ℃, about 30 g of sugars was obtained and then about 9 g of alcohol was produced by fermentation of saccharified solution. About 33 g of sugar and then about 10 g of alcohol were obtained by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree with dilute acid at 180 ℃. Production of yeast from the saccharified solutions was investigated, especially pentose-assimilable yeasts (isolated by the author and named Torulopsis xylinus). In saccharified solutions from 100 g of bog-moss or mulberry tree, about 9. 5 g or 8. 9 g of yeast was produced respectively. In order to know the availability of constituents of the spent wash, distilly waste liquor of the alcohol solution obtained from the saccharified solution of mulberry tree, experiments were carried out. During 120 hours ordinary culture, 1 / 3 parts of reducing sugars, including more than 2 / 3 parts of pentose, were consumed. It was pointed out that small amount of organic matters other than sugars was assimilated. No remarkable multiplication of yeasts took place with sulphite pulp waste liquor from which most of SO_ 2 was expelled by aeration and the remaining SO_ 2 was precipitated by adding calcium hydroxide to pH to 5. 6 by sulphuric acid, while noticeable crop yields of the yeasts were obtained. The chemical compositions of Torulopsis xylinus (7 - 9 % of ash, 43 - 47 % of crude protein and 0. 69 mg% of vitamin B_ 1) thus obtained were found to be very much the same with Torula utilis obtained from spent washes or pulp waste liquors. Production of fat with the saccharified solution of mulberry tree was carried out by the yeast (isolated by the author and named Rhodotorula mucilaginosa var.). It was found that at the first stage of fermentation (72 hours incubation) the immediate yeast population was larger in xylose or saccharified solutions as sources of carbon than in other sugars and at the second stage of fermentation (subsequent 24 hours incubation and the stage of fat production from glucose added) fat yield was also greater in the former.
