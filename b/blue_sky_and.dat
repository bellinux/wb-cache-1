5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, who claimed that the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white saltire appeared in the <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen. Consisting of a blue background over which is placed a white representation of an X-shaped cross, the Saltire is one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.|$|E

5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the <b>blue</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} types of monsoons in the state. The {{southwest}} monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 knots. The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres. During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> cooling wind.|$|E

25|$|Frisch's {{investigation}} of a bee’s powers of orientation were significant. He discovered that bees can recognize the desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the <b>blue</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> by the earth’s magnetic field, whereby the sun is used as the main compass, with the alternatives reserved for the conditions arising under cloudy skies or within a dark beehive.|$|E

25|$|Torquay United {{went through}} various team colours before {{settling}} on the familiar yellow and blue of today. In the club's formative days they played in a light and dark blue kit, before switching to {{a black and white}} striped kit reminiscent of a modern day Newcastle United kit. This identity change led to the club being dubbed 'the magpies'. The magpies played in this colour scheme until the club opted for a fresh identity In 1954. United based their new image around the town's traditional seaside character and they chose a more distinctive yellow, or gold and blue kit. The new colours were chosen to represented the area's golden sands and <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> sea.|$|E

25|$|In the Torah the Israelites are {{commanded}} to dye one of {{the threads}} of their tallit (prayer shawl) with tekhelet; {{when they look at}} this dye they will think of the <b>blue</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>and</b> of the God above them in Heaven. Tekhelet corresponds to the color of the divine revelation (Midrash Numbers Rabbah xv.) Blue in Judaism has thus had an important significance throughout the history of Jewish culture up to the present. Blue was also associated with the ten commandments. When Moses and the elders went up the mount Sinai, they saw God standing on a Sapphire pavement (Blue) and the tables of the law were made of THE stone (i.e. Sapphire) and thus the blue on their garments was to be a permanent reminder of the law of God.|$|E

500|$|Songs of Experience was {{released}} in October 1969 by Capitol Records on stereo LP. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Thom Jurek gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and said that Axelrod [...] "succeeded in spades" [...] in his search for a sound that [...] "best exemplified not only his feelings but also the heady text he sought to sonically illustrate." [...] Jurek felt that his compositions were diverse, lush, and able to resemble literature by [...] "using as much space as they do sound for dramatic and dynamic effect", and that Axelrod created original palettes for rock instrumentation through his complex use of the horn section's [...] "various colors". Lynell George of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "prescient, genre-defying" [...] solo project, and NME viewed it as a [...] "landmark" [...] album. Mojo cited the album, along with Song of Innocence, as Axelrod's artistic peak and particularly praised [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] as [...] "beautiful and blank", evoking [...] "the view from Arthur Lee's castle of an endless pale <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> <b>and</b> the vast deathly city beneath it."
