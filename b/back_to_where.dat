5|$|Instead {{of being}} coursed on open land, the Irish form is {{run in a}} secure {{enclosure}} over a set distance. Since 1993, Irish Coursing Club rules have made it compulsory for the greyhounds to be muzzled while they chase the hare. After the coursing event, the hares are transported <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they were netted and re-released into the wild. Whereas the UK form of coursing was run with dogs winning points for their running and turning of the hare, the Republic of Ireland form is run {{on the basis that}} the first dog to turn the hare wins. This is denoted by either a red flag or a white flag, indicating the colours of the respective dogs' collars.|$|E
5|$|Pembroke lodged his {{prisoner}} in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle. Here, {{in the presence}} of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they found it. Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they feel as if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E

5|$|The game follows on {{the events}} of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth. After {{managing}} to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron. With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl {{to clean up the mess}} they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they came from.|$|E
5|$|According to the Gallup Organization, Obama {{began his}} {{presidency}} with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining {{for the rest}} of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he will come back for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E

25|$|At present, {{the rate}} of {{precession}} corresponds to a period of 25,772 years, but the rate itself varies somewhat with time (see Values below), so one cannot say that in exactly 25,772 years the earth's axis will be <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> it is now.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people then}} started {{moving away from}} the car park towards the jetty. But someone shouted that Bryant was heading that way, so they tried to double back around the coaches to where Brigid Cook had been shot. Bryant doubled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> Janet and Neville Quin, who owned a {{wildlife}} park on the east coast of Tasmania, were beginning to move toward Mason Cove and away from the buses.

25|$|Note {{that there}} is a big {{difference}} between pool types. Indoor pools of 25 m give the advantage of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid bloodshedâ€œ, I advise you to spare your {{soldiers}} not force us to fight, and go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> you bad and evil strangers were and leave us alone: we will resolutely and fiercely defend this place and fight you to death for the land of our ancestors and {{for the welfare of}} our future generations. Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do {{we have the right to}} take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E
25|$|As a {{woman who}} {{suffered}} {{for the rest of}} her from the bus accident that so badly injured her in her youth, Kahlo spent much of her life in hospitals and undergoing surgery, much of it performed by quacks who Kahlo naively believed could restore her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> she had been before the accident. Many of Kahlo's paintings are concerned with medical imagery, which is presented in terms of pain and hurt, featuring Kahlo bleeding and displaying her open wounds. Many of Kahlo's medical paintings, especially dealing with childbirth and miscarriage, have a strong sense of guilt, of a sense of living's one life at the expense of another who has died so one might live.|$|E

25|$|If a minor {{infringement}} occurs a scrum or free kick {{is awarded}} to the non-offending team. For more serious misdemeanors the referee awards a penalty. If the non-offending team gains an advantage the referee can allow play to continue. The referee has wide discretion on whether any advantage has occurred; with penalty advantages needing a greater gain than scrum advantages. If no advantage is gained play is taken <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the infringement occurred. The penalty or free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, or moved out five metres if it {{is close to the}} goal line. The ball can be kicked in any direction and played at again by the person kicking it. The rest of the team must stay behind the kicker until the ball has been kicked. The opposition must retire ten metres or to their goal-line.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} great houses, its {{exterior}} was austere and not adorned with pediments or pilasters. For some, this {{gave it a}} noble simplicity. For others, it seemed unremarkable and undermined the case for preservation. Its exterior contrasted with a richly ornate and well-proportioned interior. The interior had carved marble chimneypieces, many elaborate ceilings and plasterwork of a high quality. There was a book room, a classical stone staircase with medallioned walls and a circular room with a groined ceiling. In the long parlour there was a painted ceiling by Riley, a student of Joshua Reynolds. Frescati even had its own theatre with Corinthian columns. Jacob Smith, who also worked at Carton and Russborough, landscaped and devised the large formal gardens filled with rare plants and shrubs. The house stood well back from the road on several acres of woods and parkland, and the Priory Stream passed through its grounds. There was also a small seawater pool in the garden. The gateway stood close to where {{the entrance to the}} Blackrock Shopping Centre stands today and its lands stretched <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> Sydney Avenue is now located.|$|E
