5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there.

On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
50|$|Charity <b>bookshops,</b> {{particularly}} those belonging to Oxfam, have been criticised for forcing traditional <b>bookshops</b> out of business.

In response to these criticisms, Oxfam has said that much of the damage to small book retailers has come from supermarkets and online retailers, particularly Tesco and Amazon.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{customer}} journey and identifies the drivers of excellent customer experience in <b>bookshops.</b> Five research methods—in-depth interview, focus group, participant observation, Zaltman metaphors elicitation technique, and collective stereographic photo essay—were run on eleven Italian <b>bookshops</b> involving more than 1 100 individuals overall. The contribution {{of this study}} is twofold. First, it illustrates the process to adopt when mapping the customer journey and analyzing the customer experience. Specifically, it proposes that customer experience can be deeply understood only via a broad research design involving several different profiles of participants, that are managers and booksellers, customers of different familiarity with <b>bookshops</b> (infrequent, frequent and loyal customers), people that were not familiar with the investigated <b>bookshops</b> but that have been invited on purpose, and people that have special interactions (café and events) with the <b>bookshops.</b> Second, results show three key aspects of the topic: (1) The customer experience world, based on rituals not on transactions; (2) The drivers of excellent customer experience in <b>bookshops,</b> which are customization, integration, and participation; (3) The complex role and broad competences of the ideal bookseller...|$|R

After leaving Holly Hill, Montalban moved to a flat in the Queen Alexandra Mansions at 3 Grape Street in the St. Giles {{district}} of Holborn. Here, she was in close proximity to the two primary bookstores then catering to occult interests, Atlantis <b>Bookshop</b> and Watkins <b>Bookshop,</b> {{as well as to the}} British Museum. She offered one of the rooms in her flat to a young astrologer and musician, Rick Hayward, whom she had met in the summer of 1967; he joined the OMS, and in the last few months of Montalban's life authored her astrological forecasts for Prediction. After her death, he continued publishing astrological prophecies in Prediction and Prediction Annual until summer 2012.|$|E

5|$|The comic and science-fiction <b>bookshop</b> Forbidden Planet was {{established}} at No. 23 in 1978 {{before moving to}} New Oxford Street and becoming an international chain.

5|$|While at the <b>bookshop,</b> he {{was offered}} a {{position}} as librarian at the Royal Horticultural Society in London (1933–1952). From there {{he moved to the}} Natural History Museum as a scientific officer in the botany department (1952–1976). After retirement, he continued working there, writing, and serving on a number of professional bodies related to his work, including the Linnean Society, of which he became President. He also taught botany at Cambridge University, as a visiting professor (1977–1983).|$|E
5|$|While {{working at}} the <b>bookshop</b> he made many friends amongst the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, {{including}} botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the morphologist Agnes Arber, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first scientific director of the Botanic Garden, John Gilmour then curator of the university herbarium and later director of the Garden (1951–1973), the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles (1865–1954), who became his patron, Harry Godwin, then a research fellow and later professor and Tom Tutin who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the herbarium. He continued his research, visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in 1930, {{at the age of}} 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, {{with the aid of a}} £15 grant from the Royal Society to study Epimedium. Also in 1930, the Fifth International Botanical Congress was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend this. During this time he commuted between the <b>bookshop,</b> the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life.|$|E
5000|$|The core {{idea of the}} FBP (either by {{agreement}} or law) is that a dense network of well-stocked, high quality <b>bookshops</b> is {{a necessary condition for}} the publication of a large variety of books, large variety itself deemed desirable for the cultural life of a country [...] Such <b>bookshops</b> have additional costs that are not borne by discounters, who just stock their shelves with the current blockbusters.

5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt.

The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
