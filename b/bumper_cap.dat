50|$|A minor style {{revision}} {{was applied}} for the 1997 model year. The front grille opening was given a more aggressive profile. The headlights were given a sharper slant on the inner edges, and the previous all-chrome fixture interior changed to a black interior with chrome reflector inserts. The driving lights were revised from a reflector type to a smaller projection type. The rear <b>bumper</b> <b>cap</b> was altered and had the reverse lights restyled and moved out into the bumper fascia, away from their original central position by the license plate bracket. The GS-T coupe and GSX received a large rear spoiler. The interior color choices also changed from blue, and grey in 1995-1996 model years to black/grey, tan/black, and grey in the 1997-1999 model years. The black leather interior option was only available in 1999; the package included all seats (with the 'Mitsubishi' logo embroidered on both of the fronts), door inserts, and center console armrest.|$|E
5000|$|For {{model year}} 1997, a design update {{occurred}} {{for both the}} Talon and the Eclipse that is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "2Gb". The update was primarily limited to the non-metal portions of the car. The front and rear fascias were heavily revised to incorporate more aggressive looking features. At the front, a larger air intake was created and the [...] "Eagle" [...] emblem was enlarged and embossed {{into the center of the}} <b>bumper</b> <b>cap</b> (as opposed to a badge that inset into a similarly shaped hole). At the rear, a new high-mount spoiler was introduced that projected further into the airstream, replacing the flush-mounted sickle spoiler. Added plastic moldings on the bumper caps and doors completed the revisions to the body. Lastly, on the TSi and TSi AWD models, the aluminum wheels were increased to 17 in and incorporated more angles replacing the 16 in curved 5-spoke wheel. Another important, non-cosmetic change concerned the driveline. There was a slight change in gear ratios and the number of splines on the shaft feeding power to the transfer case was altered.|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, the York {{diesel engine}} was {{redesigned}} into the 2.5 L [...] "DI" [...] (direct injection) unit. At this time this generation received a minor facelift including a grey plastic front grille with integrated headlamp surrounds, wraparound indicators, longer <b>bumper</b> end <b>caps</b> and multifunction rear lights incorporating fog, indicator, reversing and side lights {{for the panel}} van. This facelift did not commonly result in a new [...] "Mark" [...] number.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} (or [...] "2G") Eagle Talon {{was introduced in}} 1995 simultaneously with its Mitsubishi Eclipse counterpart, while the Plymouth Laser model was eliminated. Mechanically, the new Talon and Eclipse models were almost identical with the engines in the turbocharged versions receiving a modest increase in output thanks to a redesigned intake and exhaust, higher 8.5:1 (vs. 7.8:1) compression pistons, and new turbocharger. The new T25 turbocharger, provided by Garrett, had boost increased to 12 psi of peak boost and was smaller than the previous Mitsubishi built 14b turbo that was on 1G models. The T25 did spool up faster than the previous turbocharger {{in order to increase}} the turbo response or reduce turbo lag. The other important change concerned the suspension. While the 1G had MacPherson struts in the front, the 2G had double-wishbone in the front and multilink suspension in the rear. The double wishbone suspension gave the 2G a much better roll-camber curve in the front, allowing for much better handling.From an aesthetic standpoint, the differences between the Eagle Talon car and its Mitsubishi equivalent were somewhat more substantial than exhibited in the first generation models. These differences were most obvious {{at the rear of the}} car. For example, the rear fascia of the Talon featured a <b>bumper</b> <b>cap</b> with a dip in the middle to allow for a high-mounted rear license plate; rear light clusters incorporating amber turn signals (the Eclipse used red turn signals); reverse lights as part of the main rear tail light clusters (the Eclipse's reverse lights were mounted separately and lower around the mid-mounted license plate); and a sickle-shaped rear spoiler for the TSi and TSi AWD version mounted at the base of the rear window that was painted black regardless of body color (the Eclipse used a body colored, conventional [...] "basket handle" [...] spoiler mounted on the rear deck). Other differences included the air intake beneath the front bumper, which did not have a body-colored splitter (minor difference), and the absence of side skirts. Also, the hard-top Talon featured a black roof while the Eclipse had a body colored top.|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, small {{incremental}} {{changes have}} been made to the Trail Teams Special Edition FJ Cruisers, such as changing the TRD alloy wheels to beadlock style TRD wheels on later years, and the availability of Toyota's CRAWL control feature as part of the Trail Teams package (2013 and 2014 automatic transmission only). The CRAWL control had been previously used on other 4-wheel drive vehicles from Toyota and Lexus to enhance off-road capabilities. Each year, the Trail Teams Special Edition is painted in one distinct color and is the only FJ variant (besides the TRD Special Edition units) offered in a monotone color scheme, rather than the traditional two-tone FJ Cruiser with the standard white painted roof (excluding standard production FJ Cruisers with the [...] "Iceberg White" [...] body). The Trail Teams variants are also the only FJ models to have body trim pieces blacked out from the factory including the mirrors, door handles, <b>bumper</b> <b>caps,</b> etc. Special design details also carry over to the interior such as color matched fabric inserts on the seats for specific years and special Trail Teams badges.|$|R
5000|$|The Lloyd 250 {{was called}} [...] "Prüfungsangst-Lloyd" [...] ("Lloyd for exam nerves") as they appealed to owners of older driving {{licenses}} who could drive it {{without having to}} pass a new driving test for cars with a cubic capacity of over 250 cc, a test which was introduced in a legal reform of the mid-1950s. With a power of only 11 hp (DIN), the Lloyd's designers saw a need for saving weight, and thus offered the LP 250 without a back seat, <b>bumpers,</b> hub <b>caps</b> or trims. However, most buyers ordered the LP 250 V with these features as optional extras.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{his lack}} of day-to-day control over the firm, Miniger {{nonetheless}} continued to {{play a vital role}} in the company. He pushed for Electric Auto-lite to continue its expansion into additional automotive fields. Miniger helped structure the company's purchase of Alemite Die Casting in 1935, and later forced it to expand into the manufacture of radiator grilles, door handles, and assorted automotive hardware. The company purchased a <b>bumper</b> plant, hub <b>cap</b> plant, and spring cover plant the following year at his insistence, and built its first spark plug plant in 1936.|$|R

5000|$|In 1983, the Chevettes had {{a makeover}} {{for the front}} and rear fascias, and the Chevette CS was introduced. A black {{finished}} grille and trim moldings replaced most chrome pieces. Scooter and base Chevettes featured black bumpers and end-caps while the higher-end Chevette CS models included color-keyed <b>bumpers</b> and <b>caps</b> with chrome <b>bumper</b> inserts as an option. Scooter and base models featured a black-only grille and headlight buckets while CS models featured argent colored trim. The Chevette S model introduced a cosmetic package that included black painted styled-steel wheels and a red-accented grille and moldings as well as oversized decal emblems in red. Front bucket seats featured new adjustable knobs on the sides, but lost the reclining levers of previous years. Interior trim was also blacked out with new black door handles and black plastic window regulators. An integrated cassette deck was optional with the stereo package. A chrome strip on the dashboard was available only on CS and S models until the end of production. Deluxe door panels were discontinued and all models featured plastic door panels, however base and Scooter models still featured laminated cardboard cargo area panels. The [...] "diagnostic connector" [...] was removed from the wiring harness.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to a redesigned grille and hood ornament, 1978 saw slim, vertical tail lamps inset into chrome <b>bumper</b> end <b>caps</b> with built-in side marker lamps (Cadillac would retain this [...] "vertical tail lamp inset" [...] design feature on DeVille through 1984, and again from 1989 through 1999). New for 1978, a [...] "Phaeton" [...] package was optional for DeVille. Available on both coupe and sedan, the $1,929 Phaeton package featured a simulated convertible-top, special pin striping, wire wheel discs, and [...] "Phaeton" [...] name plates {{in place of the}} usual [...] "Coupe de Ville" [...] or [...] "Sedan de Ville" [...] ornament on the rear fenders. Inside were leather upholstered seats and a leather-trimmed steering wheel matching the exterior color. The package was available in [...] "Cotillion White" [...] (with Dark Blue roof), [...] "Platinum Silver" [...] (with a Black roof), or [...] "Arizona Beige" [...] (with a Dark Brown roof). Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package was priced at $369, while the d'Elegance package (for coupe or sedan) was available at $689. Electronic fuel injection, which added , was available at $744. Electronic level control - which used suspension-mounted sensors and air filled rear shocks - kept the car's height level regardless of passengers and cargo weight, was available for $140. Sales dropped slightly from 1977 to 117,750 for the $10,444 Coupe de Ville, and 88,951 for Sedan de Ville, priced at $10,668.|$|R
50|$|Stewie {{is one of}} the show's biggest {{merchandising}} icons, and he {{has been}} included on Family Guy T-shirts, baseball <b>caps,</b> <b>bumper</b> stickers, cardboard standups, refrigerator magnets, posters, and several other items. Stewie appears in the Family Guy Video Game!, where Stewie discovers Bertram attempting to outdo him in taking over the world. Desperate to stop him, Stewie shrinks himself and makes his way to Bertram's lair within Peter's testicles to discover his plan, destroys his henchman cloning lab, and rescues a kidnapped Rupert from a rocket. He finally confronts Bertram in the park, where Bertram turns himself into a giant. Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story is a DVD movie about Stewie's secret and what can possibly be his future. Stewie is also a playable character (along with Brian) in the show's second video game, Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse, where the pair travel through the multiverse again, in order to defeat Bertram.|$|R
2500|$|The American Rally AMX {{was carried}} over for 1979 with {{substantial}} cosmetic changes {{that gave the}} model {{a higher level of}} originality within VAM and pushed it away from AMC's 1978 original. The body featured all-new side decal designs in two tones that were mostly straight and surrounded the side protective rubber moldings. The portion under the rear side windows grew thicker and housed an [...] "AMX over Rally" [...] decal using the same typography and design as the previous model, the legend [...] "AMX" [...] on top of the [...] "Rally" [...] one. All glass frames and moldings, volcano hubcaps, door mirrors, rocker panels and bumpers were blacked-out. AMC's dual quad headlight design with transparent parking lights was adopted alongside an in-house VAM sporty grille design with four horizontal bars shared with the Gremlin X and American 06/S models of the same year. Both bumpers were changed to the new smaller aluminum units with side end <b>caps,</b> <b>bumper</b> guards and nerfing strips. A unique feature of this model is the radio antenna placed on top of the passenger's side rear quarter panel, instead of the top of the right front fender.|$|R
2500|$|The 1982 {{recession}} in Mexico weakened {{the economy and}} hit the automotive market and industry, with VAM being no exception. The dire situation, coupled with a government decree banning the importation of automotive accessories took its toll in both standard and optional equipment of all car lines and marques sold in Mexico. All high-trim Americans for 1982 were no longer available with power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, tilt steering column, quartz digital clock, and rear defroster. Items that were standard for 1981 such as the remote controls for the door mirrors, the intermittent wipers, the reading dome light, and vanity mirror were put on the option list. The rest of the equipment was virtually unchanged from 1981. Despite this, {{there was a new}} optional accessory for the year, an AM/FM/stereo tape player radio. All three high-trim editions featured a new VAM-designed luxurious grille with a rectangular pattern, while the three base models used AMC's square-pattern design borrowed from U.S. market Eagle models. The GFS, ECD and DL models also got a set of plain VAM-designed <b>bumper</b> end <b>caps</b> with a chrome molding on the top side edge. Along with these, AMC's Eagle nerfing strip design was also used in both bumpers. The headlight bezels changed to blacked out units in their internal sections keeping the chromed surrounding areas. All-new aluminum road wheels also replaced the previously-imported Noryl wheel covers. A unique version of the year was the American ECD, which featured a lengthened and squared rear roofline with smaller and more rectangular C-pillar windows that had a small [...] "ECD" [...] sand-blasted logo. Other changes were black rear side window surrounds for the American DL wagon that were originally created by AMC for the Eagle models, while the American GFS had plain side window panels. Both versions of the three base models were the same as in 1981 except for the grille design, new door panels, and the absence of the quartz clock in the automatic cars.|$|R
50|$|Learning {{from the}} {{experience}} of its first year, VAM offered a substantially changed and updated Lerma model for 1982. In the exterior, the squared grid grille design divided in rectangles was replaced by an all-new totally chromed metal grille with a simple design of thin horizontal stripes with equally thin spaces between them. The headlight bezels were completely blacked out in their internal parts with only their external surrounding portions retaining a chromed appearance. The front parking lights were changed from transparent to amber. Both bumpers received AMC's Eagle thick nerfing strip design with a central bright molding and new VAM-designed plain smooth <b>bumper</b> end <b>caps</b> continuing the bright molding on their upper portions. On both sides, changes were more noticeable. The bright molding on the rocker panels was deleted and new moldings with a six horizontal stripe pattern were fitted to the bottom edges of the front fenders, doors and sides. The wheel lip and drip rail bright moldings remained unchanged while new additional bright moldings appeared in the form of units one the bases of the door and side glass areas as well as new bright moldings for the internal part of the door and side window frames. The trim plate between the side glass (two-door model) or between the rear door and side glass (four-door model) was changed in favor of a new plate following the same six striped pattern as the low side moldings. This plate existed only in the two-door model in 1981 but it was present in both body styles for 1982. The small angular mid side window of the 1981 two-door model was replaced by the normal unit used since the two-door AMC Hornet and two-door AMC Concord base models. The five-spoke VAM wheels with Noryl-type wheelcovers were replaced by new aluminum wheels with chromed volcano centercaps and lug nuts. All of these changes resulted in a highly different Lerma model that looked fairly more luxurious on the outside compared to smoothness of the 1981 version.|$|R

25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic <b>bumper</b> end <b>caps</b> with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|R
