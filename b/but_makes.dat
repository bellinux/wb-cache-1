5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) asks Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to the prom; Blaine {{reveals that}} he was beaten up after a formal dance at his old school shortly after coming out, but agrees to go. He and Kurt's father Burt (Mike O'Malley) express misgivings about Kurt's daring {{homemade}} prom outfit, which includes a skirt, but Kurt is determined to be himself and wear it. Pleased by the sudden absence of homophobic bullying at school, Kurt suggests that his former tormentor Karofsky should consider coming out. Karofsky refuses, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> a tearful apology to Kurt.|$|E
5|$|During the Chunin exams, Team 7 {{encounters}} Orochimaru, an infamous ninja exiled from Konoha, who infects Sasuke with a curse mark. When active, {{the mark}} increases Sasuke's physical abilities, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> him cruel and sadistic, as the mark contains {{a fragment of}} Orochimaru's consciousness. Soon after, Kakashi teaches Sasuke his own Chidori technique, attempting to appease his desire for power. During the siege of Konoha, Sasuke is beaten by Gaara, but is rescued by Naruto. Not long after, Itachi returns to Konoha and Sasuke attempts to kill him, only to be beaten and tortured. In response, Sasuke decides he has to leave Team 7 and Konoha {{in order to become}} stronger. Believing Orochimaru's tutelage will make him more powerful, Sasuke defects from Konoha and becomes an outlaw. Naruto follows him, and the two fight when Sasuke refuses to return. Sasuke wins, but he spares Naruto's life and continues on to Orochimaru's hideout to seek power.|$|E

5|$|Faye begins dating Sam, {{unaware that}} he is {{cheating}} on her with Ward Sister Chrissie Williams. She ends their relationship when she discovers his infidelity and turns her attention to Joseph, {{who had tried to}} warn her about Sam's indiscretion. She supports Joseph when he is tormented by Jac about the relationship she had had with his father prior to his death. When STI clinician Tim attacks staff members with a crossbow, Faye is shot in the back, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> a full recovery. She reveals to Joseph that she was formerly married to a much older man named Donald, who left her a substantial amount of money after his death from cancer. She is investigated by the police, who find it suspicious that she has been twice widowed. Her stepson, Carl Hewson, blackmails her for money, but is later attacked by loan sharks and dies in theatre.|$|E
5|$|Rose Tyler and the Doctor {{decide to}} visit Rose's mother Jackie. Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be joining them shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{sometimes}} {{played with the}} larger and heavier (and unnumbered) carom billiard balls instead of pocket billiard balls. Such is the case at the Union Club and was also at the University of Michigan Billiards & Games Room, where the faculty devoted {{most of their time}} to bottle pool. Not incidentally three-cushion billiards, which uses these larger balls, was also a mainstay in that room and touring three-cushion professional Carl Conlon was a fixture there until his death in 1997. In this variation, a solid-yellow (or dotted) second cue ball is used in place of the 1 ball, and the red ball, known traditionally as the , is used in place of the 2 ball. The use of such balls makes scoring by caroms easier, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> pocketing balls (and scratching) more difficult because the larger balls must still be made in the ordinarily-sized pool pockets.|$|E

5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in Walford, AJ's brother Masood (Nitin Ganatra) makes sure he avoids his ex-wife Zainab (Nina Wadia), because she dislikes him. AJ proves {{to be a bad}} {{influence}} on Masood when they damage Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) car with a shopping trolley and AJ is punched by Derek. AJ discovers that Masood and Zainab are divorced and later tells Masood he came to Walford because his wife Aliyah (Ann Wenn) has left him. After Masood inspires AJ with his reunion with Zainab, AJ leaves to reconcile with his own wife. He returns a few weeks later saying that he and Aliyah are divorcing. Zainab contacts Aliyah to try to get her to take AJ back, and AJ says that Aliyah had an affair. Aliyah drops off AJ's belongings and reveals that there was no affair. AJ then explains that he left Aliyah because she wants children and he does not. AJ moves in with Masood and his family. Zainab dislikes his laziness and she becomes annoyed when he brings Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) back after a drunken evening. Roxy stays the night <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> it clear that it was a one-off.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer.|$|E

5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
