40|$|The {{premise of}} <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policies</b> and {{currency}} wars is that currency depreciations lead to export growth. This premise, however, {{is far from}} validated as the existing economic literature largely either fails to find significant trade flow effects of currency fluctuations or finds that these effects are only minor. We revisit {{the question of whether}} currency fluctuations are systematically associated with trade flows using rich and unique firm level Chinese customs data on China-US trade over the 2000 to 2011 period that allows us to consider firm involvement in processing trade and firm dynamics in both export and import markets. Our firm-level based estimation of trade elasticities suggest that the China-US trade balance strongly responds to changes in the CNY/USD rate. This finding is particularly pronounced when we distinguish between ordinary and processing firms. Our results thus suggest that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is stronger than previously thought and add insights to the <b>policy</b> debate on <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policies</b> and currency wars by, at least in principle, validating the underlying premise of such policies...|$|R

The lesson of Smoot–Hawley and coordination through international economic institutions represent mechanisms of informal governance that encourage cooperation to avoid a spiral of protectionism.

While trade is frequently seen as posing threats to th{{is vitally important}} goal, it can in fact {{play a major role}} in achieving it. Trade helps in a number of ways, by allowing countries to take advantage of their radically different factor endowments, with land-abundant countries providing exports and land-poor countries taking advantage of much more efficiently-produced imports. Trade liberalization can also help by raising production efficiency in agriculture, allowing improvements in dietary diversity and increasing access to food. Allowing trade substantially reduces the volatility of food prices by diversifying sources of supply. By contrast, <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policies</b> of price insulation such as the imposition of export bans in periods of high prices redistribute, rather than reduce, volatility.

First, we summarize the effects of export taxes using both partial and general equilibrium theoretical models. When large countries have an objective of constant food domestic prices, in the event of an increase in world agricultural prices the optimal response is to decrease import tariffs in net food-importing countries and to increase export tariffs in net food-exporting countries. The latter decision is welfare improving while the former is welfare reducing: it is the price to pay to get domestic food prices constant. Small countries are harmed by both decisions. Second, we illustrate the costs of a lack of cooperation in and regulation of (binding process) such policies in a time of crisis using a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model illustration, mimicking the mechanisms that have appeared during the recent food price surge.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between exchange rates and trade {{has long been}} controversial. The fixed exchange rates of the pre- 1914 gold standard were viewed as essential for efficient trade. In the period of 1919 – 39, exchange rate flexibility {{was positively correlated with}} growth, and too rigid adherence to the gold standard was negatively correlated with growth (Eichengreen 1992). However, <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policies</b> of devaluing in order to reduce unemployment in the 1930 s came {{to be seen as a}} zero-sum strategy that exacerbated the breakdown of the global economy. In the Bretton Woods era the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was responsible for ensuring that countries maintained fixed exchange rates and that any devaluation or revaluation was orderly. Since the advent of generalized floating in the 1970 s, no multilateral organization has been responsible for the global exchange rate system. There have been recurring charges of countries using exchange rate protectionism or promoting exports by exchange rate undervaluation. At the same time, the global trading system is increasingly characterized by proliferation of regional trade agreements which, together with World Trade Organization commitments, limit governments’ ability to use traditional trade policy measures (WTO 2011), and may increase the attractiveness of using the exchange rate as a trade policy instrument.

This paper finds only a limited link between economic performances and international variables, except one that upcoming elections in the United States tend to cause a higher rate of growth in Japan. Evidence suggests that although blatant policies, such as a <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policy,</b> were not adopted, a more subtle international cooperation, in the form of Japanese expansion to pill up the United States economy, have been used. ...|$|E

In this paper we argue for a radically different interpretation of exchange-rate policy in the 1930 s. We document first that currency depreciation was beneficial for the initiating countries. It worked through both the standard supply- and demand-side channels suggested by modern variants of the Keynesian model. We show next that there can in fact be no presumption that currency depreciation in the 1930 s was <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policy.</b> Rather, an empirical analysis of the historical record is needed to determine whether the impact on other countries was favorable or unfavorable. We conclude provisionally on the basis of this analysis that the foreign repercussions of individual devaluations were in fact negative [...] that the depreciations considered were beggar-thy-neighbor. As we point out, however, this finding does not support the conclusion that competitive devaluations taken by a group of countries were without benefit for the system as a whole.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters: Chapter 2 investigates, {{in the context of}} a two-country model with monopolistic competition and price stickiness, the implications for macroeconomic stability and the welfare properties of three distinct kinds of monetary policy arrangements: (a) cooperative, (b) noncooperative and (c) monetary union. The cooperative first best can be achieved if domestic inflation is set equal to zero in both countries at all times. In the non cooperative equilibrium welfare is not maximized due to the presence of <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policies</b> with the costs of non-cooperation increasing with the degree of openness of the economy. A monetary unión is welfare-improving relative to non cooperation only for countries that have strong trading links. In chapter 3 (co-authored with Katharine Neiss), we investigate the propagation mechanism of monetary shocks in an otherwise standard sticky price model, modified to incorporate factor hoarding in the form of variable capital utilisation rates and labour effort. In contrast, to previous studies, we find that real effects of monetary shocks can be generated at relatively low degrees of nominal rigidities. Factor hoarding enriches the propagation mechanism, by flattening the marginal cost responses to monetary shocks. The assumption of labour hoarding is crucial for generating persistence, while the assumption of variable capital utihsation allows us to generate reahstic investment volatility without having to introduce capital adjustment costs. Finally, Chapter 4 investigates whether monetary pohcy in a currency area should stabilize an aggregate of inflation and output or whether it should take into account the dispersion of these variables across regions when the currency area is characterized by asymmetric shocks across regions and when participation constraints define the set of feasible policies. We find that even if the two regions are identical, asymmetric shocks might create asymmetric responses of regional variables. Participation constraints introduce a trade-oíf between eíficiency and incentives in settings with lack of a strong enforcement technology. In order to deal with incentive problems the central bank has to manipulate the future consunption paths by adopting a more expansionary policy with respect to regional productivity shocks...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} in two major parts. The first, longer part is an {{extended}} generic {{discussion of the}} causes and consequences of liquidity traps; it uses a succession of small, highly stylized models to address both the traditional questions regarding liquidity traps {{and a number of}} novel issues. The central new conclusion of this analysis is that a liquidity trap fundamentally involves a credibility problem - but one that is the inverse of the usual one, in which central bankers have difficulty convincing private agents of their commitment to price stability. In a liquidity trap {{the problem is that the}} markets believe that the central bank will target price stability, given the chance - and 4 hence that any current monetary expansion is merely transitory. The traditional view that monetary policy is ineffective in a liquidity trap, and that fiscal expansion is the only way out, must therefore be qualified: monetary policy will be effective after all if the central bank can credibly promise to be irresponsible, to seek a higher future price level. The theoretical analysis also appears to refute two widely held beliefs. First, international capital flows, which allow a country to export savings to the rest of the world, are not a sure-fire guarantee against a liquidity trap; because goods markets remain far from perfectly integrated, the required real interest rate in terms of domestic consumption can be negative even if capital is perfectly mobile and there are positive-return investments abroad. A corollary to this is that the extent to which a successful monetary expansion - in which the central bank succeeds in creating expectations of inflation - will be a <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policy</b> that expands demand at the rest of the world's expense will probably be less than wide [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} WTO Appellate Body Report on China Measures Affecting Imports of Automobile Parts (WT/DS 342 /AB/R, 15 December 2008). This dispute {{concerns}} {{a set of}} regulatory measures imposing a 25 % 'charge' on imported automobile parts used {{in the manufacture of}} motor vehicles in China. The main legal question in this case consisted of the nature of this charge as either a border charge subject to China's tariff concessions or an internal charge, subject to the basic nondiscrimination requirement of GATT Article III. In our report, we examine the reasoning of the Appellate Body relating to the difference between these two types of charges. We discuss the role and relevance of this distinction in the GATT/WTO legal system in general, and for the purposes of resolving this dispute in particular. We also address the important systemic question relating to the review of a Member's domestic laws for purposes of determining their GATT/WTO consistency. This was an important issue in this case, as China claimed that the Panel misunderstood the meaning of the relevant Decree and requested the Appellate Body to review the Panel's erroneous reading of this Decree. We discuss the Appellate Body's reasoning relating to the review of domestic laws by Panels and the Appellate Body and express concern over the distinction drawn by the Appellate Body between legal and factual elements of relevance in the interpretation of such laws. The 'economic bone' in this case is less straightforward to split than the legal one. In legal terms, the Appellate Body's decision is a time-consistent one, but, in economic terms, it is not clear if it is also a welfare-optimal one. The main reason is that many questions relevant to the case were left unaddressed by the Appellate Body. Due to the lack of factual evidence to substantiate its allegations, the Panel's ruling remains rather speculative on certain accounts. For this purpose, we engage in our own examination of the facts, using mainly a unique dataset of Chinese firm-level data. We analyze issues of ownership in China's car industry, the growth of the import-competing Chinese industry over time, the elasticity of the demand for cars, and duty pass-through, etc. The purpose is to verify more closely who 'benefits' and who 'loses' from the Chinese import duty so as to understand the economic incentives involved. In this respect, we attempt to determine whether the economics support the conclusion that China pursued a <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policy</b> in the car-part industry...|$|E

When the tax on crude is not available as a policy option, however, a second-best biofuel subsidy {{may or may not be}} positive, depending on the input elasticity of substitution in energy production. In the large-country case, a biofuel subsidy spurs global demand for food and confers a terms-of-trade benefit to the food-exporting nation. In the absence of <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> trade <b>policy</b> tools, the twin objectives of pollution reduction and term-of-trade improvement justify a combination of crude tax and biofuel subsidy for the food exporter. If the food importer also uses a biofuel subsidy (or tax), we have a Johnson (1953) type Nash equilibrium augmented by pollution considerations. If biofuel subsidies reduce global crude use, then in a Nash equilibrium, the food-exporting nation must use a subsidy, while a food-importing nation will impose a subsidy if and only if the pollution-reduction effect dominates the terms-of-trade effect. ...|$|R

S. federal and state government strategies reveal that the United States {{is in danger of}} adopting a misguided notion of 2 ̆ 2 new federalism. 2 ̆ 2 The strategies pursued by the governments in the United States preserve and promote the autonomy of states in a manner that allows for policies creating negative externalities, <b>beggar-thy-neighbor</b> <b>policies,</b> and other sub-optimal policies arising out of prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s dilemma-type situations. Moreover, the strategies preserve state autonomy in a manner that does not lead to greater public participation in democracy or useful experimentation. In short, the strategies chosen by the governments in the United States do not promote the values of federalism. A brief comparative examination of strategies pursued by the Canadian governments supports this conclusion. Indeed, the comparison yields what will likely be surprising results to many observers. The U. S. federal government has arguably been less aggressive in constraining sub-federal government protectionism vis d vis Canada and U. S. states are arguably more aggressive than their provincial counterparts in establishing foreign policies. Accordingly, the governments in the United States must undertake a re-examination of their current strategies. Such a re-examination should occur in the context of implementing a model for a 2 ̆ 2 new federalism 2 ̆ 2 that focuses on the values a federal system of government seeks to promote rather than allowing federalism to be a mere slogan or rhetorical device. Successful implementation of such a model will require conscientious politicians that not only assess the constitutionality of their actions but, in addition, assess the impact of their actions on the values of federalism. Part II of this Article discusses the lack of serious consideration of the values of federalism in the current politics of 2 ̆ 2 new federalism. 2 ̆ 2 It argues that conscientious politicians should weigh the values of federalism before taking action with respect to a given matter. Part III defines grey areas and yellow zones in the context of split sovereignty and explores their relationship. Part IV identifies the grey areas and yellow zones present in U. S. federalism. Part V analyzes the various strategies that can be adopted by federal and state governments in response to grey areas and yellow zones exposed by globalization. Part VI critiques the actual strategy adopted by the U. S. federal government with respect to the negotiation of international trade agreements. Part VII critiques the strategy chosen by state governments with respect to engaging in foreign affairs. Part VIII briefly compares the strategies of governments in Canada to highlight the misguided 2 ̆ 2 new federalism 2 ̆ 2 apparent in the strategies of U. S. governments. Part IX concludes that the U. S. federal and state governments need to modify their strategies adopted in response to globalization {{in the context of an}} overall reassessment of 2 ̆ 2 new federalism. 2 ̆...|$|R
