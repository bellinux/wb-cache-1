To the left are two rows of metallic barrels lain on the floor, instead of having them stand upright. At right are stacks of <b>boxes,</b> <b>piled</b> eight <b>boxes</b> high, with fancy labels on them that read "Olive Oil". Near the boxes is a wheel cart with more boxes loaded.

50|$|Don goes {{on another}} date with the much-younger Bethany Van Nuys. Bethany and Don awkwardly run into Betty and Henry while {{out at a}} restaurant, causing Betty to have a minor anxious {{outburst}} at Henry. Henry and Betty fight in the car as Henry wonders aloud whether Betty is {{still in love with}} Don. The next morning, Betty apologizes and explains that Don was the only man she had ever been with. Henry purposely rams his car into the boxes Don has stored in the garage in the Ossining house, then phones Don at work and asks him to remove his boxes, cruelly suggesting Don do so before Gene's birthday, silently emphasizing that Don is not invited. When Don arrives at the appointed time, he finds his <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> on the curb near where Henry is mowing the lawn, studiously ignoring Don.|$|R

40|$|Like the crazed {{woman in}} gothic novels, {{scientific}} data {{have long been}} relegated to the dark basements and attics of scientific laboratories. However, perhaps these days are over: data, especially big data, are all the rage, along with increasing calls to make the data on which scholarly claims are made into first-class citizens of scholarship. These calls are welcome to some; reviled by others. Many reasons are given as to why we cannot, do not, or should not make data available (e. g., Strasser 2013; Wallis et al. 2013), but I think that the main reason we do not rou-tinely share data is that, until recently, we could not. And because we could not, a system of scholarly communica-tion grew where data were disposable. Literally. Eventu-ally, the <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> upon <b>boxes</b> and file cabinets overflowed.

60|$|No one {{has written}} {{anything}} that really conveys {{the quality of}} that repatriation process; the queer business of bringing these suspicious, illiterate, despondent people back to their desolated homes, reuniting swarthy fathers and stockish mothers, witnessing their touchingly inexpressive encounters, doing what one could to put heart into their resumption. Memories {{come back to me}} of great littered heaps of luggage, bundles, blankets, rough <b>boxes,</b> <b>piled</b> newly purchased stores, ready-made doors, window sashes heaped ready for the waggons, slow-moving, apathetic figures sitting and eating, an infernal squawking of parrots, sometimes a wailing of babies. Repatriation went on to a parrot obligato, and I never hear a parrot squawk without a flash of South Africa across my mind. All the prisoners, I believe, brought back parrots--some two or three. I had to spread these people out, over a country still grassless, with teams of war-worn oxen, mules and horses that died by the dozen on my hands. The end of each individual instance was a handshake, and one went lumbering on, leaving the children one had deposited behind one already playing with old ration-tins or hunting about for cartridge-cases, while adults stared at the work they had to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those {{that remain}} after the proper number {{has been given}} to the farmers the breeders sell to them or to others, it being no part of their {{business}} to bring up the chickens. The fattening business is quite different. At these places there are long rows of little <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> up on each other into a wall five feet high. The door of each of these boxes has a hole in it through which the fowl can put its head, with a little sort of shutter that closes down on it. A fowl is placed in each bow. Then the attendants go around two together; one carries a basket filled with little balls of meal, the other lifts the shutter, and as the fowl puts its head out catches it by the neck, makes it open its beak, and with his other hand pushes the ball of meal down its throat. They are so skillful that the operation takes scarce a moment; then they go on to the next, and so on down the long rows until they have fed the last of those under their charge. Then they begin again afresh." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year was worse. <b>Boxes</b> of bicycles <b>piled</b> up in shops. Among them were returns, mostly with broken parts. Where metal bends, plastic breaks.

6000|$|When Father Barry {{reached the}} parsonage {{he found no}} use for a pass key. Pat Murphy, his {{faithful}} servant and acolyte, was watching for him just within the door. He drew the half-frozen priest across a small entry, to a large warmed apartment answering to-day as both study and dining-room. [...] "The rist of the house do be perishing," [...] the Irishman explained. The priest sank {{in front of a}} blazing coal fire, tossing his gloves to the table. He held his hands before the glow without comment. They were wonderful hands, denoting artistic temperament, but with fingers too pliant, too delicately slender for ascetic life. Philip Barry's hands seemed formed for luxury, and in accordance with their expression he had surrounded himself with both comfort and chaste beauty. In the large, low, old-fashioned room in which he sat there was no false note. Pictures, oriental rugs, richly carved chairs--all represented taste and expenditure, somewhat prejudicial to a priest's standing with his bishop. That the greater part of everything in the little house had arrived as a gift from some admiring parishioner but added to the aged superior's disapproval of esthetic influence. To-day Father Barry warmed his hands without the usual sense of comfortable home-coming. Pat Murphy observed that for once his master showed no interest in a row of flower <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> on the table.|$|R

5000|$|John Fordham of The Guardian {{commented that}} [...] "Jarrett has always favoured {{exhaustive}} documentation, but the intensity, variety, and astonishing technical command of these performances might well persuade devoted fans and intrigued improv enthusiasts alike of his view {{that these were}} landmark moments". John Garratt of PopMatters noted that [...] "The four-disc box set A Multitude of Angels is the new turning point in Jarrett’s career where he pushed himself too hard. His temporary illness is our gain. If marathon performances like The Köln Concert, La Scala, or Solo Concerts: Bremen/Lausanne were your gold standard for inspiration, you’ll be glad {{to know that this}} <b>box</b> <b>piles</b> on nearly five extra hours of it. The CD tracks are not divvied up for a vinyl format, either. With the exceptions of encores and covers of “Danny Boy” and “Over the Rainbow”, these untitled improvisations range from 30 minutes to 43 minutes in length. The shortest CD is 70-plus minutes. Once you press play, you really need to hang in there....A Multitude of Angels tells the music world what Keith Jarrett fans already knew—that the man could be an endless fountain of music, a one-man jam-band that only needed 88 keys to balance the Law of Fate with the Law of Accident (according to his liner notes). Since that’s the case, this box will not alter anyone’s perception of Jarrett or change his reputation overall." ...|$|R
6000|$|Very {{early one}} morning we were awakened by a bustling {{presence}} in the yard, and found our camp had been surprised by a tall, lean, old native lady, dressed in what were obviously widow's weeds. You could see at a glance she was a notable woman, a housewife, sternly practical, alive with energy, and with fine possibilities of temper. Indeed there was nothing native about her but the skin; and the type abounds, and is everywhere respected nearer home. It did us good to see her scour the grounds, examining the plants and chickens; watering, feeding, trimming them; taking angry, purpose-like possession. When she neared the house our sympathy abated; {{when she came to}} the broken chest I wished I were elsewhere. We had scarce a word in common; but her whole lean body spoke for her with indignant eloquence. [...] "My chest!" [...] it cried, with a stress on the possessive. [...] "My chest--broken open! This is a fine state of things!" [...] I hastened to lay the blame where it belonged--on François and his wife--and found I had made things worse instead of better. She repeated the names at first with incredulity, then with despair. A while she seemed stunned, next fell to disembowelling the <b>box,</b> <b>piling</b> the goods on the floor, and visibly computing the extent of François's ravages; and presently after she was observed in high speech with Taniera, who seemed to hang an ear like one reproved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Zip, boom, bang! Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Bang! Hurrah for Putnam Hall!" [...] Then {{the fire}} was stirred up, more <b>boxes</b> and barrels <b>piled</b> on top, and the cadets danced around more wildly than ever.

60|$|And {{now it was}} {{the evening}} of the last day. They had sighted the coast of Devonshire, and the {{following}} morning would see them within the Southampton waters.

6000|$|... "Yes indeed, we have Aspern's {{word for}} that." [...] And as I {{looked again at}} the old woman's wrappings I could imagine that she had not wished to allow people a reason to say that the great poet had {{overdone}} it. But I did not waste my time in considering Miss Bordereau, in whom the appearance of respiration was so slight as to suggest that no human attention could ever help her more. I turned my eyes all over the room, rummaging with them the closets, the chests of drawers, the tables. Miss Tita met them quickly and read, I think, what was in them; but she did not answer it, turning away restlessly, anxiously, so that I felt rebuked, with reason, for a preoccupation that was almost profane in the presence of our dying companion. All the same I took another look, endeavoring to pick out mentally the place to try first, for a person who should wish to put his hand on Miss Bordereau's papers directly after her death. The room was a dire confusion; it looked like the room of an old actress. There were clothes hanging over chairs, odd-looking shabby bundles here and there, and various pasteboard <b>boxes</b> <b>piled</b> together, battered, bulging, and discolored, which might have been fifty years old. Miss Tita after a moment noticed the direction of my eyes again and, as if she guessed how I judged the air of the place (forgetting I had no business to judge it at all), said, perhaps to defend herself from the imputation of complicity in such untidiness: ...|$|R

Mr. Putney Giles was a first-rate man of business. With all his pleasant, easy manner, he was precise and methodical, and was not content that his client should be less master of his own affairs than his lawyer.

On the long wooden {{platform}} under the sheds Stephen caught sight of Herr Korner and Herr Hauptmann amid a group of their countrymen. Little Korner came forward to clasp his hands. The tears ran on his cheeks, {{and he could not}} speak for emotion. Judge Whipple, grim and silent, stood apart. But he uncovered his head with the others when the train rolled in. Reverently they entered a car where the pine <b>boxes</b> were <b>piled</b> one on another, and they bore out the earthly remains of Captain Carl Richter.|$|R
