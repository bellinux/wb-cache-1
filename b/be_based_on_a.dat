5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{is based}} on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the sun for {{direction}} involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields (magnetoception), use visual landmarks as well as olfactory cues.|$|E

5|$|Two-level {{utilitarian}}ism (sometimes Government House utilitarianism) is a utilitarian {{theory of}} ethics developed by R. M. Hare. According to the theory, a person's moral decisions should <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> set of 'intuitive' moral rules, except in certain rare situations {{where it is}} more appropriate {{to engage in a}} 'critical' level of moral reasoning.|$|E
5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Iron Mans release, Marvel Studios {{announced that}} they were developing a sequel, with an intended release date of April 30, 2010. In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct. That same month, Justin Theroux signed to write the script, which would <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> story written by Favreau and Downey. Theroux co-wrote Tropic Thunder, which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel. Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film, and Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man's armor.|$|E

5|$|The coin {{stems from}} {{the desire of the}} Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 16th-century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for this through the design process. When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Jordan Chandler's alleged {{account of}} the {{relationship}} was detailed in a book by journalist Victor M. Gutierrez. The book was said to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> diary the boy had kept {{at the time and}} included details of alleged sexual encounters between Jackson and him. In 1995, Jackson filed a civil suit against Gutierrez for slander; the jury found in Jackson's favor, awarding him $2.7 million in damages. However, that suit was unrelated to the book and the judgement does not serve to refute the allegations contained within. In 1996, Evan Chandler sued Jackson for around $60 million, claiming Jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case. In 1999, a court ruled in Jackson's favor and threw out the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|With World War II looming, Max Schuster aided the Jewish Salten's {{flight from}} Nazi Germany and helped {{introduce}} him, and Bambi, to Walt Disney Productions. Sidney Franklin, a producer and director at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, purchased the film rights in 1933, initially desiring {{to make a}} live-action adaptation of the work. Deciding such a film would be too difficult to make, he sold the rights to Walt Disney in April 1937 in hopes of it being adapted into an animated film instead. Disney began working on the film immediately, intending {{it to be the}} company's second feature-length animated film and his first to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> specific, recent work.|$|E

5|$|Bellingham was immortalized as {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as {{the brother of}} Ann Hibbins, {{a woman who was}} executed (in real life in 1656, {{as well as in the}} book) for practicing witchcraft. There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> footnote in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{replicates}} all {{the features}} of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn {{in the form of the}} prim churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring Hesperus, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a hypocrite, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable ermine muff while displaying no charity to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in Tom Jones.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the museum}} was headed by Sujatmiko. That year David Kristian Budhiyanto of Petra Christian University wrote that {{the museum was}} rarely visited and in some places poorly maintained. He posited this to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> popular view of museums as unexciting or boring places. In order to attract new visitors, the museum has {{initiated}} several competitions in 2012 and 2013, including a photography contest on the museum's Facebook page. It has also undertaken mobile exhibitions, showing some of its collection {{in cities such as}} Yogyakarta and Magelang. Between January and September 2013 the museum received 26,249 visitors, an increase of 250 per cent over the previous year's target; this was credited to the various promotional efforts undertaken. The museum is now promoted as a site for educational tourism and accepts donations of materials related to the press in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|In Five Songs (1956–57) and Musique funèbre (1958) Lutosławski {{introduced}} his {{own brand of}} twelve-tone music, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in Musique funèbre, augmented fourths and semitones). This system also gave him the means to write dense chords without resorting to tone clusters, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from Arnold Schoenberg's tone-row system, although Musique funèbre does happen to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and Paganini Variations.|$|E
5|$|One of Berhtwald's letters {{has been}} preserved, sent to Forthhere, Bishop of Sherborne, and asking Forthhere to intercede with Beorwold, the Abbot of Glastonbury, to ransom a slave. Another letter, this one {{addressed}} to Berhtwald, from Waldhere, Bishop of London, also survives. The main {{interest in the}} second letter {{is that it is}} the oldest surviving letter close surviving in Western Europe. This second letter also relates that Waldhere and Berhtwald had attended a synod which can be dated to sometime between 703 and 705, where the kingdom of Wessex was threatened with excommunication. A charter witnessed by Berhtwald which mentions a supposed 706 council, numbered 54 by Sawyer, is now known to be a fake, although the witness list may <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> legitimate 8th century charter that no longer survives. Likewise, a charter with Berhtwald as a witness and relating to the 716 Council of Clofesho is also known to be a 9th-century forgery, although again it may have been based on actual documents from the council.|$|E
5|$|The Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} the Department of Post-War Reconstruction's proposed principles to govern demobilisation on 12June 1944. The {{key element of}} these principles was that {{the order in which}} personnel would be demobilised was to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> points system, with service men and women being allocated points {{on the basis of their}} period of service, age, marital status and employment or training prospects. An extensive demobilisation plan was then developed by an inter-service committee following further consultation with trade unions, employers and returned servicemen. This plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6March 1945. The rate at which personnel were to be discharged was set at 3,000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{somewhat}} controversial {{argument is}} that evolution in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural proteins (such as enzymes), control embryonic development. In turn, these regulatory genes turn out to <b>be</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> very old set of highly conserved genes which Carroll nicknames the toolkit. Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that toolkit genes such as Hox must have evolved before the Cambrian radiation which created most of the animal body plans that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication but far more often by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same signal may be given at a different time in development, in {{a different part of}} the embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.|$|E
