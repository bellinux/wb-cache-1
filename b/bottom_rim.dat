25|$|When I was a kid, {{my father}} told me about an {{accident}} that happened while he was working on Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the <b>bottom</b> <b>rim</b> of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
25|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins have strongly convex leading and concave trailing margins, and blunt tips. The pelvic fins are triangular {{with nearly}} straight margins. The first dorsal fin originates over the pectoral fin insertions, and is broadly triangular {{with a narrow}} apex and a concave trailing margin. The second dorsal fin measures about 67ndash&77% as tall as the first and is similar in shape; there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is almost {{as large as the}} second dorsal fin and lies slightly behind; it has a deep notch in the posterior margin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical; the lower lobe is narrow and well-developed, while the upper lobe has a gently convex upper margin and a prominent notch in the ventral margin near the tip. The body is covered by small, overlapping oval-shaped dermal denticles bearing three or five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is plain slate-gray above, including the upper surfaces of the pectoral and pelvic fins, and the caudal fin; the underside is white. The boundary between dark and light runs through the <b>bottom</b> <b>rim</b> of the eye, through the gill slits, over the flank well above the pelvic fins, and onto the upper caudal fin lobe. The fins darken towards the posterior margins, forming a black edge on the upper caudal fin lobe; each pectoral fin also has a black blotch underneath, near the tip. The eyes are ringed in white.|$|E

50|$|Originally Cegléd jugs {{were made}} of {{galvanized}} tin. Later they {{were made of}} aluminium and steel, both bare metal and enamel-covered, typically of red, blue or white color. Despite the complicated shape, the jug (without handle) was made of a single metal sheet. For sturdiness, the mouth and <b>bottom</b> <b>rims</b> were doubly folded. The handle was attached by rivets.|$|R
2500|$|Three-piece can {{construction}} {{results in}} top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rims.</b> In two-piece construction, one piece is a flat {{top and the}} other a deep-drawn cup-shaped piece that combines the (at least roughly) cylindrical wall and the round base. Transition between wall and base is usually gradual. [...] Such cans have a single rim at the top. Some cans have a separate cover that slides onto the top or is hinged.|$|R

40|$|A {{nanopore}} electrode {{structure was}} fabricated consisting of ensembles of nanopores with separately addressable electrodes at the pore <b>bottoms</b> and the <b>rims.</b> A metal/insulator/metal layer structure allowed for adjusting the spacing between the <b>bottom</b> and <b>rim</b> electrodes {{to be in}} the range of about 200  nm. Pore diameters varied between 200 and 800  nm. The electrochemical properties of this electrode structure and its perspectives for applications in bioelectronics were studied using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry along with high-resolution scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in constant-distance mode. It was possible to visualize the electrochemical activity of a single nanometric electrode using high-resolution SECM in a combination of sample-generation-tip-collection mode and positive feedback mode. The SECM images suggested an influence of the unbiased rim electrode on redox amplification which was used as a basis for evaluating the feasibility of current amplification by means of redox cycling between the <b>bottom</b> and <b>rim</b> electrodes. Amplification factors superior to those obtained with interdigitated array electrodes could be demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 42) A cylindrical {{drawing of}} the complete bipartite graph Km,n is a drawing with two disjoint sets of vertices placed {{on the top and}} <b>bottom</b> <b>rims</b> of a cylinder where every vertex at the top is connected to every vertex at the bottom by an edge drawn along the lateral surface of the cylinder. The cylindrical crossing number is defined as the minimum number of crossings among all cylindrical drawings of a graph. A formula is derived for the cylindrical crossing number of K,m,n as well as an algorithm for creating a drawing that achieves that number. With this result, we show that among all cylindrical drawings of the complete graph Km,n where the edges between two vertices on the inner (or outer) boundary are contained inside (or outside) the boundary, the drawing with half (or nearly half) of the vertices on each boundary has the fewest crossings...|$|R

One had {{radial slots}} engraved along the <b>bottom</b> <b>rim</b> of the resonant cavity interior, {{as required by}} Fetta's theory to produce thrust; another [...] "null" [...] test article lacked those radial slots. Both drives were equipped with an internal dielectric. A third test article, the experimental control, had an RF load but no resonant cavity interior. These tests took place at atmospheric pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Some drums have {{reinforcing}} {{rings of}} thickened metal or plastic, called [...] "chimes", at four places: top, bottom, and one each {{a third of}} the way from each end ring. This sufficiently strengthens them so that they can readily be turned on their sides and rolled when filled with heavy materials, like liquids. Over short to medium distances, drums can be tipped and rolled on the <b>bottom</b> <b>rim</b> while being held at an angle, balanced, and rotated with a two-handed top grip that also supplies the torque (rotational or rolling force).|$|E
50|$|In {{its early}} years, the {{lighthouse}} exterior colour was plain white {{and had a}} <b>bottom</b> <b>rim.</b> In the late 20th century, the bottom part faded and brick material what would compose and its exterior became light stucco. In early 2013, its second building with the same style was constructed and was finished before 2014 and became activated as the lighthouse moved to its new location. The older lighthouse became deactivated and a crack was formed east of the mid-staircase. In 2015, {{a new series of}} resort villas started construction east of the lighthouse and is near completion. No resorts have been constructed {{on the west side of}} the old lighthouse's location.|$|E

[...] A continuous undulating ground-line runs all round the basin. Other inscriptions run round the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rims</b> of the basin. [...] While the baptism of Jesus is very commonly depicted in Early Medieval art, those of the other figures are very rare subjects indeed, and this unusually elaborate and learned programme was no doubt composed with clerical assistance. It does not reflect Byzantine iconographic precedents; instead it matches closely the interest in typology and allegory, of which the influential contemporary Liège-born theologian Rupert of Deutz was a particular exponent (though Rupert was also a particular opponent of the bishop at the time, Otbert of Liège, who took the Emperor's side in the Investiture Controversy). [...] The head of God the Father that appears {{at the top of the}} Baptism of Christ (identified as PATER) is an early appearance of God the Father in Western art; a Hand of God, more typical of the period, appears in the baptism scenes of Cornelius and Craton.|$|R

50|$|At {{the tip of}} the jaw, the premaxilla and maxilla are {{separated}} by a groove, which is also a defining characteristic of Sinosaurus. The premaxilla would have been taller than it is long, which is similar to specimen LFGT LDM-L10 of Sinosaurus triassicus but unlike either Dilophosaurus or specimen KMV 8701 of Sinosaurus sinensis. Also like LFGT LDM-L10, the bottom edge of the premaxilla is much higher than the maxilla. The two bones are at the same level in KMV 8701, and are angled away from each other in Dilophosaurus. Similar to both LFGT LDM-L10 and KMV 8701, the maxilla bears a near-vertical front margin; it is lower and more pointed in Dilophosaurus. The front portion of the bottom margin of the maxilla is angled such that the first maxillary tooth projects forwards. There is a groove running parallel to the tooth row along the <b>bottom</b> <b>rim</b> of the maxilla.|$|E
