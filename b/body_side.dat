25|$|The Caprice {{models were}} renamed to Caprice Classic for the 1973 model year. The Kingswood Estate model with {{simulated}} wood-grain <b>body</b> <b>side</b> trim was now named the Caprice Estate. The convertible was {{moved from the}} Impala to the Caprice lineup {{for the first time}} in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{tradition}} of adding a trim level above the EX during the refresh like the first generation CR-V, Honda added the SE trim level for the 2005 CR-V. The CR-V SE featured painted bumpers, <b>body</b> <b>side</b> molding, and hard, body-colored spare tire cover. For a more luxurious experience, Honda added a leather interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated side mirrors and front seats.|$|E
25|$|Exterior {{colors were}} limited to Alpine White, Firecracker Red, Sunshine Yellow, Quick Silver Metallic, or Classic Black. Only the black painted {{versions}} included gold <b>body</b> <b>side</b> stripes that continued {{up and over the}} roof band, as well as gold paint accents for the standard slot-styled wheels. A carryover 1977 Hornet AMX decal was available for the rear deck and hood, in either gold with orange or black with gold. Polished forged aluminum 5-spoke road wheels were optional.|$|E
50|$|JR Freight {{started a}} {{programme}} of life-extension refurbishment of its Class ED75-1000 fleet from 1993, and refurbished locomotives were initially repainted {{in a new}} livery with {{the bottom half of}} the <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> finished in ivory. The livery applied to refurbished locomotives was subsequently simplified to just adding a white stripe along the bottom of the <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> could {{secure a}} load {{but could not}} be loaded from the side by forklifts, so a <b>body</b> with drop <b>sides</b> was standardized as the M54A1C.|$|R
5000|$|WAP-5 {{locomotives}} homed at Ghaziabad loco shed {{have large}} 'P-5' decals on their <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
25|$|These {{sets were}} branded for New Zealand Rail's {{suburban}} operator Cityline, {{and carried the}} Cityline branding and logo under the central four windows on the car <b>body</b> <b>side.</b> The NZR logo was painted {{in front of the}} car numbers at either end. Following the sale of NZ Rail Ltd to Wisconsin Central and the rebranding of suburban services as Tranz Metro, the NZR logos and Cityline branding were deleted and replaced with the Tranz Metro logo in the place of the former Cityline branding.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of all the}} LH sedans, {{the first}} {{generation}} Concorde was most {{closely related to the}} Eagle Vision. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheetmetal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, <b>body</b> <b>side</b> moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body colored strips with the Chrysler Pentastar logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height lightbar between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's <b>body</b> <b>side</b> moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came {{all the way up to}} the chrome beltline; on Visions the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles.|$|E
25|$|The DMC-12 {{was only}} {{available}} with two factory options; a no-cost manual transmission or automatic transmission ($650 extra) {{and the choice}} of a grey or black interior. Several dealer options were available, including a car cover; floor mats; black textured accent stripes; grey scotch-cal accent stripes; a luggage rack and a ski-rack adapter. The standard feature list included stainless steel body panels; gull-wing doors with cryogenically treated torsion bars; leather seats; air conditioning; an AM/FM cassette stereo system; power windows, locks and mirrors; a tilt and telescopic steering wheel; tinted glass; <b>body</b> <b>side</b> moldings; intermittent/constant windshield wipers; and an electric rear window defogger.|$|E
50|$|In visual {{appearance}} the Class 10E can {{be distinguished}} from the later model Class 10E2 by the roof ends and the sills. The Class 10E has riffled roof ends {{and parts of the}} sill protrude slightly past the bottom edge of the <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b> The Class 10E2 has smooth unriffled roof ends and no part of the sill protrudes past the bottom edge of the <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Traditional woods were chosen: Spruce (top soundboard); Rosewood (<b>body</b> <b>sides</b> {{and back}} soundboard); Ebony (fretboard [...] ) and Mahogany(neck) ...|$|R
50|$|Upper <b>body's</b> <b>side</b> {{sections}} {{have the}} founder's heraldic decoration and two kings of arms placed at {{height of the}} central shield.|$|R
25|$|Prohormones are {{precursors}} to {{hormones and}} are most typically sold to bodybuilders as {{a precursor to}} the natural hormone testosterone. This conversion requires naturally occurring enzymes in the <b>body.</b> <b>Side</b> effects are not uncommon, as prohormones can also convert further into DHT and estrogen. To deal with this, many supplements also have aromatase inhibitors and DHT blockers such as chrysin and 4-androstene-3,6,17-trione. To date most prohormone products have not been thoroughly studied, and {{the health effects of}} prolonged use are unknown. Although initially available over the counter, their purchase was made illegal without a prescription in the US in 2004, and they hold similar status in many other countries. They remain legal, however, in the United Kingdom and the wider European Union. Their use is prohibited by most sporting bodies.|$|E
500|$|Debuting in September 1992 as a 1993 model, the {{refreshed}} LS 400 (designed through 1991) {{was introduced}} {{with more than}} 50 changes, largely in response to customer and dealer requests. The vehicle received larger disc brakes, wheels, and tires, and adjustments {{were made to the}} suspension and power steering systems to improve handling. Stylistic changes included additional <b>body</b> <b>side</b> moldings and a revised grille, along with a greater selection of colors. For the interior, a standard passenger front airbag (first Toyota-built series production car available with passenger front airbag), an external temperature gauge, digital odometer, seat belt pretensioners, and chlorofluorocarbon-free refrigerant were added. In 1992, the Celsior introduced the world first GPS navigation system with voice instructions, supplied by Aisin. By 1994, the LS 400's U.S. base price exceeded , a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle's introduction. Customer demand for the vehicle and shifts in foreign exchange rates contributed to the increase in price. The growing popularity of the LS internationally was an asset to Toyota, as Japan had entered into an economic recession in 1991, that later became what was called the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble or [...] "bubble economy". Production of the first-generation LS ended in September 1994 to make way for production of the second-generation model in October.|$|E

50|$|A final {{batch of}} vans was {{constructed}} in 1950-1951, {{this time with a}} steel frame and two axles, but also with panelled <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> in place of planks. These forty vans were numbered 707Z through 746Z.|$|R
2500|$|Butterfly slide: On breakaways or {{any other}} {{movement}} goaltenders should be using this technique to make [...] "proper saves". [...] To perform this goaltender move, you must use your leg to push off with your skate and with one knee hovering just above the ice [...] while using your other skate to push your <b>body</b> <b>side</b> to side.|$|E
2500|$|For 1954, the Jet {{received}} minor trim updates to its two- and four-door sedans. A new luxury model, the Jet-Liner {{was added}} making the Jet a three series model line. The Jet-Liner came with chrome trim around {{the windows and}} <b>body</b> <b>side,</b> gravel shields, as well as upgraded color-keyed vinyl interiors featuring foam rubber seat cushions.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1971 {{model year}} the [...] "X" [...] appearance/equipment trim package was {{introduced}} as a $300 option on the 4-passenger model and [...] "proved extremely popular." [...] It included <b>body</b> <b>side</b> tape stripes, body color front fascia, slotted road wheels with D70x14 Goodyear Polyglas tires, blackout grille insert, bucket seats, and [...] "X" [...] decals.|$|E

50|$|In 1971, the South African Railways placed fifty Class 6E1, Series 2 {{electric}} locomotives with a Bo-Bo wheel arrangement in mainline service. Series 2 {{was the first}} of the Class 6E1s to have their sandbox lids set into the bottom edge of the locomotive <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Westerner (500 units) in Frost White {{paint with}} wood plank trim side inserts for the <b>body</b> <b>side</b> and tailgate, {{as well as}} a [...] "Pony Express" [...] medallion. The {{interior}} featured stallion brown vinyl that simulated [...] "richly tooled" [...] leather on the seats and door panels in combination with white antelope grained vinyl. The Westerner was available west of the Mississippi River.|$|E
2500|$|All Americans {{received}} a new chrome horizontal grille bar that extended outboard to the headlights, while the grille sections got an attractive [...] "blackout" [...] treatment. The wraparound rear {{window on the}} sedans was modified to a flat unit, with a more squared-off [...] "C" [...] pillar, which changed the appearance from the earlier sedans with their overhanging rooflines. [...] The overall effect was a more formal-looking car. [...] The 440 and Rogue versions picked up a stainless steel trim piece running stem to stern on either <b>body</b> <b>side,</b> straight back between the wheel wells and the belt line. At {{each end of the}} strip were the newly safety-mandated <b>body</b> <b>side</b> reflectors, amber for the front fenders, red for the rear. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards for all passenger cars sold in America for 1968 also called for shoulder harness for the front seats and elimination of reflective interior trim. Other requirements for all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, included exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions.|$|E

50|$|It {{was based}} on the Ford {{full-size}} car line available in each year. The Country Sedan was the mid-trim station wagon in the Ford range. Unlike the Country Squire, the Country Sedan featured plain <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b> As a full-size wagon, it could carry up to 9 passengers, if so equipped.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Crossfire" [...] {{refers to}} the two {{character}} lines that run from front to rear along the <b>body</b> <b>sides</b> — crossing each other midway through the door panel. Conceived {{during the period of}} Chrysler's ownership by Daimler-Benz, the name also {{refers to the}} collaboration of the two companies.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Dreadnought" [...] {{was also}} the first GWR {{carriage}} with internal compartment doors, but as these did not go down well with the travelling public, the next design reverted to external compartment doors. The Concertina design of 1906/7 reverted to [...] width but retained the [...] length. The doors were recessed into the <b>body</b> <b>side</b> rather than flush with the outer panels, and as each carriage was placed in a fixed-set, the company had fitted bellows-like material connections between carriages to smooth the airflow.|$|E
2500|$|The Amitron was {{designed}} to minimize power loss by keeping down rolling resistance, wind drag resistance, and vehicle weight. The prototype was a snub-snouted three-passenger urban area vehicle or city car with an overall length of only [...] Among its unique automobile design features were passenger seats that had air filled cushions, rather than conventional polyurethane (foam rubber). The car did not feature conventional <b>body</b> <b>side</b> doors, but the canopy of the vehicle was hinged up and backward ("clamshell type" [...] on rear mounted pivots) for entry and egress.|$|E
5000|$|Pacers {{without the}} {{optional}} vinyl roof trim could be finished in several unique two-tone paint combinations, with {{front and rear}} scuff molding extensions on the <b>body</b> <b>sides.</b> The two-tone treatment was changed in 1977 to an [...] "up and over the roof" [...] accent paint scheme {{for the remainder of}} production.|$|R
5000|$|The trains have {{unpainted}} {{stainless steel}} bodies, with an exterior livery featuring red highlights. Each motored car has one motored bogie.
