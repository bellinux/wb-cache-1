Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A burner was designed and constructed to combine weed control practices of parallel and cross-flaming with the technology of covers and insulation. It involved two covers designed to be placed on the sides of a crop row. The flame under the covers was directed parallel to the crop row. Using uniquely designed vanes to divert heated air, the apparatus was designed to re-circulate a portion of heat emitted from the burners for increased fuel efficiency. The apparatus was evaluated by comparing it with the two open flame practices. This evaluation was performed by moving the burners over an area that would monitor the temperatures at specified heights and locations. Temperatures were measured using thermocouples placed at heights 7 -mm, 150 -mm, and 300 -mm in the crop row and height 7 -mm in the left and right furrows. Burners traveled at a designated speed (2, 3. 5, or 5 km/h) and burner operating pressure combination (207, 276, or 345 kPa). Time versus temperature curves were generated with the data for the temperatures observed. The areas under the curve, above 100 degrees C and within an exposure time boundary were used to compute utilization factors. The utilization factors provided a relative comparison of burner efficiency and performance. At 300 -mm in the row, temperatures never exceeded 100 degrees C. At 150 -mm in the row, temperatures rarely exceeded 100 degrees C. Sometimes temperatures exceeded 100 degrees C for a brief time. These results were evidence the <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> re-circulated some heat and excessive amounts of heat were not escaping into the crop canopy. The thermocouples at height 7 -mm provided a good indication of temperature activity with the burners. With areas under the curve in the row at 7 -mm, open cross-flaming showed higher temperatures for than the <b>covered</b> <b>burner.</b> However, the <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> had higher utilization factors than open cross-flaming. The <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> utilization factors were greater than open cross or parallel-flaming in the furrows...|$|R

A <b>covered</b> infrared <b>burner</b> was designed and constructed so that it could be compared to an open-flame <b>burner.</b> Two <b>covered</b> <b>burners,</b> a high configuration and a low configuration, were constructed. A low configuration <b>covered</b> infrared <b>burner,</b> high configuration <b>covered</b> infrared <b>burner,</b> and an open-flame burner were studied to evaluate the increase in temperature caused by each burner to a target zone. These evaluations were conducted while the burners were traveling at a given speed (2, 3. 5, or 5 km/h) and pressure combination (207, 276, or 345 kPa). The temperature increase was referred to as the heat transfer. The target zone levels were monitored individually by thermocouples on the target sensor, a tool developed specifically to aid in data acquisition for the heat transfer experiments. There were four zone levels that were observed: 3. 5 and 1 cm above ground, ground level, and 0. 5 cm below ground. A set of Temperature versus Time curves was developed for the four zones. The area under the curve, above the threshold boundary, and left of the exposure time boundary was found so that a utilization factor could be calculated. The utilization factor was used as a relative comparison of burner efficiency and performance. Results reveal that there was not a significant rise in temperature in the sub-ground level zone. The observations at the ground level zone varied dramatically due to the intermittent activity of soil particles making contact with the thermocouple. The 1 and 3. 5 cm zone levels were a better indication of temperature activity; therefore, conclusions were drawn from observations at these above ground levels. In comparing the utilization factors of the <b>covered</b> infrared <b>burners</b> and the open-flame burner, it was observed that the <b>covered</b> infrared <b>burner</b> performed better than an open-flame burner at any speed and pressure combination even when the <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> was utilizing all four burners continuously. When comparing the low and high configuration burner, it was observed that the low configuration burner slightly outperforms the high configuration burner when relating to the average utilization factor. This was attributed to the different forms of ventilation used for the low and high configuration burners...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there is}} a {{magnificent}} silver-gilded incense burner on display, {{as well as a}} silver-gold decorated sandalwood burner. This consists of a <b>burner</b> <b>cover,</b> stack, feet and other parts. The bottom rim of the cover is decorated with a circle of lotus petals patterns, and the upper part is carved with five lotuses and enlaced tendrils. On each lotus lies a tortoise with its head turned back, holding flowers in its mouth. The burner has five feet in the shape of beasts, the front parts of which are in the shape of unicorns. The inscription on the burner indicates that it was made in 869 AD by an imperial workshop specialized in fabricating gold and silver ware for the imperial family.|$|E
50|$|Steam Generator {{has three}} basic {{components:}} a coil of water tubes, {{surrounded by a}} series of <b>burner</b> assemblies, and <b>covered</b> with an insulated shroud. Each burner assembly consists of an air blower, which blows pre-heated air into the combustion chamber, a fuel atomizer, and an igniter. The blower and atomizer are arranged so that the flame front is tangential to the water-tube coils. Cyclone Power Technologies claims this arrangement allows the heavier particles in the fuel to circle the outside of the chamber until they are completely burned up, allowing for much cleaner, complete combustion of fuel, and resulting in cleaner emissions. However, they have not performed any testing to verify this theory.|$|R
40|$|The {{discrepancies}} in the stability limits {{based on the}} characteristic time Ï„_ 0, which were observed when burner families of different geometry were compared in Section III, have been explained by use of the residence time concept. Thus, the present experiments with burners of varying geometry have clearly shown that the residence time in the mixing zone is the proper correlation parameter for the stability limits. This parameter is not affected by the great variation the flow field encounters when the slot ratio is changed over a wide range. The experiment also {{has shown that the}} most satisfactory correlation is obtained by use of a residence time for the material in the inner part of the mixing zone. The small slot-ratio burner shows several interesting similarities with the can-type combustion chamber. The primary similarity lies {{in the structure of the}} mixing zone, because there is good reason to believe that the mixing zone in the can <b>burner</b> also is <b>covered</b> by a flow of fresh mixture for only a short distance. Hence, the successful correlation of stability limits for small slot-ratio burners, shown here, strongly suggests that the mechanism of governing importance for flame stabilization in can burners is the same as that for bluff-body flame stabilization. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent DOE-OHVT {{studies show}} that diesel {{emissions}} and fuel consumption can be greatly reduced at truck stops by switching from engine idle to auxiliary-fired heaters. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has studied high performance diesel burner designs that address the shortcomings of current low fire-rate burners. Initial test results suggest a real opportunity {{for the development of}} a truly advanced truck heating system. The BNL approach is to use a low pressure, air-atomized burner derived form burner designs used commonly in gas turbine combustors. This paper reviews the design and test results of the BNL diesel fueled cabin heater. The <b>burner</b> design is <b>covered</b> by U. S. Patent 6, 102, 687 and was issued to U. S. DOE on August 15, 2000. The development of several novel oil burner applications based on low-pressure air atomization is described. The atomizer used is a pre-filming, air blast nozzle of the type commonly used in gas turbine combustion. The air pressure used can b e as low as 1300 Pa and such pressure can be easily achieved with a fan. Advantages over conventional, pressure-atomized nozzles include ability to operate at low input rates without very small passages and much lower fuel pressure requirements. At very low firing rates the small passage sizes in pressure swirl nozzles lead to poor reliability and this factor has practically constrained these burners to firing rates over 14 kW. Air atomization can be used very effectively at low firing rates to overcome this concern. However, many air atomizer designs require pressures that can be achieved only with a compressor, greatly complicating the burner package and increasing cost. The work described in this paper has been aimed at the practical adaptation of low-pressure air atomization to low input oil burners. The objective of this work is the development of burners that can achieve the benefits of air atomization with air pressures practically achievable with a simple burner fan...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of biological and technical factors {{on the effect of}} flame weeding, as a basis for reducing the energy consumption and increasing the effective ground speed required for good weed control Responses of weeds and test plants were evaluated in the field. Effects of propane dose and ground speed were described by logistic models. The sigmoidal dose-response and speed-response curves imply that propane dose and the ground speed can be adjusted to the required control effect, the weed flora and the developmental stage of the plants, A 95 % reduction in susceptible annual weed species, with 0 - 4 true leaves, was achieved at propane doses of 10 - 20 kg ha^- 1, and the weeds were completely killed at 20 - 50 kg ha^- 1 (900 - 2300 MJ ha^- 1). Considerably higher doses were needed at later stages and for more tolerant species. The most tolerant species could not be controlled with one treatment, regardless of dose. Flamers with different characteristics were studied Flamers with <b>covered</b> <b>burners</b> were generally more effective than an open flamer, especially on larger plants and tolerant species. The effective ground speed was generally higher for flamers with a higher fuel input, but only up to a certain level, A flamer with a relatively high propane consumption of 34 kg h^- 1 per metre working width (440 kW m^- 1) allowed an effective ground speed of 8 km h^- 1 when smaller plants were treated, whereas the effective ground speed was 2, 6 km h^- 1 for a flamer with the more usual burner power of 12 kg h^- 1 m^- 1 (150 kW m^- 1). Temperatures from the flamers were measured above the ground under weed-free conditions in the laboratory. There was generally a high correlation between different thermal parameters, e. g. the maximum temperature and the temperature sum, measured from the flamers in the laboratory, and the weed reduction in the field, although discrepancies were found, Flame weeding is useful although the method could be further improved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{generate}} detailed and simplified kinetic models for the oxidation of the Primary Reference Fuels (PRF) n-heptane, iso-octane and their mixtures, with low numbers of species and reactions. These mechanisms are consistent {{in terms of the}} choice of kinetic parameters for the different reaction classes. The further aim is to validate the kinetic models {{for a wide range of}} different combustor operating conditions, such as engines, shock tube, jet-stirred reactors, flow reactors, laminar flames and <b>burners,</b> to <b>cover</b> the full range of temperatures, pressures and air-fuel equivalence ratios. In the validation procedure the focus is on both extensive tests for the low temperature ignition and a validation against flame experiments. This development is motivated by the fact that the broadly validated hydrocarbon fuel oxidation mechanisms that have been developed previously are large and thus consumed more CPU-time than is acceptable by commercially available CFD-tools, because of their complexity, which prohibits the direct incorporation in simulations of complex reactor models, e. g. with turbulent flow. For the simplification and the reduction of mechanisms a stepwise efficient and simple lumping strategy for different reaction types has been developed and subsequently combined with a necessity analysis. The lumping of species with the same functional groups helps to reduce the different complex pathways into one lumped reaction pathway, which reduces the mechanism in terms of both numbers of species and reactions, causing only a negligible loss of information of the detailed mechanism. This is controlled by comparing predicted concentration profiles of lumped species with the added profiles of the isomeric species. Then further reduction of the mechanism is achieved by using necessity analysis (reaction flow combined with a sensitivity analyses) which eliminated less necessary species and their corresponding reactions. The developed mechanisms are validated against ignition delay times measured in shock tube experiments from Fieweger et al., Ciezki et al. and Davidson et al. for temperatures from 600 ? 1300 K, for fuel air equivalence ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 3. 0 and pressures from 3. 2 ? 40 bar. It is also validated against shock tube data from Horning et al. and Smith et al. and Vermeer et al. for high temperatures from 1250 ? 1800 K, for fuel air equivalence ratios in the range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 and pressures from 1 4 bar. The detailed, lumped and skeleton mechanisms are further validated against the laminar flame speed experimental data of Davis and Law and for flame structure data of El Bakali et al [...] Predictions for the low and medium temperature range are also tested against species and heat release profiles obtained in plug flow and jet stirred reactors at pressures between 3 and 12. 5 bar against the experimental data of Callahan et al., Held et al., and Dagaut et al [...] The mechanisms are further validated and applied in HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) engine simulations using a zero dimensional ignition model. Mechanism show good agreement in cylinder pressure, temperature and also heat release rate with the experiments of Tsurushima et al [...] Finally detailed and lumped mechanisms for the oxidation of PRF fuel blends n-heptane/iso-octane and the alternative fuel blend n-heptane/toluene are presented and validated under conditions relevant for HCCI engines. For mixtures of n-heptane/toluene the mechanism was validated against shock tube experimental data from Burcat et al. and for mixtures of iso-octane/n-heptane the mechanism has been validated against the shock tube experimental data of Fieweger et al. for different octane numbers. In addition, the mechanism has been tested and applied using a zero dimensional engine model for HCCI. Results were compared against the experiments from Kalghatgi et al. and Christtensen et al. under a range of different initial operating conditions and varying fuel blends...|$|R
