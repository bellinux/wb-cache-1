5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from <b>being</b> <b>one</b> of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to <b>being</b> <b>one</b> with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E
