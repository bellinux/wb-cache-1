50|$|The {{increased}} use of pesticides and herbicides can have profound negative effects on the regal fritillary as well. Heavy spraying of herbicides can eliminate nearby larval food plants and nectar sources that they are dependent on (Selby 2007). The indiscriminant use of pesticides also poses a big threat to regal fritillaries and other prairie-specialist butterflies. Pesticides such as the bacterial pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis ("Bt", the agent used in gypsy moth control) is lethal to all Lepidoptera larvae. It is thought that the gypsy moth control programs used in the east along wooded grassland edges {{may have been a}} final factor leading to the loss of some populations (Selby 2007). <b>Broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> of insecticides for pest control on adjacent crop land and rangeland continues to be a direct threat to the regal fritillary.|$|E
40|$|Dalmatian {{toadflax}} (Linaria genistifolia ssp. Dalmatica) is a {{major concern}} in disturbed areas of British Columbia’s interior due to its pronounced ability to displace native vegetation. To investigate the most appropriate control method, including efficiency, a study was established in Kenna Cartwright Nature Park, Kamloops, BC in 2016. Manual removal and three herbicide treatments were compared by collecting live and dead stem count in 6 m by 6 m replicates (n= 30) during baseline, post-treatment and end-of-growing season assessments. Tordon 22 K was applied at 213 g a. e. ha- 1 picloram mixed with Agral 90 surfactant (0. 025 % by volume) using <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying,</b> spot spraying and hand wicking (August 23 rd). Treatment had a significant effect; broadcast and spot spraying provided the highest overall success resulting in mean stem counts of 1. 7 ± 1. 07 and 6. 33 ± 2. 67 {{at the end of the}} growing season, respectively. Wicking offered the same overall success as spot spraying in reducing total live stems. However, wicking contained 61 % of the live stems at the end of the growing season, relative to baseline, whereas spot spraying only contained 31 %. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> offered the greatest success in which survivorship was 13 %. Only broadcast and spot spraying provide statistically significant reduction in vegetative stems from baseline to end-of-season; <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> contained zero stems in this life stage. Despite eliminating all stems at time of treatment, manual removal experienced high regrowth which resulted in statistical similarity to the control and appeared to encourage vegetative regrowth. Nearly all of the regrowth experienced in the control, manual removal, spot spraying and wicking at the end of the growing season were rosettes. Seedlings did not greatly contribute to reproduction in any treatments and were absent from <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying.</b> For high density sites (> 31 stems/m 2), <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> offers the greatest chance of success based on both success and efficiency. Low to medium density sites can be controlled by spot spraying, however the lower residual soil activity must be considered. Ultimately, the effect on the native plant community must be evaluated when selecting one of the recommended treatment methods and future research should focus on tracking the communities through time...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to develop an {{integrated}} weed control strategy against annual weeds in spring oilseed rape {{by means of a}} combined mechanical and chemical weed control which will be performed concurrently and separately. The project encompasses field experiments in which different combinations of inter-row hoeing and intra-row herbicide treatments will be evaluated and compared to conventional weed control treatments with <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> of herbicides, and experiments in which an implement for concurrent inter-row hoeing and intra-row herbicide treatment will be refined and evaluated. In 2012, an implement for intra-row spraying combined with row hoeing was developed and evaluated in two field experiments in spring oilseed rape {{in the southern part of}} Sweden. The effects of inter-row hoeing, intra row spraying, and combination of the two methods were compared with conventional <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying.</b> Preliminary results showed that the best weed control effects were obtained with the combination of inter-row hoeing and intra-row spraying in both experiments. Regarding crop yield, the yield was significantly higher in the combined treatment in one of the experiments while no effects on the yields were obtained in the other experiment. We envisage that the inter-row hoeing and intra-row herbicide treatment will diminish the overall use of herbicides to less than one third in comparison with the more conventional chemical weed control methods, while having the same weed control effect...|$|E

Because {{distribution in the}} soil {{plays an important role}} in herbicide fate and transport, this study was conducted to analyze the effect of various application methods on herbicide losses with surface runoff. Twelve rainfall simulation plots (three replications of four herbicide application treatments) were established in 1995. Losses of atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine with surface runoff were measured for the four different treatments: <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> without incorporation with no-till (NT), <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> with disk incorporation (SD), <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> with Mulch Master incorporation (MR), and subsurface application with incorporation using a modified Mulch Master (MB). For the modified Mulch Master, sprayer nozzles were added to the trailing edges of 61 -cm wide Mulch Master sweeps, which were run at a depth of 6 cm. Following herbicide application, rainfall was simulated at 6. 35 cm h - 1 for 1. 5 h on the 3. 1 m × 10. 7 m plots. Runoff volumes and soil losses were greatest for NT (3. 36 cm and 632 kg ha - 1), followed by MR and MB, with SD showing the lowest total runoff and sediment losses (0. 34 cm and 217 kg ha - 1). Herbicide losses and concentrations were significantly greater (P = 0. 10) for NT than for the other three treatments. On the NT plots, runoff began quickly and only occurred on two of the four inter-row areas that had traffic tracks. Herbicide losses decreased in the order of NT, MR, SD, and MB. In addition, MR and MB retained more surface crop residue than SD...|$|R

30|$|The eucalypts at the {{incursion}} {{site had}} an average height of 20 – 30  m, so the only effective insecticide application method was by aerial spraying. Given {{the nature of the}} environment, it was important to minimise spray drift. Prior modelling using specialised software (spray drift AGDISP) enabled subsequent aerial applications to be undertaken with minimum drift, thus maximising efficacy for a successful eradication within a semi-rural environment. Moreover, the spot-spraying technique allowed better targeted treatment than <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying,</b> which provided a safer option for isolated trees close to houses. Spot-spraying was also applied to trees that had been sprayed using a conventional boom because it provided good coverage of insecticide throughout the canopy and on the lower leaf surfaces (Strand et al. 2014) where larvae were often observed. The spot-spraying technique used here was a modification of the spot-gun, developed to control invasive wilding pines (Gous et al. 2014) and is the first time this technology has been used for aerial application of insecticide.

An innovative machine for weed control in inter-row and intra-row areas, with a unique combination of inter-row cultivation tooling and intra-row band spraying for six rows and an electro-hydraulic side-shift frame controlled by a GPS system, was developed and evaluated. Two weed management strategies were tested in the field trials: <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> (the conventional method) and band spraying with mechanical weed control using RTK-GPS (the experimental method). This approach enabled the comparison between treatments {{from the perspective of}} cost savings and efficacy in weed control for a sugar beet crop. During the 2010 – 2011 season, the herbicide application rate (112 L ha− 1) of the experimental method was approximately 50 % of the conventional method, and thus a significant reduction in the operating costs of weed management was achieved. A comparison of the 0. 2 -trimmed means of weed population post-treatment showed that the treatments achieved similar weed control rates at each weed survey date. Sugar beet yields were similar with both methods (p = 0. 92). The use of the experimental equipment is cost-effective on ≥ 20 ha of crops.

In two separate experiments repeated in space and time, we used prescribed fire in combination with herbicides at various rates and two application methods to develop an effective management scheme for reducing smooth sumac. We used a randomized complete block design with 13 herbicide treatments and a control with three replicates in burned and non-burned areas. Results were similar in both experiments in which herbicide treatment and burning were the significant main effects. All herbicide treatments reduced smooth sumac stem density compared to the control, but no distinct advantage was detected regarding specific herbicide, application rate, or whether the herbicide was applied as a <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> or with a hand-held wick.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Handgun applicators are popular, general‐purpose {{greenhouse}} sprayers. However, {{there are}} few recommendations {{on how to use}} them to treat plant benches. Handgun applications made from one side can result in significant differences in deposits between the side of the plant facing the spray stream and the opposite side. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> {{over the top of the}} canopy may improve spray distribution across the canopy. The objective of this research was to determine differences in performance between different sprayers used to treat mature poinsettias and differences in the fate of the spray within the canopy with the aim to determine which techniques produced the highest spray retention on the abaxial leaf surface. A benchtop trial was conducted using a mature poinsettia canopy in a greenhouse. Sprayer treatments were used to apply tank mixes of pesticides and fluorescent tracer. Nylon screen targets were secured to the abaxial surfaces of leaves in the upper and lower parts of the canopy. Benchtop trials revealed significant differences between the amount of spray found on the upper and lower canopy target areas. Handgun nozzle pressure was a more significant factor in depositing material on the abaxial surfaces of leaves than changing application rate. A TwinJet boom system using dual‐orifice nozzles did not treat abaxial surfaces differently from the handgun applications. The air‐assist treatment with flat‐fan nozzles produced the highest mean deposits on abaxial surfaces in the lower canopy area, but overall there were no statistical differences in lower canopy deposits between treatments. These results demonstrate the difficulty that ornamental producers have in targeting pesticide placement on abaxial leaf surfaces deeper in the canopy. The variability in spray deposits observed on foliage demonstrates the potential for significant variability in pest management...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{control is}} {{typically}} achieved by <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> postemergence herbicides {{on the entire}} orchard floor which wastes chemical by spraying bare ground. Growers can account for spatial variation in weed density and only spray weedy areas instead of applying herbicide to entire fields by using the automatic spot-sprayer, WeedSeeker sprayer. We conducted field experiments in flood- and microsprinikler-irrigated lemon orchards, and flood- and sprinkler-irrigated pecan orchards to measure the amount of herbicide applied, weed control, tree yield, and the economic value of adopting the WeedSeeker sprayer compared to conventional boom spray technology. The WeedSeeker sprayer reduced cumulative herbicide use by at least 36 % compared to the conventional boom sprayer at all sites. Weed control obtained using the WeedSeeker sprayer was usually similar to the conventional boom sprayer. There were no effects of the treatments on yield at any location. The partial budget analysis, {{used to determine the}} economic value of adopting the technology, showed that as the area of the orchard and the cost of the herbicide increased, the time to recover the initial investment in the WeedSeeker sprayer decreased. The investment in the technology can typically be recovered in less than five years in Arizona lemon and pecan orchards. We also conducted greenhouse experiments to determine the effect of various sensitivity settings and leaf area on the operational efficiency of the WeedSeeker sprayer. The WeedSeeker sprayer did not detect and spray all broadleaf and monocot plants unless a sensitive setting was used. The WeedSeeker sprayer was more efficient when detecting broadleaf plants compared to monocot plants. Our results indicate that operating the WeedSeeker sprayer using a sensitive setting (sensitivity level 2) will result in the most efficient detection of weeds. Finally, field studies were conducted in a non-bearing pecan orchard to evaluate weed management systems using various postemergence and preemergence herbicides. Most postemergence herbicides controlled the weed species present in the orchard. Tank mixing the herbicides generally resulted in greater control compared to applying them alone. All preemergence herbicides reduced the weed emergence compared to not using a preemergence herbicide. No pecan tree damage was observed in any treatment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1960 More than {{one-fourth of}} the forest land in the Pacific Northwest is growing timber at reduced {{capacity}} {{as the result of}} brush encroachment. Increasing use of chemicals in brush control requires that more information be available regarding their use. Bigleaf maple, Oregon oak and vine maple are among the more noxious brush species in the Willamette Valley area. This thesis summarizes the progress which has been made in the control of these species by the Forest Research Division. Aerial sprays have been found satisfactory in many areas for <b>broadcast</b> <b>spraying</b> of low brush cover. Basal sprays and ground level foliage sprays are used on weed trees and tall brush. Topography is also a major consideration in choice of method. Effectiveness of the herbicide is determined by climate, season, species, specific chemical, formulation, diluent, concentration, and many unknown factors. Most of the treatments in this project were applied to individual stems. Many of the tests were established in order to find the most effective chemical for a given situation; others expand on information gained in earlier trials. On large trees, applications were made both basally and in frills; also in bands around the boles at breast height with paste type herbicides. Smaller shrubs were treated with foliage sprays, dormant cane sprays, and individual stem sprays. The treatments were located on Bureau of Land Management land near Scio, Oregon, and in the McDonald Forest. Aerial spray projects conducted by the Bureau of Land Management in the Cascades and in the Coast Range have been included in these observations. Bigleaf maple was killed very successfully with basal sprays of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in oil in a mixture of 32 ahg. It is very likely that much lower dosages will prove adequate. Maple stems up to eight inches d. b. h. were well controlled with 2, 4, 5 -T applied in a similar manner. Girdling has not proved to be an adequate method of control because of basal resprouting and delayed top-kill. Frilling followed with a dilute spray (22 ahg) of 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) in kerosene gave good control. However, the cost of application is higher than for a similar basal spray. Paste herbicides were largely rather ineffective except for kilbrush applied in September. Oregon oak has proven more difficult to kill with basal sprays than maple. However, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and 2, 4 -D amine in frills have both provided complete top killing. 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) gave the better sprout control. Kilbrush gave good results on small stems when applied in August. Scarification of the bark prior to treatment proved to be the most dependable method. Vine maple has been top-killed by 2, 4, 5 -T, 2 -(2, 4, 5 -TP) and brushkiller mixtures in many forms and concentrations. Sprouting has not been controlled completely by any of these but 2, 4, 5 -T is the most effective in this respect. Aerial sprays of four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T in some cases have caused nearly complete top-kill, and considerable sprout retardation. Snowbrush has been completely killed by 2, 4, 5 -T with foliage and with step sprays. A Bureau of Land Management aerial spray project using four pounds per acre of 2, 4, 5 -T gave 100 per cent kill of this species. Cherry, elderberry, thimbleberry, poison oak and madrone can be effectively top-killed with 2, 4, 5 -T as basal or foliage spray. Sprout control has been relatively poor on most of these species. Grass competition to young seedlings can be reduced with several chemicals. Tree survival is consistently higher, however, when the minimum amount of grass herbicide is applied which will reduce grass density to approximately 60 per cent of normal. Soil sterilization reduces tree survival. The use of herbicides as a forest management tool has increased rapidly in recent years. Public acceptance of the value of this tool and further refinements in techniques can provide much needed relief for the brush problem in out forests...|$|E

In the positionally selective treatments, herbicide spray was directed to leave an untreated zone over the crop row at planting. Growth analysis indicated no detectable differences when Italian ryegrass safened by directed spray was compared to Italian ryegrass safened by activated carbon. The major difference between systems was greater weed control in the crop row for carbon-safened treatments. The non-safened application superimposed sublethal diuron rates over Italian ryegrass and rattail fescue grown in varying densities and proportiors. Growth analysis of monoculture stands indicated differences due to planted density, species, and herbicide, whereas growth analysis of plants grown as space-planted individuals indicated difference due to species only. Diuron at the rates applied did not affect seed yield or above ground dry weight.

In bioassays, the percentage of G. mellonella mortality was consistently higher on leaves (average = 84 %), intermediate on flower clusters (73 %), and lower on twigs (43 %) for all application dates. In 1992 and 1993, single nematode sprays applied every 2 to 3 days from early May to mid-June on apple tree limbs reduced primary damage caused by H. testudinea by 98 % and 100 %, respectively, {{but none of the}} treatments was effective in 1994. In 1993 and 1994, multiple border-row sprays were applied against C. nenuphar adults with a commercial hand-gun applicator in an insecticide-free orchard. At harvest, plum curculio damage in the nematode-treated orchard reached 5 % and 55 % in 1993 and 1994, respectively, as compared to 80 % and 85 % in an adjacent insecticide-free orchard. In a second experiment performed in 1994, multiple <b>broadcast</b> <b>sprays</b> with a commercial orchard sprayer caused no significant effect on plum curculio damage (nematode = 28 %; control = 31 %). Although some efficacy of canopy sprays of nematodes was detected against early-season apple pests, the inconsistent results and high application costs preclude their use as a sole control tactic against these pests in commercial apple orchards...|$|R

Microfiche. xiii, 89 leaves ill. 29 cmThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to (1) obtain {{a better understanding}} of the interrelationship of ants, mealybug, and mealybug wilt disease of pineapple in Hawaii, and (2) to develop alternative methods of ant control. The study was in three parts: 1) a follow-up study of the epidemiology of mealybug wilt in a pineapple field at Poamoho, Oahu, Hawaii, Which was previously used for a study on the biology and ecology of big-headed ant, Pheido 1 e megacephala (Fabricius), and the gray pineapple mealybug, Dysmicoccus neobrevipes Beardsley, the two most important insects associated with the mealybug wilt of pineapple; 2) laboratory screening of potentially useful insecticide compounds for possible use as ant baits or as broadcast spray; and 3) field tests of promising ant baits and <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> for ant control on the Island of Molokai. The population density of the big-headed ant was higher during the second crop than during the first crop of pineapple at both Poamoho and Molokai. No mealybug wilt plants were found in plots with excellent ant control, while the number of mealybug wilt plants increased sharply during the second crop in blocks where ants were not controlled. The incidence of mealybug wilt was higher at the edge of the plot than toward the middle of the field. Infestation of the Mo 10 kai experimental planting (20. 3 ha divided into 102 0. 2 -ha plots) by big-headed ants started at the edge of the planting adjacent to an abandoned field and along a waste area. The ant dispersal and percentage of ant infested plots increased progressively with the age of the pineapples. A baited stake technique is described for use of evaluation of big-headed ant populations. Soybean oil mixed with peanut butter (50 : 50) was the most attractive bait material of all those tested for the big-headed ant workers. The greatest foraging activity of the ant occurred after sunset. Sixteen pesticides were selected from laboratory screening tests and tested as baits. Baits of AC 217300 (2 (1 H) -Pyrimidinone, tetrahydro- 5, 5 -dimethyl-, [3 - 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]- 1 -[2 -[4 (trifluoromethyl) phenyl]=ethenyl]- 2 -propenylidene]hydrazone) were acceptable to the ant and were more effective than any of the other pesticides studied. Field tests were conducted with baits of AC 217300 (85 % corncob grits, 15 % soybean oil, and AC 217300 at concentration of 1500 to 7500 ppm) at a rate of 2. 24 kg bait per hectare. Results showed that the baits at 7500 ppm were as effective as mirex baits (0. 3 %) for controlling ~. megacephala. <b>Broadcast</b> <b>sprays</b> of 8 insecticides were applied for control of P. megacephala in the pineapple field at Molokai. Carbofuran, chlordane, diazinon, fonofos, heptachlor, and acephate all gave a high initial kill of the ants one day after the treatment. However, five months after the treatment, only heptachlor and chlordane continued to give good control of the ants. Tests with diazinon and acephate showed that their effectiveness was affected by the size of the pineapple plants. Additional tests with acephate indicated it has some promise for ant control. Pest management strategies for control of pineapple mealybug wilt disease are discussed. Information of ant movement would be useful in ant control programs. Destroying ants and mealybugs along edges of pineapple plantings may prevent pest migrations into newly planted fields. Use of insecticides only at the periphery of the fields and in uncultivated areas contiguous with new plantings may effectively control the ants, thus minimizing the overall use of insecticides...|$|R

The model utilises information about the optical transmission range probability distribution of the target orchard. This information is derived from a tractor mounted LIDAR system that provides an idealised optical analogue of spray droplet transmission in the target trees closest to the sprayer.

To test whether IVM principles {{can be applied to}} ROWs in northern Canada, I investigated the impacts of eight management strategies on plant communities in Yukon, Canada. Because forestry herbicide applications are not common in Yukon, I also examined the acute toxicity of imazapyr and triclopyr to non-target plants in standardized greenhouse tests with common boreal herbs. For treatments, triclopyr and imazapyr were each applied by three methods: <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray,</b> cut stump and point injection. Additional treatments were mechanical mowing or cutting target species and seeding native grasses. Vegetation cover surveys were completed before treatments and repeated after one year along with visual herbicide damage assessments. ROW plant communities were significantly altered by management methods one year after treatment, but clear directional changes were not yet evident. Herbicide treatments were more effective at target species control than mechanical methods. All treatments caused a minor reduction in non-target species cover. Imazapyr applications caused more damage to non-target species than triclopyr. Other treatment impacts were life form (e. g. shrub, forb, etc.) or species-specific. Vegetative vigour tests and seedling emergence and seedling growth tests in five ROW soils were used to assess toxicity of both herbicides to Achillea millefolium and Chamerion angustifolium. Test results supported field findings: imazapyr was more toxic than triclopyr. Foliar Inhibition Concentration (IC) 50 estimates were 0. 7 and 1. 2 % of the maximum imazapyr application rate vs. 31 % for A. millefolium and triclopyr (C. angustifolium’s could not be calculated). Soil applied triclopyr caused IC 50 estimates of 2 - 20 µg g- 1 and imazapyr IC 50 estimates were 50 % of residues remained after 30 days and indicates further research into triclopyr dissipation and risks to wildlife in northern ecosystems is needed...|$|R

This point-injection cylinder (PIC) can incorporate herbicides {{in a single pass}} through the field while leaving the soil surface virtually undisturbed. The PIC functions effectively on both bare soil surfaces and soil surface covered with crop residue;The relative persistence of banded herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, and propachlor) using the PIC and a band sprayer was compared in a field study. A bare soil surface and a soil covered with an average of 79 percent corn residue were used in the comparison. Point injection was found to decrease losses due to a combination of volatilization, photodegradation, and runoff thus increasing persistence for alachlor and propachlor applied to soil. The relative persistence of atrazine applied to soil was found to be about the same for both application methods 21 days after application. Losses were higher for the herbicides sprayed on the corn residue as compared to point-injection into the soil;Weed control with the PIC and <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> with disk incorporation was determined for various herbicides using oats as the test species. There was no significant difference found between these application methods in controlling the oats for the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, butylate, or EPTC. Weed control was significantly higher for trifluralin when disk incorporated versus point-injected. In a full field study, no significant difference in weed control were found between applying atrazine and alachlor with the PIC and band sprayers. Both application methods were effective in controlling the weeds in the banded area when compared to a check treatment;In a rainfall simulation study, band spraying was compared against point-injection to determine if there were differences in the percentages of the atrazine, alachlor, and propachlor lost with runoff and leachate during 10 cm of rain 1 to 6 days after application. Tillages used included no tillage, chisel plow tillage, and ridge tillage. No significant difference was found in the runoff water and sediment, or the leaching water losses for atrazine, alachlor, or propachlor when applied by either the point injector or a band spraying nozzle...|$|R

A recently-developed fertilizer applicator, the spoke-wheel injector has potential to improve fertilizer-use efficiency in ridge-till systems, but little work has been done to identify efficient N placements for ridges. A field study to investigate corn (Zea mays L.) response to ridge-till N placement methods and to examine the inorganic N distribution resulting from point-injected N fertilizer was conducted within a corn-soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) rotation at two central Iowa locations on poorly-drained till-derived soils. Urea-ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) treatments consisted of combinations of three placements (surface <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray,</b> point injection between rows, or point injection in rows) and five rates from 0 to 157 kg N ha[superscript]- 1. To determine fertilizer-N recovery, [superscript] 15 N-depleted NH[subscript] 4 NO[subscript] 3 (99. 99 % [superscript] 14 N) was substituted for UAN on one-row microplots from within the main plots of the 67 - and 157 -kg N ha[superscript]- 1 treatments. Nitrogen recovery was estimated from plant samples taken at four growth stages from [superscript] 15 N-depleted microplots. Nitrate- and NH[subscript] 4 -N were determined on soil samples taken late in the growing season at five positions perpendicular to the plant row and at several depth intervals from 0 -, 67 -, and 157 -kg N ha[superscript]- 1 injection treatments;Generally, 157 kg N ha[superscript]- 1 treatments resulted in soil NO[subscript] 3 -N and NH[subscript] 4 -N levels greater than other rates. The greatest N accumulations were measured around the injection point and in the ridge surface soil. Injected N resulted in significantly greater corn yields, percentage N derived from fertilizer, and percentage of fertilizer N recovered than broadcast, but differences between injection positions were generally not significant;A portion of the study area was used to compare the sufficiency of one- and three-row microplots for studying N uptake from in-row N applications.

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to evaluate weed management practices in 2, 4 -D resistant and dicamba resistant soybean. Dicamba resistant and 2, 4 -D resistant soybean will allow {{for the use of}} an additional herbicide site of action for control of troublesome broadleaves such as Palmer amaranth, tall waterhemp, horseweed, and giant ragweed. The longevity and utility of 2, 4 -D resistant and dicamba resistant soybean will depend on how the crops and their corresponding herbicides are managed and integrated into a weed management strategy. The movement of herbicides from the application site to sensitive vegetation as well as selection of herbicide resistant weeds from repeated herbicide use are two factors that are likely to decrease the longevity and utility of these crops. ^ Studies were conducted to investigate the influence of <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> nozzle design on the deposition, absorption, and efficacy of postemergence applied herbicides. When evaluating droplet deposition in a narrow row soybean canopy, nozzle design did not influence herbicide coverage at the ideal height of weeds. Coverage in a narrow row soybean canopy was influenced by spray volume with the 140 l ha- 1 volume resulting in greater coverage than the 94 l ha- 1 volume. Deposition of glyphosate plus 2, 4 -D or dicamba postemergence onto target weeds resulted in equivalent depositions on the leaf surfaces between two traditional flat fan nozzles and two air induction drift reduction nozzles. Herbicide efficacy was only influenced by nozzle design when applications were made to high-density stands of weeds or when the weeds exceeded the recommended heights for postemergence application. Results from these investigations showed applications of 2, 4 -D and dicamba herbicides with the required low drift nozzles can provide control of troublesome broadleaf weeds when making applications following a residual herbicide to appropriately sized weeds with spray volumes greater than 94 l ha- 1. ^ Research experiments were conducted over four growing seasons to evaluate the influence of herbicide use patterns on weed species density and diversity and herbicide resistance selection pressure. Herbicide Strategies that relied on glyphosate plus dicamba or 2, 4 -D with minimal use of residual herbicides resulted in greater weed densities and number of weed species at postemergence herbicide applications, indicating a significant increase in herbicide resistance selection pressure. The dicamba or 2, 4 -D reliant strategies also resulted in shifts towards monocot species both in field observations as well as soil seed bank evaluations with fall panicum becoming the predominate species. Integrated strategies that included soil residual herbicides reduced both dicot and monocot species abundance and a predominate weed species was not apparent after four years. ^ The ultimate longevity of the 2, 4 -D resistant and dicamba resistant soybean systems will depend on the implementation of best management practices. The use of air induction nozzles for herbicide applications in this system will reduce the potential for off-site movement thus retaining or building a positive rapport amongst the agriculture community and general public. When used appropriately the air induction nozzles provided effective delivery of the herbicide to the target weeds and thus efficacy of the herbicides were not reduced. The useful life of these technologies can be lengthened by implementing herbicide strategies that contain multiple herbicide sites of action, soil residual herbicides, and incorporate cultural weed management practices to supplement herbicides. ...|$|R

40|$|Oral {{administration}} of dicyandiamide (DCD) to grazing ruminants for excretion in urine represents an alternative delivery technique to conventional broadcast application of DCD to reduce urinary nitrogen (N) losses from grazed pastures. A field lysimeter trial and an allied plot mowing trial {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of intermixing DCD in cattle urine on soil and pasture N dynamics and leaching losses in a free-draining pumice soil. DCD was either intermixed with urine to achieve equivalent application rates of 10, 30 or 60 kg DCD haˉ¹, or surface <b>broadcasted</b> as a <b>spray</b> solution (10 or 30 kg DCD haˉ¹) onto the soil surface following urine application and compared to controls (urine and nil-controls without DCD). A single application of ¹⁵N-labelled artificial cattle urine (equivalent to 600 kg N haˉ¹) and corresponding DCD treatments were applied in late autumn and monitored over the following 300 days. DCD altered the partitioning of the applied urine-¹⁵N by increasing plant uptake of urinary-N by 32 – 60 % and decreasing urine-¹⁵N in leachate, which was primarily influenced by the amount of DCD applied. The method of DCD application had no significant effect on leaching of any N constituent, except for ammonium-N, which was higher in the intermixed relative to the spray DCD treatments (26 vs. 18 kg N haˉ¹, respectively; P < 0. 05). The total amount of nitrate-N leached was reduced from 217 kg N haˉ¹in the urine-control to 143, 80 and 61 kg N haˉ¹ (P < 0. 05) with increasing rates of DCD application of 10, 30 and 60 kg haˉ¹, respectively. Application of DCD also significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased the total amounts of ammonium-N and dissolved organic-N (DON) leached, but led to leaching losses of DCD-N. Rapid and large leaching losses of DCD down the soil profile led to spatial separation from the ammonium-N retained in the surface layer. Leaching of DCD (below 600 mm) at 55 – 69 % of that applied represented an important leachable organic-N source (equivalent to 4 – 27 kg N haˉ¹), and reduced the overall efficacy of DCD in decreasing total N leaching losses. The total N leaching losses from all measured N fractions were 332 kg N haˉ¹ in the urine-control compared to 236, 157 and 154 kg N haˉ¹ at DCD application rates of 10, 30 and 60 kg haˉ¹, respectively. This study highlights the potential benefit from delivering DCD in cattle urine to reduce urinary-N leaching losses, with the most effective targeted single application rate being 30 kg haˉ¹ under the experimental conditions of this study...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting billbug and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of cabbage moth with S. carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard <b>broadcast</b> <b>spray</b> application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of S. feltiae against cabbage root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (plant tray spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a plant tray spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. Plant tray sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of cabbage maggots around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by plant tray sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a plant tray spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a plant tray spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a follow-up application of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in outdoor vegetables, but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in outdoor vegetables. Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|R
