5|$|Playing with a {{tonsillar}} infection {{for most}} of the season, Gardiner was often slumped over his crossbar during breaks in games, nearly blacking out. After leaving for a singing lesson in June 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He went into a coma, from which he never woke. Gardiner died at age 29, on Wednesday, June 13, 1934, from a brain hemorrhage <b>brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> infection.|$|E

5|$|The {{registers}} of Crosthwaite Church {{stated that}} there were 238 interments in 1623, {{believed to have been}} something between a twelfth and a tenth of the whole population of the parish at that time.

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (though for a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth <b>brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, {{in the first two}} decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E

While aloft, Sing comes to peace with Buddha, and is able to use the Buddhist Palm method to subdue the Beast. The Beast accepts his defeat and asks Sing to be his master.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's most {{influential}} recordings date from {{his time with}} Goldkette and Whiteman, although they were generally recorded under his own name or Trumbauer's. The Whiteman period also marked a precipitous decline in Beiderbecke's health, <b>brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demand of the bandleader's relentless touring and recording schedule in combination with Beiderbecke's persistent alcoholism. A few stints in rehabilitation centers, {{as well as the}} support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family in Davenport, did not check Beiderbecke's decline in health. He left the Whiteman band in 1930 and the following summer died in his Queens apartment at the age of 28.|$|E

5|$|For {{the shot}} of the levitating truck, which {{was used in the}} film to {{demonstrate}} the strange phenomena <b>brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> coming of the alignment of the worlds, filmmakers attached a cement truck to a large hydraulic rig, which could be programmed to change speed and movement. In order to create Algrim's transformation into Kurse, Double Negative morphed live action performances of Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as both Algrim and Kurse. Double Negative then added in smoke and lava-like effects.|$|E
5|$|In {{isolated}} {{areas with}} small populations, tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties {{to contribute to}} the founder's effect as survivors repopulate their place. For example, around 1775, a typhoon hit Pingelap Atoll, and in combination with a subsequent famine, reduced the island's population to a low level. Several generations after the disaster, as many as 10% of Pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia. This is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation <b>brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> typhoon having a mutated gene, which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> Impressionism, <b>the</b> piano suite was reintroduced {{by early}} 20th-century French composers such as Ravel and Debussy.

Ravel is particularly well known for his Miroirs suite for piano and lesser known for Le tombeau de Couperin, both requiring tremendous skill and dexterity from the pianist.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Goose Creek Oil Field was {{discovered}} launching an oil boom at Galveston Bay.

5|$|The Great Depression {{presented}} a unique time for film-making in the United States. The economic disaster <b>brought</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{stock market crash}} of 1929 changed American values and beliefs in various ways.

He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought.
