5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
5|$|The third <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> {{to target}} Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American {{nematode}} Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist {{for years in}} mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn from the market in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of import and release of invertebrate <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> is not harmonized yet in Europe. Each country {{has its own}} regulatory system in place that is legally based on either the nature protection and/or the Plant Protection Act. The publication of the FAO Code of Conduct in 1996 for import and release of exotic <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> was the turning-point for the activities related to the import and release of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> in Europe. An EPPO expert panel developed from 1998 to 2002 two guidelines on the safe use of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> and established a list of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> widely used in the EPPO region. An EU funded project with the goal to develop scientific methods for evaluating environmental risks of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> introductions into Europe (ERBIC) was conducted from 1998 to 2002. In 1999, the OECD initiated a working group with the aim to develop a guidance document on appropriate {{regulation of}} invertebrate <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents.</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>control</b> industry was very concerned about these developments and proposed to the International Organization for <b>Biological</b> <b>Control</b> (IOBC/WPRS) to co-ordinate harmonization among European countries. A commission of the IOBC/WPRS {{was put in place}} in 2003 with the aim to facilitate and harmonize regulation in Europe.

5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.|$|E
5|$|More than 100 insect species prey on H. zea, usually {{feeding on}} eggs and larvae. The {{insidious}} flower bug (Orius insidiosus), a pirate bug, feeds on the eggs of H. zea, thus {{acting as a}} <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent.</b> Some plants emit a blend of chemicals in response to damage from H. zea, which attract parasitic insects. Cardiochiles nigriceps, a solitary endoparasitoid wasp, makes use of these volatile plant compounds to identify the presence of H. zea. When the wasps find damaged host plants, they hover around and then search for the host with their antennae. When the females find their prey, they use their antennae to position themselves and deposit eggs into the host. The braconid wasp Microplitis croceipes, which deposits its eggs inside a living caterpillar, {{is also an important}} parasitoid of both H. zea and the related species Heliothis virescens. When larval densities are high, a fungal pathogen, Nomuraea rileyi, can cause an outbreak of disease. However, pupal mortality is high not because of predators, but because of harsh weather conditions, collapsing pupal chambers, and disease.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native blue crab in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts.|$|E

40|$|The Golden Apple Snail (GAS) is now {{the major}} pest of the paddy {{plantation}} in Malaysia and can spread {{all over the place}} through irrigation and flood. In general, the snail was damaging to rice seedlings only during the early stages of growth. For this reasons farmers use the pesticide approach to eradicate the snails. Eventually, the usage of pesticides such as molluscicide has been restricted to minimize environmental pollution and conserve the natural enemies GAS. Therefore, as to concern over food security and sustainable environment, this study was conducted to see the <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> operation of the golden apple snail by releasing the <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents.</b> The study is conducted in an area of Rantau Panjang, Kelantan.

25|$|Of the {{diseases}} {{that have been}} identified as potential biological control agents, the fungal pathogen Myrothecium verrucaria {{has been shown to be}} very promising. Disease development is very high at around 30 to 40 degrees Celsius which matches field conditions. In addition, the fungus does not spread outside of areas where it is applied. However, one major drawback of this <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> is that it is highly toxic to mammals so extreme care would have to be taken in handling this organism.

25|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} with some clerid species. Forensic research is limited {{because of their}} late arrival on carrion, but members such as Thanasimus undatulus have been researched as a possible role in integrated pest management or IPM. Thanasimus undatulus is a predator of bark beetles. Some species of bark beetles such as the southern pine beetle and the mountain pine beetle can become pests to the lumber industry because in large numbers they can cause damage and kill live trees. Thanasimus undatulus has been researched as a possible <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> for these pests. Researchers and forestry officials have used bark beetle aggreagation pheromones to attract the checkered beetle to specific trees. This causes the bark beetles to be overwhelmed, extensively preyed upon by the clerid beetles, and typically eliminated.|$|E

500|$|The next {{detection}} was in Georgia, USA, and at {{that time}} was assumed to be N. didactylus from the West Indies. It was in fact three South American Neoscapteriscus species, N. abbreviatus, N [...] vicinus, and N. borellii, probably arrived in ship ballast. They caused major problems for decades as they spread in the southeastern USA.Scapteriscus mole cricket populations had built up since {{the early decades of the}} 20th century and damaged pastures, lawns, playing fields and vegetable crops. From the late 1940s chordane had been the insecticide of choice to control them, but when chordane was banned by the U.S. EPA in the 1970s, ranchers were left with no economic and effective control method. Especially to aid Florida ranchers, a project that became known as the UF/IFAS Mole Cricket Research Program was initiated in 1978. In 1985, a multi-authored report was published on accomplishments. In 1988, an account was published on prospects for biological control, and in 1996 an account of promising results with biological control. The program ended in 2004 after 25 years of running monitoring stations, and in 2006 a summary publication announced success: a 95% reduction in mole cricket numbers in northern Florida, with biological control agents spreading potentially to all parts of Florida. Efforts to use Larra bicolor as a <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agent</b> in Florida began by importing a stock from Puerto Rico. It became established in a small area of southeastern Florida but had little effect on Neoscapteriscus populations. A stock from Bolivia became established in northern Florida and spread widely (with some help) to most of the rest of the state and neighboring states. Its survival depends upon the availability of suitable nectar sources.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-four European rabbits were {{introduced}} to Australia in 1859 by estate owner Thomas Austin in Victoria. They soon spread throughout the country {{due to the lack}} of natural predators, widespread farming producing an ideal habitat, and mild Australian winters allowing them to breed year-round. Australia's equivalent to the rabbit, the bilby, was quickly pushed out by the rabbits. The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection. Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense [...] "rabbit-proof fence" [...] to halt the westward expansion of the introduced rabbit population. The European rabbit can not only jump very high, but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, experiments with introduction of a virus, Myxomatosis cuniiculi, provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect vectors necessary for spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits of the same species. Today's remaining wild rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis.

40|$|The {{durability}} of a control method for plant protection {{is defined as}} the persistence of its efficacy in space and time. It depends on (i) the selection pressure exerted by it on populations of plant pathogens and (ii) on the capacity of these pathogens to adapt to the control method. Erosion of effectiveness of conventional plant protection methods has been widely studied in the past. For example, apparition of resistance to chemical pesticides in plant pathogens or pests has been extensively documented. The {{durability of}} <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> has often been assumed to be higher than that of chemical control. Results concerning pest management in agricultural systems have shown that this assumption may not always be justified. Resistance of various pests to one or several toxins of Bacillus thuringensis and apparition of resistance of the codling moth Cydia pomonella to the Cydia pomonella granulovirus have, for example, been described. In contrast with the situation for pests, the durability of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> of plant diseases has hardly been studied and no scientific reports proving the loss of efficiency of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> against plant pathogens in practice has been published so far. Knowledge concerning the possible erosion of effectiveness of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> is essential to ensure a durable efficacy of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> on target plant pathogens. This knowledge will result in identifying risk factors that can foster the selection of strains of plant pathogens resistant to <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents.</b> It will also result in identifying types of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> with lower risk of efficacy loss i. e. modes of action of <b>biological</b> <b>control</b> <b>agents</b> that does not favor the selection of resistant isolates in natural populations of plant pathogens.
