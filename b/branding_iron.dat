25|$|Endowments are {{transferred}} with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast {{of a rare}} material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small <b>branding</b> <b>iron.</b> The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, {{is part of the}} duties of a special class of magician called a facilitator. When the forcible is ready, the facilitator invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. The facilitator touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert facilitator can tell whether the endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute. The forcible is expended by this process and may not be reused.|$|E

500|$|Tensions {{between the}} Earp family {{and both the}} Clanton and McLaury clans {{increased}} through 1881. On July 25, 1880, Captain Joseph H. Hurst, of Company A, 12th Infantry, and Commanding Officer of Fort Bennett, asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to help him track Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker. This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property. Hurst brought four soldiers, and Virgil invited Wyatt and Morgan Earp, as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams. The posse found the mules on the McLaury's Ranch on Babacomari Creek, northwest of Tombstone, {{as well as the}} <b>branding</b> <b>iron</b> used to change the [...] "US" [...] brand to [...] "D8".|$|E
500|$|On July 25, 1880, U.S. Army Captain Joseph H. Hurst asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp {{to assist}} him in {{tracking}} Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker. Virgil requested the assistance of his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, along with Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, and they found the mules at the McLaurys' ranch. McLaury was a Cowboy, a term which in that time and region was generally {{used to refer to}} a loose association of outlaws, some of whom also were landowners and ranchers. Legitimate cowmen were referred to as cattle herders or ranchers. They found the <b>branding</b> <b>iron</b> used to change the [...] "U.S." [...] brand to [...] "D.8."

2500|$|The {{question}} of authenticity {{is a frequent}} discussion in art markets where Native American art is the emphasis. Another connection to his family cattle ranch, Clarke created two works to discuss the topic of authenticity: To the Discriminating Collector in 2002 and Branded in 2006. Creating a <b>branding</b> <b>iron</b> that spells out [...] "INDIAN", To the Discriminating Collector sets aim at collectors that put their stamp of [...] "Indian" [...] on artworks and creators they deem worthy of the term, allowing them to brand books, clothing, films, objects, religion [...] "Indian" [...] with one stamp of the <b>branding</b> <b>iron.</b> He followed up the <b>branding</b> <b>iron</b> with using it, burning the branding into a white sheet of paper. Conceptually the work is simple yet the meaning is meant to question the lack of authenticity that Native American art collectors find in conceptual art by contemporary artists. Many of these collectors seek traditional art forms as a valid form of Native art, while contemporary artists are placed {{on the back burner}} in collections and Indian markets.|$|E

2500|$|Scouting of {{the route}} began on May 16, and Mullan lead the work crew out on July 1. The road headed north to Fort Taylor, where the Snake River was crossed with pontoon boats. One man drowned during the {{crossing}}. After crossing the Snake, the crew began leaving wooden mile markers, sometimes also inscribed with information about distance to the nearest water or other useful information. An old <b>branding</b> <b>iron</b> with the letters [...] "M" [...] and [...] "R" [...] on {{it was used to}} inscribe each marker. Mullan intended the initials to mean [...] "Military Road", but the crew began using them to mean [...] "Mullan Road". The crew also made the first longitudinal observations north of 42 degrees latitude, and made maps of the territory which remained the best for another 50 years. In mid-July, the crew reached Lake Coeur d'Alene. Mullan decided to build the road on the shortest route past the lake, which was along the southern edge. Unfortunately, this meant a rapid, [...] descent into the Valley of the St. Joe River, and then an extremely difficult passage through dense timber and heavy underbrush. Massive, fallen trees blocked the route every few feet, and boulders, some of them half-buried, had to be blasted or rolled out of the way. It took eight days just to reach the valley floor. Mullan then encountered a large swamp, which his crew bridged with a corduroy road. Reaching the [...] St. Joe River, the crew built two flat-bottomed boats to serve as a ferry, since building a bridge was not practical. The work crew reached the Coeur d'Alene Mission on August 16, having blazed [...] of road.|$|E

40|$|Freeze {{branding}} as {{a method}} of livestock identification has been received with enthusiasm. When super-cold or chilled <b>branding</b> <b>irons</b> are applied to the hide of the animal, the pigment-producing cells are destroyed or altered. When the hair grows back, it is white.

50|$|The <b>branding</b> <b>irons</b> take {{approximately}} 20-30 {{minutes to}} cool, {{and the entire}} iron must be submerged, because if the brand is not evenly cooled, then the brand itself will be uneven. Liquid nitrogen cools the iron to a temperature of −240 to −250 Celsius. Dry ice can also be used, but does not get as cold, only −160 to −180 Celsius.|$|R

60|$|The late brutal assaults. I {{strongly}} {{question the}} expediency of advocating {{the revival of}} whipping for those crimes. It is a natural and generous impulse to be indignant at the perpetration of inconceivable brutality, but I doubt the whipping panacea gravely. Not in the least regard or pity for the criminal, whom I hold in far lower estimation than a mad wolf, but in consideration for the general tone and feeling, which is very much improved since the whipping times. It is bad for a people to be familiarised with such punishments. When the whip went out of Bridewell, and ceased to be flourished at the carts tail and at the whipping-post, it began to fade out of madhouses, and workhouses, and schools and families, and to give place to a better system everywhere, than cruel driving. It would be hasty, because a few brutes may be inadequately punished, to revive, in any aspect, what, in so many aspects, society is hardly yet happily rid of. The whip is a very contagious kind of thing, and difficult to confine within one set of bounds. Utterly abolish punishment by fine - a barbarous device, quite as much out of date as wager by battle, but particularly connected in the vulgar mind with this class of offence - at least quadruple the term of imprisonment for aggravated assaults - and above all let us, in such cases, have no Pet Prisoning, vain glorifying, strong soup, and roasted meats, but hard work, and one unchanging and uncompromising dietary of bread and water, well or ill; and we shall do much better than by going down into the dark to grope for the whip among the rusty fragments of the rack, and the <b>branding</b> <b>iron,</b> and the chains and gibbet from the public roads, and the weights that pressed men {{to death in the}} cells of Newgate.|$|E

50|$|Livestock {{branding}} {{is perhaps}} the most prevalent use of a <b>branding</b> <b>iron.</b> Modern use includes gas heating, the traditional fire-heated method, an iron heated by electricity (electric cattle <b>branding</b> <b>iron)</b> or an iron super cooled by dry ice (freeze <b>branding</b> <b>iron).</b> Cattle, horses and other livestock are commonly branded today for the same reason they were in Ancient times, to prove ownership.|$|E
