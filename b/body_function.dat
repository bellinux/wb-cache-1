25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} are a normal response in individuals having chronically used benzodiazepines, and an adverse effect and result of drug tolerance. Symptoms typically emerge when dosage {{of the drug}} is reduced. GABA is the second-most-common neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (the most common being glutamate) and by far the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA. The use of benzodiazepines has a profound effect on almost every aspect of brain and <b>body</b> <b>function,</b> either directly or indirectly.|$|E
25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally {{accepted as a}} major risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal <b>body</b> <b>function.</b> Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} manual activity capacity (i. e. activity {{capacity to}} perform hand activities) {{and its relation}} with <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> of the hand and forearm in children with congenital hand differences (CHD) Methods We assessed 10 - 14 year-old children with CHD (N = 106) using a functional handgrips test. Measurements of <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> included joint mobility and muscle strength. Patient characteristics were hand dominance and severity. Results We found a stronger relation between <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> and manual activity capacity in non-dominant hands than dominant hands. Dominant hands {{scored significantly higher on}} manual activity capacity than nondominant hands that were similarly impaired at <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> level. Severity of the CHD and <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> had only small effects on manual activity capacity. Conclusion The relation between <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> and manual activity capacity is stronger in non-dominant hands than dominant hands, indicating that improvement in <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> lead to larger changes in manual activity capacity in the non-dominant hand. This may suggest that in bilaterally-affected children surgery should be done at the non-dominant hand first since this hand would benefit most from surgery-induced <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> improvement...|$|R

40|$|Background: It was {{indicated}} in many studies that verticalization have positive effects such as preventing fractures,regulating cardiopulmonary functions, increasing the head control, and the facilitation of postural muscles in pediatric patients, however, no study showing {{the effect of}} supported standing in patients with myelomeningocele on <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> and activity was encountered. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the effects of structured supported standing training in children with myelomeningocele on <b>body</b> <b>functions</b> and activity according to ICF-CY. Methods: Twenty-five children with MMC aged between 3 and 17, who were divided into two groups-SST and control. The supported standing training was given to supported standing group 2 hours a day for 8 weeks in addition to the routine physical therapy program. <b>Body</b> <b>functions</b> were assessed with the Trunk Impairment Scale, and activity levels were assessed with the Gross Motor Function Measurement- 88 and Pediatric Functional Independence Measurement at the beginning of the study, at the end of 8 weeks and at the end of 12 weeks from beginning.
