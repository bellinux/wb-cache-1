5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors.

5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice.

5|$|Hamilton {{was among}} those {{dissatisfied}} with the weak national government. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention {{in order to create}} a new constitution.

5|$|Opinions of Hamilton {{have run}} the gamut: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic. Hamilton's {{reputation}} was mostly negative in the eras of Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy. By the Progressive era, Herbert Croly, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt praised his leadership {{of a strong}} government. Several nineteenth- and twentieth-century Republicans entered politics <b>by</b> <b>writing</b> laudatory biographies of Hamilton.|$|E

Only four 19th century baseball players, including Flick, were still alive in 1970. In his later years, Flick still answered requests for autographs from his fans.

5|$|When she {{had reached}} her Clapham Junction flat, {{she began to}} write immediately. In December, Rowling's mother Anne died after ten years {{suffering}} from multiple sclerosis. Rowling was writing Harry Potter {{at the time and}} had never told her mother about it.

5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack <b>by</b> <b>writing</b> the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question <b>by</b> <b>writing</b> that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E

5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live <b>by</b> <b>writing</b> alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 <b>by</b> <b>writing</b> a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{controversially}} {{excluded from}} Italy's 2002 World Cup squad by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who believed him {{to not have}} fully recovered from the serious injury he had sustained during the season. Although he was initially keen to include Baggio in the final 23-man list, he ultimately excluded him from the squad; Baggio had made a direct appeal to him prior to the tournament <b>by</b> <b>writing</b> him a letter. Fans and pundits criticised the omission, as Italy were eliminated by co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16.|$|E
