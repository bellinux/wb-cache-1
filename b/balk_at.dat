5|$|Many rituals {{were used}} to {{identify}} a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> the grave in question. Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken {{as a sign of}} vampirism.|$|E
5|$|Princess Kassandra of Troy is the story's protagonist, {{and it is}} {{told from}} her perspective. It begins when an elderly Kassandra tiredly agrees to correct the Homeric version of the Trojan War that is told by a {{traveling}} minstrel. Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> the gender roles dictated by Trojan culture, and her inner turmoil over whether she should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

5|$|Grove took {{advantage}} of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost {{as the result of}} a <b>balk.</b> <b>At</b> the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the only one to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came up to bat. Gordon hit a double to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter. Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18). He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff. Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier.|$|E

Most cave divers in the U.S. <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> the use of any sort of floating guide line, 6mm nylon line is the norm in UK and is regularly anchored to stones, lead weights, or whatever is needed these belays are laid clear of mud and silt. In continental Europe, thinner yet slightly buoyant line is typical. Cave diving practices in some localities may be different than those {{in other parts of the}} world because those caves require specialized techniques.|$|E
25|$|Political {{complications}} {{began to}} interfere with the project. Celebrezze had not involved in the council in the negotiations, and the city council now threatened to <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> the approving the project. Celebrezze wanted to establish a group of businessmen and civic leaders to promote the bond issue to voters (who had a habit of defeating such referendums), but had to hold off until the council acted. This placed passage of the bond issue in jeopardy. Moreover, the two consultants hired earlier that summer had yet to issue their report. The city council appeared supportive of the project, but this soon changed. Councilman Russell withdrew his competing proposal for a convention center, after being convinced by other council members that competing plans would hurt the bond issue vote. But the council declined to support the group promoting the bond issue. This angered John A. Green, chairman of Ohio Bell, whom Celebrezze had asked to lead the promotional group. Green announced he would not do so unless disputes over the convention center were resolved.|$|E

He feels no pain and nothing can kill him, so {{therefore}} he's essentially a story device for action sequences." [...] James Berardinelli gave Wolverine {{two and a half}} stars out of four, calling the action scenes competently executed but not memorable, and considering that when dealing with Wolverine's past [...] "there's little creativity evident in the way those blanks are filled in", and that the revelations made Wolverine [...] "less compelling". Comparatively, Bill Gibron of AMC's Filmcritic.com website gave the film a positive [...] "4.0 out of 5 stars," [...] saying that although Hugh Jackman is [...] "capable of carrying even the most mediocre effort, he singlehandedly makes X-Men Origins: Wolverine an excellent start to the summer 2009 season." [...] He predicted [...] "there will be purists who <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> how Hood and his screenwriters mangle and manipulate the mythology;" [...] and further said that [...] "any ending which leaves several characters unexplained and unaccounted for can't really seal the full entertainment deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gardner writes [...] "I <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> the unwarranted {{assumption}} that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily {{singled out as}} intelligence while others cannot." [...] Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as [...] "intelligence". Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's addition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligences are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply {{a recognition of the}} broad scope of inherent mental abilities, and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an IQ value.|$|E
2500|$|In the Malleus demons are {{the ones}} who tempt humans to sorcery and are the main figures in the witches' vows. They {{interact}} with witches, usually sexually. The book claims that it is normal for all witches [...] "to perform filthy carnal acts with demons." [...] This is a major part of human-demon interaction and demons do it [...] "not for the sake of pleasure, but for the sake of corrupting." [...] It is worth noting that not all demons do such things. The book claims that [...] "the nobility of their nature causes certain demons to <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> committing certain actions and filthy deeds." [...] Though the work never gives a list of names or types of demons, like some demonological texts or spellbooks of the era, such as the Liber Juratus, it does indicate different types of demons. For example, it devotes large sections to incubi and succubi and questions regarding their roles in pregnancies, the submission of witches to incubi, and protections against them.|$|E

CBS also offers its own online broadcast of the show and www.CBS.com/daytime/ATWT."

2500|$|The Sunday Times of London {{reported}} in February 2007 that the IRB was brokering {{a deal with}} SANZAR, the body that organises the Tri Nations, to admit Los Pumas to the competition as early as 2008. The story noted that logistical issues, specifically the distance between Argentina and Europe plus fixture congestion in Northern Hemisphere rugby, caused the Six Nations to <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> admitting Argentina. The IRB was apparently convinced that the Tri Nations was the proper place for a Southern Hemisphere team, and reportedly found South Africa strongly supporting the move and Australia not opposed. The Sunday Times indicated that the biggest stumbling block could be the UAR itself, [...] "some of whose members are deeply attached to amateurism." [...] Eventually, the IRB admitted its attempt to get the Pumas into a major competition would be unsuccessful until at least 2010, when the key media contract between SANZAR and News Corporation expires. An IRB spokesman cited fixture congestion in the Southern Hemisphere {{and the lack of}} a professional structure in Argentina as additional reasons for the demise of a potential deal.|$|E
2500|$|Matsu {{was born}} in Glasgow, Scotland in 1904. [...] His father was Japanese, {{and his mother was}} Scottish. [...] He moved with his family to Canada as a young child and then to Cleveland, Ohio. By age 13, Matsu had shown himself to be an {{exceptional}} athlete and was being compared to Jim Thorpe. Sportswriter Paul Purman wrote a nationally syndicated story about Matsu in July 1917. Purman wrote that Matsu played first base on an undefeated baseball team, played halfback for a high school football team, played forward on an amateur basketball team, set the Cleveland junior records in the 50, 75 and 100-yard dashes, pole-vaulted 7 feet, 4inches, was a champion swimmer at the Cleveland Y.M.C.A, played [...] "a fair game of tennis," [...] and caddied at a golf course. Purman concluded: [...] "Even Jim Thorpe and Howard Berry, all around athletes de luxe, will have to doff their chapeaux to this Japanese youth who claims Cleveland as his home and who doesn't <b>balk</b> <b>at</b> anything in the athletic line except auto racing and poker." ...|$|E
