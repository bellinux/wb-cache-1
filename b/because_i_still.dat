In 1999, when Betty was celebrating 30 years on-screen, Alison Boshoff of the Daily Mail praised the character's never changing style: [...] "for 30 years, one favourite fixture of Coronation Street has remained exactly the same [...] barmaid Betty Turpin. With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> enjoy it so much and am always looking forward rather than back. Really, it has been a wonderful experience and I feel very glad I was able to stick around for so long." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after O'Neill's death, {{his widow}} Carlotta Monterey demanded that Random House {{contravene}} O'Neill's explicit wishes and publish the play at once. [...] "We refused, of course," [...] wrote publisher Bennett Cerf in his memoirs, [...] "but then were horrified {{to learn that}} legally all the cards were in her hand. … I do not regret that we took the stand we did, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> think we were right." [...] Monterey had the play published by the Yale University Press in 1956, with {{the bulk of the}} proceeds deeded to Yale's Eugene O'Neill Collection and for scholarships at its drama school.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{told the}} Irish Ambassador to London in 1946, [...] "I {{said a few}} words in {{parliament}} the other day about your country <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> hope for a united Ireland. You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country." [...] He later said [...] "You know I have had many invitations to visit Ulster but I have refused them all. I don't {{want to go there}} at all, I would much rather go to southern Ireland. Maybe I'll buy another horse with an entry in the Irish Derby." ...|$|E

Dancer insisted on throwing the full distance from the pitcher's mound to the plate. I don't want none of the 10 ft stuff, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can <b>still</b> throw it far, she joked. After that she received chemotherapy treatment.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Father Brown simply, {{and stood}} up also, [...] "you won't take it by force. First, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> really haven't <b>still</b> got it. And, second, {{because we are not}} alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|On July 19, 2013, in Riverside Superior Court, Miller {{was sentenced}} to death. On August 16, 2013 Cox and John were sentenced. Cox {{was sentenced to}} two life terms without parole. Cox showed no remorse stating, [...] "I {{apologize}} {{for what happened to}} the victims' family. I didn't say I'm sorry I did anything <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> don't feel that I did anything to be here for it." [...] He also said he would appeal. John, the gunman, was given the death penalty. Judge Christian Theirbach called the murders savage, and the most inhuman he had seen in his 27 years on the bench.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1985 interview, {{when asked}} what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, [...] "Two things, really. One was the {{completely}} negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn't give UFOs the chance of existing, {{even if they were}} flying {{up and down the street}} in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> thought they weren't going about it in the right way. You can't assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was something to all this." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the race}} for the seat on the SBOE, the nonprofit {{watchdog}} group Texas Freedom Network (TFN), which first brought Bruner's posts to public attention, warned that the SBOE has a history of mixing culture wars with public education and criticized many of Bruner's public statements immediately prior to her primary election. While some of Bruner's posts were later deleted, TFN and journalists of numerous Texas and national publications made screen shots of the posts and began reporting on them, questioning her fitness to hold public office. When asked about her public statements, Bruner defended them, saying [...] "I don't intend to apologize for my opinions <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> believe my statements were accurate." [...] After Bruner's defeat, TPN president Kathy Miller issued a statement saying: [...] "Texas escaped an education train wreck tonight. If Bruner had ultimately won election to the board, she would have instantly become the most embarrassingly uninformed and divisive member on a board that already too often puts politics ahead of making sure our kids get a sound education." ...|$|E

I've often gone without little things <b>I</b> wanted, simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hated to make Sarah bring them, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hated <b>still</b> worse to go after them, knowing we were both weakly and tired. Now I deny myself nothing. I make Lemuel fetch and carry without remorse, from morning till night. I never knew it before, but the man-body seems never to be tired, or ill, or sleepy." ...|$|R

6000|$|Barrington's {{face grew}} a trifle stern. [...] "There {{are times when}} you tax our patience, Lance," [...] he said. [...] "Still, {{there is nothing to}} be gained by {{questioning}} your assertion. What I fail to see is where your reward for all this will come from, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>still</b> convinced that the soil will, so to speak, give you back eighty cents for every dollar you put into it. I would, however, like to look at those implements. I have never seen better ones." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, {{between the}} {{writing and the}} typewriting I was well a-weary. I had brain and nerve fag, and body fag as well, and yet the thought of drink never {{suggested}} itself. I was living too high to stand in need of an anodyne. All my waking hours, except those with that infernal typewriter, were spent in a creative heaven. And along with this I had no desire for drink <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> believed in many things--in the love of all {{men and women in}} the matter of man and woman love; in fatherhood; in human justice; in art--in the whole host of fond illusions that keep the world turning around.|$|E
60|$|On the 23d of October I {{learned of}} Pemberton's being in command at Holly Springs and much {{reinforced}} by conscripts and troops from Alabama and Texas. The same day General Rosecrans was relieved from duty with my command, {{and shortly after}} he succeeded Buell in the command of the army in Middle Tennessee. I was delighted at the promotion of General Rosecrans to a separate command, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> believed that when independent of an immediate superior the qualities which I, at that time, credited him with possessing, would show themselves. As a subordinate I found that I could not make him do as I wished, and had determined to relieve him from duty that very day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it seems}} to me," [...] he said, [...] "that I am only wasting my time by trying to make you see reason and common-sense. You look upon me as a brute. Well! perhaps I am. At any rate I am that which your father and you have made me. Four years ago, when you had power over me and over mine, you brutalised us. To-day we--the people--are your masters and we make you suffer, not for all--that were impossible--but for {{part of what you}} made us suffer. That, after all, is only bare justice. By making you my wife I would have saved you from death--not from humiliation, for that you must endure, and at my hands in a full measure--but I would have made you my wife <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> have {{pleasant}} recollections of that kiss which I snatched from you on that never-to-be-forgotten night and in the darkness--a kiss for which you would gladly have seen me hang then, if you could have laid hands on me." ...|$|E
5000|$|A rival {{group of}} {{officials}} within the FBF elected Victorien Attolou their new president in February 2011. Attolou {{was elected by}} a group that claimed president Moucharafou Anjorin {{was no longer in}} charge. Twelve of the fifteen member executive committee resigned after accusing Moucharafou of being a dictator. The election was held following the failure by FIFA to resolve the initial dispute between Moucharafou and the officials. Moucharafou stated that [...] "I am unconcerned about the elections held over the weekend <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>still</b> {{the man in charge of}} the federation".|$|R
40|$|When we {{are selling}} something, we {{evaluate}} market prices by comparing them to some reference price {{that we have}} in mind. This comparison gives us an idea of whether a certain price is “good” or “bad”. For example, if I am a corn producer and had a chance to sell corn for $ 4. 20 /bu a few months ago and now I can sell it only for $ 3. 50 /bu, it might feel like the current price is “bad” <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am comparing it with a higher price that would have allowed me to make more money. On the other hand, if my break-even price is $ 3. 40 /bu, then it might feel like the current price is “good” <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can <b>still</b> make a profit by selling above my break-even level...|$|R
50|$|I {{discovered}} the track by chance, during the Olympic Games in Rome in 1960. I saw Gaiardoni win. I {{said to myself}} 'I like that.' My first race on the track was the Rustine kilometre in Paris, in 1962. That was on the Cipale track. I'd never ridden on a track. It was Toto Gérardin who taught me, over a week. I finished second behind Pierre Trentin I remember that I rode all the sprints {{out of the saddle}} in the straight. And I fell off. I'd forgotten that you can't freewheel with a fixed gear. I rode the track again the following year and I was contacted for a tournament between France and Germany... in the team pursuit. That wasn't surprising <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was <b>still</b> considered a roadman at that time.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}}, she said, {{the evening of}} my visit to the Heights, I knew, as well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I shunned going out, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> carried his letter in my pocket, and didn't want to be {{threatened}} or teased any more. I had {{made up my mind}} not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how its receipt would affect Catherine. The consequence was, that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days. The fourth was Sunday, and I brought it into her room after the family were gone to church. There was a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open, and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he must run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow. He departed, and I went up-stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "He put me off my guard--I can't call it {{anything}} else. I know I {{gave him}} a great chance--I encouraged him, urged him, tempted him. But when once he had spoken, he should have stood to it. He should n't have had two opinions--one for me, and one for himself! He put me off my guard. It was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> resisted him that I went to you again, that last time. But I was still afraid of you, and in my heart I believed him. As I say, I always believed him; it was his great influence upon me. He is the cleverest, the most intelligent, the most brilliant of men. I don't think that a grain less than I ever thought it," [...] he continued, turning again to Bernard. [...] "I think it only the more, and I don't wonder that you find a woman to believe it. But {{what have you done}} but deceive me? It was just my belief in your intelligence that reassured me. When Miss Vivian refused me a second time, and I left Baden, it was at first with a sort of relief. But there came back a better feeling--a feeling faint compared to this feeling of to-day, but strong enough to make me uneasy and to fill me with regret. To quench my regret, I kept thinking of what you had said, and it kept me quiet. Your word had such weight with me!" ...|$|E
60|$|South Carolina and the Southern States {{no doubt}} {{felt that they}} would not succeed in obtaining secession in this way, and {{therefore}} they sought to obtain the separation which they wanted by revolution--by revolution and rebellion, as Naples has lately succeeded in her attempt to change her political status; as Hungary is looking to do; as Poland has been seeking to do any time since her subjection; as the revolted colonies of Great Britain succeeded in doing in 1776, whereby they created this great nation which is now undergoing all the sorrows of a civil war. The name of secession claimed by the South for this movement is a misnomer. If any part of a nationality or empire ever rebelled against the government established on behalf of the whole, South Carolina so rebelled when, on the 20th of November, 1860, she put forth her ordinance of so-called secession; and the other Southern States joined in that rebellion when they followed her lead. As to that fact, there cannot, I think, much longer be any doubt in any mind. I insist on this especially, repeating perhaps unnecessarily opinions expressed in my first volume, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>still</b> see it stated by English writers that the secession ordinance of South Carolina should have been accepted as a political act by the Government of the United States. It seems to me that no government can in this way accept an act of rebellion without declaring its own functions to be beyond its own power.|$|E

"Well, then, {{can you not}} see how {{pleasant}} it was to me to {{find someone}} who would give me a peep into the unseen world, without requiring as an entrance-fee any religious emotions and experiences? Here I had been for years, shut out; told that I had no business with anything eternal, and pure, and noble, and good; that to all intents and purposes I was nothing better than a very cunning animal who could be damned; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was <b>still</b> 'carnal,' and had not been through all Jane's mysterious sorrows and joys.

"I am not as {{skillful}} {{as everyone}} thinks I am; I understand {{that people are}} excited for me and what I can do which is good, as it proves that I am {{on the right path}} and that my hard work is paying off. However, I am really just 'normal' and not a 'star', yet. People are often asking me when 'I will go to Barcelona' and it makes me feel uncomfortable <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am <b>still</b> young and learning. But the rumors that run around often make me feel as if my head will explode. It puts stress on my mind when I am trying to focus on River Plate and possibly get the chance to represent Colombia. It's a dream of mine to play for Colombia during a World Cup, but I cannot make it if I don't continue working hard." ...|$|R
40|$|Baldessari {{started to}} produce collages out of {{black-and-white}} movie stills in 1976. Even if {{his work is}} decidedly anti-dogmatic, over time the production of these images seems to follow a recurring pattern. The process is simple: The artist goes to a shop and buys second- rate movie stills, files them away using a provisional classification system, then selects some and cuts parts of them, sometimes add- ing touches of colour to certain areas, sometimes adding coloured dots and sometimes combining various images together. Baldessari selects the most generic images, the ones with no identity – the “stuff nobody wants”: At one place I go to for movie <b>stills,</b> <b>I</b> look where the photographs are randomly thrown in boxes. It’s stuff nobody wants. Photographs they can classify or identify go upward in price... The stuff I get is twenty-five cents a shot. But <b>I</b> like that <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don’t want <b>stills</b> from movies that I’ve seen or when I’m familiar with the stars. It has to be really obscure <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don’t want any baggage to come with it...|$|R
