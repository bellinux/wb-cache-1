5|$|After a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> with genetically {{modified}} food, Marge decides to plant her own garden. Crows {{arrive on the}} new garden, so Marge makes a scarecrow, which scares Homer. Homer destroys the scarecrow, and the crows see Homer as their leader, following him everywhere and doing his bidding. But when the crows try to carry Maggie, Homer turns on them and they attack his eyes. He is prescribed medicinal marijuana.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E

40|$|The Rachels–Temkin {{spectrum}} {{arguments against}} the transitivity of better than involve good or <b>bad</b> <b>experiences,</b> lives, or outcomes that vary along multiple dimensions—e. g., duration {{and intensity of}} pleasure or pain. This paper presents variations on these arguments involving combinations of good and <b>bad</b> <b>experiences,</b> which have even more radical implications than the violation of transitivity. These variations force opponents of transitivity to conclude that something good is worse than something that isn’t good, on pain of rejecting the good altogether. That is impossible, so we must reject the spectrum arguments...|$|R

25|$|On January 17, {{a federal}} judge ruled that the casino at-large caucus plan could go ahead. This {{was seen as a}} win for Obama because of the Culinary Workers Union endorsement. To further complicate matters, the major news and polling {{organizations}} decided to refrain from polling before the Nevada caucuses, fearing the newness of the caucus, the transient nature of Nevada's population, and more fallout from their <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> in New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Because Rand had a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> {{with the}} Broadway {{production}} of Night of January 16th due to numerous script changes {{mandated by the}} producer, she insisted on having final approval of any revisions. The production was quickly troubled as Abbott requested many changes that Rand refused. To facilitate rewrites, Abbott asked experienced playwright S. N. Behrman to work with Rand as a script doctor. Abbott also decided to replace actor John Davis Lodge, who was hired to play Andrei.|$|E
25|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{typified by}} a {{situation}} where a harmless species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at a common predator. The harmful species (the model) might have spines, stingers, or toxic chemistry, while its apparent double has no defence other than resembling the unpalatable species. Protection of the mimic from predators is afforded by its resemblance to the unpalatable species, which the predator associates with a certain appearance and a <b>bad</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

25|$|Told {{of a good}} {{horse for}} sale in Australia called Merman, she {{purchased}} it and had it shipped to England; such shipments were risky {{and she had a}} previous <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> with a horse arriving injured (Maluma). Merman was {{regarded as one of the}} best “stayers”; he eventually went on to win the Lewes Handicap, the Cesarewitch, Jockey Club Cup, Goodwood Stakes, Goodwood Cup, and Ascot Gold Cup (with Tod Sloan up). Langtry later had a second Cesarewitch winner with Yentoi, and a third place with Raytoi. An imported horse from New Zealand called Uniform, won the Lewes Handicap for her.|$|E
25|$|The {{censorship}} in Hamburg {{was relatively}} lax but Campe {{had to worry}} about Prussia, the largest German state which had the largest market for books (it was estimated that one-third of the German readership was Prussian). Initially, any book which had passed the censor in a German state was able to be sold in any of the other states but in 1834 this loophole was closed. Campe was reluctant to publish uncensored books as he had <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> of print runs being confiscated. Heine resisted all censorship. So this issue became a bone of contention between the two.|$|E
25|$|M. R. D. Foot, {{intelligence}} {{officer for the}} SAS brigade, was ordered to arrange the special forces contingent. He first approached the head of 1st SAS Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Paddy Mayne, who refused {{to take part in}} an intelligence operation, having had a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> implementing deception plans whilst in north Africa. However, Lieutenant Colonel Brian Franks of the 2nd SAS Regiment was convinced {{to take part in the}} operation. 2nd SAS provided twelve men under the command of Captain Frederick James Fowles(Chick) and Lieutenant Norman Harry Poole. After landing these teams were to locate and open fire on the German forces, allowing some to escape in the hope they would report the parachute drops.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{match the}} new German speedsters, White Star decided {{to drop out}} of the {{competition}} and commission the four large Celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra day at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> with the Deutschland, Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the Celtic. However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse.|$|E
25|$|Wilco {{was signed}} to Reprise Records (Warner) and began {{recording}} AM {{almost as soon}} as the band was formed. After recording, Tweedy was introduced to Jay Bennett, who then joined the band. Also during this time, Tweedy quit smoking marijuana after a particularly <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> with some cannabis brownies. A.M. did not fare as well commercially in comparison to Son Volt's first album, only reaching number 27 on the Heatseekers chart while Son Volt's debut Trace hit the Billboard 200. Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum invited Tweedy to join him in a supergroup named Golden Smog with Gary Louris and Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run, and Noah Levy of The Honeydogs. Under the pseudonym Scott Summit, Tweedy released Down by the Old Mainstream with Golden Smog in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{first thing}} many people notice when {{entering}} {{the gates of}} Oakland is the mausoleum of Jasper Newton Smith, on which sits a striking life-size statue of Smith himself. Jasper Smith was a real estate investor who financed two buildings downtown. One, known as The House that Jack Built, was constructed with the stipulation that its cornerstone be left even after the building was torn down. That cornerstone still stands {{at the entrance of}} the Peachtree Center MARTA station on Carnegie Way. Smith was well known for refusing to wear a necktie due to a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> as a child. Therefore, one story describing the creation of his statue notes that when the artist sculpted him wearing a cravat, Smith refused to pay until the offending item had been chiseled off.|$|E

25|$|There was {{advanced}} co-ordination between infantry, {{artillery and}} armour, and the latest, highly manoeuvrable Mark V tank was used {{after it had}} been demonstrated to Monash and Rawlinson. Five companies (60 combat and four supply tanks) of the British 5th Tank Brigade were provided for the assault. Although the Australians had worked with {{a small number of}} tanks successfully at Villers-Bretonneux, their opinion of the technology was clouded by the <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> they had had of them in April and May 1917 around Bullecourt. As such, to ensure co-ordination and overcome the problems the Australians had experienced at Bullecourt, the Australian infantry and tanks trained and lived together prior to the battle. Coloured diagrams were painted {{on the sides of the}} tanks, corresponding to the battalions that they would support, so that the infantry knew which tank to follow.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{footage and}} the film's soundtrack were off-limits, the {{designers}} {{were allowed to}} re-create the likenesses of the actors who {{had appeared in the}} film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn't surprise them, as Ford had had a negative experience working on the film and, at the time, even refused to talk about it in interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film's director, as he too had had a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> on the film, and had fallen out with Yorkin and Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game.|$|E
500|$|Yelp {{added the}} ability for {{business}} owners to respond to reviews in 2008. Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a <b>bad</b> <b>experience</b> have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations. The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs. A business owner can [...] "claim" [...] a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports. Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the [...] "check in" [...] feature. In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device. Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.|$|E
