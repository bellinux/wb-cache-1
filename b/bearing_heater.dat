50|$|Due to {{the need}} to insert a core and also that to be effective, the core has to be in {{relatively}} close proximity to the bore of the part to be heated, there are many application in which the above <b>bearing</b> <b>heater</b> type approach is not feasible.|$|E
50|$|Often {{referred}} to as a <b>bearing</b> <b>heater,</b> the mains frequency unit employs standard transformer principles for its operation. An internal winding is wound around a laminated core similar to a standard mains transformer. The core is then passed through the work-piece and when the primary coil is energised, a magnetic flux is created around the core. The work-piece acts as a short circuit secondary of the transformer created, and due to the laws of induction, a current flows in the work-piece and heat is generated. The core is normally hinged or clamped in some way to allow loading or unloading, which is usually a manual operation. To cover variations in part diameter, the majority of units will have spare cores available which help to optimise performance. Once the part is heated to the correct temperature, assembly can take place either by hand or in the relevant jig or machine press.|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} baseline {{design for}} the Space Infrared Telescope Facility includes a Tertiary Mirror Assembly (TMA) which selectively redirects the telescope's converging science beam to each of several instruments. The TMA's mirror rotates on an axis coincident with the beam's axis, and is held steady during observation by a kinematic mount. A bearing has been designed whose compliance causes minimal interference with the precision of the kinematic mount, and which is well suited to the particular requirements of a cryogenic satellite such as SIRTF. The bearing suspends its rotor {{by taking advantage of}} the repulsion between a superconductor and a magnet. It potentially eliminates problems associated with mechanical bearings that arise in similar applications, such as lubricant loss or failure, bearing wear, and sensitivity to particulates, and does so without imposing the thermal load of a <b>bearing</b> <b>heater</b> or active magnetic bearing. The bearing shows promise of offering an alternative to ball bearings in cryogenic applications where some compliance is acceptable or advantageous...|$|E
40|$|As {{a recent}} {{development}} to further reduce the flying {{height of a}} magnetic head in hard disk drives (HDDs) to nanometers, thermal flying-height (TFC) control technology is now widely applied in the HDD industry because it enables consistent read/write spacing, increased storage density and improved HDD reliability. The fast development of TFC technology presents new challenges to head designers because of the complicated structure of a TFC head, the thermo-mechanical-coupling effects and tribology issues arising at nanometer read/write spacing. A steady-state TFC solver dedicated to obtaining the steady-state flying attitude of a TFC slider is developed in this thesis. This solver uses a finite volume based solver (CML static solver) to solve the generalized Reynolds equation and obtain the pressure and spacing fields in the air bearing and a commercial coupled-field solver (ANSYS) to obtain the stress and strain fields due to internal heating. An iterative procedure is adopted to consider the cooling effect of the air bearing on the heater-induced protrusion. Accuracy of the solver is verified by drive-level magnetic tests on several combinations of air <b>bearing</b> and <b>heater</b> designs. TFC sliders' performances under different ambient conditions are investigated based on the TFC solver. It is found that the thermal actuation efficiency of a TFC slider increases with altitude because of the weakened cooling and reduced air bearing stiffness at the transducer area at a higher altitude. In addition, a TFC slider maintains a more consistent read/write spacing at different humidity levels, compared with a non-TFC slider, because the thermal actuation is able to compensate part of the pressure loss caused by water condensation. A TFC slider's flying height in air-helium mixtures is {{shown to be a}} highly nonlinear function of the fraction of helium in the gas mixture due to the combined effects of the gas mean free path, viscosity and heat conductivity. These results provide general guidelines for heater and ABS designers to reduce a TFC slider's sensitivity to ambient conditions and improve HDD reliability. A touchdown numerical model for predicting TFC sliders' dynamics at touchdown and over-pushed conditions is developed and implemented based on the CML dynamic simulator. It extends the solution of the time-varying generalized Reynolds equation to near-contact and contact conditions using a statistical multi-asperity approach. Various interfacial forces are considered by use and further development of a sub-boundary lubrication model to capture important tribological effects occurring at touchdown. This model is able to predict a TFC slider's unstable dynamics at the beginning of touchdown, which has been discovered in many related experimental studies. The effects of different head-disk interface factors are investigated using this numerical model. It is found that the suspension is actively involved in the TFC slider's bouncing vibrations and has a significant influence on the excited second air bearing pitch mode. It is also shown that adhesion force serves as an essential factor in exciting the second air bearing mode whereas other interfacial forces only affect details of the slider's bouncing behaviors. By changing the interfacial properties, namely, the interface roughness and lubricant thickness, the variation of interfacial forces with spacing reduction differs, which leads to very different touchdown patterns. With a rougher interface profile the slider smoothly transfers from a flying stage to a sliding stage. With a smoother interface profile the slider experiences a flying-bouncing-sliding transition. With the smoothest interface the slider goes through a flying-bouncing-surfing-sliding transition. The touchdown behaviors predicted by the numerical simulator are correlated with experiments conducted on industry-provided head parts with the same ABS and suspension design. Similar touchdown stages and excited modes are also discovered in the experiments. Though experiments showed a slider spectrum with richer frequency components, the modes missed from the numerical simulations are recovered by conducting a harmonic analysis on a full HGA model with air bearing included. The different touchdown dynamic patterns predicted here result in significant differences in the successful touchdown detection, which is very important for realizing reliable read/write operations, and therefore this work provides guidelines for head disk interface (HDI) optimization. The general approach proposed here is also applicable to studies on the effects of other important HDI factors, such as air bearing geometric features, heater-induced protrusion profiles, and suspension design parameters, and on the slider's touchdown dynamics behaviors, which will assist in obtaining solutions to performance and reliability issues in current hard disk drives...|$|R
