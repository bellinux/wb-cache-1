40|$|Abstract. —As larger, {{more complex}} data sets {{are being used}} to infer phylogenies, {{accuracy}} of these phylogenies increasingly requires models of evolution that accommodate heterogeneity in the processes of molecular evolution. We investigated the effect of improper data partitioning on phylogenetic accuracy, as well as the type I error rate and sensitivity of <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors,</b> a commonly used method for choosing among different partitioning strategies in Bayesian analyses. We also used <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors</b> to test empirical data for the need to divide data in a manner that has no expected biological meaning. Posterior probability estimates are misleading when an incorrect partitioning strategy is assumed. The error was greatest when the assumed model was underpartitioned. These results suggest that model partitioning is important for large data sets. <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors</b> performed well, giving a 5 % type I error rate, which is remarkably consistent with standard frequentist hypothesis tests. The sensitivity of <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors</b> was found to be quite high when the across-class model heterogeneity reflected that of empirical data. These results suggest that <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors</b> represent a robust method of choosing among partitioning strategies. Lastly, results of tests for the inclusion of unexpected divisions in empirical data mirrored the simulation results, although the outcome of such tests is highly dependent on accounting for rate variation among classes.

As the deletion of a tumor suppressor gene can lead to tumor development, one objective of these studies is to determine which, if any, chromosome arms harbor tumor suppressor genes. Results: We propose a large class of mixture models for describing the data, and we suggest using <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors</b> to select a reasonable model from the class in order to classify the chromosome arms. <b>Bayes</b> <b>factors</b> are especially useful {{in the case of}} testing that the number of components in a mixture model is n 0 versus n 1.
