5|$|The first {{recorded}} spaniel in Russia {{was a black}} Cocker Spaniel owned by hunting enthusiast Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. Because of its noble connections, spaniels of various breeds were imported to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Some were used for hunting, but the smaller spaniels were not of much use in Russian <b>bird</b> <b>hunting</b> due to the weather and terrain conditions. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that selective breeding began for longer legged spaniels; specifically importing Springer Spaniels to create a rather mixed Russian Spaniel.|$|E

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{evaluation}} of hunters experience in the usage of steel and lead pellets in game <b>birds</b> <b>hunting.</b> An {{essential part of the}} work deals with the characteristics of lead as a harmful element and its impact upon the environment, which results in compulsory use of steel pellets. Some other types of pellets made from alternative materials are suggested and characterized here as well. In addition, it elaborates the workload of guns when using steel pellets. The work also includes comparisons between steel and lead shots and presents the experience in their use in both game <b>birds</b> <b>hunting</b> and sports shooting...|$|R

Chickens account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common. Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. <b>Bird</b> <b>hunting</b> is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock. Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand. Though some hunting, {{such as that of}} muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species.|$|E

2500|$|Leavitt's stature as {{a writer}} on some of Maine's {{favorite}} topics, and his weekly television presence {{made him one of}} the state's celebrities [...] in the days when the words 'Maine' and 'celebrity' were oxymorons. Once, on a <b>bird</b> <b>hunting</b> drive in northern Maine with his friends Curt Gowdy and Brooks Robinson, Leavitt got lost. He stopped at a local home where he saw several men talking in the driveway. After inquiring after directions, Leavitt gestured at his car.

2500|$|Although the Rhodesian ridgeback's <b>bird</b> <b>hunting</b> prowess {{has been}} well known {{throughout}} the breed's history (the original description from the South African parent club belabors this point in fact), {{it is important to}} note that the [...] "gundog" [...] classification made in 1920s Southern Rhodesia and South Africa was not specifically about <b>bird</b> <b>hunting.</b> To understand this it is necessary to understand the union's classification system at that time. The two likely categories Barnes could have chosen from within the SAKU classification system at that time were, [...] "sporting" [...] and [...] "gundog". In the [...] "sporting" [...] group were the sighthounds and scenthounds. In the [...] "gundog" [...] group were the birddogs. This raises the question why Barnes rejected the group containing the sighthounds and scenthounds, and successfully lobbied in favor of the group containing the birddogs. Barnes' reasoning becomes clear with an understanding of the distinction between the two groups. The union's [...] "sporting" [...] dogs were those that would find game above ground, and were then expected to dispatch the game without assistance. The union's [...] "gundogs" [...] were those that find game above ground, and the human hunter was then expected to dispatch the game by means of a firearm. Within this context, the Rhodesian ridgebackwhich was clearly expected to hold the lion at bay for the hunter, not to attempt to dispatch the lion unassisted by the gunplacement in the union’s gundog group becomes the logical choice within that system as it existed at that time.|$|E

There is a spring hunting season for black bear and in most years, limited hunting of bison that leave Yellowstone National Park is allowed.

2500|$|Skeet {{shooting}} is an Olympic sport where participants {{attempt to break}} clay disks flung into the air at high speed {{from a variety of}} angles. The firearm of choice for this task is usually a high quality, double-barreled over and under shotgun with 28/30inch barrels and open chokes. The event is in part meant to simulate the action of <b>bird</b> <b>hunting.</b> The shooter shoots from eight positions on a semicircle with a radius of , and an 8th position halfway between stations 1 and 7. There are two houses that hold devices known as [...] "traps" [...] that launch the targets, one at each corner of the semicircle.

In 1935, the Roosevelt administration began to consider whether a [...] "Fort Peck Migratory Bird Refuge" [...] should be established around the soon-to-be-filled Fort Peck Reservoir. Noted wildlife biologist Olaus Murie was sent to the area to document the soils, topography, vegetation, and wildlife in the area.
