5|$|There are six {{business}} {{routes of}} US Highway131 {{in the state}} of Michigan, and previously there was one <b>bypass</b> <b>route.</b> All of the business routes are former sections of US Highway 131 (US131). These former sections of the mainline highway, along with the necessary connecting roads, allow traffic to access the downtowns business districts of cities bypassed by sections of US131 built since the 1950s. The extant business loops connect to Constantine, Three Rivers, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Big Rapids, Cadillac, and Manton. The former <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> in Grand Rapids allowed traffic to bypass that city's downtown at a time when US131 still ran through the heart of the city.|$|E
5|$|Bypass US Highway131 (Byp. US131) was a <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> around {{downtown}} Grand Rapids. The highway followed 28th Street eastward {{from the}} intersection with US131 (Division Street) south of downtown. From this starting point eastward, it ran concurrently with Byp. US16 and Byp M-21. M-37 also followed 28th Street {{at the time}} eastward from the intersection at Kalamazoo Avenue. At the intersection with East Beltline and Broadmoor avenues in Paris Township (now Kentwood), Byp.US16/Byp. US131/Byp.M-21 turned northward to follow East Beltline, and M-37 turned southward on Broadmoor. The <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> continued northward through Grand Rapids Township. At the intersection with US16/M-50 (Cascade Road), Byp. US16 ended, and Byp. M-21 ended {{less than half a}} mile (0.4km) north of that at the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street). North of the intersection with Fulton Street, Byp. US131 was the only designation along East Beltline Avenue at the time. The highway ran northward into Plainfield Township, and it terminated at an intersection with US131 at Plainfield Avenue and Northland Drive just south of the Grand River.|$|E
5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass. The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the <b>bypass</b> <b>route.</b> The planned <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass, in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said the bypass would promote suburban sprawl. The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E
40|$|Solving of {{the problem}} of quality {{characteristics}} providing QoS in MPLS-TE network with <b>bypass</b> <b>routes</b> oftraffic transmission is proposed. By the nodal tensor method the value of packet delay along a traffic transmission route for the network with <b>bypass</b> <b>routes</b> of traffic transmission and without them is received and the results comparison of traffic balancing is conducted.

50|$|In 1957 or 1958, two <b>bypass</b> <b>routes</b> {{were built}} along SC 28: Seneca and Abbeville; old routes through both cities became SC 28 Business. In 1959, SC 28 was {{straighten}} out east of Seneca, avoiding Newry. In the early 1960s, two more <b>bypass</b> <b>routes</b> were built along SC 28: Anderson, South Carolina and Pendleton; also, SC 28 was rerouted {{north and east}} around Clemson, leaving SC 93.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, M-21 was rerouted {{to replace}} its <b>bypass</b> <b>route.</b> The former route through {{downtown}} Grand Rapids was redesignated as Bus. M-21. At the time, Bus. M-21 continued eastward along Franklin Street before turning northward on Eastern Avenue into downtown Grand Rapids. Once there, it followed Fulton Street eastward through East Grand Rapids and into Grand Rapids Township where it terminated at East Beltline Avenue. The business loop was truncated to US131 in 1972, and then redesignated as BS I-196 in 1974.|$|E
5|$|The St. Joseph Valley Parkway is {{a freeway}} in the U.S. states of Indiana and Michigan, {{serving as a}} <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> around Elkhart, Mishawaka, and South Bend in Indiana and Niles in Michigan. The freeway runs {{to the south and}} west of Elkhart and South Bend and Niles and {{consists}} of segments of U.S. Route 31 (US31) and US20; those two highway designations run concurrently at the southwestern rim of the South Bend metropolitan area. It continues north to run along the St. Joseph River valley.|$|E
5|$|Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) was a <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> of M-21 in Kent County. It {{started at}} the {{intersection}} between M-21 (Chicago Drive) and 28th Street in Grandville. From there, it was routed eastward along 28th Street running concurrently with Byp. US16. At the intersection with US131 (Division Street) on the Wyomingâ€“Paris township line, a Byp. US131 started and ran concurrently eastward along 28th Street. Byp. US16/Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 continued along 28th Street in Paris Township to an intersection with Kalamazoo Avenue where M-37 turned off Kalamazoo and onto 28th Street. Further east, 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue intersected. At that junction, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned northward along East Beltline while M-37 turned south and Byp. US16 continued eastward on 28th Street. Running northward in Grand Rapids Township, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 intersected US16/M-50 at Cascade Road before Byp. M-21 terminated at the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street).|$|E
5000|$|Several {{alternate}} alignments of US 66 {{occurred because}} of traffic issues. Business <b>routes</b> (BUS), <b>bypass</b> <b>routes</b> (BYP),alternate routes (ALT), and [...] "optional routes" [...] (OPT) (an early designation for alternate routes) came into being.|$|R

5|$|In 1940, a new roadway was opened, {{completing}} the third {{side of a}} triangle between the junction with M-113, Walton Corners and Fife Lake. US131 was shifted to the new highway and the former routing along the other {{two sides of the}} triangle became part of M-113 and M-186. A second realignment opened the following year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska. US131 no longer turned east along Boardman Road between South Boardman and Lodi. Instead the MSHD rerouted the highway directly to the northeast, {{from the end of the}} previous new routing north of Fife Lake to Kalaska. By 1945, a Bypass US131 was created around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids, following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue, while the main highway continued to run through downtown unchanged. A decade later, mainline US131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the former <b>bypass</b> <b>route,</b> and Business US131 (Bus. US131) was created for the former route through downtown. A second business loop was created in Three Rivers, Michigan, after an expressway bypass of the city's downtown was opened in early 1954. Another expressway section was opened between Mancelona and the M-32 junction west of Elmira in late 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Milford {{area study}} has been dormant since July 2007 due to {{community}} opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes {{to the west and}} east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE1Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable <b>bypass</b> <b>route.</b> Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the <b>bypass,</b> <b>Route</b> 206 was replaced by Route 170, which ran along Atlantic Avenue and New York Avenue through the community. The route remained intact for several decades, lasting until May 15, 1986 when jurisdiction of the route was transferred to Burlington County. The route still continued to appear in state documents by 1988. When the route was turned over, it became Burlington County Route 690.|$|E

U.S. Highway1 (US1) and US17 travel through the city from the south to the north, and US23 enters the city running concurrently with US1. In downtown, US23 splits from US1 and quickly runs to its southern terminus.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the {{designation}} was revived {{in the suburbs}} of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was designated on a section of Eisenhower Boulevard between then US 230 and the interchange at Interstate 83, replacing the retired US 230 <b>Bypass</b> <b>route.</b> This was only temporary designation, however, as an interstate highway connector between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Interstate 83 was being built. The new interstate was built parallel to Eisenhower Boulevard. When the highway opened in 1969, it was designated Interstate 283, and the PA 283 designation on Eisenhower Boulevard was deleted.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} riverside roadway {{along the}} southern bank of the Mohawk River in western Schenectady was designated as part of NY5S in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY5S entered the Schenectady area on River Road and followed River and Rice Roads and Erie Boulevard into downtown Schenectady, where it ended at NY5. In the initial plans for the Interstate Highway System, outlined by the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1955 Yellow Book, the city of Schenectady would be served by two highways: one bypassing {{the city to the}} southwest (the New York State Thruway) and another that would loop north of the <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> to serve downtown Schenectady. The western portion of the loop route would run through the NY5S corridor.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, 1927, the Board of Estimate {{adopted the}} final {{plans for the}} highway, setting a hearing date of March 24. It was split into two sections, Section one went from Canal Street to 59th Street. Section two was to carry the road over the NYCRR's 60th Street Yard from 59th Street to 72nd Street. Section two was {{approved}} by the Board of Estimate on August 16, 1928; section one was postponed until September 27 due to objections. On October 18, the Board of Estimate approved section one. The highway was advocated by most business interests, including the Downtown League, the Fifth Avenue Association, the West End Association, and eleven other organizations. They cited increasing traffic and the need of a <b>bypass</b> <b>route</b> to support the highway, which would cost little in comparison to its benefits. Miller spoke {{at a meeting of the}} Market and Business Men's Association of the Greenwich and Chelsea Districts on October 30, 1928, detailing plans for the highway.
