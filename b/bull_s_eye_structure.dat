40|$|Le sujet de ma thèse est l étude de la {{diffraction}} par des trous sub-longueur percés dans des films métalliques, ainsi que la compréhension du rôle des plasmons de surface (SPs) dans la diffraction en champ lointain. Nous avons construit un goniomètre fait maison de haute qualité. Une série de trous unique percés dans un film opaque et variant continûment de k r >> 1 à k r > 1 to k r<< 1 {{in a flat}} opaque film were explored, where k is the wavevector of {{the incident}} wave and r is the radius of the hole. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} diffraction of single hole can be classified into four regimes, depending on the input polarization. A simple analytical expression reveals {{for the first time the}} subtle interplay of two competing factors: one related to surface plasmon excitation and the other originating in the coupling of the field to the waveguide mode of the aperture. When the hole is surrounded by concentric grooves (<b>bull</b> <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>structure)</b> and is illuminated with the grooves on the output side, the beaming effect occurs: far-field diffraction is confined in very small solid angle. The effects of geometrical parameters on bull s eye diffraction have been studied and the diffraction patterns with the width less than 1 in the far field have been achieved. Another surface waves (CWs) different from SPs on tungsten films were studied. It was demonstrated that the CWs have beaming effect as well. By comparison we showed that CWs display much weaker enhancement in transmission than SPs through nanostructures. STRASBOURG-Bib. electronique 063 (674829902) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E
40|$|Well logs, cores, and {{petrographic}} {{analyses of}} selected wells in the Levelland and Slaughter fields {{have revealed that}} the lower San Andres Formation consists of up to five vertically repeating depositional cycles. Each depositional cycle primarily consists of a shoaling upward sequence of subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal facies. Subtidal sediments contain dolomudstones, packstones, wackestones, and grainstones with bioturbation and stylolitization. Fossil allochems include bivalves, crinoids, foraminifers, brachiopods, and lesser quantities of corals and bryozoans; nonskeletal grains include pellets, oolites, and lesser oncolites. Intertidal sediments are primarily composed of packstones, wackestones, and grainstones with laminites, burrows, and lesser quantities of algal stromatolites. Skeletal grains include bivalves, crinoids, and lesser foraminifers; nonskeletal grains include pellets and intraclasts. Supratidal sediments are typically anhydrite interlaminated with dolomite. Algal stromatolites, fenestrae (bird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eye)</b> <b>structures,</b> tepee structures, desiccation cracks, pisolites, and collapse breccia occur in this facies. ^ Petrographic analyses of the lower San Andres reveal the following facies: crinoidal, mudstone, spiculitic, crinoidal-bioclastic, fusulinid-bioclastic, bioclastic, pelletal, oolitic, peloidal-intraclastic, pisolitic, algal-laminated, and anhydrite. ^ Petrographic and geochemical analyses have revealed that the most common diagenetic processes within the lower San Andres are as follows: (1) micritization, (2) cementation, (3) dolomitization, (4) compaction, (5) dissolution, (6) anhydritization, (7) silicification, (8) fracturing, (9) stylolitization, and (10) pyritization. ^ Porosity and permeability are variable in the study area. The commonest porosity types are the moldic, vuggy, interparticle, intraparticle, intercrystalline, and minor cavernous. Anhydritization resulted in lowering primary and secondary porosities in the study area. ^ Sedimentary structures indicating possible subaerial exposure surfaces are common in the study area. These include tepee structures, desiccation cracks, fenestral fabric, and breccia. ^ Stable oxygen and carbon stable isotopes were tested {{for the first time}} in the study area as possible indicators for subaerial exposure surfaces. A test suite of selected samples from cycles 4 and 5 of the Mobil 360 (Levelland Unit) were analyzed for oxygen and carbon stable isotope content. Shifts in the abundance of oxygen isotopes were recognized along subaerial exposure surfaces. Comparison of the core description with stable isotopic analysis reveals that the latter may be a valuable technique in recognizing subaerial exposure surfaces in the dolomites of the lower San Andres Formation, although, further work and tighter sampling are required in order to establish the validity of this approach. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{was found}} that two kinds of {{resonance}} modes could exist in the structure that consists of a grating metal thin film, a sandwiched dielectric material, and a metal ground[17]. One mode depends on the grating period and the other mode results from Fabry-Pérot-like resonance. In this paper, we adopted the concentric rings as the grating structures on the dielectric layer over the metallic ground and studied their near-field enhancements and far-field radiation patterns. The concentric rings have often been used for focusing applications. When the concentric rings are formed on the metal surface of a single layer, a strong transmission is obtained through the structure called the bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>structure</b> which has been described extensively elsewhere[18 – 22]. It collects the light into the center hole, and the different shapes of the hole would result in different electric field enhancement from this light collection. For example, an elliptical aperture[23] and a hexagonal aperture[24] surrounded by polygonal segmented grooves are strongly polarization dependent. The transmission can be enhanced by cutting the bull’s eye antenna; i.e., a split bull’s eye structure[25]. A bowtie aperture[26] {{and a pair of}} fan-rod optical antenna[27] can achieve stronger electric fields by integrating with the bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>structure.</b> The bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>structure</b> has also been applied to control the fluorescence beams[28, 29].|$|R
