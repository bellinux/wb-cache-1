5|$|Super Smash Bros. Brawl, which Project M modifies, is a {{fighting}} game with an unconventional battle system. Players battle in arenas of varying sizes {{and levels of}} complexity, controlling characters {{with a variety of}} play styles. They can attack one another with their own repertoires of special moves, or with a basic attack. Attacks can be avoided by jumping or using a short-lived shield move. Unlike most fighting games, Brawl does not include standard health gauges, but a percentage counter; there is no point at which a character is automatically knocked out from the counter getting too high, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> knocked farther with increasing damage. Being knocked off the screen—or falling off oneself—causes a knock-out. Players may use items for offensive purposes, such as guns and swords, or for healing purposes, such as food and heart containers. The stages, characters, and items are drawn from Nintendo's video game franchises such as Mario, Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid, along with Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog series and Konami's Metal Gear series. The victor of a match has no standard determining factor. Rather, depending on the settings, victory may be reached, for example, by being the last player alive using a stock system, or by achieving the most KOs after a set amount of time.|$|E

Short miles are the absolute shortest distance between two or more zip codes, literally a straight line drawn across the map. These short miles rarely reflect the actual miles that must be driven in order to pickup and deliver freight, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> used to calculate what the driver will earn.|$|E

25|$|If a {{conductor}} moves with a constant velocity {{through the field}} of a stationary magnet, eddy currents will be produced due to a magnetic force on the electrons in the conductor. In the rest frame of the conductor, on the other hand, the magnet will be moving and the conductor stationary. Classical electromagnetic theory predicts that precisely the same microscopic eddy currents will be produced, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> due to an electric force.|$|E

25|$|In Alliance, {{there are}} three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona. The point of this mode is to get more points than the other teams, but each team is chased by another and is only allowed to kill one {{specific}} team (not the team chasing them, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to stun the team hunting them). This mode encourages players to work together, as teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously. The Advanced Alliance mode is a variant of Alliance mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, similar to the Advanced Wanted mode.|$|E
25|$|One {{case study}} with coral reef {{restoration}} {{was conducted on}} the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The University of Hawaii {{has come up with a}} Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program to help relocate and restore coral reefs in Hawaii. A boat channel on the island of Oahu to the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology was overcrowded with coral reefs. Also, many areas of coral reef patches in the channel had been damaged from past dredging in the channel. Dredging covers the existing corals with sand, and their larvae cannot build and thrive on sand; they can only build on to existing reefs. Because of this, the University of Hawaii decided to relocate some of the coral reef to a different transplant site. They transplanted them with the help of the United States Army divers, to a relocation site relatively close to the channel. They observed very little, if any, damage occurred to any of the colonies while they were being transported, and no mortality of coral reefs has been observed on the new transplant site, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> continuing to monitor the new transplant site to see how potential environmental impacts (i.e. ocean acidification) will harm the overall reef mortality rate. While trying to attach the coral to the new transplant site, they found the coral placed on hard rock is growing considerably well, and coral was even growing on the wires that attached the transplant corals to the transplant site. This gives new hope to future research on coral reef transplant sites. As a result of this coral restoration project, no environmental effects were seen from the transplantation process, no recreational activities were decreased, and no scenic areas were affected by the project. This is a great example that coral transplantation and restoration can work and thrive under the right conditions, which means there may be hope for other damaged coral reefs.|$|E

500|$|Once seated, Bryan {{went to the}} Platform Committee {{meeting at}} the Palmer House, {{displacing}} the Nebraska gold delegate on the committee. [...] The proposed platform was pro-silver; Senator Hill had offered an amendment backing the gold standard, which had been defeated by committee vote. [...] As Hill was determined to take the platform fight to the full convention, the committee discussed who should speak in the debate, and allocated 75minutes to each side. [...] South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, a silver supporter, wanted an hour to address the convention, and to close the debate. [...] When both Hill and Bryan (who {{was selected as the}} other pro-silver speaker) objected to such a long closing address, Tillman settled for 50minutes and for opening the debate rather than closing it; Bryan was given 25minutes to close. [...] Bryan later asked the Platform Committee chairman, Arkansas Senator James K. Jones why he was given such a crucial role as closing the platform debate; Senator Jones responded that he had three reasons: Bryan's long service in the silver cause, the Nebraskan was the only major speaker not to have addressed the convention, and that Jones had a sore throat. [...] That evening, Bryan dined with his wife and with friends. [...] Looking upon the loud Boies and Bland supporters, Bryan commented, [...] "These people don't know it, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> cheering for me just this way tomorrow night." ...|$|E
500|$|Sharon {{flew back}} to Jerusalem to attend a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, June 9. He said Syria had already begun moving its second armored {{division}} (the 3rd Armoured Division) south from Ein Zahalta. The political timetable dictated that waiting until Thursday would not leave enough time for a ground advance. Drori, who came with Sharon to the meeting, was against the attack, saying it was superfluous. Eitan was ambivalent, preferring to limit the attack to {{a signal to the}} Syrians. The Communications Minister, Mordechai Tzipori, argued that Sharon's plan had exceeded the original forty-kilometer line. Sharon replied that the line had to be measured from Israel's northernmost point, Metula. He added that destroying the missile batteries in the Beqaa was necessary to save the force at Ein Zahalta. The Interior Minister, Yosef Burg, pointed out that a fight against the Syrians seemed imminent, in contrast to what the Cabinet wanted, and that attacking the missiles would only aggravate things and lead to an all-out war. Sharon stressed the vulnerability of the soldiers in the field. Begin turned to Ivry's deputy, Amos Amir, and asked for his projection of the IAF's losses in such an attack. Amir replied [...] "I cannot promise no losses whatsoever, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> minimal". Begin supported the attack and eventually Burg was also convinced. Sharon left the conference and issued an order for an air strike as well as a ground operation.|$|E

2500|$|As a rule, it is {{impossible}} to design a candidate generator that will satisfy this goal and also prioritize candidates with similar energy. [...] On the other hand, one can often vastly improve the efficiency of SA by relatively simple changes to the generator.

2500|$|Breeding colours is also {{a problem}} for many {{beginner}} breeders. [...] Certain colour combinations can produce unwanted or potentially harmful results, such as mating blue merle to blue merle. Blue merle to blue merle crosses can produce {{what is called a}} [...] "double merle" [...] the result of which can be deaf or blind. Mating a sable and white to a blue merle can produce a sable merle, which is undesirable for the show ring. [...] A tri-colour to a pure-for-sable (a sable and white which can produce only other sable and whites), will produce only sable and whites, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> tri-factored sable and whites (which means they have the tri-gene.) [...] There are many more examples of breeding for color, so a good breeder will research color genetics prior to breeding. [...] There are many different genes contributing to the different colors of the Sheltie, including the bi gene, the merling gene, the sable gene, and the tricolour gene.|$|E

[...] Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Roddy Woomble confirmed that the band {{were in the process}} of writing a new album, stating: [...] "I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and it is no secret that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in time, as will others." [...] In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Lucci Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.|$|E
