This way, the teletext decoder captures every page sent out and stores it in memory, so when a page is requested by the user it can be loaded directly from memory {{instead of having to}} wait for the page to be transmitted. When the page is transmitted again, the television checks if the page in memory is still up-to-date and updates it if necessary.|$|E
500|$|Paul Taylor of the Financial Times {{found the}} ZX81 to be [...] "a {{powerful}} and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun {{introduction to the}} mysteries of home computing" [...] but cautioned readers about its limitations. It lacked ready-made software, the keyboard {{was not easy to}} use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade-style games and its <b>built-in</b> <b>memory</b> was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, [...] "the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool and I think that, provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do, it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the ZX81 {{highlighted}} the great {{value for money}} offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in Your Computer, [...] "the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment". He applauded the improvements {{that had been made}} over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 [...] "a very good first computer" [...] that [...] "will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost." [...] However, the <b>built-in</b> <b>memory</b> was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was [...] "mandatory for any worthwhile use". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.|$|E

[...] Similar to the Atari Lynx, the handheld has an extra set of buttons allowing the console to be played at different angles; for the WonderSwan, these buttons were used to allow gamers to play games in both the portrait and landscape orientations. [...] The WonderSwan series are all powered by a single AA battery, with the original monochrome version having a battery life of 40 hours.
