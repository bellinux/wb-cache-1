It is made of <b>bent</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> of 4 mm thick steel 1. 0038 in the production run of 80 000 pcs/year. A combination of shearing and bending at a follow tool was selected from among various options as the most appropriate. On the basis of technological, structural and control calculations, tool were designed and the technical documentation was elaborated. A blank sheet of metal with dimensions of 4 x 1500 x 3000 mm (using 94 %) was chosen as a semi-finished product. On {{the basis of the}} total shearing force, which was greater that the bending force, the same press CDCS 2500 P 81 made by the company Dirinler was selected for both tools. Using the economic evaluation, production costs per one anchor foot were calculated in the amount of 102, 3 CZK, including 30 % profit of the company.

40|$|Bending is {{the uniform}} {{straining}} of material around a straight axis {{and is used}} commonly in various <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> industrial products. Since all materials have a finite modulus of elasticity, plastic deformation is followed by some elastic recovery when the load is removed. In bending processes this phenomenon is called springback. Springback occurs not only in flat sheets or plate, but also in bars, rods, etc., {{and is one of}} the key factors to influence the quality of <b>bent</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts. The amount of springback should be known in order to produce <b>bent</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts within acceptable tolerance limits. There are many parameters which have influence on springback, one of them is strain hardening. The aim of the experimental work, described in the paper, was to determine the influence of the effective strain to springback ratio and springback angle of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> specimens. Many experiments have been done to find out the amount of springback for different values of effective strain and different thickness of <b>metal</b> <b>sheets.</b> Different specimens were used for the experimental determination of springback ratio and springback angle and were bent in a special bending tool. Statistical analysis methods were used for determination of mathematical models. This study is considered to be helpful to understand springback phenomena in metal forming processes...|$|R

This final {{project has been}} {{developed}} by Joseba Lasa and the research group EMAP from the XIOS Hogeschool Limburg. I came from the University of the Basque Country in San Sebastian. I have done my thesis for the electromechanics department. The objective of this project has been to design and develop a tightening system for <b>bent</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts, {{because one of the}} subjects in the research group EMAP is the dimensional accuracy control of this kind of pieces. Different kind of bent parts have been proposed. These pieces are being studied by EMAP in cooperation with <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> processing companies. The bent parts have to be measured accurately and therefore the product has to be positioned and fixed as good as possible. When designing a tightening or fixing system we have to be sure that this system will be as flexible as possible and can tight more than one piece in the same system. It also has to be as easy as possible to use, to get a good positioning and to have a short change-over time. And at last, the system has to be as cheap as possible. It is also interesting to be able to measure pieces in series to spend less time measuring the pieces. The following steps have been taken to find the most interesting fixing system for the different bent plates. 1. - A market study on different tightening methods and tools. 2. - Designing different kind of fixing methods. 3. - Developing the best fixing system 4. - Evaluating the system (resistance calculations, choosing material,...|$|R

However, composite parts cannot be <b>bent</b> like <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts. Hence, only low forces {{can be applied to}} close gaps between parts, caused by geometrical variation in parts and assembly fixtures.

40|$|AbstractLaser cutting {{has started}} {{to be used as}} an {{effective}} method for cutting out blanks from rolled <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> because of its high flexibility for cutting line and high productivity. However, residual stresses, which are generated by laser cutting, have been the greatest obstacle for the popularization of laser cutting. One of the problems is the warp which appears in the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal,</b> after being subjected to bending processes after laser cutting. The authors present a light indentation method for reducing residual stress generated by laser cutting. The method is to give light indentation on the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> edge and to reduce tensile residual stress generated near the laser cutting surface. In particular, this present paper especially focuses upon optimization of working condition depending on mechanical properties of blank. Furthermore, the mechanism of transition of stress and effective strain in light indentation was examined. Experiments of U-bending after applying light indentation were conducted for usability of this method. The FEM analyses were carried out in order to investigate the effect of working condition in various mechanical properties. As a result, the optimum condition of light indentation method in various materials was found out, and the warp of <b>bent</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> was drastically reduced...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDevelopable {{materials}} are ubiquitous {{in design and}} manufacturing. Unfortunately, general-purpose modeling tools are not suited to modeling 3 D objects composed of developable parts. We propose an interactive tool to model such objects from a photograph. Users of our system load a single picture of the object they wish to model, which they annotate to indicate silhouettes and part boundaries. Assuming that the object is symmetric, we also ask users to provide a few annotations of symmetric correspondences. The object is then automatically reconstructed in 3 D. At {{the core of our}} method is an algorithm to infer the 2 D projection of rulings of a developable surface from the traced silhouettes and boundaries. We impose that the surface normal is constant along each ruling, which is a necessary property for the surface to be developable. We complement these developability constraints with symmetry constraints to lift the curve network in 3 D. In addition to a 3 D model, we output 2 D patterns enabling to fabricate real prototypes of the object on the photo. This makes our method well suited for reverse engineering products made of leather, <b>bent</b> cardboard or <b>metal</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R
40|$|Designers {{often need}} to {{decompose}} a product into functioning parts during the product design stage. This decomposition {{is critical for}} product development, as it determines the geometric configuration of parts, and has direct impact on product cost. Most decomposition decisions are based primarily upon end-user requirements instead of product manufacturability. The resulting parts can be expensive to manufacture or are sometimes impossible to make. This thesis presents a manufacturability-driven approach which can help designers decompose <b>bent</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> products into manufacturable parts. The decomposition approach presented in this thesis takes the geometric description of an initial product design, analyzes its manufacturability, and decomposes the product into manufacturable parts. The decomposition continues until all decomposed parts are manufacturable. Near-optimal solutions are generated based on some primary concerns of design for manufacture (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA). Designers can then examine the decomposition results and decide whether they meet end-user requirements. Cutting, bending, and assembly processes are considered as the major manufacturin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bending has {{significant}} {{importance in the}} <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> product industry. Moreover, the springback of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> {{should be taken into}} consideration in order to produce <b>bent</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts within acceptable tolerance limits and to solve geometrical variation for the control of manufacturing process. Nowadays, the importance of this problem increases because of the use of sheet-metal parts with high mechanical characteristics (High Strength Low Alloy steel). This work describes robust methods of predicting springback of parts in 3 D modelling subjected to bending and unbending deformations. Also the effects of tool geometry in the final shape after springback are discussed. The first part of this paper presents the laboratory experiments in wiping die bending, in which the influence of process variables, such as die shoulder radius, punch-die clearance, punch nose radius and materials properties were discussed. The second part summarises the finite element analysis by using ABAQUS software and compares these results with some experimental data. It appeared that the final results of the FEM simulation are in good agreement with the experimental ones. An optimisation methodology based on the use of experimental design method and response surface technique is proposed in the third part of this paper. That makes it possible to obtain the optimum values of clearance between the punch and the die and the optimum die radius which can reduce the springback without cracking and damage of product...|$|R
