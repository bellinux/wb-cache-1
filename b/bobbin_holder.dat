50|$|Mike Rainville {{first came}} to {{woodworking}} as a hobby when he was 11. At that time, his mother, Pat, told him that, “he needed {{to find something to}} do.” Rainville’s grandparents had a history of working with their hands, specifically woodworking and farming, so there were always materials around to utilize. Rainville made his first items, spools and <b>bobbin</b> <b>holders,</b> in his parents’ basement in Lincoln, Vermont, using some spare wood, a coping saw, and a sanding block. As time progressed, he started making cribbage boards which are still being made today. Local craft fairs provided him with income to purchase new equipment and materials. By 1979, Rainville had established his first wholesale relationship.|$|R
