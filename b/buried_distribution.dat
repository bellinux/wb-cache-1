Correlation techniques are widely used in leak detection, but for these to be effective, the propagation wave speeds and wave attenuation must be known.

40|$|Detection {{of water}} leaks in <b>buried</b> <b>distribution</b> pipes using {{acoustic}} methods is {{common practice in}} many countries. Correlation techniques are widely used in leak detection, and these have been extremely effective when attempting to locate leaks in metal pipes. However, a number of difficulties have been highlighted when trying to determine the position of leaks in plastic pipes. Of particular interest here {{is what happens to}} the leak noise when the pipe passes through an expanse of water, such as across a river or lake. In this paper, the low-frequency acoustic propagation and attenuation characteristics of a submerged plastic water pipe are investigated experimentally in the laboratory, supported by predictions from a theoretical model. It is found that, whilst the signal attenuation for a submerged pipe is increased relative to that for a similar in-vacuo pipe, energy does not, in fact, radiate into the water; furthermore, the attenuation is small compared with that for a pipe buried in soil. <br/...|$|E

This paper presents the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) for detecting the corrosion of <b>buried</b> heat <b>distribution</b> pipeline, which mainly introduced {{the principle of the}} TEM to detect the pipeline and the general detection method. Combining with an instance of corrosion detection of <b>buried</b> heat <b>distribution</b> pipeline in a certain street in China Hohhot, the detection results were analyzed and the feasibility of this method was proved through excavation. The results show that the TEM can detect the uniform corrosion <b>distribution</b> of <b>buried</b> metal pipeline and it’s effective and practical for detecting the <b>buried</b> heat <b>distribution</b> pipeline. The TEM could provide a new method for guaranteeing the safe operation {{of the heat}} distribution pipeline. ...|$|R
40|$|A common {{technique}} for locating leaks in <b>buried</b> water <b>distribution</b> pipes {{is the use}} of the cross-correlation on two measured acoustic signals, on either side of a leak. This technique can be problematic for locating leaks due to high volume underground noise when the acoustic signals in PVC pipes are generally narrow-band and low frequency. For getting good results leak noise signals are generally passed through a Butterworth first order low pass, high pass, and then the Kalman filter before calculating the cross-correlation function. The model also is used to demonstrate the importance of the use of multiple inputs and moving averaging filters in single output before using the Kalman filter when system equations are unknown...|$|R

40|$|Leaks from <b>buried</b> water <b>distribution</b> pipes are {{commonly}} located {{by applying the}} correlation technique to two measured acoustic/vibration signals {{on either side of}} a leak. The effectiveness of the correlation technique for locating leaks in plastic pipes depends on the type of sensors used and their sensitivities. Based on an analytical model of the cross-correlation of pressure responses established in an earlier study, this paper investigates the behaviour of the cross-correlation coefficient for leak signals measured using pressure, velocity and acceleration sensors. Theoretical predictions show that a measure of pressure responses using hydrophones is effective for measurements where there is a small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but a sharper peak correlation coefficient can be achieved if accelerometers are used. The theoretical work is validated to some extent with test data from actual water pipes on a test site in Canada...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{techniques}} {{have been used}} for many years to find and locate leaks in <b>buried</b> water <b>distribution</b> systems. Hydrophones and accelerometers are typically used as sensors. Although geophones could be used as well, they are not generally used for leak detection. A simple acoustic model of the pipe and the sensors has been proposed previously by some of the authors of this paper, and their model was used to explain some of the features observed in measurements. However, simultaneous measurements of a leak using all three sensor-types in controlled conditions for plastic pipes has not been reported to-date and hence they have not yet been compared directly. This paper fills that gap in knowledge. A set of measurements was made on a bespoke <b>buried</b> plastic water <b>distribution</b> pipe test rig to validate the previously reported analytical model. There is qualitative agreement between the experimental results and the model predictions in terms of the differing filtering properties of the pipe-sensor systems. A quality measure for the data is also presented, which is the ratio of the bandwidth over which the analysis is carried out divided by the centre frequency of this bandwidth. Based on this metric, the accelerometer was found to be the best sensor to use for the test rig described in this paper. However, for a system in which the distance between the sensors is large or the attenuation factor of the system is high, then it would be advantageous to use hydrophones, even though they are invasive sensors...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} of a leak in <b>buried</b> water <b>distribution</b> pipes, may be determined by accurate estimation of the time delay between two measured acoustic signals. By using {{a model for the}} wave propagation along plastic pipes, various time delay estimators using cross-correlation are compared in this paper for their ability to locate a leak in plastic pipes. The estimators of interest are the ROTH impulse response, the smoothed coherence transform (SCOT), the WIENER, the phase transform (PHAT) and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimators. For leak detection in buried plastic water pipes it is found that the SCOT estimator is particularly suited to this purpose. The accuracy of the estimators is also discussed. It is found that random errors introduced by random noise on the signal measurements are insignificant compared with the resolution of the time delay estimators imposed by the low-pass filtering characteristics of the pipe. Limited experimental results are presented to support the findings...|$|R

The analytical model is used to explain some of the features of correlation measurements made in actual water pipes. Leak noise signals are generally passed through a band-pass filter before calculating the cross-correlation function. The model is used to demonstrate the importance of the cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter and the insensitivity of the correlation to the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} interpretation of laser-induced {{damage in the}} nanosecond regime is realized with a defect <b>distribution</b> <b>buried</b> inside the redeposited layer arising from a polishing process. Under the 355 -nm laser irradiation, the size dependence of the defect embedded in the fused silica can be illustrated through the thermal conduction model. Considering CeO 2 as the major initiator, the size distribution with the power law model is determined from the damage probability statistics. To verify {{the accuracy of the}} size distribution, the ion output scaling with depth for the inclusion element is obtained with the secondary ion mass spectrometer. For CeO 2 particulates in size of the depth interval with ion output satisfied in the negative exponential form, the corresponding density is consistent with that of the identical size in the calculated size distribution. This coincidence implies an alternative method for the density analysis of photoactive imperfections within optical components at the semi-quantitative level based on the laser damage tests...|$|R

The goal was to deliver efficiently {{the maximum amount of}} optical power into buried tumors being treated while avoiding potential damage to normal tissue caused by strong optical power deposition underneath the tissue surface illuminated by the laser beam. The buried tumors were considered to have much higher absorption than the surrounding normal tissue because of selective uptake of the absorption-enhancement dye. The power delivering efficiency to buried tumors was investigated for various diameters of the laser beam. An optimal beam diameter was estimated to achieve the maximum product of the power coupling efficiency and the power delivered to the <b>buried</b> tumor. The <b>distribution</b> of power deposition was simulated for single-beam delivery and multiple-beam delivery as well.

The high bulk sensitivity of hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) in combination with circularly polarized radiation enables {{the investigation of the}} magnetic properties of <b>buried</b> layers. Angular <b>distributions</b> of high kinetic energy (7 - 8 key) photoelectrons in a range of about 600 were recorded in parallel to the energy distribution. Depending on purpose, energy and angular resolutions of 150 - 250 meV and 0. 17 - 2 degrees can be accomplished simultaneously in such experiments. Experiments were performed on exchange-biased magnetic layers covered by thin oxide films. More specifically, the angular distribution of photoelectrons from the ferromagnetic layer Co 2 FeAl layer grown on MnIr exchange-biasing layer was investigated where the magnetic structure is buried beneath a MgO layer. Pronounced magnetic dichroism is found in the Co and Fe 2 p states for all angles of emission. A slightly increased magnetic dichroism was observed for normal emission in agreement with theoretical considerations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Involuted soil horizons {{and buried}} organic {{matter in the}} active layer and near-surface {{permafrost}} provide evidence that soil movement or cryoturbation is occurring within the active layer in hummocky terrain. Cryoturbation in the active layer of permafrost-affected soils could have significant implications in sequestering carbon, including trace metals and contaminants that are absorbed onto organic matter. Though several hummock development theories exist, there has thus far been limited evidence to support them; similarly, {{few studies have been}} able to establish hummock age. This study aimed to contribute radiocarbon-dated ages of buried organics in both the active layer and permafrost, as well as provide evidence for the convective cell/equilibrium model and the collapse model. Trenches were dug along a transect at two well-developed hummock sites in the Mackenzie Delta near Inuvik, NWT. Active layer and permafrost samples were analyzed for distribution of gravimetric water content (GWC), organic matter, inorganic carbon, and carbon- 14 (C 14).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a theoretical and experimental investigation into the enhancement of acoustic methods used to detect leaks in <b>buried</b> plastic water <b>distribution</b> pipes. Although acoustic methods have been successfully used for leak detection in metallic pipes, they are less effective in plastic pipes due, for example, to the high attenuation of leak noise signals. Two specific problems investigated in this thesis. They are the uncertainty involved in the calculation of the time delay in arrival times between two leak signals, and the variation of speed at which the leak noise propagates in the pipe. This is done in both the time and frequency domains. A new way to estimate the wave speed from measurements made {{in the presence of}} a leak is also proposed, together with a way of estimating the attenuation of leak noise as it propagates in the pipe. A bespoke test-rig was designed and built specifically for this project by South Staffs Water plc, so that leaks could be simulated and investigated in controlled conditions. Following the characterisation of the test rig, two specific correlators were investigated, one using the basic cross-correlation (BCC) function and other using the phase transform (PHAT). It is shown that the BCC is more suitable for leak detection, when the pipe exhibits resonance behaviour. It is further shown that the bandwidth over which the analysis is conducted is crucial to locate the leak accurately. To determine this bandwidth a procedure is developed to determine automatically low and high frequency cut-off frequencies of a band-pass filter. This method uses both the coherence and the modulus of the cross-spectral density (CSD) function between two leak noise signals. A new technique is also proposed to calculate the time delay estimate using both the modulus and phase of the CSD function, and this is validated using a wide range of data from the bespoke test-rig and also from a Canadian test-rig. Moreover, an expression for the variance of the time delay estimate is determined based on frequency domain data, and this is shown to give the same result as that previously determined in the time domain. Using the variance and statistical analysis a range of values that the time delay estimate can assume is calculated. This range of values is related to the 95 % confidence interval of the time delay estimate calculated using the weighted least squares fit. The confidence interval can also be applied to the wave-speed estimate. The time delay and wavespeed estimates can be combined to determine a region where a leak is likely to be located in a pipe rather than giving an exact position as provided by commercial correlators. Measured data is used to validate the approach using the bespoke test-rig...|$|R
