5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E

5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} Roman {{paintings}} of Priapus have survived. One {{of the most}} famous images of Priapus is that from the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. A fresco depicts the god weighing his phallus against a large bag of coins. In nearby Herculaneum, an excavated snack bar has a painting of Priapus <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> apparently as a good-luck symbol for the customers.|$|E
25|$|When touring at coastal theatres {{with his}} wife, Lowe used his {{distinctive}} 1885 former steam yacht Amazon as a floating base. He bought Amazon as a houseboat in 1968 but realised her potential {{and took her}} back to sea in 1971; this unique vessel is still operating in the Mediterranean. The ship had a bar with a semicircular notch cut halfway along, to enable both the portly figure of Lowe and his wife to serve <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> at the same time, acting as hosts during the parties they threw on board.|$|E

25|$|The game ends {{when the}} Hood arrives {{at one of}} the pubs and is touched by the {{landlord}} from his front step. The landlord then takes charge of the Hood for the year, and is supposed to give everyone a free drink. The winning pub pours beer over the Hood and then hangs it <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> (each pub has two hooks especially for this purpose). According to legend, it used to be roasted on a spit over the pub fire having been doused with ale, which was then drunk by those present.|$|E
25|$|Colour Bearers {{get their}} name from {{a band of}} purple they wear as {{insignia}} on their uniform, purple {{being one of the}} school colours. They are elected by the pupils and the staff, similar to Eton's Pop, and have important roles in the school community as a whole. Unlike captains they keep their positions for a whole year unless they are demoted which is usually the punishment for untoward behaviour. They meet every week with the Headmaster to attend {{to a wide range of}} school matters. As well as this they are responsible for maintaining the refectory and the library and for serving drinks <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> at the weekly socials in addition to organising major school wide events that take place throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|In Manet’s painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, {{observed}} by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene {{appears to be}} reflected in the mirror <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet’s barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.|$|E

5000|$|Communist Party of India {{also went}} through a split during this time. In 1962, China {{attacked}} India, and Communist Party was divided ideologically into two groups. The official faction, sided with Russian ideology stood <b>behind</b> Nehru during <b>the</b> war. The group that sided with Chinese ideology were pushed to the bring. Eventually this group split off from CPI and formed Communist Party of India (Marxist). The official group was headed by S. A. Danke at national level. In Kerala, the two Communist parties fought {{each other in the}} 1965 elections. Most CPI(M) leaders were put <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> and many contested <b>the</b> elections from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R

25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b> The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E

500|$|Becky {{is not an}} {{aspirational}} character, she {{strives to}} be normal, satisfied with a [...] "hard up lifestyle". She has changed since her early days, having calmed down a little {{in terms of her}} often out of control behaviour. Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had said to me that in three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Driver {{discussed}} her character, saying, [...] "Coronation Street characters tend to {{fit into}} one of two camps. Those who have drama after drama and those who muddle through life, often in the background, as sturdy and dependable as the famous cobbles. Betty falls into the latter group. There have been moments of drama, intrigue and even romance – {{but it has been}} her presence <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> cutting up pieces of lamb and chunks of potato, that has endeared her to the viewers." [...] When asked about Betty's [...] "sharp tongue", Driver suggested, [...] "Not really sharp. [...] just straightforward. [...] not nasty to anybody but [...] suffer fools gladly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{establishment}} {{features a}} glass wall <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> looking into an indoor swimming pool where swimmers {{can be seen}} under water. It is located inside the O'Haire Motor Inn, which was built in 1962. [...] The concept of a swimming pool designed so underwater swimmers can be viewed from inside the bar was original to the building, {{as the person who}} built the O'Haire had been inspired by a similar design he saw when visiting the Playboy Club in Chicago. [...] When built in the 1960s, the O'Haire Motor Inn was considered [...] "swank" [...] and modern, and the tiki concept was popular, in part due to the then-recent admission of Hawaii to the United States as a state. [...] The concept of a tropical theme was also viewed as a fun concept for Montana, a landlocked state with long, cold winters.|$|E
500|$|Becky {{became the}} 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008. Kelly opined that the character's ex-con {{personality}} {{would give her}} an advantage <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> explaining: [...] "The previous producer, Steve Frost, loved {{the idea of a}} barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch. Becky's an ex-con so she can fight dirty like nobody else." [...] The character's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress, something which drew off-screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts. ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona, stating that she loves drinking cider, and that she isn't bothered by how she looks—though when she dresses up she [...] "dresses to the nines" [...] with big earrings, gold rings, logo belts and hair pieces. She dislikes anyone ordering her about, as she cannot handle being told what to do.|$|E
