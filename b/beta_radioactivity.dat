40|$|Het RIVM controleert achtmaal per jaar de metingen van de verrijkingsfabriek Urenco te Almelo. Het gaat hierbij om lozingen van radioactiviteit {{in water}} en lucht. De contra-expertise onderbouwt de betrouwbaarheid van de {{analyses}} die Urenco uitvoert. Doorgaans komen de analyses overeen, zo ook in 2006. Uit de metingen blijkt dat er in het afvalwater doorgaans een zeer lage totaal-alfa en totaal-beta activiteit aanwezig is. De radioactiviteit in ventilatielucht ligt zeer dicht bij het niveau van de hoeveelheid radon die van nature in buitenlucht aanwezig is. Het RIVM heeft in acht afvalwatermonsters en acht monsters van ventilatielucht, die verspreid over het jaar 2006 zijn afgenomen, de totaal-alfa en totaal-beta activiteit bepaald. Deze bepaling is een snelle manier om de mate waarin uraan naar het milieu geloosd wordt, aan te tonen. Opdrachtgever is de Kernfysische Dienst van het ministerie van VROM. Within {{the framework of}} a monitoring programme, the RIVM measures the release of radioactivity into the waste water and atmosphere of the Urenco uraan enrichment plant in Almelo. Measurements are carried out eight times per year. This form of counter-expertise is aimed at verifying and supporting the reliability of the analyses carried out by the Urenco plant. The two different sets of measurements are generally in agreement, as was also the case in 2006. As a rule, the waste water contains very low levels of gross alpha and gross <b>beta</b> activity. <b>Radioactivity</b> levels in the ventilation air are very close to those levels expected due to the natural presence of radon in the outside atmosphere. The RIVM determined the gross alpha and gross beta activity in eight waste water samples and eight samples of ventilation air. The samples were taken at time points dispersed throughout 2006. This procedure provides the RIVM with a rapid method for determining the extent of uraan release into the environment.

This {{information will be}} beneficial in the assessing the acceptability of K Basin sludge in the Tank Waste Remediation System and in the design and/or operational practices related to retrieval and handling of this K Basin sludge. Calculations were made based on results from recent laboratory chemical and radionuclides analyses of sludge sampled from thirteen locations in K East main basin. This concentration data was mathematically processed to determine the various constituents concentration distribution throughout the basin floor. This data was further processed, along with data previously generated from the analysis of measured sludge depths, to give both basin total masses and associated spatial distribution of the various sludge constituents. Results of these calculations, showed that the major gravimetric constituents of the sludge are iron (1505 kg), uranium (1387 kg), aluminum, sodium and c 2 @ 15 cium.

40|$|PURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possible radioactive potential of zirconium dioxide (ZrO 2) dental ceramics. Such information is necessary since they became an integral part of routine prosthetic rehabilitations and devoid of scientific information about their radioactivity creates some concern in the dental community. METHODS Four different types of commercial ZrO 2 ceramics, namely Lava, Cercon, ICE Zirkon, and Everest Bio ZS were investigated before and after the sintering process. Sintering temperatures were applied according to each manufacturer's instructions. The compositions of the presintered and sintered specimens were analyzed using x-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF). Concentrations of the elements and compounds were also measured by this method. Determination of radioactivity continued with Gamma-spectrometry measurements and Gross alpha/Beta analyses. RESULTS The activity of gamma and Gross alpha/beta was below minimum detection limits (MDL) for presintered and sintered ZrO 2.

The gross alpha radioactivities were measured as below 1 Bq kg- 1 {{in most of the}} samples, some of them being due to the detection limit of the counting system. The gross <b>beta</b> <b>radioactivity</b> levels ranged from 1. 8 Bq kg- 1 to 453 Bq kg- 1, larger levels being observed in leguminous seeds while the highest level being in haricot bean.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on five studies. It {{includes}} the characterization of lipid micro emboli in shed mediastinal blood during cardiac surgery. The reuse of blood directly by cardiotomy suction is a common practice {{in order to reduce}} the need of blood transfusions. In shed mediastinal blood we showed that there is an abundance of lipid particles in the size range of 10 - 60 μm. These lipid particles are also recirculated by the cardiotomy suction, through filters and the plastic tubing in the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit. The lipid particles are quite probably in an emulsified state which renders them hydrophilic and less prone to stick to the plastic surfaces of tubing and filters. With a series of samples from the mediastinal blood and from the arterial circulation we found that the lipid particles are formed during the operation. Probable sites of origin are the bone marrow after sternotomy and the mediastinal fat tissue manipulated during the surgery in order to expose the heart for cannulation. When the blood was collected in a separate transfusion bag and transfused over a short period of time the increase of lipid micro emboli could be detected in the arterial circulation of the CPB circuit. This was measured by using a Coulter counter to analyze and count emboli in a series of blood samples. The Coulter counter was shown in the first study to be a valuable technique to evaluate embolic loads of lipid micro emboli in blood. The lungs act as physiological filters for the circulation. Embolic material is filtered effectively by the lungs. Using this filtering property of the lungs could therefore be an option in retransfusing the lipid laden mediastinal blood gathered during cardiac surgery. Using a pig model and a shed blood phantom laden with radioactive triolein as embolic material, we registered the hemodynamic results of this during CPB. Furthermore we registered the embolic load in the circulation by measuring <b>beta</b> <b>radioactivity</b> in a series of blood samples. We found that the lungs do act to trap a great deal of these lipid particles but these are then to a certain extent recirculated again. This was especially evident when the cardiac output and pressure were increased by a bolus of volume and vasoconstrictors Lipid emboli find their way into the circulation during cardiac surgery, where they can be detected and counted by the Coulter counter. When simultaneously registering micro embolic signals from a transcranial Doppler and counting lipid micro emboli in blood samples taken from the arterial line, we found a strong correlation between the two phenomena. Lipid material was also tagged by <b>beta</b> <b>radioactivity</b> and found to end up in different organs. By comparing two shed blood phantoms, one with nonemulsified lipids and the other with emulsified lipids we found that the lipid embolic matter increases in the circulation and is more easily deposited in the tissue. The overall purpose was to show that lipid micro emboli are released into the shed mediastinal blood during cardiac surgery. When this blood is retransfused, it is the source of a bombardment of lipid micro emboli in the circulation. These emboli are lodged in various organs. Lipid emboli in the emulsified state are more likely to pass into the circulation during retransfusion of shed mediastinal blood. These emboli can be detected by a transcranial Doppler in the arterial circulation of patients undergoing cardiac surgery...|$|E

In this study mine water and coal FA were characterized to determine their physiochemical properties. This study linked the modelling results obtained by using the Geochemist’s workbench (GWB) software to the results obtained during the actual treatment of Matla mine water and Rand Uranium mine water using coal FA and lime. The chemistry involved when Matla mine water and Rand Uranium mine water were treated with flocculants was also investigated. Lastly the chemistry and kinetics involved was investigated when mine water was treated with various ameliorants such as Matla coal FA, lime and/or Al(OH) 3 using jet loop mixing or overhead stirring. Mine water from Matla coal mine had a pH of 8 and therefore was classified as neutral mine drainage (NMD). Rand Uranium mine water had a pH of less than 3 and therefore was classified as acid mine drainage (AMD). The concentration of sulphate, Na, Ca, Mg, B, Hg, Se and Cd ions in Matla mine water was 1475, 956, 70, 40, 15, 2. 43, 1. 12 and 0. 005 mg/L respectively.
