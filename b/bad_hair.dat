The second session started the next day and produced the original songs: [...] "I Remember Larry", [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", and [...] "Since You've Been Gone". The third session took place on November 5, 1995, and resulted in the original [...] "I'm So Sick of You" [...] and the parody [...] "Cavity Search". The fourth session yielded [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] medley, and the two parodies [...] "Gump" [...] and [...] "Phony Calls".

500|$|On January 15, 1996, Yankovic began {{recording}} the lead single for the album, [...] "Amish Paradise". Yankovic felt that parodying Coolio would pay off, because Coolio had [...] "such an identifiable image {{that a lot}} of things could be done [...] ". He noted, [...] "I like to play around with people that have some- you know, a lot of style as opposed to somebody who's kind of homogonized [...] and bland and has no personality, and Coolio certainly kind of sticks out in a crowd." [...] Yankovic felt that juxtaposing the original song's [...] "gangsta" [...] themes with the Amish lifestyle would produce a humorous end result. After Yankovic revealed to his label that he would be doing a Coolio parody, they requested that the album artwork for the release also parody Coolio. Yankovic had been toying with the name <b>Bad</b> <b>Hair</b> Day for a time and felt that he could adequately use the name and lampoon Coolio – who was known for his distinct hair style – at the same time.

However, Joyce noted that [...] "some of the biggest laugh-getters" [...] on the album were Yankovic's originals. A record review from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concluded that [...] "'Weird Al' Yankovic's ninth collection of original songs and parodies reinforces his reign as pop music's King of Comedy", and that the record [...] "showcases Yankovic's unparalleled ability to capture the styles of other bands and turn boring pop songs into fun tunes." [...] J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun noted that while Yankovic's music can be [...] "sophomoric and silly", Yankovic himself [...] "can also be pretty smart". The review highlighted, among other songs, [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] and [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", as some of the album's best songs.|$|E
500|$|The Kazon's {{design was}} {{formulated}} around {{the beginning of}} June 1994. The series' make-up supervisor Michael Westmore was heavily involved {{in the creation of}} the look for the Kazon. While describing the species' facial features, Westmore said he constructed a skin protrusion along the nose and front of the face to simulate [...] "a soft cockscomb, a rooster comb" [...] rather than [...] "the dinosaur bone-type of ridges". He said that there were very small visual differences between Kazon males and females, with the distinguishing characteristic being women having a more delicate physicality than the men. According to Westmore, the prosthetic make-up for the forehead was structured in a shape reminiscent of the Devil, while the ridges on the nose were inspired by a vulture's neck. The nose designs were modified throughout the first two seasons with the addition of a nose tip and spikes protruding from the nostrils. The Kazon's design was the subject of fan criticism following the series premiere, with one fan commenting: [...] "They look like they're all having a <b>bad</b> <b>hair</b> day."

2500|$|This is {{represented}} by the show's promotional tagline, [...] "Small town Canada with a little Muslim twist": the religious angle, while always present, is largely tied to and sometimes even secondary to standard and universal sitcom themes such as family, friends and the humour in everyday life. For example, while the show sometimes tackles storylines with a political edge, such as a character claiming to be unable to attend a conference in the United States because he says he was wrongly placed on a no-fly list (when in fact he is simply afraid of flying) or the mosque being raided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, even these situations are explored as much for their humour as their politics. The show much more commonly explores purely comedic issues such as whether a Muslim woman still has to cover her hair if the only man who can see her is gay, whether Muslims can curl, whether to haggle with the carpet salesman when buying a prayer rug, or whether a Muslim woman's head scarf is enough to mitigate a <b>bad</b> <b>hair</b> day. Television critics have also credited this very combination of an attention-grabbing premise with conventional and familiar sitcom themes as one of the primary reasons that the show successfully retained an audience after its debut.|$|E
