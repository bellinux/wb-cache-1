6000|$|Of {{this the}} {{following}} instance {{was told to}} the author by a gentleman connected with the sufferer. A young man of fortune, who had led what is called so gay a life as considerably to injure both his health and fortune, was at length obliged to consult the physician upon the means of restoring, at least, the former. One of his principal complaints was the frequent presence {{of a set of}} apparitions, resembling a <b>band</b> <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> dressed in green, who performed in his drawing-room a singular dance, to which he was compelled to bear witness, though he knew, to his great annoyance, that the whole corps de ballet existed only in his own imagination. His physician immediately informed him that he had lived upon town too long and too fast not to require an exchange to a more healthy and natural course of life. He therefore prescribed a gentle course of medicine, but earnestly recommended to his patient to retire to his own house in the country, observe a temperate diet and early hours, practising regular exercise, on the same principle avoiding fatigue, and assured him that by doing so he might bid adieu to black spirits and white, blue, green, and grey, with all their trumpery. The patient observed the advice, and prospered. His physician, after the interval of a month, received a grateful letter from him, acknowledging the success of his regimen. The greens goblins had disappeared, and with them the unpleasant train of emotions to which their visits had given rise, and the patient had ordered his town-house to be disfurnished and sold, while the furniture was to be sent down to his residence in the country, where he was determined in future to spend his life, without exposing himself to the temptations of town. One would have supposed this a well-devised scheme for health. But, alas! no sooner had the furniture of the London drawing-room been placed in order in the gallery of the old manor-house, than the former delusion returned in full force: the green figurantés, whom the patient's depraved imagination had so long associated with these moveables, came capering and frisking to accompany them, exclaiming with great glee, as if the sufferer should have been rejoiced to see them, [...] "Here we all are--here we all are!" [...] The visionary, if I recollect right, was so much shocked at their appearance, that he retired abroad, in despair that any part of Britain could shelter him from the daily persecution of this domestic ballet.|$|E

5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the <b>band</b> <b>of</b> interest. <b>Figures</b> 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line.

We considered the incompleteness <b>of</b> a Gollin <b>figure</b> {{to be the result}} of its masking by multiplicative noise similar to the texture of transparent windows and opaque elements. The brightness and colour of the opaque elements are identical to the background and size of transparent windows corresponding with the size of fragments <b>of</b> the incomplete <b>figure.</b> In other words, incomplete figures are figures occluded by an 'invisible' mask. The purpose of this work has been to determine the statistical properties of the 'invisible' mask and to show their connection with thresholds <b>of</b> incompleteness <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> at recognition. We have made additional investigations, which show that the incompleteness thresholds depend on the level of similarity <b>of</b> the spatial-frequency <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> the <b>figure</b> and the 'invisible' mask. The thresholds are reduced when the 'invisible' mask changes to a visible one. We presented in psychophysical experiments incomplete figures with two sizes, covering the foveal or macular areas.

5000|$|The {{building}} material {{used in the}} Chennakesava temple is chloritic schist, more commonly known as (soapstone) or potstone, and is essentially a simple Hoysala plan built with extraordinary detail. What differentiates this temple from other Hoysala temples of the same plan is the unusually large size of the basic parts of the temple. The temple is a ekakuta vimana design (single shrine) of 10.5 m by 10.5 m size. A large vestibule connects the shrine to the mandapa (hall) {{which is one of}} the main attractions of the temple. The mandapa has 60 [...] "bays" [...] (compartments). The superstructure (tower or Shikhara) on top of the vimana has been lost over time. The temple is built on a jagati (platform for circumambulation). There is one flight of steps leading to the jagati and another flight of steps to the mantapa. The jagati provides the devotee the opportunity to do a pradakshina (circumambulation) around the temple before entering it. The jagati carefully follows the staggered square design of the mantapa and the star shape of the shrine. The mantapa here was originally an open one. A visitor would have been able to see the ornate pillars of the open mantapa from the platform. According to art critic Gerard Foekema, the mantapa is perhaps the most magnificent one in all of medieval India. The open mantapa was converted into a closed one after about fifty years, during the Hoysala rule. This was done by erecting walls with pierced window screens. The window screens are on top of 2 m high walls. There are twenty eight such windows, with star-shaped perforations and <b>bands</b> <b>of</b> foliage, <b>figures</b> and mythological subjects.

As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule.
