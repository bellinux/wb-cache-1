5000|$|Palissy ware is a 19th-century {{term for}} {{ceramics}} {{produced in the}} style of the famous French potter Bernard Palissy (c. 1510-90), who referred to <b>his</b> own work <b>in</b> the familiar manner as rustique. Palissy's distinctive style of polychrome lead-glazed earthenware in a sombre earth-toned palette, using naturalistic scenes of plants and animals cast from life, was much imitated by other potters <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>lifetime</b> and especially in the 19th century, when pottery in Palissy's style was produced by Charles-Jean Avisseau of Tours, who rediscovered Palissy's techniques <b>in</b> 1843, <b>his</b> relatives the Landais family of Tours, Georges Pull of Paris, Maurice, and Barbizet. Portuguese Palissy ware was produced by the potteries of Mafra, Jose A. Cuhna, Alves, José Francisco de Sousa, Cezar, Herculano Elias, and Augusto Baptista de Carvalho. Twentieth-century reproductions are extremely common. it is now difficult to identify which 16th-century works in the rustique manner are actually from Palissy's own workshop except by comparison with either fragments excavated in 1878 from remains of the grotto that he certainly decorated at the Tuileries Palace for Catherine de' Medici, who called him to Paris in 1566 or from excavations at the site of <b>his</b> Paris workshop <b>in</b> the Palais du Louvre.

40|$|The {{life and}} thought of John Dee (1527 - 1608) have in recent years {{received}} considerable attention from historians. His nineteenth-century reputation as a deluded (and deluding) crank has been dispelled and he is seen now as the proponent of an immensely complex system of philosophy which made important contributions {{to the development of}} mathematics, astronomy, architecture, navigation and applied science. Many claims have been made for the profundity of the influence exerted by Dee and <b>his</b> ideas, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>lifetime</b> and after <b>his</b> death, and a great effort has been made to define his 'world picture' by reference to such formulae as 'Neoplatonism', 'Hermeticism', and 'Rosicrucianism', but while these are valid and significant in all sorts of ways, there has been no clear apprehension of the main focus of his system. The predominant impression of Dee is of an enormously erudite, but intellectually insular man, pursuing a tremendously diffuse range of studies which, while they have important implications for the history of science and ideas, {{do not appear to be}} organised into a consistent, internally - coherent system, directly relevant to the contemporary world.

The analysis will make use of Kerry Sinanan's research into slave narratives and abolitionist literature, Vincent Carretta's writings about Equiano and The Interesting Narrative, as well as Sidonie Smith and Julia Watson's theory of autobiographical writing and their schema of autobiographical acts.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a rhetorical}} biography of Ferdinand Canning Scott Schiller (1864 - 1937), the foremost British proponent of pragmatism {{at the turn}} of the previous century. Beyond reconstructing the development and receptions of Schiller's thoughts, this dissertation brings the resources of rhetorical criticism to bear and focuses, <b>in</b> particular, on <b>his</b> style and its significance <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>lifetime</b> and afterward. While spending most of <b>his</b> career <b>in</b> England, Schiller came <b>in</b> <b>his</b> time to be one of the most widely discussed figures in what is often considered a distinctly American philosophical movement. This rhetorical biography analyzes, in chronological order, the most substantial and often contested arguments that Schiller engaged in so as to promote, first, Jamesian pragmatism and, secondly, his own pragmatic humanism. These arguments were meant to defend the principles of pragmatism and pragmatic humanism against the dominant strains of Idealism then current <b>in</b> <b>both</b> British and American philosophy. But they were also supported by reference to a wide range of topics: psychical research, formal logic, science, religion, and eugenics. This dissertation examines how Schiller's arguments exemplify the positive and negative aspects of the rhetorical category of style. More specifically, this rhetorical biography posits that Schiller's use of the stylistic figure repetition—the reiteration of key claims so as to emphasize their importance and to engage the pathos of the audience—helps to explain why Schiller is now a largely forgotten instigator of pragmatism, conceived herein as both a philosophical concept and a historical movement. This dissertation also demonstrates how traditional methods of rhetorical criticism, often focusing on the set text or oration, can be profitably extended by way of archival materials, public documents, and a focus on the range of arguments offered over the expanse of a subject's career...|$|R

50|$|Fahey's {{writings}} {{have been}} a source of controversy, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lifetime</b> and since. Writing to Joseph MacRory in 1942, Archbishop John Charles McQuaid of Dublin stated thatDr Fahey will certainly not err in doctrine, but he is capable of making statements and suggestions that are not capable of proof by any evidence available to the censors... I have been obliged to watch carefully his remarks upon the Jews. He will frequently err in good judgement, and this error will take the shape of excerpts from newspapers as proof of serious statements, unwise generalisations and, where Jews are concerned, remarks capable of rousing the ignorant or malevolent. In his own Congregation, Fr Fahey is not regarded as a man of balanced judgement. He is a wretched Professor, obscure and laborious.Although Fahey's Maria Duce organisation was initially left to its own devices, Archbishop McQuaid grew less sympathetic to it {{in the latter half of}} the 1950s. He condemned the group for their heavy-handed reaction to requests for an interview from the anti-Catholic American writer Paul Blanshard (whom Bishop McQuaid felt should have been treated courteously despite disagreeing strongly with him). McQuaid went as far as to write to Fahey in 1954 stating that he opposed the latter's association of the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary with his organisation. Fahey died before any response could be made, and the group was disbanded the following year; McQuaid took on the group afterward.|$|E

40|$|Widely held {{as modern}} Chinese literature’s most {{important}} writer, Lu Xun (1881 - 1936) remains {{a figure of}} much controversy, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lifetime</b> and, with Mao Zedong’s (1893 - 1976) advocacy, particularly long after his death. While the study of Lu Xun as a short story writer, essayist, critic, literary historian, and cultural icon thrives on, in our age of transnationalism and interculturality our understanding of Lu is far from complete without taking into account his opinion on Western literature. This paper focuses on Lu’s views on Shakespeare and finds that his reception of the Bard is generally lukewarm and sometimes displeasing. China’s literary circle in the late 1920 s and 1930 s was taken by surprise by Lu’s views, as Lu is one of modern China’s earliest translators of European literature. Besides, {{he is one of}} the first Chinese writers in whose work the name Shakespeare in Chinese transliteration is found. While Lu’s transliterated name for Shakespeare has failed to become definitive, he continued to express his controversial views on Shakespeare. A number of major contemporary writers were caught in the ensuring dispute. By tracing the origin of Lu’s poor opinion on Shakespeare and by investigating the entire saga, this paper fills a gap in Lu Xun study while offers a close scrutiny of the twists and turns in a story of cross-cultural exchange...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. John Foxe (1517 - 87) {{was one of the}} most influential writers of the English Reformation. In the forty years between 1547 and his death, he produced some forty works in English and Latin. However, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>lifetime</b> and since then, he has been principally known for only one of them, The Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs. John Foxe fled to the Continent during the reign of Mary I, and on his return, wrote a history of the English Protestant martyrs from the 14 th century to his own time. Usually known as The Book of Martyrs, it traces the triumph of Protestantism through the sufferings of English Protestants. Some four hundred copies of Foxes editions of 1563, 1570, 1576 and 1583 remain, but most are defective to some extent, and all bear their original imperfections. Although microfilms of all the four original editions were available, and were adequate for general use, they too had their imperfections. The copies selected for filming were damaged and incomplete and many running heads and marginalia were omitted during photography. Moreover, these images were devoid of any commentary or apparatus, and well over a hundred years of Reformation scholarship had elapsed since Pratt completed his work. Also a number of bowdlerised and abbreviated editions had been published in the twentieth century, particularly in the United States, and although there was little danger of these deceiving serious scholars, the proposal suggested that the time was ripe for the full text to reappear with a modern commentary. It had also been recognised for some time that the Acts and Monuments is a major work of sixteenth century scholarship and a significant influence upon the development of the national identity. A reliable scholarly edition was urgently required. In 1993 the British Academy established this project to produce a new edition. Originally, a paper copy was envisaged, however the scale of the project soon became too large to make this feasible. The 1583 edition alone is densely packed with information, including reference to hundreds of sources, some of them imperfectly identified. In scale it runs to nearly three million words. The Committee decided to switch its objective from a print edition to CD-ROM, which in turn would make a variorum edition feasible, embracing all the four original texts. Due to technical developments and innovations in 2002, the committee, with the approval of the British Academy, decided to transfer the publishing medium from CD-ROM to an online edition. Main Topics : This British Academy 'Category One Research Project' has produced a new, definitive edition of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs, based on a textual reconstruction of the four editions published in Foxe's lifetime. It also contains extensive editorial commentaries, information on people and places mentioned in the text, and bibliographical database and a corpus of scholarly essays. Data Contents This resource consists of four kinds of data, namely: 1) 158 *. html files which constitute a selection of all the original website constituents. 2) 12, 058 *. xml files containing information about different textual materials such as transcriptions, editorial comments, and summaries found in books 1 to 12 of all four editions (i. e. 1563, 1570, 1576 and 1583) of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs 3) 2, 472 image *. png files featuring original index tables, pages and woodcuts shown primarily in John Foxe's 1583 edition of the book 4) Eight tabular files containing data on bibliographic scholarly works, publications and other materials related to the Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E
