The first one was to do with members of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), whose members claimed that the scheme was one made for members of the then ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP). As such many members of NDC did not want to register with the scheme. The reverse of all the propaganda that surrounded the scheme at its inception were revisited in 2009 when the NDC took over power.|$|E

25|$|There {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{criticism}} of the methodology used to teach Swedish {{and the lack of}} competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.|$|E

While it was a widely debated topic for many Egyptologists, it had also spread {{to the general public}} as popular culture has come up with many conspiracy theories that played out in movies, TV shows, and fictional books. Author James Patterson has even recently written his own take in his book, The Murder of King Tut. There are many educated and respected Egyptologists as well as trained professionals in other fields who have devoted a lot of time researching Tutankhamun and who have varying beliefs to his cause of death. Some have stood by their theories even in light of new evidence. Some of the theories are better known and supported than others.|$|E

In 1998, Chamberlain returned to Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his #13. Around this time, he has been quoted as saying: [...] "There's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> conversation, since people have been trying to get my jersey number retired, that I have some dislike for the University of Kansas. That is totally ridiculous." ...|$|E

Furthermore, the legs of the stool were called stumps, which adds further credence to the idea that stools were used as early wickets. According to the Churchwarden's Accounts for Great St. Mary's Church of Cambridge (1504–1635), a church stool was sometimes known in the south-east by the Dutch name of [...] "kreckett", this being the same word used for the game by John Derrick in 1597.|$|E

The changes attracted many critics, including the most successful players in Masters history, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Woods claimed that the [...] "shorter hitters are going to struggle." [...] Augusta National chairman Hootie Johnson was unperturbed, stating, [...] "We are comfortable with {{what we are doing}} with the golf course." [...] After a practice round, Gary Player defended the changes, saying, [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> criticisms, but I think unjustly so, now I've played it....

"This Is England", {{much like}} the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been {{drastically}} re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths and football-style chants added to Strummer's incomplete recordings. Although Howard was an adept drummer, drum machines were used for virtually all of the percussion tracks. For the remainder of his life, Strummer largely disowned the album, although he did profess that [...] "I really like 'This Is England' [...] 'North and South' is a vibe." [...] In early 1986, the Clash disbanded. Strummer later described the group's end: [...] "When the Clash collapsed, we were tired. There had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> intense activity in five years. Secondly, I felt we'd run out of idea gasoline. And thirdly, I wanted to shut up and let someone else have a go at it." ...|$|E

Liverpool fans had even chanted Owen's name during the match, singing, [...] "There's only one Michael Owen." [...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important for me, because there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> speculation about me of late and about my position within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated {{the importance of the}} two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he can do and great credit to him. We're the players – it's up to us to play and the management decides which players we have." [...] Carragher confirmed that Liverpool missed their captain Gerrard, but was delighted to win the match despite this.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Deputy Director General, Mark Byford, also {{defended the}} {{decision}} {{on the day of}} the programme, saying: [...] " [...] should have the right to be heard, be challenged, and for the public who take part in Question Time and the viewers to make up their own minds about the views of the BNP. It's not for the BBC to censor and say they can't be on". The BBC's chief political adviser, Ric Bailey, stated after the failed appeal that the BBC [...] "would have been breaking its charter if it had not treated the BNP with impartiality ... We absolutely stand by that judgement, even though there's obviously <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> controversy about it". A senior BBC presenter, John Humphrys, said the decision was [...] "absolutely right". He said: [...] "Why should we be afraid of what they have to say? Free speech is the issue here, and the BBC's obligations." [...] However, broadcasting unions said some of its members would protest at the invitation.|$|E

500|$|In his {{confession}} Lace described {{how he had}} disposed of DeSimone's jewellery by throwing the items on to the railway embankment beneath Copnor Bridge in Portsmouth. In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area {{in an attempt to}} recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items was discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: [...] "It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder there has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. Although {{we have not been able}} to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the suspect it was important we did everything to explore this final aspect of the case." ...|$|E

He said: [...] "There has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> discussion about it: 'Is this the last Iron Man for Robert ?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." [...] In April 2013, Cheadle stated that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, saying, [...] "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. I know there was talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway." [...] In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, [...] "There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth Iron Man."

500|$|Pearl Jam {{commenced}} {{work on a}} {{new album}} following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as [...] "a pretty positive one" [...] and [...] "very intense and spiritual." [...] Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, [...] "There's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed." [...] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles [...] "I Am Mine" [...] and [...] "Save You". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident {{in the presence of}} B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as [...] "Love Boat Captain". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours." [...] The track entitled [...] "Arc" [...] was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.|$|E
