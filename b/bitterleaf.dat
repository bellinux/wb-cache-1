50|$|Vernonia calvoana or <b>bitterleaf,</b> is {{a common}} garden plant in many West African and Central African countries. It is a key {{ingredient}} in ndolé, a national dish of Cameroon.|$|E
50|$|The Waawa {{people eat}} fufu or pounded yam, {{which is known}} locally as utara {{with a variety of}} unique soups e.g. ohé-ede, made with cocoyam,ohé-nsala and ohé-onugbu made with <b>bitterleaf.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Yikyik is a kobold ranger who was prejudiced against halflings, in {{contrast}} to fellow ranger Belkar <b>Bitterleaf's</b> prejudice against kobolds. The intense hatred the two had for each other culminated at the Order vs. Guild battle, where Yikyik was defeated. Belkar appears later wearing what {{he refers to as}} a [...] "swanky new leather hat" [...] made from Yikyik's hide.|$|R
5000|$|Nkolmetet is a {{combined}} word {{of two different}} Beti words Nkol which means hill and the word Metet which {{is a kind of}} edible plant also called in Beti yolyolo. Because of it bitterness, the plant is commonly called in Cameroon Ndole of Ewondo and Duala language; also known as <b>bitterleaf</b> (Vernonia amygdalina).|$|E
5000|$|Egusi soup {{is a kind}} of soup {{thickened}} {{with the}} ground seeds and popular in West Africa, with considerable local variation. [...] Besides the seeds, water, and oil, egusi soup typically contains leaf vegetables, other vegetables, seasonings, and meat. Leaf vegetables typically used for egusi soup include <b>bitterleaf,</b> celosia and spinach. Typical other vegetables include tomatoes and okra. Typical seasonings include chili peppers, onions, and locust beans. Also commonly used are beef, goat, fish, shrimps, or crayfish.|$|E
50|$|In {{return for}} Roy's {{cooperation}} in defeating Xykon, Lord Shojo agreed to grant {{each member of}} the Order of the Stick one favor with the exception of Belkar <b>Bitterleaf,</b> who, having murdered his guard, was released on bail in lieu of specific assistance. Although he was willing to lie to them, he does not appreciate Roy insulting or otherwise criticizing his paladins and wizards, such as the wizard who accidentally teleported them into a Roc's nest instead of Azure City because he was drunk at the time.|$|E
50|$|Among Cameroonian {{specialties}} are brochettes, {{known locally}} as soya (a kind of barbecued kebab made from either chicken, beef, or goat), sangah (a mixture of maize, cassava leaf and palmnut juice, mbanga Soup and kwacoco), eru and water fufu, ndolé (a spicy stew containing <b>bitterleaf</b> greens, meat, shrimp, pork rind, and peanut paste), koki (primarily consisting of black eyed peas and red palm oil), achu or taro (cocoyam fufu with an orange/yellow red palm oil soup) and many others.Curries, soups and fish dishes abound, as well as meats on skewers.Insects are eaten {{in some parts of}} the country (particularly the forested regions).|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} Vernonia, {{including}} V. calvoana, V. amygdalina, and V. colorata, are eaten as leaf vegetables. Common names for these species include <b>bitterleaf,</b> onugbu in the Igbo language, ewuro and ndole. They {{are common in}} most West African and Central African countries. They {{are one of the}} most widely consumed leaf vegetables of Nigeria, where the onugbu soup is a local delicacy of the Igbo people, and of Cameroon, where they are a key ingredient of Ndolé. The leaves have a sweet and bitter taste. They are sold fresh or dried, and are a typical ingredient in egusi soup.|$|E
5000|$|Ogbono soup (bush mango) is a Nigerian dish {{made with}} ground ogbono seeds, with {{considerable}} local variation. The ground ogbono seeds {{are used as}} a thickener, and give the soup a black coloration. [...] Besides seeds, water and palm oil, it typically contains meat, seasonings such as chili pepper, leaf vegetables and other vegetables. Typical leaf vegetables include <b>bitterleaf</b> and celosia. Typical other vegetables include tomatoes and okra. Typical seasonings include chiles, onions, and iru (fermented locust beans). Typical meats include beef, goat, fish, chicken, bush meat, shrimp, or crayfish. It can be eaten with fufu, pounded yam, or with rice. In other countries the soup may be available in packaged prepared form in some markets that specialize in Western African foods. Ogbono soup has a mucilaginous (slimy) texture, similar to okra soup.|$|E
50|$|Belkar <b>Bitterleaf</b> is a Chaotic Evil Halfling Ranger/Barbarian. Belkar is an erratic, casual killer {{driven by}} a variety of selfish impulses. While ostensibly the party's tracker, he is astoundingly bad at most of his class skills, {{including}} tracking. He joined the Order to escape justice from a deadly bar fight in which he knifed fifteen people. The Order does not abandon him, despite his bloodthirsty tendencies, due to Roy's belief that he must keep the violent halfling under control. After Roy is dead, Haley, who becomes the Order's leader, states she'd abandon him if she didn't need all the help she could get. Belkar's loyalty to the Order fluctuates with his mood, and, despite frequently thinking about it, he never actually betrays them. Belkar fights with two daggers. Though he's often believed to be unintelligent, even to himself, he's occasionally shown as cunning if in danger. He later adopts a housecat named Mr. Scruffy to be his animal companion.|$|E
5000|$|Miko Miyazaki was {{a female}} paladin {{and member of the}} Sapphire Guard. She was raised in a monastery and thus had some monk skills in {{addition}} to her paladin abilities. Miko was the most fanatical, powerful, and high-ranking member of the Sapphire Guard. The series' author has admitted that Miko was an intentional take on the [...] "fanatical paladin" [...] RPG stereotype in contrast to the other, more rational Paladins of the Guard. Her fanaticism was so extreme that other members of the Sapphire Guard would send her away on missions just to be rid of her. Miko was sent to capture the Order of the Stick and bring them to Azure City to be tried for destroying one of the five secret gates. After some initial hostilities, due in part to confusion of the Linear Guild's crimes with the Order, Roy And Durkon convinced the party to come peacefully, but tensions erupted after a brush with assassins at the Weary Travellers Inn resulted in great risk destruction and risk to life, partly due to the Order's misbehaviour. Annoyed by Miko's haughty and thankless attitude, Roy reneged on his promise to come peacefully, and Miko used force to drag them back to Azure City in chains. Belkar <b>Bitterleaf</b> escaped captivity just before the trial, and the Order's decision to protect him at the trial's conclusion, just after their acquittal, sealed a deep enmity between her and the Order. Later, when she found out that Xykon's armies were approaching Azure City, she overhear some remarks from the Lich that she interpreted as a sign of collusion with Roy, the Order's leader. On her way back to Azure City to warn Lord Shojo, she caught the tail end of a conversation between Roy and her liege that led her to conclude that Shojo was a traitor, colluding with both Roy and Xykon to overrun the city. In her anger, she killed him, causing her to lose her paladinhood. Miko was then jailed, but escaped during Xykon's attack on the city. In an attempt to keep the Lich from taking over the magical gate, she destroyed it. The resulting explosion killed her, while narrowly allowing Xykon and his lieutenant Redcloak to escape.|$|E
40|$|Polyherbal {{therapy is}} said to be a current {{pharmacological}} principle having the advantage of producing maximum therapeutic efficacy with minimum side effects. We assessed the antidiabetic efficacy and hence the impact on biochemical indices of toxicity by a combination of extracts from neem and <b>bitterleaf.</b> Thirty rats, 25 diabetic and 5 non-diabetic rats, were used for the study. The diabetic rats were divided equally into five groups and respectively treated: saline (diabetic control), extracts from neem and <b>bitterleaf</b> combined, neem only, <b>bitterleaf</b> only and chlorpropamide for a 24 day period. After oral administration of the first dose of extract (400 mg kg - 1 b. w.) and chlorpropamide (4. 286 mg kg - 1 b. w.), blood glucose was monitored in vivo at various time intervals for 9 h, thereafter daily administration continued for 24 days. Whereas single dose treatment with neem only showed peak reduction (28. 56 %) an hour after, treatments with combined extracts, <b>bitterleaf</b> and chlorpropamide had their peak reductions all at the 7 th hour (24. 78, 47. 31 and 60. 51 %, respectively). Percentage reductions in blood glucose relative to their initial values at the end of treatment were 71. 05, 44. 95, 88. 63 and 75. 83 for combined extract, neem, <b>bitterleaf</b> and chlorpropamide respectively. The decrease in blood glucose for the groups treated with combined extracts and <b>bitterleaf</b> only compared well (p< 0. 01) with chlorpropamide and non diabetic control, but not with neem alone. Determination of markers of hepatotoxicity in serum including GPT and GOT activities, total protein, albumin and urea indicated that, of the four treatments, neem provides the best protection against hepatic dysfunction. In the group treated with combined extracts these alternate selective advantages of neem and <b>bitterleaf</b> were expressed as a positive synergy, hence more beneficial than individual treatments...|$|E
40|$|Nitrosatability {{of dried}} Nigerian {{vegetables}} and spices was investigated under simulated gastric conditions. N-Nitroso-dimethylamine (NDMA) {{was the only}} volatile nitrosamine found above the preformed level except in ugwu where N-nitroso-piperidine (2. 3 ppb) was also detected. The lowest NDMA value of 0. 4 ppb was found in <b>bitterleaf</b> while onions had the highest level (14. 7 ppb) of nitrosation. The results suggest that, under endogenous conditions, nitrosation of these foodstuffs could be an important contributory factor in cancer aetiolog...|$|E
40|$|Vernonia amygdalina (<b>Bitterleaf),</b> Eucalyptus citriodora (Eucalypt) and Phyllanthus amarus (Schum) were {{investigated}} for their antibacterial properties against pure cultures of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp. The isolates {{were obtained from}} dept of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital. Water and Ethanol {{were used in the}} crude extractions of the active constituents of the plants. Broth dilution and Agar diffusion methods were used in determining the antibacterial effects of the different plant extracts on the test organisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the water extracts on the test organisms was 50 mg/ml while that of the ethanolic extract ranged between 6. 25 - 50 mg/ml. Similarly the diameters of zones of inhibition of the plant extracts at concentration of 100 mg/ml ranged between 3. 0 - 14. 0 mm and 3. 0 - 18. 0 mm for the water and ethanolic extracts respectively on the test organisms. Water extracts of vernonia amygdalina (<b>Bitterleaf)</b> and Schum (Phyllanthus amarus) were not effective on majority of the test organisms. Klebsiella sp. was not inhibited by the water extracts at the test concentrations. The Ethanolic extracts of Eucalyptus citriodora (Eucalypt) were most effective on all the test organisms. The least and the most susceptible organisms to the extracts were Shigella sp. and E. coli respectively. The {{results of this study suggest}} the possibility of using the ethanolic extracts of these plants in treating diseases caused by the test organisms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bitterleaf</b> (Vernonia spp.) is, {{despite its}} common name, {{a very popular}} leafy vegetable, {{commonly}} found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Its rising popularity in and outside its region of origin, plus its scarcity during the dry season, has encouraged the Cameroon training and research centre CFAPP to develop a practical method for drying and conserving the leaves.
