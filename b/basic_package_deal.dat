40|$|This is {{a thesis}} about {{legislative}} <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> in the European Union {{and their effects}} on EU policy outcomes. It analyzes inter-chamber legislative exchange between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The key argument is that <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> increase the legislative influence of the European Parliament across legislative procedures and policy areas. <b>Package</b> <b>deals</b> allow Member States to establish control over the financial aspects of legislation and to ensure its adoption without delay. In exchange, the European Parliament gains further institutional powers and access {{to some of the}} EU's most salient policy areas. Legislative bargaining between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament is analyzed across all EU legislation, completed in the period 1 May 1999 - 30 April 2007. The argument is tested empirically through the quantitative analysis of 1465 co-decision and consultation proposals, 19 policy areas and 8 years. Five in-depth case studies complement the findings. The results indicate that the use of <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> in the EU is conditional on the distributive nature of legislative proposals, and their urgency. In turn, <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> and urgency affect legislative outcomes. <b>Package</b> <b>deals</b> and delay increase the EP's legislative influence in the consultation procedure. <b>Package</b> <b>deals</b> and Council impatience increase the EP's legislative influence in the co-decision procedure. Overall, <b>package</b> <b>deals</b> extend the EP's legislative influence in distributive policy areas and increase its institutional powers...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{construction}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important subdivision of construction industry, necessitating advanced procurement methods {{in order to accommodate}} changing requirements. Commonly, residential construction demand is met by the informal sector of construction industry. With the changing environments, a novel trend of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts is spreading in the context bringing in formalities to the residential construction projects. <b>Package</b> <b>deal</b> is a developed procurement method with unique characteristics. However, in selecting an appropriate procurement method for a specific housing construction project, proper understanding of characteristics of available procurement options are utmost of importance. Therefore, this research aimed to elucidate the suitability of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts for residential building construction, against time, cost and quality benefits. Study identified 43 time, cost, and quality related expectations through a comprehensive literature survey, which residential construction clients would expect to be born of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts. The factors were ranked against industry experts' view and further, tested via a survey with a sample of clients with <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> and informal construction experience. Data were analysed for medians and standard deviations in to rank the factors considering the reliability. Consequently, experts appreciated time and cost benefits of <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts over informal construction. Importantly, projects start quickly with known early commitments under <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> contracts. However, informal construction offers better quality with attractive finished products. Therefore, the <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> is suitable for the clients, who are concerned of time and cost benefits, while informal {{construction is}} suitable for the client’s with prime concern of quality benefits...|$|R

40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} right-of-first-refusal jurisprudence {{has been the}} effect of an acceptable third-party offer for a package of properties, a portion of which is burdened. In determining the effect of such <b>package</b> <b>deals,</b> courts have primarily relied on principles related to the nature and operation of rights of first refusal. Unfortunately, this approach has led different courts to reach disparate and inconsistent results. The problems posed by the <b>package</b> <b>deal,</b> of course, could be remedied by the parties themselves through a provision addressing the effect of such a transaction on the rightholder 2 ̆ 7 s privilege. The provision would answer whether the <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> is to trigger the right of first refusal, and if so, whether the rightholder {{would be allowed to}} exercise her privilege on the burdened portion alone or on the entire package. There is, however, every indication that in many circumstances, the costs of agreeing to a provision addressing the somewhat remote possibility of a dispute arising out of a <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> will outweigh its benefits. As a result, parties to right-of-first-refusal agreements will continue to omit a provision addressing the possibility of a <b>package</b> <b>deal.</b> Therefore, a consistent and uniform judicial treatment of the <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> is desirable. The most appropriate solution is for the courts to adopt a default rule that would apply to all instances of the <b>package</b> <b>deal,</b> unless the parties to a right-of-first-refusal agreement contracted around the rule explicitly. In terms of fairness and efficiency, the most appropriate default rule is to require an owner who receives an acceptable offer for a <b>package</b> <b>deal</b> to provide the rightholder with an opportunity to purchase the burdened portion of the package at a reasonable price. If the owner fails to do so, the rightholder should be entitled to enforce her privilege by purchasing the burdened property at a price determined by the court to be fair and reasonable...|$|R

40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> {{of health}} {{services}} is {{a key component of}} a public and private mix in health care. But to develop a <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> is a difficult task due to all constraints of public demand, health budget, and the population ability to pay.

Therefore there are services that need to be left outside the <b>basic</b> <b>package</b> and to be covered with private schemes.
