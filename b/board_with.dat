If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the <b>board</b> <b>with</b> a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

He {{was found guilty of}} financial impropriety by a league investigation, leaving the <b>board</b> <b>with</b> no other choice but to terminate his contract. Stewart Houston came in as caretaker and revitalised the squad, taking Arsenal to the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. The Arsenal board subsequently hired Bruce Rioch, on a three-year deal in June 1995. Rioch's tenure lasted just 61 weeks and in his only season at the club, he guided Arsenal to fifth position, which came with a UEFA Cup spot. Rioch was sacked in August 1996, amid reports of disagreements with vice-chairman David Dein.|$|E

In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate.

On the first play of their drive, Nevada took a 21-0 lead on a 28-yard touchdown pass to Sudfeld.

5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating <b>board,</b> <b>with</b> his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E

One play later, Tech was on the <b>board</b> <b>with</b> a touchdown pass from quarterback Michael Vick. By {{the end of the}} first quarter, Tech had taken a 14–0 lead. Clemson was able to close the gap to 14–10 in the second quarter, but Tech added another touchdown before halftime to take a 21–10 lead into the second half.|$|E

3000|$|By contrast, {{there were}} {{considerable}} discrepancies between the boards {{in the analysis}} and validation samples {{in the case of}} log-sector class 2. As Fig.  8 a shows, a three-cluster solution was distinct for the validation sample as well and therefore deriving the same number of groups for the validation sample as for the analysis sample did not conflict with a feasible interpretation of the cluster tree. However, the visual impression of the derived board compositions markedly differed for two of the three groups. While a group comprising only clear or near knot-free boards was established for the validation sample as well, a good separation between <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> large sound knots and <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> smaller dead knots was not accomplished. As compositions 2 and 3 in Fig.  8 b illustrate, <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> predominantly large sound knots and <b>boards</b> <b>with</b> black knots were mixed in those groups with some near clear boards distributed over both.|$|R
