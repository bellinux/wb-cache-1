Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "A–", noting that [...] "'The Fire' {{is not the}} second season’s funniest half-hour, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> it for its simplicity." [...] Writing that the episode bore {{similarities}} to a bottle episode, he enjoyed {{the way that the}} conversations among the employees allowed the audience to more fully understand all of the individual characters better. Adams also praised the interaction between Carell and Novak, as well as the performance of Wilson, which he called [...] "unsettling".|$|E
500|$|Sue's {{philosophical}} {{argument with}} Emma about religion {{is the scene}} that Murphy is [...] "most proud to {{have been involved with}} in [...] entire career." [...] Explaining Sue's stance on religion, he stated: [...] "Sue's an atheist, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> that she doesn't want to be. She and [...] are both saying to the world, 'Prove us wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God. Murphy felt {{it would have been easy}} to have Kurt sing an anti-religious song, but instead chose to have him sing about his faith in love.|$|E
500|$|Jackson had {{publicly}} {{stated that}} he was proud to be black. He also {{wrote a letter to}} photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: [...] "Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it reminds me that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color." ...|$|E

500|$|Howarth said of {{starring}} on a soap opera, [...] "Every actor at {{one time}} passes through daytime. I wouldn't have said yes to the offer if I didn't want to stay a while on daytime." [...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool." [...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 2007, Abrams {{accepted}} Paramount's {{offer to}} direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer. He explained that he had decided {{to direct the}} film because, after reading the script, he realized that he [...] "would be so agonizingly envious of whoever stepped in and directed the movie." [...] Orci and Kurtzman said that their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story. Abrams noted that, during filming, he had been nervous [...] "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with dialogue about 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet' [...] I knew this would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable. I didn't love Kirk and Spock when I began this journey – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> them now." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik. He previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome", and the sixth season episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards". In an interview, Sapochnik spoke about the scenes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which mostly lacked any dialogue, saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of smart and witty dialogue. This is something that Game of Thrones is probably quite famous for and rightly so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> non-verbal film making more than anything probably." [...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, this is truly wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to try my hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I really hit the jackpot this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|Asked in July 2006 {{what she}} hoped for Kyla {{in the long}} run, Ayola responded: [...] "Most of all I’d {{like to see her}} laugh, big belly laughs as she has not done much of that! ...I also would like her to find a man that she is with not just because he is {{attractive}} but someone who can work her out and understand her". [...] Several months after this interview, the character was romantically linked to newcomer and former guest star, general surgical consultant Abra Durant, played by Adrian Edmondson. Edmondson departed from and returned to the show several times, with Kyla and Abra breaking up and reuniting on multiple occasions. Asked in February 2008 whether the two would ever get back together, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." [...] The two ultimately left Holby together, moving to Ghana.|$|E
500|$|Between the Restoration of {{the monarchy}} in 1660 {{and the end of}} the 17th century, {{classical}} ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson. Thomas Rymer, for example, condemned Shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic. Nevertheless, poet and critic John Dryden rated Shakespeare highly, saying of Jonson, [...] "I admire him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> Shakespeare". For several decades, Rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to Shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius. A series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of Samuel Johnson in 1765 and Edmond Malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation. By 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad. Among those who championed him were the writers Voltaire, Goethe, Stendhal, and Victor Hugo.|$|E
500|$|Warner {{publicly}} supported Richard Nixon {{during the}} 1960 presidential election {{and paid for}} full-page ads in The New York Times [...] "to proclaim why Nixon should be elected". [...] In the wake of Nixon's loss to John F. Kennedy, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the Los Angeles Palladium {{in honor of the}} president-elect. [...] Several weeks later, Warner {{received a phone call from}} the new chief executive's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan's book, PT 109, a bestseller concerning John Kennedy's exploits during World War II. [...] "I don't think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon," [...] Warner said later. [...] "I would have voted for both of them if I could. [...] You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> everybody." [...] In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the Vietnam War.|$|E

500|$|... "S" [...] {{was written}} by Ester Dean in {{collaboration}} with the song's producers, Stargate and Sandy Vee. Dean explained its conception and the sexually suggestive lyrics to Gail Mitchell of Billboard: [...] "The first thing that came to me was 'Come on, come on.' I'm thinking, 'I don't know what in the hell this is about to be.' And I remembered I'd seen something that said, 'Sticks and stones may break my bones.' Then came 'But chains and whips excite me.' When people have a great track that speaks to me, it feels like it already has a story in it". Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day you are who you are and I love you that way." [...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> you like a brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she is never going away. While singing the lines [...] "Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / It feels so special / It feels so good" [...] she admits [...] "liking afternoon delights".|$|E
500|$|Abra, {{aided by}} a {{returned}} Ric, {{decided to go ahead}} with the operations anyway, and secured the use of Kellar theatre at night from Clifford. [...] However, events come to a head when they received a charity patient in episode [...] "Duty of Care" [...] chaperoned by Abra's father, Cecil. [...] Having previously told Kyla his father was dead, Abra attempted to hide his identity from her, but she was furious to discover the truth. He placated her briefly, but was so worried when his father collapsed with ill-health that he ruined a social services meeting to decide whether her son may be returned from foster care. [...] They rowed bitterly, and soon thereafter Abra's father died. [...] He decided to take over the running of the charity in his father's place, and once more departed from Holby, again leaving Kyla behind. When asked whether the two characters would ever get back together, following Abra's second abandoment, Ayola responded: [...] "He treated Kyla like dirt, so I don’t know if she’ll forgive him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> working with Ade – he’s a gorgeous man." ...|$|E

500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible.
