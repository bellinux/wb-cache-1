5|$|Cariappa {{was married}} in March 1937, in Secunderabad, to Muthu Machia, a forest officer's daughter. Though their married life was happy initially, later, {{due to an}} age gap of almost 17 years, ideological differences, and Cariappa's {{professional}} commitments, their marriage <b>broke</b> <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> September 1945, the couple separated without any formal divorce. Three years later Muthu died in an accident.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{picketing}} on {{most days}} with his fellow Lost writers, Carlton Cuse, {{a member of the}} WGA negotiating committee, continued to oversee post-production in late November.

5|$|On 7 January 2010 a Brussels-London train <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the Channel Tunnel, {{resulting}} in three other trains failing {{to complete their}} journeys.

5|$|The Princess Theatre Society, while promising, {{failed to}} {{convince}} the Old Strathcona Foundation that it was capable of profitably managing the theatre, and negotiations <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> April 1996.

5|$|These {{negotiations}} <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> 2005, when {{neither side}} could {{agree on the}} research protocol and the research project was cancelled.

5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1979, the Chinese People's Liberation Army {{crossed the}} Vietnamese border, {{withdrawing}} on 5 March after a two-week campaign which devastated northern Vietnam and briefly threatened Hanoi. Both China (40,000) and Vietnam (over 20,000) suffered heavy losses. Peace talks <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> December 1979 and both China (400,000) and Vietnam (600,000) began a major build-up of forces along the border.

Miller was wicketless against Worcestershire, but succeeded with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 220 {{in just over}} six hours. He then scored 159notout against Yorkshire. At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the week of May, and the media began to speculate that he could score 1000runs in one month, something {{that had been done}} on a tour only by Bradman.|$|E

Razer's arm sliced into S3's weapon controls, stopping the disc, which allowed Razer to dominate the fight and win on a judges' decision.|$|E
5|$|Talks between Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs over renewal {{terms for}} the highly lucrative Pixar-Disney {{distribution}} deal <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> January 2004. Jobs in particular disagreed with Eisner's insistence that sequels {{such as the}} then in-development Toy Story 3 (2010) would not count against the number of films required in the studio's new deal. To that end, Disney announced the launching of Circle 7 Animation, a division of Feature Animation which would have produced sequels to the Pixar films, while Pixar began shopping for a new distribution deal.|$|E

5|$|The NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship (Campeonato Mundial Historico de Peso Semicompleto de la NWA in Spanish) is a {{professional}} wrestling championship promoted by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). CMLL had held the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship for over 48 years, when {{the relationship between the}} promotion and National Wrestling Alliance <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> March 2010. Blue Demon Jr., the president of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, telling them to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they were no longer part of the NWA.

5|$|The union between Norway and Sweden, {{imposed by}} the Great Powers in 1814, had been under {{considerable}} strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own consular service. Nansen, although not by inclination a politician, had spoken out on the issue on several occasions in defence of Norway's interests. It seemed, early in the 20th century that agreement {{between the two countries}} might be possible, but hopes were dashed when negotiations <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by Christian Michelsen, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|This {{community}} {{also saw}} close collaboration between architects, specialist structural engineers, and building contractors emerge {{on the new}} skyscraper projects. Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on {{the appearance of the}} skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built. Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the D. H. Burnham & Company, for example, felt like a small factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff.|$|E

60|$|When {{half the}} villagers had safely {{undergone}} the ordeal, the excitement, {{because of its}} repression, was painfully intense.

5|$|A leading {{member of}} the Yorkshire team which {{achieved}} {{a high level of}} success in the time he played, Macaulay was a volatile character who played aggressively. He left a job at a bank to become a professional cricketer, making his first-class debut aged 23 as a fast bowler. Meeting limited success, he altered style to deliver off spin in addition to his pace bowling. This proved so effective that he was chosen to play for England in Test matches. However, his perceived poor attitude towards the game, and an unsuccessful match in the 1926 Ashes probably prevented him playing more Tests. His form slumped following injuries in the late 1920s, but a recovery in the early 1930s led to a recall by England, although he <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> his second match back. Another injury in 1934 made cricket difficult for him and his first-class career ended in 1935, although he continued playing club cricket until the Second World War. A pilot officer in the Royal Air Force, he died of pneumonia on active service in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in April, Atlanta was {{decommissioned}} in Philadelphia on 21 June 1865 {{and placed}} in reserve at League Island. She was sold to Sam Ward on 4 May 1869 for the price of $25,000 and subsequently delivered to representatives of Haiti on 8 December by Sydney Oaksmith, a lawyer who had received an advance of $50,000 on her purchase price of $260,000. The ship was briefly seized by the Customs Service, possibly for violations of neutrality laws as she had just loaded four large guns and a number of recruits for the forces of Sylvain Salnave, President of Haiti, who was embroiled in a civil war. Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs. The ship, now renamed either Triumph or Triumfo, departed on 18 December 1869 and vanished en route, apparently sinking with the loss of all hands, either off Cape Hatteras or the Delaware Capes.|$|E
5|$|Maloney and Smythe's {{most famous}} horse Wonder Where, {{also led to}} {{the breakup of the}} partnership. Wonder Where, named by Maloney, was bred at Frank Selke's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, Wonder Where had an {{outstanding}} season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing Wonder Where and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse <b>broke</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.|$|E
