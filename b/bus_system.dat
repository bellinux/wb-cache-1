5|$|Local bus {{transportation}} {{is provided by}} Broward County Transit (BCT), the county <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> BCT provides for connections with the bus systems {{in other parts of}} the metropolitan area: Metrobus in Dade County and Palm Tran in Palm Beach County. Tri-Rail, a commuter rail system, connects the major cities and airports of South Florida. In November 2006, Broward County voters rejected a one-cent-per-hundred sales tax increase intended to fund transportation projects such as light rail and expansion of the <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Snohomish County {{established}} {{its public}} transportation benefit area (PTBA), {{the first in}} the state, after municipal corporations for public transportation were added to the Revised Code of Washington by the Washington State Legislature in 1975. The PTBA plan for a countywide <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> was approved during a general election on June 1, 1976, funded by a three-tenths increase of the sales tax rate in member cities. Two previous attempts to establish a <b>bus</b> <b>system,</b> under the Snohomish County Transportation Authority (SNOTRAN) in 1974, were rejected by voters from the entirety of Snohomish County. Heavy opposition came from the residents of Everett because of the high sales tax rate and planned absorption of Everett Transit, acquired by the city in 1969, forcing the SCPTBA to exclude Everett in its successful attempt at creating a <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> SCPTBA Public Transit began operating in the cities of Brier, Edmonds, Lynnwood, Marysville, Mountlake Terrace, Snohomish and Woodway on October 4, 1976, using 18 leased GMC buses on seven routes carrying 6,414 passengers without fares during the first week.|$|E

5|$|WMATA's <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an agreed price, on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a publicly owned <b>bus</b> <b>system,</b> and requested takeover.|$|E

5|$|In February 1987, Greyhound Lines' new {{ownership}} and the ATU {{agreed on a}} new, 3-year contract. In June 1987, Greyhound Lines acquired Trailways, Inc. (formerly Continental Trailways), the largest member of the rival National Trailways <b>Bus</b> <b>System,</b> effectively consolidating into a national bus service. Greyhound was required by the ICC, in their action approving the merger, to maintain coordinated schedules with other scheduled service operators in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Greyhound Lines {{acquired}} two more {{members of the}} National Trailways <b>Bus</b> <b>System.</b> The company purchased Carolina Trailways in 1997, followed by the intercity operations of Southeastern Trailways in 1998. Following the acquisitions, {{most of the remaining}} members of the Trailways System began interlining cooperatively with Greyhound, discontinued their scheduled route services, diversified into charters and tours, or went out of business altogether.|$|E

There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in the valley {{is a serious problem}} during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> operates year-round in the valley, and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
5|$|The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority (EMTA) {{operates}} the city's transit <b>bus</b> <b>system,</b> {{known as the}} 'e'. Buses run {{seven days a week}} in the city, with trips out {{to other parts of the}} county occurring a couple times a week. Intercity buses providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland and Pittsburgh are operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the Intermodal Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street.|$|E
5|$|The Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line's Scarborough station offers direct {{service to}} New York's Grand Central Terminal, {{and is the}} primary public {{transport}} to the city.

5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the agency, the only means of {{transportation}} were bullock-carts known as jhatkas along with palanquins. The roads connecting Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars. From the early 20th century onwards, bullock-carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles and motor vehicles, while motor buses were the main means of private road transportation. Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers, operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910. The first organised <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928. The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public-owned bus and motor services. Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} one of the most {{extensive}} bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester region radiating from the city. In 2011, 80% of public transport journeys in Greater Manchester were made by bus, amounting to 220 million passenger journeys by bus each year. Following deregulation in 1986, the <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> was taken over by GM Buses, which after privatisation was split into GM Buses North and GM Buses South and at a later date these were taken over by First Greater Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester respectively. First Greater Manchester also operates a three route zero-fare bus service, called Metroshuttle, which carries 2.8 million commuters a year around Manchester's business districts. Stagecoach Manchester is the Stagecoach Group's largest subsidiary and operates around 690 buses.|$|E
50|$|CANalyzer is an {{analysis}} software tool from Vector Informatik GmbH.

5|$|Community Transit's {{planning}} for limited-stop bus service, which later evolved into bus rapid transit, {{began in the}} 1990s, with proposals to build bus lanes on State Route 99 between 145th Street NE in Shoreline and Casino Road (near State Route 526) in Everett. Sound Transit was established in 1996 as a regional transit authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express <b>bus</b> <b>system,</b> but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community Transit. Sound Transit funded the construction of business access and transit lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the ground for a future bus rapid transit line.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Upper Peninsula Transportation Authority (EUPTA) {{operates}} the Drummond Island Ferry across the De Tour Passage {{in addition to}} two other ferries and the regional rural <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> for Luce and Chippewa counties. As part of the service between De Tour and Drummond Island, EUPTA operates up to three different vessels: the SS Drummond Islander, SS Drummond Islander III and the SS Drummond Islander IV. , fares start at $12 per car and increase based {{on the size of}} the vehicle transported, including a fuel surcharge. Passenger fares are $2 for adults and $1 for seniors or students; the vehicle driver's fare is included in the vehicle charge. Ferries leave Drummond Island at 10 minutes after the hour, from De Tour at 20 minutes to the hour, and run most of the day; some crossing times are only operated seasonally. M-134 is one of two highways in Michigan to use a ferry connection; the other is US10 between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|While {{extensive}} {{technical studies}} and the raising of finance for the project were in progress, the city expanded significantly resulting in a twofold rise in population and a fivefold {{rise in the number}} of vehicles between 1981 and 1998. Consequently, traffic congestion and pollution soared, as an increasing number of commuters took to private vehicles with the existing <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> unable to bear the load. An attempt at privatising the bus transport system in 1992 merely compounded the problem, with inexperienced operators plying poorly maintained, noisy and polluting buses on lengthy routes, resulting in long waiting times, unreliable service, extreme overcrowding, unqualified drivers, speeding and reckless driving. To rectify the situation, the Government of India and the Government of Delhi jointly set up a company called the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 3 May 1995, with E. Sreedharan as the managing director.|$|E
