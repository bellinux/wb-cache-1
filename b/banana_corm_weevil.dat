The first incident of C. sordidus was detected in Kpg. Remun, Gedung, Serian where 90 % of the banana plants were infested. An on farm trial to evaluate the effect of chemical spraying at plant collar and trapping was carried out. Untreated plot served as the control. Only chemical spraying at the plant collar showed significant reduction of weevil damage to the plant. Nevertheless the percentage of damage was still high.

Researchers in Hawaii found that a hot-water treatment at 50°C for 10 minutes was enough to kill all nematodes in a corm 2-6 inches thick. Soil solarization, or heating and insulating of the soil, can cause nematode death although heat may not penetrate deep enough to kill all nematodes. Cover crops such as sunn hemp and some species of marigold may reduce the amount of spiral nematodes in the soil prior to banana establishment. [...] Nematicides are also an option.

40|$|Among {{the species}} of banana borers, black weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) {{is the most}} {{economically}} important pest in Costa Rica and worldwide. The control of C. sordidus in intensive production systems is mainly based on application of insecticides; therefore the search for biological alternatives, {{such as the use}} of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), is needed. The susceptibility of Cosmopolites sordidus to Heterorhabditis atacamensis CIANE 07 was evaluated. The effect of inoculating H. atacamensis on larvae and adults of C. sordidus, in vitro and in artificially infected corms, was evaluated. Larvae inoculated with EPN had a mortality of 88 % on the second day and 100 % on the third day; no mortality was observed in adults. The treatments of 100, 500 and 1000 IJ. larvae- 1 showed statistically significant differences from the control and theLD 50 was 52 IJ. larvae- 1.

40|$|An on-farm {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of pheromone trap density on {{the population of the}} banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Col., Curculionidae) was conducted in Masaka district, Uganda. The pheromone used was Cosmolure+, a commercially available weevil aggregation pheromone. Forty-two farms were assigned to one of three treatments: 0, 4 and 8 pheromone traps/ha. Pheromone lures were changed monthly at which time the traps were moved to a different location within the stand. Adult weevil population densities were estimated by using mark and recapture methodology at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 21 months, while damage to the <b>banana</b> <b>corm</b> was assessed at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 21 months {{since the start of the}} experiment. Pheromone trap captures were generally low: about 10 weevils per trap per month. There were no significant differences in mean catches of C. sordidus per trap per month except for February 2002 when doubling the pheromone trap density decreased weevil catches. Although not significant, decreased efficiency was also the trend in higher trap densities over all the data sets.

40|$|Bananas (Musa spp.) {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} important staple food crops in Africa. Two major groups of bananas exist in Africa: the East African highland banana (EAHB, AAA) in East and Central Africa, and the plantains (AAB) in West Africa. Neither of these groups has been affected by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) race 1, which is the primary fungal pathogen in the continent for banana. The susceptibility of EAHB and plantains to Foc tropical race 4 (TR 4) is unknown, and was the focus of this study. A collection of 14 genetically diverse EAHB and plantain cultivars were evaluated in China and The Philippines to determine field resistance to Foc TR 4. A field heavily infested with TR 4 was used in Guangzhou, China, and another one in Davao City in The Philippines. Disease incidence was determined according to leaf yellowing, pseudostem splitting and confirmed rhizome discoloration. The fungus was also re-isolated from diseased materials and identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Foc TR 4 -specific primers. All EAHB and plantain cultivars, except EAHB 'Ibwi', proved to be resistant to the tropical strain of Foc race 4, with disease incidence ranging from 0 - 5 % only. In The Philippines, 'Ibwi' developed Fusarium wilt at an incidence of 32 % compared to 46 % for 'Williams' and 79 % for 'Grand Naine's (both AAA genome, Cavendish subgroup). Similar results were observed in China where most cultivars were severely affected by the <b>corm</b> <b>weevil.</b> Our preliminary results indicate that African bananas are less vulnerable to Foc TR 4 compared with some susceptible cultivars in Asia.

40|$|In Africa, {{plantain}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important starchy food and cash crops. Nonetheless, one of the major constraints for its production was the unavailability of healthy planting materials at planting time. This constraint could be lifted using the cloning of planting materials via the in vitro micropropagation or in vivo macropropagation techniques. Shelled corms from four cultivars, known as PITA 3, FHIA 21, ORISHELE and CORNE 1, were used. Three treatments differing in three hormonal concentrations, especially 20. 0, 30. 0 and 40. 0 mg L- 1 were tested. The control one was hormone free. Tested treatments were laid out in a split plot design. The decorticated <b>banana</b> <b>corms</b> were sprayed twofold at 2 weeks interval with BAP solution when placed in sterilized soil in high humidity plastic tunnel. It emerged from results, regarding BAP concentration effect, that BAP treatment with 40 mg L- 1 significantly reduced the emergence time of shoots at 20 days as against 25. 1, 28. 3 and 28. 5 for the 2 tested other treatments as well as control, respectively. Likewise, the concentrations 40. 0 mg L- 1 both recorded the largest number of sprouted buds per corm and number of shoots per corm. With respect to banana cultivar effect, PITA 3 showed the largest number of shoots per corm. Basing on such findings, it is concluded that MSD technique combined with BAP at 40. 0 mg L- 1 is a suitable technique for improving of the in vivo macropropagation of plantain.

40|$|Crop {{sanitation}} (removal and chopping of residue corms and pseudostems following plant harvest) {{has been}} recommended as a 'best bet' means of reducing banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), populations. However, {{it has been}} unclear when such practices should be carried out and what types of residues should be destroyed. Therefore, trials were conducted in Uganda to determine C. sordidus distribution, timing of attack, and oviposition on crop residues and growing plants. Assessments were performed in on-station trials on different aged standing and prostrate residues by destructive sampling. Similar {{data were collected from}} farmers' fields maintained at low, moderate, and high levels of sanitation. In the on-station trial, oviposition occurred on up to 120 -day-old residues, although most occurred within 30 days of harvest. In a second on-station experiment, oviposition on standing residues was not significantly affected by residue age. By contrast, oviposition on prostrate residues was two times higher on 4 -week-old than on 2 -week-old residues, while the number of larvae on 8 -week-old residues was three times higher than on 2 -week-old residues. The number of adults was twice as high on 16 -week-old residues as that on 2 -week-old residues for both prostrate and standing residues. Farmers' fields maintained at high sanitation had 50 % fewer eggs per residue than farms with low sanitation levels. In general, the number of immatures per residue was 50 % higher on <b>banana</b> <b>corms</b> than on pseudostems.

40|$|Radopholus similis {{is one of}} the key pests {{of banana}} in the East African Highlands and in the world. Although control of this pest has mainly relied on the use of clean {{planting}} material, re-infestation of plants in the field remains a critical concern. Alternative management options such as the use of fungal endophytes may be used to provide protection and extend plant life. In this study, a total of 35 endophytic Fusarium isolates were screened for the production of secondary metabolites antagonistic to R. similis in culture. Undiluted and diluted culture filtrates were tested against motile stages of R. similis and eggs. Tests were conducted using culture filtrates of the fungal isolates grown in <b>banana</b> <b>corm</b> broth. All isolates tested demonstrated some level of in vitro antagonistic activity on the mobility of R. similis mixed stages (males, females and juveniles). The percentage of immobilized nematodes increased with increase in the length of exposure time to culture filtrates. After 24 hrs exposure, up to 100 % of nematodes were immobilized compared to 26. 5 % in control treatments. Mortality of mixed stages of R. similis exposed to culture filtrates for 24 hrs, followed by rinsing with sterile distilled water, demonstrated that the effects of culture filtrate treatment were irreversible, as nematodes did not recover and were considered dead. Nematode mortality rates after 24 -hr exposure periods ranged from 76. 4 % to 100. 0 %. The effects of culture filtrates on R. similis motile stages increased with increasing culture filtrate concentration. Culture filtrates also demonstrated inhibitory effects on hatching of R. similis eggs. Radopholus similis males were more sensitive to culture filtrate treatment than females. The results obtained demonstrate the potential for using endophytic Fusarium isolates as biological control agents against R. similis and/or toxic derivatives as potential nematicides against the nematode.

We also measured the effect of the cover crop on the damage done to <b>corms</b> by <b>weevil</b> larvae and on banana fruit biomass. The addition of the cover crop reduced numbers of mature C. sordidus adults but failed to reduce damage to corms. The proportion of young adults, which reflects survival of eggs and larvae, was higher in cover crop plots than in bare soil plots and was negatively correlated with the abundance of the earwig Euborellia caraibea. Fruit biomass was lower in cover crop plots, perhaps because of competition between the banana crop and the cover crop. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), is {{the most}} {{important}} constraint to banana production in East African highlands. For most resource-poor farmers in the region, biological control is the only viable option because it requires little or no cash investment. I investigated patterns of predation by natural enemies of the banana weevil in its presumed native range in Indonesia to determine if there were natural enemies that could be imported to control the pest in Africa. Work was also done in Uganda to determine if predatory insects already present in local banana farming systems could be better conserved to produce banana weevil control. ^ Through farm surveys in Indonesia, I confirmed existing reports that banana weevil damage is low in Sumatra and Java. However, I found no evidence of parasitism from 25, 000 eggs and 3600 larvae collected from seven diverse geographical locations. The adult and larvae of the histerid, Plaesius javanus Erichson, were found to be important predators of C. sordidus. P. javanus larva entered tunnels of plants, presumably in search of banana weevil stages. This predator should be imported to Uganda for establishment as a classical biological control agent of the banana weevil. ^ Experiments in Uganda showed that destruction of crop residues in bananas, as recommended for weevil control and practiced by some farmers, reduced predator numbers on farms, reduced predator: prey ratios and had no benefit to the plant with respect to damage prevention. Instead, I demonstrated that residue presence, through maintaining high predator: prey ratios, offsets damage to plants that would otherwise occur from increased numbers of banana weevils. ^ Ants are the major predatory group now present in banana farming systems in Uganda. Surveys in banana farms found 55 species from pitfall traps, 17 from banana pseudostem residues and 34 from <b>banana</b> <b>corms.</b> Eleven species of ants came to banana weevil egg and larvae exposed in the field as baits and thirteen species were tested in the laboratory for their potential to attack the banana weevil.

40|$|Banana is {{the most}} {{important}} food crop in Uganda. However, there has been a decline in productivity, attributed to declining soil fertility, drought, pests and diseases and crop management factors. This study aimed to explore the possibility of increasing yields through the use of fertilizer and mulch, and to evaluate the benefits of these inputs across the major banana producing regions in Uganda. This study was carried out in 179 smallholder plots in Central, South, Southwest and East Uganda in 2006 / 7. Half of the plots were ‘demonstration plots’ of an agricultural development project, while the other half were neighboring farmer plots that acted as ‘control’. Demonstration plots received mineral fertilizer (100 % of plots), averaging 71 N, 8 P, 32 K kg ha− 1 yr− 1 and external mulch from grass and crop residues (64 % of plots), whereas control plots received no mineral fertilizer and little external mulch (26 % of plots). Demonstration plots had significantly (P ⩽ 0. 05) higher yields than control plot in Central, South and Southwest, but average yield increases varied from 4. 8 t ha− 1 yr− 1 (Southwest) to 8. 0 (Central), and 10. 0 (South). Average <b>weevil</b> <b>corm</b> damage (3 %) and nematode-induced root necrosis (7 %) was low and similar for both plot types, so yield increases could only be explained by the use of fertilizer and mulch. The highest demonstration plot yield increases were observed where fertilizer addressed key nutrient deficiencies identified using the compositional nutrient diagnosis approach. Farm gate bunch prices declined from 0. 17 (Central Uganda) to 0. 07 USD kg− 1 (Southwest Uganda). Consequently, average marginal rate of return (MRR) of fertilizer and mulch use ranged from 0. 1 (Southwest) to 5. 8 (Central). The technologies were likely to be acceptable to farmers (MRR ⩾ 1. 00) up to 160 km away from the capital. Fertilizer use is likely to be acceptable in all regions (MRR = 0. 7 – 9. 4) if local fertilizer prices of 2006 / 7 (average USD 0. 56 kg− 1 of fertilizer) declined by 50 %. Doubling of fertilizer prices is likely to make fertilizer use unacceptable beyond 100 km away from the capital. The study concludes that there is scope for increased input use in banana systems in Uganda, but that regional variations in crop response, input/output prices, and price fluctuations have to be taken into account.
