6000|$|To Sarah Wharton, this {{intelligence}} gave unexpected pleasure; {{rising from}} her seat with impatience, she bade the <b>black</b> show <b>Birch</b> into the apartment; when, suddenly recollecting herself, {{she turned to the}} traveler with an apologizing look, and added, [...] "If Mr. Harper will excuse the presence of a peddler." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Slowly {{he turned}} and began to gnaw the bark of the big <b>black</b> <b>birch.</b> It was tough, but it tasted good. Clumsily he began to climb, tearing off a mouthful of bark here and there as he climbed. The higher he got the {{tenderer}} and sweeter the bark became. Finally he {{reached the top of}} the tree, and there on the small branches the bark was so tender and so sweet that he ate and ate and ate until for the first time in many days Mr. Porcupine had a full stomach. That night he curled up in a hollow log and slept all the night through, dreaming of great forests of <b>black</b> <b>birch</b> and all he wanted to eat.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next day}} he hunted for and found another <b>black</b> <b>birch,</b> and {{climbing}} to the top, he ate and ate until his stomach was full. From that time on Mr. Porcupine ceased to hunt for berries or beetles or bugs. He grew stout and stouter. He filled his shaggy coat until it was so tight it threatened to burst.|$|E

6000|$|Quite as {{a matter}} of course, a spring had been found, as the first {{consideration}} in [...] "locating," [...] as it is called by that portion of our people who get upon their conversational stilts. The spring burst {{out of the side of}} a declivity, the land stretching away for more than a mile from its foot, in an inclined plane that was densely covered with some of the noblest elms, beeches, maples, and <b>black</b> <b>birches,</b> I have ever seen. This spot, the Chainbearer early assured me, was the most valuable of all the lands of Mooseridge. He had selected it because it was central, and particularly clear from underbrush; besides having no stagnant water near it. In other respects, it was like any other point in that vast forest; being dark, shaded, and surrounded by the magnificence of a bountiful vegetation.|$|R

There Sister South Wind found him, and her heart was moved to pity, for she knew that his wits were as slow as his body. Softly she stole up behind him.|$|E
60|$|On a trout brook once I had {{a curious}} sense of comradeship with Meeko. It {{was in the}} early spring, when all the wild things make holiday, and man goes a-fishing. Near the brook a red {{squirrel}} had tapped a maple tree with his teeth and was tasting the sweet sap as it came up scantily. Seeing him and remembering my own boyhood, I cut a little hollow into the bark of a <b>black</b> <b>birch</b> tree and, when it brimmed full, drank the sap with immense satisfaction. Meeko stopped his own drinking to watch, then to scold and denounce me roundly.|$|E

"Now while Mr. Porcupine was so {{thin and}} lean {{he had no}} enemies, but when he grew stout and then fat, Mr. Panther and Mr. Fisher and Mr. Bobcat and even old King Bear began to cast longing eyes upon him, for times were hard and they were hungry. Mr. Porcupine began to grow afraid. By night he hid in hollow trees and by day he went abroad to eat only when {{he was sure that}} no one bigger than himself was about. And because he no longer dared to move about as before, he no longer {{depended}} upon the <b>black</b> <b>birch</b> alone, but learned to eat and to like all kinds of bark.|$|E

6000|$|Now only {{a dent in}} {{the earth}} marks the site of these dwellings, with buried cellar stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries, hazel-bushes, and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there; some pitch pine or gnarled oak {{occupies}} what was the chimney nook, and a sweet-scented <b>black</b> <b>birch,</b> perhaps, waves where the door-stone was. Sometimes the well dent is visible, where once a spring oozed; now dry and tearless grass; or it was covered deep--not to be discovered till some late day--with a flat stone under the sod, when the last of the race departed. What a sorrowful act must that be--the covering up of wells! coincident with the opening of wells of tears. These cellar dents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left where once were the stir and bustle of human life, and [...] "fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute," [...] in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed. But all I can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this, that [...] "Cato and Brister pulled wool"; which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes I rambled to pine groves, {{standing}} like temples, or like fleets at sea, full-rigged, with wavy boughs, and rippling with light, so {{soft and}} green and shady that the Druids would have forsaken their oaks to worship in them; or to the cedar wood beyond Flint's Pond, where the trees, covered with hoary blue berries, spiring higher and higher, are fit to stand before Valhalla, and the creeping juniper covers the ground with wreaths full of fruit; or to swamps where the usnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white spruce trees, and toadstools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover the ground, and more beautiful fungi adorn the stumps, like butterflies or shells, vegetable winkles; where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow, the red alderberry glows like eyes of imps, the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest woods in its folds, and the wild holly berries make the beholder forget his home with their beauty, and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless other wild forbidden fruits, too fair for mortal taste. Instead of calling on some scholar, I paid many a visit to particular trees, of kinds which are rare in this neighborhood, standing far away {{in the middle of}} some pasture, or in the depths of a wood or swamp, or on a hilltop; such as the <b>black</b> <b>birch,</b> of which we have some handsome specimens two feet in diameter; its cousin, the yellow birch, with its loose golden vest, perfumed like the first; the beech, which has so neat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted, perfect in all its details, of which, excepting scattered specimens, I know but one small grove of sizable trees left in the township, supposed by some to have been planted by the pigeons that were once baited with beechnuts near by; it is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you split this wood; the bass; the hornbeam; the Celtis occidentalis, or false elm, of which we have but one well-grown; some taller mast of a pine, a shingle tree, or a more perfect hemlock than usual, standing like a pagoda {{in the midst of the}} woods; and many others I could mention.
