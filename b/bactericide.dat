Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with <b>bactericide</b> and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E

25|$|Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV {{is necessary to}} separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, {{so that it will}} fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a <b>bactericide.</b>|$|E

25|$|Morris Kharasch, {{a chemist}} at the University of Maryland, filed a patent {{application}} for thiomersal in 1927; Eli Lilly later marketed the compound under the trade name Merthiolate. In vitro tests conducted by Lilly investigators H. M. Powell and W. A. Jamieson {{found that it}} was forty to fifty times as effective as phenol against Staphylococcus aureus. It was used to kill bacteria and prevent contamination in antiseptic ointments, creams, jellies, and sprays used by consumers and in hospitals, including nasal sprays, eye drops, contact lens solutions, immunoglobulins, and vaccines. Thiomersal was used as a preservative (<b>bactericide)</b> so that multidose vials of vaccines could be used instead of single-dose vials, which are more expensive. By 1938, Lilly's assistant director of research listed thiomersal as one of the five most important drugs ever developed by the company.|$|E

The bird may {{pick up the}} insects in their [...] and rub them on the body, or the bird may lie {{in an area of}} high density of the insects and perform dust bathing-like movements. The insects secrete liquids containing chemicals such as formic acid, which can act as an insecticide, miticide, fungicide or <b>bactericide.</b> Alternatively, anting could make the insects edible by removing the distasteful acid, or, possibly supplement the bird's own preen oil. Instead of ants, some birds can also use millipedes. More than 200 species of bird are known to ant. The practice may be called [...] "passive anting", when a bird simply positions itself to allow ants to crawl through its plumage.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} {{strategy}} {{for controlling diseases}} caused by Pseudomonas syringae is, {{as it has been}} for more than 5 decades, to spray <b>bactericides.</b> These mainly include a variety of copper compounds or other heavy metals, with or without various combinations of fungicides or other pest-control chemicals. Spraying with antibiotics or other organic <b>bactericides</b> have also been used, but to a lesser extent. Unfortunately, these strategies have never been satisfactory, resulting in heavy crop losses during severe epidemics. Over the last years, pathogenic strains that are resistant to copper spraying have been detected globally and are threatening the continuation of this strategy. Three different strategies are slowly being introduced into the field, (i) seed disinfection by heat or a combination of heat and <b>bactericides,</b> (ii) biological control by antagonistic microorganisms, and (iii) soil solarization especially against pathogens that spend part of their life cycle in the soil.

2500|$|Pesticides are {{substances}} that {{are meant to}} control pests or weeds. The term pesticide includes all of the following: herbicide, insecticide, [...] insect growth regulator, nematicide, termiticide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, predacide, <b>bactericide,</b> insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, fungicide, disinfectant (antimicrobial), and sanitizer. The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use. Most pesticides are intended to serve as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general, protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects.|$|E
2500|$|During [...] anting, birds rub insects {{on their}} feathers, usually ants, which secrete liquids {{containing}} chemicals such as formic acid.

40|$|Neutrophils play an {{essential}} role in innate immunity due to their ability to migrate into infected tissues and kill microbes with <b>bactericides</b> located in their secretory granules. Neutrophil transmigration and degranulation are tightly regulated by actin cytoskeleton. Invading pathogens produce alkaloids that cause the depolymerization of actin, such as the mold alkaloid cytochalasin D. We studied the effect of cytochalasin D on the morphology and secretion of fMLP-, LPS-, or PMA-stimulated human neutrophils upon adhesion to fibronectin. Electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the neutrophils adherent to fibronectin in the presence of various stimuli differed. But in the presence of cytochalasin D, all stimulated neutrophils exhibited a uniform nonspread shape and developed thread-like membrane tubulovesicular extensions (cytonemes) measuring 200 [*]nm in diameter. Simultaneous detection of neutrophil secretory products by mass spectrometry showed that all tested stimuli caused the secretion of MMP- 9, a key enzyme in the neutrophil migration. Cytochalasin D impaired the MMP- 9 secretion but initiated the release of cathepsin G and other granular <b>bactericides,</b> proinflammatory agents. The release of <b>bactericides</b> apparently occurs through the formation, shedding, and lysis of cytonemes. The production of alkaloids which modify neutrophil responses to stimulation via actin depolymerization may be part of the strategy of pathogen invasion...|$|R

40|$|Control {{of plant}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria {{is a serious}} problem in production of many agricultural crops. High multiplication rate, adaptability and life inside plant tissue make bacteria unsuitable and inaccessible for most of control measures. Consequently, the list of <b>bactericides</b> available for plant protection is very short. Lately, biological control measures have been intensively studied as a potential solution of the problem. Investigation of bacteriophages,viruses that attack bacteria, is a fast-expanding area of research in plant protection. Several experiments have shown that they {{can be used as a}} very efficient tool for control of plant pathogenic bacteria.

40|$|Nutrient {{availability}} {{is a major}} constraint {{to plant}} production and carbon storage in arctic ecosystems, but there are few studies coupling processes in the decomposer and microbial food web and the implications these processes have on the control of nutrient mineralization. We studied the relationship between microbial biomass and the abundance of microbivore {{and the role of}} grazing on nutrient turnover after annual addition of carbon (sucrose), fertilizer (NPK), fungicide (benomyl) and <b>bactericides</b> (streptomycin and penicillin) to two dwarf shrub communities, a low and a high altitude heath. After four years of repeated additions, we measured microbial biomass by fumigation-extraction and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio by PLFA analysis and estimated the numbers of protozoa and nematodes, assigned into feeding groups. The fungal to bacterial ratio of nematode feeding groups was around 0. 2, indicating a bacterial-based food web in both communities. The size of the microbial biomass did not change after the additions, except when the amount of available carbon was increased (low altitude heath) or when addition of carbon was combined with fertilizer (high altitude heath). In contrast, fertilizer but not carbon increased the number of microbivores. This suggests that the amount of available carbon and not grazing pressure controls the size of the microbial biomass, Furthermore, it suggests that the food quality, e. g. nutrient content of the micro-organisms, had a larger effect on the microbivore than the size of the microbial biomass. The addition of <b>bactericides</b> and fungicide did not significantly change the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio of the micro-organisms. We could not detect any effects of the <b>bactericides.</b> In contrast, the fungicide strongly decreased nematode density, least in the fungal feeders, probably due to increased abundance of the insensitive Aphelenchoides ssp.
