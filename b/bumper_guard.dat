25|$|In 1947 a new stamped grille with a {{separate}} upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> crossbars, front and rear. All new was an Estate wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became {{the top of the}} line in the station wagon market.|$|E
2500|$|When postwar {{automobile}} production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome {{was more}} sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans {{as well as}} coupes, and a war-inspired [...] "bombsight" [...] hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> front and rear. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. As a consequence the 1946 Roadmaster's horsepower fell from 165 to 144. Torque {{on the other hand}} was hardly affected. Nevertheless, Roadmaster’s [...] I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top of the line Chrysler's. Due to wartime inflation prices were substantially higher. The biggest change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from four percent in 1941 to 20 percent in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 a new stamped grille with a {{separate}} upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> crossbars, front and rear. All new was an Estate wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became {{the top of the}} line in the station wagon market.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the body}} style {{remained}} the same throughout the Challenger's five-year run, there were two notable changes to the front grille. The 1971 models had a [...] "split" [...] grille, while 1972 introduced a design that extended the grille (nicknamed the [...] "sad-mouth") beneath the front bumper. With this change to the front end, 1972 through 1974 models had little to no variation. The only way to properly distinguish them is that the 1972s had flush mounted bumpers with no <b>bumper</b> <b>guards,</b> (small <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> were optional), while both the 1973 and 1974 models had the protruding [...] "5 mph" [...] bumpers (with a rubber type filler behind them) in conjunction with large <b>bumper</b> <b>guards.</b> The 1974 cars had larger rear <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> to meet the (new for 1974 and on) rear 5 mph rear impact law. These changes were made to meet U.S. regulations regarding crash test safety.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} '50s American car {{designers}} began to shed both rear tailfins and <b>bumper</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|R
50|$|For 1956, the Beetle {{received}} {{what would}} become one of its more distinctive features, a set of twin chrome tailpipes. Models for North America gained taller <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> and tubular overrider bars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exterior}} sported smooth curves with chrome and stainless trim. The {{rear bumper}} had an optional center <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> {{that had to}} be ratcheted out of the way so the trunk cover could be lifted. Front and rear bumpers had optional chrome [...] "tips", a dress-up item that bolted {{to the ends of the}} stock bumper. Although it wasn't a Chevrolet option, a popular after market feature was a large external sunshade that protected the driver from glare off the metal dashboard.|$|E
5000|$|Additional STS features: Grille with {{flush-mounted}} wreath-and-crest, modified driver's {{front fender}} with the cornering light {{moved to the}} front facia and headlight monitors removed, matching body color front lower airdam and bodyside moldings, matte black export license pocket with bright bead, matte black front bumper impact pads and rear <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> vertical inserts, matching body color outside rearview mirrors with black patch, modified (from Eldorado) rear reflexes (moved to the bumper), modified export taillamps with three-color European-style lenses, STS nameplate on the decklid and an STS exclusive cloisonne deck lid lock cover.|$|E
50|$|The 1950 Supers {{shared with}} all the other series totally new all <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> grille and more rounded styling. Super script {{appeared}} on front fenders just above the full length lower bodyside moldings. A new body style was a 2-door Riviera hardtop. Another new bodystyle was a long wheelbase sedan which was stretched an extra four inches (102 mm) and featured plusher interior than most Supers, which normally had cloth interiors of finer material than the Special. Supers had three VentiPorts on each hoodside. The convertible had leather power seats plus power windows and top.|$|E
5000|$|In range {{rationalization}} to {{a single}} trim available in two-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and station wagon body versions, the styling changes for the 1973 Ambassadors were minimal. Heftier front and rear bumpers were included to comply with new U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a 5 mph front and a 2.5 mph rear impacts without damage to the engine, lights, and safety equipment. Ambassadors complied with the regulation by incorporating a stronger front bumper equipped with self-restoring telescoping shock-absorbers. Designed to [...] "give" [...] as much as 3.5 in, it jutted slightly forward from the front fascia and incorporated flexible trim matching the body paint. This bumper also featured a more prominent horizontal rubber guard at its upper portion near the grille, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a pair of vertical chrome <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> that was optional before. The rear bumper gained vertical black rubber <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> that also replaced a pair of similar and previously optional chrome <b>bumper</b> <b>guards.</b> The grille gained heavier horizontal bars and headlight bezels took on blackout trim in their recessed portions.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the seven}} model years, Porsche {{made a number}} of changes to the 914. Some of these changes were {{cosmetic}} and others were in response to changing crash protection standards. From 1970 to 1974, the 914 was offered with chrome or painted bumpers. In early 1970, rear bumpers were produced with a straight crease {{on either side of the}} license plate indent. Between 1970 and 1972, both front and rear bumpers were smooth without <b>bumper</b> <b>guards.</b> In 1973, <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> were added to the front of the car. In 1974, guards were also added to the rear bumper. In 1975 and 1976, the chrome or painted bumpers were replaced with heavy, rubber-covered units which actually made the cars more stable at high speeds.|$|R
50|$|Postwar Cadillacs began {{sporting}} conical <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> in the 1946 model year. In 1951 models, {{some were}} raised into the grille. In 1957 black rubber tips appeared. The element continued {{to become more}} pronounced in size through 1958, but were eliminated in the 1959 Cadillac redesign.|$|R
5000|$|... #The racket, {{including}} <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> and all {{solid parts}} of the handle, may not exceed 22 inches in length.#The racket frame may be any material judged safe.#The racket frame must include a cord that must be securely attached to the player's wrist.#The string of the racket must be gut, monofilament, nylon, graphite, plastic, metal, or a combination thereof, and must not mark or deface the ball.#Using an illegal racket will result in forfeiture {{of the game in}} progress or, if discovered between games, forfeiture of the preceding game.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} sported smooth curves, chrome and stainless trim. In {{the earlier}} models the rear bumper had an optional center <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> {{that had to}} be ratcheted out of the way so the trunk cover could be lifted. Front and rear bumpers had optional chrome [...] "tips", a dress-up item that bolted {{to the ends of the}} stock bumper. Not a Chevrolet option but a popular after market feature was a large external sunshade that protected the driver from glare off of the metal dash board. The 1949 to 1952 models were completely different than the earlier years with the fleetline [...] "fastback" [...] shape being quite distinct than a normal sedan shape.|$|E
50|$|In 1957 a tubular X-frame without {{side rails}} was adopted. This {{resulted}} in greater structural rigidity and provided for a lower body without {{a loss of}} usable space. Front end styling was marked by rubber <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the Series 75 were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal windsplits. At the upper end this fenderbreak trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both tailamps. The Series 75 came as a limousine or in a nine-passenger sedan configuration, both with auxiliary seats. Power was 300 to 325 hp (224 to 242 kW) for 1957.|$|E
50|$|It {{included}} fender {{skirts and}} a removable fiberglass top as standard equipment, with a fabric convertible top as a commonly specified option. The engine was Ford's proven 292-cubic-inch OHV 292 Y-block V8, which got 18MPG. The exhaust pipes exited through twin <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> {{bolted to the}} rear bumper.|$|R
5000|$|As {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Harley Earl, GM Vice President of Design, the conical <b>bumper</b> <b>guards</b> would mimic artillery shells. [...] Placed inboard of the headlights on front bumpers of Cadillacs, {{they were intended}} to both convey {{the image of a}} speeding projectile and protect vehicles' front ends in collisions.|$|R
50|$|All Packard 200 models {{came with}} twin horns, two sun visors, {{front and rear}} <b>bumper</b> <b>guards,</b> spare tire and jack set. Deluxe trim level {{included}} the spartan appointments found on the standard models, and added chrome wheel rings, and turn indications as standard. White-wall tires and full-wheel covers were also extra.|$|R
50|$|The main {{external}} {{change to}} the 1948 Super from its 1947 counterpart was the Super script on each front fender. Other series identification continued to be earned on the <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> crossbar. The car was a bit lower than in 1947 rolling on new 7.60 x 15 tires mounted on wheels with trim rings and small hubcaps. Super script was also found on the center crest of a new black Tenite steering wheel. New cloth interiors featured leatherette scuff pads and trim risers. The instrument panel was redone, using silver-tone instruments on a two-tone gray panel. The sedan was carpeted in the rear with a carpet insert {{also found in the}} front rubber mat. The convertible also featured cloth and leather interior trim with power top, seat and windows standard. Total sales were 108,521.|$|E

5000|$|Tomb Raider Edition: 2003 {{model year}} was a limited run of 1,001 (perhaps as many as 1,050) Wrangler Rubicon [...] "Tomb Raider" [...] models {{produced}} promote the Tomb Raider sequel, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life. Along with the standard Rubicon fare, it also included exterior features such as 16-inch Alcoa forged aluminum wheels, Tomb Raider badging, and Mopar accessories including a light bar, riveted fender flares, tubular grille guard, diamond-plated <b>bumper</b> <b>guard,</b> etc. Interior features included Dark Slate fabric seats with red accent stitching down the center, silver surround instrument panel bezel, red seat belts, and a Tomb Raider badge with serial number. To match the vehicle in the film, it was offered in Bright Silver. Due to its classic styling, combined with numerous unique accessories, the 2003 [...] "Tomb Raider" [...] Limited Edition Wrangler Rubicon {{has become one of}} the most highly collectible jeeps of all-time.|$|E
25|$|All four {{versions}} of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The car's front bumper lost its full-width vinyl rub strip but gained two rubber-faced <b>bumper</b> <b>guards.</b> A larger rear bumper was added to meet new 5mph legislation, and the license plate was moved up to a position between the taillights.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included <b>bumper</b> <b>guards,</b> electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with horn ring.

50|$|For {{its last}} year in the {{fuselage}} body, the Monaco continued with its 1972 styling, except for another new rear bumper with redesigned taillamps, along with a new decklid and rear-quarter endcaps. Large black rubber guards were added to the bumpers to comply with new Federal five-mile-per-hour impact standards. Hardtop and sedan models gained about 6.5 in due mostly to the <b>bumper</b> <b>guards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2000: The Rodeo and Amigo {{receive a}} visual refresh with beefier bumpers, new headlights, taillights, and grille designs. On the inside, new seats and seat fabrics are introduced.

The package included white or black paint over gray lower body panels, crossbars for the roof rack, and special graphics.|$|E
5000|$|In 1951 Supers had larger bodies than Specials {{but looked}} similar with three rounded VentiPorts per fender, broad bright fender shields {{and a full}} length [...] "Sweepspear" [...] chrome body side molding. This {{chrome-plated}} strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in {{a quarter of a}} circle to go straight back to the taillight. Series script was found on the deck lid and within the steering wheel center. The long wheelbase sedan was named the Riviera sedan although it was not a hardtop. Supers were trimmed with materials similar to Special Deluxes except for in the plush Super Riviera sedan. Front turn signals were within the <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> [...] "bombs," [...] while rear signals shared the stop lamps' housing on the rear fender edges. The convertibles and Estate wagonwere trimmed in leather. 169,226 Supers were sold.|$|E
5000|$|For 1957, a tubular X-frame without {{side rails}} was adopted. This {{resulted}} in lower body without {{a loss of}} usable space. Front end styling was marked by rubber <b>bumper</b> <b>guard</b> tips and dual circular lamps set into the lower bumper section. Side trim was revised and a dual taillight theme was used. Identifying the standard 62 models were bright metal moldings, just forward of the rear wheel openings, highlighted by seven horizontal wind slits. At the upper end this fender brake trim joined a horizontal molding that ran along a conical flare extending towards both taillamps. A crest medallion was seen on the forward angled rear fins. De Villes had special nameplates on the front fenders. Series 62 Eldorados (as distinct from the Series 70 Eldorado Brougham) were further distinguished by the model name above a V-shaped rear deck ornament and on the front fenders. The rear fender and deck contour was trimmed with broad, sculptured stainless steel beauty panels. Also seen were [...] "shark" [...] style fins pointing towards {{the back of the}} cars. A three section built in front bumper was another exclusive trait of the Series 62 Eldorados, which came with a long list of standard features. A new body style was added to the subseries, a 4-door Eldorado Sedan Seville, but only four were actually sold, and it was cancelled the following year.|$|E
