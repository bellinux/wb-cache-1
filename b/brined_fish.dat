40|$|Introduction : Smoking of fish {{has changed}} its {{function}} nowadays from just the preservative task to flavoring and coloring. The method of smoking {{has also been}} developed from traditional, which had used a simple technology to the modern method. In recent years, preparation of liquid smoke manufactured from certain varieties of wood pyrolysates have been successfully used {{as a substitute for}} the traditional smoking in a kiln. Material and methods : The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of cold smoking of mackerel fish on the proximate composition, water activity, salt content and microbial aspect of smoked fish treated using oak sawdust and liquid smoke either salted or un-salted. Sensory analysis was carried out by using score sheet organoleptic and hedonic test. Identification of pathogenic bacteria was done by API- 20 E method. Factorial design was administered to compare the effect of traditional and liquid smoke method to brined and unbrined smoked fish. Results and Discussion : The content of protein, lipid, water activity and salt of the two products were not significantly different (p> 0. 05). This means that the quality between two products were similar. Only moisture content of the products were very significantly different (p> 0. 01) caused by the phenomenon of osmosis between moisture of <b>fish</b> and <b>brine.</b> Study of liquid smoke treatment was found that liquid smoke was easier compared to oak sawdust smoke. It was also found that smoking reduces the number of colonies of bacteria. The number of colonies were about 1 x 103 /g – 5 x 103 /g after 2 day storage for unbrined smoked <b>fish,</b> while in <b>brined</b> smoked <b>fish,</b> no colonies were found after 3 day storage.

50|$|Fish curing {{includes}} and of curing fish by drying, salting, smoking, and pickling, or by {{combinations of}} these processes have been employed since ancient times. On sailing vessels fish were usually salted down immediately to prevent spoilage; the swifter boats of today commonly bring in unsalted fish. Modern freezing and canning methods have largely supplanted older methods of preservation. Fish to be cured are usually first cleaned, scaled, and eviscerated. Fish are salted by packing them between layers of salt or by immersion in <b>brine.</b> The <b>fish</b> most extensively salted are cod, herring, mackerel, and haddock. Smoking preserves fish by drying, by deposition of creosote ingredients, and, when the fish are near the source of heat, by heat penetration. Herring and haddock (finnan haddie) are commonly smoked. Kippers are split herring, and bloaters are whole herring, salted and smoked. Sardines, pilchards, and anchovies are small fish of the herring family, often salted and smoked and then preserved in oil. Fish are dried under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and air velocity. Since the dried product is relatively unappetizing and rehydrating slow, other preservation methods are common.|$|R

40|$|Background. Salted fish {{products}} are popular {{in many countries}} around the world. Salting {{is one of the}} oldest techniques for fish preservation, and is essentially intended to increase the shelf-life of the product depressing water activity by means of dehydration and salt uptake by the fish muscle. However, the current demand for salted fish is driven more by the flavour of the product than for preservation purposes. Vacuum-packaging represents a static form of hypobaric storage. It is widely used in the food industry because of its effectiveness in reducing oxidative reactions in the product at relatively low cost. Low temperature storage is one of the primary methods to maintain fish quality, based on the reduction in the rates of microbiological, chemical and biochemical changes. Material&nbsp; and methods. Fresh Golden mullets were rapidly beheaded, scaled, gutted and immediately washed with tap water then, samples were taken to the laboratory in ice box for chemical and microbial analysis of fresh fish, other samples were put in the brine (6 liter water and 2160 g salt was used for brine solution). After 14 days of <b>brining,</b> <b>fish</b> were taken out of brine solution and drained, then they were Vacuum Packed and labelled (each pack contained two fish about 1500 g weight). All the packs were stored in a refrigerator 4 &deg;C. Some quality aspects including Total Volatile Nitrogen (TVN), Peroxide Value (PV), Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA), Total Viable Count (TVC), Halophilic Bacteria (HB) and presence of Clostridium Botulinum were determined in fresh mullets, fresh brined mullets after 14 days of brining, and in (Vacuum Packed) VP samples stored at 4 &deg;C at intervals of 30, 60 and 90 days. Results. &nbsp; TVN increased from ten mg/ 100 g in fresh brined after 14 days to 30. 80 mg/ 100 g in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, PV increased after brining from 1. 50 meq/kg in fresh brined to 28. 90 meq/kg in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, TBA increased from 0. 07 mg MDA/kg in fresh brined to 0. 10 after 60 days and then, decreased to 0. 09 mg MDA/kg in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage and&nbsp; TVC decreased from 4. 70 log CFU/gr in fresh brined to 4. 40 log CFU/ gr after 30 days and then, increased to 5. 70 log CFU/gr in VP brined Golden mullet after 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C, HB increased from 4. 55 log CFU/gr in fresh brined to 6. 30 log CFU/gr after 90 days of storage period at 4 &deg;C and exceeded the permissible level. Clostridium botulinum toxin was not detected in any of the samples throughout the storage. Conclusions. The results from this study clearly suggested that a combination of brining, vacuum packaging and storage at refrigerated temperature prolongs the shelf-life of Golden mullet to a great extent. Our findings revealed that the longest shelf-life was for VP brined Golden mullet stored at 4 &deg;C is 30 days...|$|R

The fish lost 14 to 29 % of the initial weight after 48 h of curing, in brine and dry salt, respectively. Correspondingly the moisture decreased from 76 to 57 % in brine cured and 52 % in dry salted fish. Salt content in the muscle increased from 1 % to 14. 82 and 13. 32 % {{in the case of}} brine cured and dry salted mackerel respectively, with slower uptake of salt in the latter because of the lesser surface area in contact. Tissue proteinases were activated initially in all cases when salting commenced, with higher activation in the case of pH 3 and 4.

The main technological stages of of the preparation of shrimps before their use in feeding – activation, hydration, decapsulation, incubation, dehydration were described. The effect of brine shrimp nauplia enriched with biologically active substances enriched brine shrimp on sturgeon juveniles was highlighted. Practical value. Fish farm owners search for cost-effective, easy to use, and available food that is preferred by sturgeon juveniles (Acipenseridae). Brine shrimp nauplii obtained from cysts can be readil used to feed fish just after one-day incubation. Instar I (the nauplii that just hatched and contain large yolk reserves in their body) and instar II nauplii (the nauplii after first moult and with functional digestive tracts) are more widely used in aquaculture, because they are easy for operation, rich in nutrients, and small, which makes them suitable for feeding fish larvae as live feed or after drying. The generalized information will be important for scientists studying the peculiarities of the feeding of sturgeon juvenile including natural foods. The data on the application of the biotechnology of brine shrimp use for the feeding of sturgeon juveniles will be useful for fish farmers. The importance {{of the use of}} Artemia for the feeding of sturgeon juveniles is due to its biological and economic characteristics and is diescribed in the article. The ability of the brine shrimp to produce dormant eggs, known as cysts, facilitated the extensive use of Artemia in aquaculture. The cysts may be stored for long periods and hatched on demand to provide a convenient form of live feed for larval <b>fish.</b> <b>Brine</b> shrimp nauplii constitute the most widely used food item, and over 2000 tonnes of dry Artemia cysts are marketed worldwide annually...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of Salinity Gradient Power technologies, Reverse ElectroDialysis (RED) {{is one of the}} most promising. In RED, two solutions of different salt concentration are fed into a series of alternate compartments, the one fed by the low salinity solution, the other by the high salinity solution. Compartments are separated by anion and cation exchange membranes alternatively piled to form a stack. Selective ion transport from the concentrate compartment to the dilute one across the membranes allows to generate an ionic current, which is eventually converted into electric current by means of suitable electrode compartments closing the stack. 	Several options for the feed solutions are possible. Natural waters were first considered as a potential source of salinity gradient, such as: river water and seawater or concentrated brines and low-salinity waters. Another alternative is the use of artificial solutions as feed solutions within closed-loop systems in which deployed salinity gradient of solutions exiting the RED unit is then regenerated by means of a regeneration step (e. g. : using low-grade heat, in RED heat engines; or, using electricity, in RED batteries). 	A nascent, still less explored alternative is the use of different industrial wastewaters as feed solutions. In fact, in several different scenarios, waste streams to be disposed can actually represent a very effective source of salinity gradient to be exploited before the natural mixing with the receiving water body occurs. In the present work a high salinity waste <b>brine</b> from a <b>fish</b> processing factory and a low-salinity water from a civil wastewater Membrane Bio Reactor (MBR) treatment plant were selected as feed solutions for an extensive investigation on a laboratory-scale RED unit (10 cell-pairs with a 10 cmx 10 cm active membrane area). Firstly, the RED unit performance was characterized with artificial NaCl solutions prepared with the same NaCl concentration as the real streams, in order to have a comparison-reference for tests with real solutions. Subsequently, long-run tests with real feed solutions were performed (firstly feeding real brine and artificial low-salinity feed, then artificial brine and real low-salinity feed and, finally, feeding the stack with both real feed), operating the RED unit in an uninterrupted way for more than 2 weeks for each case. The time-evolution of system performance parameters (pressure drops, stack resistance, power output, etc.) was registered and analyzed in order to assess the relevant effect of the real feed solutions, likely related to fouling/scaling/plugging phenomena in the lab-stack. Also counter washing and chemical washing procedures were periodically (typically, once per week) implemented in order to highlight their effectiveness in restoring process performance. On overall, results collected over a period of more than 2 months, represent an original and unique source of information on the long-time performance of RED systems with such unconventional real feed solutions...|$|R
5000|$|The tomb of Puyemré {{dates back}} to the Old Kingdom during the time of Reign of Thutmosis III. Puyemré parents were Puia and Nerferioh and he had two wives named Tanefert and Sensonb he was the second prophet of Amūn. In his earlier career Puyemré as second priest of Amon had been {{responsible}} for queen Hatshepsut for the construction of the outworks of her temple. Puyemré was given the name of “Baumeister des Hatschepsuttempels von Deir el-Bahari” by B. Engelmann von Carnap because of the responsibility he had for Queen Hatshepsut. The tomb of Puyemré is a private tomb located in Khokha it was excavated in the rock in the great cemetery in the western bank of the Nile at Thebes. The current location of the tomb of Pyuemré is now at the museum under the Tytus Fund. The architecture of this tomb with its columned portico and transverse hall leading to three chapels is unique compared to typical T-shaped tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The portico has been reconstructed due to being old which was a common thing in all tombs that reconstruction would happen. The portico the roof being supported by columns that have texts of deceased in the intercolumnar there remained scenes including banquet and deceased by two priest.The three chapels south chapel, north chapel and the central chapel are all filled with decorations that capture different scenes. The south chapel has sons and daughters with new year gifts before deceased and wife Sensonb on the left and Tanefer on the right wall. Puyemré wives must have been very important to him because they are almost in every wall pictured doing something different. In the north chapel there is funeral scenes {{on each side of the}} doorway as well as offering lists to Nefertem before being deceased. Finally, in the central chapel there are two scenes of Hathor that emblems to deceased. Before the men are deceased there are oils on burnt offerings and the priest with offerings is deceased with his wife. [...] The façade was not only the form of decoration that TT39 courtyard had but also has false doors at slight intervals and rounded tablets but also its execution the backward lean and the incised inscription in monochrome (Davies, N Garis 51). The proposed shelter was taken into consideration the quality of the rock at the level that it was being 4.5 meters above the floor of the false doors could not be cut into. So there was an alternative way or reconstruction including flat stones twelve to fifteen centimeters thick to provide support. The hall way that leads to the three chapels show scenes with inspects workshops of the temple of Amūn and ploughing in carpenters, jewelers, stone-vase workers, ploughing, and attendants with horses and chariot (Porter 71). There is guest and female musicians included and women with lyre; this records the produce of south lands before the deceased for Treasury of Amūn, including Nubians with cattle, gold and ivory, monkeys and baboons, and Egyptians with linen. In TT39 the only repast scenes incorporating an offering procession were shown in the southern chapel (Stupko-Lubczyńska 656). Where the scene corresponds with the selection of gifts presented to the deceased. This scene is being questioned because it’s found in TT81 (Ineni) in the corresponding wall, TT71 (Nebamon) and in TT100 (Rekmire). This scene was a popular decoration to have in the Eighteenth Dynasty. What links the scene in TT 39 and that in the Chapel of Hatshepsut, apart from the presented product, are the titles of the bearers. All of themin TT 39 are described as Hrj mr(w)t, ‘an overseer of mr(w)t-people’. Seven of fi fteenmen in the Chapel of Hatshepsut are entitled sS Hrj mr(w)t, ‘a scribe (of) an overseer of mr(w)t-people’, while the figures with this title tend to concentrate in the end of the register.N. de G Davies gives an example referenced to the Hatshepsut chapel where there’s scenes that are placed in the chapel of Hatshepsut in TT39. The chapel of Hatshepsut is seen as a significance to TT39 for inspiration and decoration the scenes the non offering list, the motifs of incense, linen, and animals incorporated into the offering procession and the figures of Iunmutef and Thot, placed in the Chapel itself are interesting when compared to the typical Old and Middle kingdom offering scenes. Where the offering scenes served as a symbolic and as well as a magical purpose. Inside the tomb there is thirty-one plates that consist of photogravures, line drawings and twelve color plates. Puyemré had reserved his tomb for his family including his two wives. This shows that Puyemré did not follow the old custom of assigning names and offices to all but the very humblest servitors (Davies, N. de Garis 38). There is a repetition in scenes that show Puyemré and his two wives where Tanefret is his companion on the north wall and Senseneb on the south wall. This shows the two rivals coming together for the affection or the affectionate memory of Puyemré showing a lack of domestic harmony. It turns out that this scene is the most appealing to visitors when they visit the tomb. These scenes are back to back coming together in the center of the niche in plate sixty-two. There are three scenes that show deceased Tanefert with monkeys eating dates under her chair and deceased spearing hippopotamus as well as deceased families that are fishing. The other scene where Senseneb is deceased where she is standing inspecting three rows bringing geese, ducks, and cranes, netting fowl herdsmen bringing cattle and <b>brining</b> netting <b>fish,</b> the third where there’s vintage with sealing wine-jars, pressing and treading grape, and papyrus-harvest. These scenes based on Puyemré’s wives seem to be most important because it seemed that both of them had a hard work life for Puyemré they were both worked down doing all these activities/jobs.|$|R
