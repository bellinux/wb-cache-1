5|$|Between 1877 and 1931, Albert A. Michelson made {{multiple}} {{measurements of}} the speed of light. His 1877–79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb, who was also working on measuring the speed of light. Michelson's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault's original arrangement. As seen in Figure5, Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L (i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light). If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus, the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M (equal in diameter to lens L) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens, this being true regardless of the RM distance. Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000feet. To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance, Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens (150feet) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15feet closer to L than the principal focus. This allowed an RS distance of between 28.5 to 33.3feet. He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air-turbine-powered mirror R, and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115mm. His 1879 figure for the speed of light, 299944±51km/s, was within about 0.05% of the modern value. His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements {{such as the use of}} polygonal prism-shaped rotating mirrors (enabling a brighter image) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts-per-million accuracy. His figure of 299,796±4km/s was only about 4km/s higher than the current accepted value. Michelson's final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death. Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F.G.Pease and F.Pearson, various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy, including an earthquake which disturbed the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Indications for {{intubation}} include airway obstruction, {{inability to}} protect the airway, and respiratory failure. Examples of these indications include penetrating neck trauma, expanding neck hematoma, and being unconscious, among other indications. In general, the method of intubation used is rapid sequence intubation followed by ventilation. Assessment of circulation in those with trauma includes control of active bleeding. When a person is first brought in, vital signs are checked, an ECG is performed, and, if needed, vascular access is obtained. Other tests should be performed to get a <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> of their current blood chemistry, such as a arterial blood gas or thromboelastography. In those with cardiac arrest due to trauma chest compressions are considered futile, but still recommended. Correcting the underlying cause such as a pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, if present, may help.|$|E

30|$|A {{random effects}} analysis, {{incorporating}} age as a covariate, {{was used for}} the longitudinal data to assess the relationship between MP (the dependent variable) and HSA.

This was followed by multivariable regression analysis with HSA as the dependent variable and age and group as the explanatory variables, with the interaction between age and group taken as a covariate.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of two strategies to improve antibiotic use in patients with a complicated urinary tract infection. DESIGN: Multicentre cluster randomised unblinded trial. METHOD: The departments of Internal Medicine and Urology from 19 hospitals in the Netherlands took part in this trial. Based on retrospective patient record investigations we performed <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements</b> on the scores of a validated set of quality indicators for antibiotic use in a minimum of 50 patients with a complicated urinary tract infection per department in 2009. A similar post-trial measurement took place in 2012. In 2010 we randomised the hospitals between 2 improvement strategies: a multifaceted strategy that included results of the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements,</b> education, reminders and assistance with optional improvement interventions, and a competitive feedback strategy, in which the departments only received results of the <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements</b> and non-anonymous results from the other departments in this study arm. The primary outcome measure was improvement of the quality indicator scores. Secondary outcome measures were determinants of improvement of the indicators. (Netherlands Trial Register: NTR 1742) RESULTS: The <b>baseline</b> and post-trial <b>measurements</b> were performed on 1, 964 patients and 2, 027 patients, respectively. Post-trial measurements revealed a significant, but limited, improvement of several indicators compared with <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements.</b> We found {{no significant difference in}} improvement between the two strategies for any indicator. The intensity with which the departments implemented improvement strategies was mostly suboptimal, but intensive implementation of a strategy was associated with greater improvement. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of both improvement strategies was comparable, but limited. For real improvement in antibiotic use in patients with complicated urinary tract infections, improvement interventions should be developed and applied by local professionals themselves...|$|R

50|$|In a {{large-scale}} screening study, {{one in ten}} children in mainstream classrooms were identified with working memory deficits. The majority of them performed very poorly in academic achievements, independent of their IQ. Similarly, working memory deficits {{have been identified in}} national curriculum low-achievers as young as seven years of age. Without appropriate intervention, these children lag behind their peers. A recent study of 37 school-age children with significant learning disabilities has shown that working memory capacity at <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement,</b> but not IQ, predicts learning outcomes two years later. This suggests that working memory impairments are associated with low learning outcomes and constitute a high risk factor for educational underachievement for children. In children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and developmental coordination disorder, a similar pattern is evident.|$|E

40|$|Background: At present, {{there is}} a high {{incidence}} of elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and {{it is important to know}} the long term progression and the factors that influence it. Objectives: To analyse the progression of advanced CKD in elderly patients and the influence of bone-mineral metabolism. Methods: Retrospective study of 125 patients ≥ 70  years of age with CKD stages 4 – 5 who started follow-up from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008, showing the progression of CKD (measured by the slope of the regression line of the estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by MDRD- 4) over 5  years. Results: Progression in the entire group (median and 25 th and 75 th percentiles) : − 1. 15 (− 2. 8 / 0. 17) ml/min/ 1. 73  m 2 /year, CKD- 4 : − 1. 3 (− 2. 8 / 0. 03) ml/min/ 1. 73  m 2 /year, CKD- 5 : − 1. 03 (− 3. 0 / 0. 8) ml/min/ 1. 73  m 2 /year; the slope of the regression line was positive in 35 patients (28 %: CKD does not progress) and negative in 90 patients (72 %: CKD progresses). Negative correlation (Spearman) (slower progression) : PTH, albumin/Cr ratio and daily Na excretion (all <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements).</b> No correlation with eGFR, serum P, urinary P excretion, protein intake and intake of P (all <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements).</b> In the linear regression analysis (dependent variable: slope of progression) : albuminuria and PTH (both at <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements)</b> influenced this variable independently. Logistic regression (progresses vs. does not progress) : PTH, albuminuria and eGFR (all at <b>baseline</b> <b>measurements)</b> influenced significantly. Conclusions: In our group of elderly patients, impairment of renal function is slow, particularly in CKD- 5 patients. Albuminuria and PTH at baseline levels are prognostic factors in the evolution of renal function...|$|R

50|$|An initial {{spirometry}} {{is performed}} {{to assess the}} patient's native respiratory status. You {{will be asked to}} take a deep breath and then blow into the mouthpiece of the spirometer as hard as you can. This is a <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement.</b> A dose of bronchodilator medication is administered by means of inhaler or nebulizer (such as 400mcg of salbutamol (also known as albuterol)). You will wait about 15 minutes and then the spirometry is repeated. An increase in FEV1 (or forced expiratory volume in the first second of a forced exhalation) of >200ml is considered a positive result. Bear in mind, however, that this number does not apply to children, and that it can differ depending on the patient's native result; small patient's with pulmonary fibrosis, restrictive lung disease etc. will have a percentually lower FEV1 than healthy average-sized adults. This can give a false positive result of the test.|$|E
50|$|Zelinski {{developed}} {{the first comprehensive}} standardized questionnaire of self-reported memory to determine whether people’s beliefs about their memory are echoed in their objective performance. The questionnaire, the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), has modest concurrent validity with respect to memory performance and is a better predictor of performance than responses to a yes/no question about memory problems, as commonly used in medical history-taking. Correlates of memory ratings include age, memory performance, depression, health ratings, education, and personality, and these findings translate across my comprehensive longitudinal study of aging (the Long Beach Longitudinal Study) and a nationally representative sample of older adults. Changes in ratings up to 19 years after <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> are modestly associated with increasing age as well as declining objective performance. The MFQ {{has been used in}} samples of older adults throughout the United States and other countries. Questionnaires similar to it are in wide use today.|$|E
50|$|After a {{preliminary}} survey by Roy {{and three other}} members of the Society on 16 April, they found a suitable location for the starting baseline on Hounslow Heath, between King's Arbour and Hampton Poor-house just over 5 miles to the south-east. A preliminary measurement of the line was carried out with a steel chain prepared by Jesse Ramsden. It was the intention to measure more accurately with a set of three deal rods about 20 ft. in length but their use had to be abandoned because of their susceptibility to lengthen and shorten in wet weather. The deal rods were replaced by one-inch-thick glass tubes of the same length. The final measurement gives the length of the base as 27404.7 ft. to an accuracy of about 3 inches in 5 miles (or about 1/100,000). The precision of this <b>baseline</b> <b>measurement</b> far exceeded any previous attempts, and in recognition Roy was awarded the Copley medal by the Royal Society in 1785.|$|E
