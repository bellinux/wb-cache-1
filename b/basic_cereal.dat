Sci., 13 : 99 - 104 The {{aim of the}} present investigation is to evaluate the presence of mycotoxins Zearalenon and Deoxinivalenol as natural contaminators of the <b>basic</b> <b>cereal</b> components of combined feed in this country – maize, wheat, barley and oats. A total of 281 samples, including maize 104, wheat 103, barley 39 and oats 35, stock cereals from 2003 – 2005 crops had been evaluated. More favorable substrates for their accumulation had been maize, wheat and barley, while for oats the presence was established only in some of investigated years. The average concentrations of Zearalenon for maize vary between 398 and 838 µg/kg, for wheat between 450 and 884 µg/kg, for barley between 320 and 378 µg/kg, for oats between 250 and 350 µg/kg. The average concentrations of Deoxinivalenol for maize vary between 237 and 372 µg/kg, for wheat between 336 and 678 µg/kg, for barley between 250 and 333 µg/kg, and for oats 250 µg/kg...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{price formation}} on the world’s rice market using simple {{supply and demand}} models as a start, but moving to “supply of storage ” models—a staple of commodity-market analysis {{for more than half}} a century—to explain hoarding behavior and its subsequent impact on prices. The supply of storage model, however, does not account adequately for the influence that “outside ” speculators have on prices. This paper quantifies the impact of financial factors and actors on commodity-price formation using very short-run prices and Granger causality analysis for a wide range of financial and commodity markets, including rice. The results are highly preliminary but are also very provocative. Speculative money seems to surge in and out of commodity markets, strongly linking financial variables with commodity prices during some time periods, but these periods are often short and the relationships disappear for long periods of time. Finally, the paper addresses the long-run (since 1900) relationships among the prices of the three <b>basic</b> <b>cereal</b> staples, rice, wheat and corn (maize), which have declined more than 1 percent pe...|$|E

40|$|Achieving food {{security}} {{has been the}} overriding goal of agricultural policy in India. The introduction and rapid spread of high-yielding rice and wheat varieties in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s resulted in steady output growth for foodgrains. Public investment in irrigation and other rural infrastructure and research and extension, together with improved crop production practices, has significantly helped to expand production and stocks of foodgrains. However, concern is increasing that the rapid growth from the Green Revolution is waning. Public investments in agriculture are declining, and the annual increment to gross capital formation in agriculture is now lower than in the early 1980 s. In the years to come, higher economic growth as well as sizable population growth will increase the demand for food. The structure of demand is also changing, as diets are diversifying from the <b>basic</b> <b>cereal</b> staples to fruits, vegetables, and other higher-valued foods. Collaborative research between the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has explored how these possibly conflicting trends in supply and demand will affect net trade in grains in India, and it suggests policies for meeting the growing demand.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project and its predecessor, which were implemented between October 1982 and May 1985, was to develop and evaluate in the rural setting a number of low-cost technologies that could improve the production and handling of food, reduce drudgery, and create employment in the villages. The Technical Cooperation Programme supplied the services of two consultants who visited the country {{on a number of}} occasions and observed the work of farmers in the Terai and hill areas, and identified a number of low-cost technologies that would be suitable under local conditionsFood production in Nepal must increase at a rate at least equal to population growth to meet the rising demand for <b>basic</b> <b>cereal</b> products. The Government is addessing this problem by promoting integrated action in both the production and post-harvest sectors: the low-cost technologies identified under projects TCP/NEP/ 0107 and NEP/ 2308 could, if introduced, have a positive effect on food production, but there is, nonetheless, a need to train the farmers to accept and use them; once accepted, it would be important to train and assist village artisans in the production of the low-cost tools and implements involvedProject GCP/NEP/ 037 /AUL, the PFL/Rural Save Grain Programme, is able to provide both these forms of trainingBefore the introduction of the new technologies, however, it was recommended that a detailed socio-economic study be conducted to establish their appropriateness, as their success would depend upon the introduction of the correct tools and implements in the areas best suited to their use, and upon their being well used, and as they were designed to be.

40|$|How {{much did}} {{speculation}} affect {{the formation of}} rice prices during the rapid escalation of prices in world markets late in 2007 and early in 2008, through what mechanisms, what will happen as these influences unwind, and how is the story for rice different from other commodities? To answer these questions, this paper addresses four separate topics, each linked to the others by basic mechanisms of price formation. Simple supply and demand models are a start. The difference between short run responses to prices changes, and those responses after full adaptation is possible in the long run, is crucial and the conceptual model {{highlights the importance of}} these differences for understanding current prices. History matters. But storage and price expectations also become important for storable commodities in the short run—the length of time the commodity can be stored—a year or so for rice. A model of the “supply of storage,” is used to understand the factors affecting price expectations, and price formation, in the short run. This model is very powerful in its ability to explain hoarding behavior and subsequent impact on prices. Next, an effort is made to understand empirically the impact of financial factors and actors on commodity price formation using very short run prices and Granger causality analysis, {{for a wide range of}} financial and commodity markets, including rice. Speculative money seems to surge in and out of commodity markets, strongly linking financial variables with commodity prices during some time periods. But these periods are often short and the relationships disappear entirely for long periods of time. The links between financial markets and commodity markets are not simple nor are they stable. Finally, the paper addresses the long-run relationship between prices of the three <b>basic</b> <b>cereal</b> staples, rice, wheat and corn (maize), since 1900. It is clear there has been a long-run decline in the prices of all three cereals. Despite this common pattern, however, and important cross-commodity linkages, price formation for rice has several unique dimensions that are also worthy of further study. Commodity price formation, speculation, world rice market, world food crisis. ...|$|E

40|$|Oats (Avena sativa L.) {{among the}} <b>basic</b> <b>cereals</b> are highly {{appreciated}} from the nutritive and the dietetic point of view. This beneficial effect of oat products is primary {{attributed to the}} soluble dietary fibre compound β-D-glucan, major polysaccharide constituent of cell walls of oats. Mature grains of naked oat genotypes dispose of higher content of β-D-glucan (Havrlentová and Kraic, 2006) and its value decreases in milled grain with time (Gajdošová et al., 2007). Locality and year influence its content, although {{it seems that the}} genotypes with black colour of the glumes account significantly lower standard deviation and variation coefficients in the content of β-D-glucan, what indicates markedly stable biosynthetic mechanism of studied metabolite (Čertík et al., unpublished data). Oat seed is also an important source of dietary fibre and its content can be influenced by both genotype and locality. The importance and exploitation of oats have an increasing style and therefore the monitoring of microsatellite polymorphism of Avena sativa DNA has his foundation. 20 pairs of microsatellite primers occurring in non-coding regions of DNA were tested.

The aim {{of this article is to}} evaluate, based on an analysis, the self-sufficiency rate of the Czech Republic and Poland in selected commodities of crop production between marketing years 2000 / 2001 – 2009 / 2010, with special attention to the most important and cultivated commodities – <b>basic</b> <b>cereals,</b> oilseeds, corn and potatoes.

For most described commodities the trend of self-sufficiency rate in the Czech Republic and Poland is stabilised or growing. Only production of potatoes is coming close to critical treshhold in CZ, therefore national strategies should be put in place to maintain the self-sufficiency rate above the critical limit.

40|$|Dietary {{carbohydrates}} {{are characterized}} {{with respect to}} both chemical composition and likely site, rate and extent of digestion. Starch is divided into rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS). The present investigation aimed at evaluating the effect of starch source on nutritionally important starch fractions {{and the extent of}} in vitro starch digestion in four processed cereals, namely rice, ragi (Eleusine coracona), wheat, jowar (Sorghum vulgare) and their mixtures in varying proportions, using controlled enzymatic hydrolysis with pancreatin and amyloglucosidase. Rapidly available glucose (RAG) was also measured to derive a starch digestion index (SDI). The total starch and amylose content in the raw cereals ranged from 21 - 26. 6 and 12. 6 - 20. 7 g/ 100 g, respectively. Among the four <b>basic</b> <b>cereals,</b> roti (flat, unleavened pancake, diameter 12 cm) produced from ragi had highest total starch, RDS and SDI. However, in mixtures containing two or more cereals RDS and SDI were lower than those observed in single cereals. Significant correlations were observed between RAG and SDI, or RDS, respectively (r = 0. 91, r = 0. 96, P < 0. 01). An inverse relation between amylose content and SDI (r = - 0. 78, p < 0. 01) indicates the influence of amylose on the extent of starch digestion. The results highlight the importance of starch source in determining the starch fractions of processed cereals and their mixtures. The simple in vitro measurement of starch fractions could serve as a tool for characterizing dietary carbohydrates with respect to their digestion in the gut...|$|R

The differences in the selection of foodstuffs and forms of cooking are most notable between those in mainland and those in coastal regions.

The coastal region bears the influences of the Greek and Roman cuisine, {{as well as of the}} later Mediterranean cuisine, in particular Italian (especially Venetian). Coastal cuisines use olive oil, and herbs and spices such as rosemary, sage, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and lemon and orange rind. Peasant cooking traditions are based on imaginative variations of several <b>basic</b> ingredients (<b>cereals,</b> dairy products, meat, fish, vegetables, nuts) and cooking procedures (stewing, grilling, roasting, baking), while bourgeois cuisine involves more complicated procedures and use of selected herbs and spices.

This results in reduced education attainment and work productivity which negatively impacts on regional development and economies.

Folate deficiencies result from unbalanced diets and are responsible for an estimated 250, 000 birth defects annually.

30|$|Species in the studied HGAF {{supplement}} for household’s {{food and}} income. Tubers {{and vegetables are}} among the herb species and replace the staple food of cereal crop. Research results also showed that tubers are replacing the <b>basic</b> staples of <b>cereals,</b> and produce reasonable amount of carbohydrate (Fernandes and Nair 1986). Respondents assure that fruit trees are primarily served for food especially during difficult time of drought. The three fruit tree species frequently found was an indicator of how farmers are highly depends in HGAF for food {{in addition to their}} cash income revenue. Relatively Persea americana and Mangifera indica have a good market (but not consistent) in the near zonal town, Fintoselam than other fruit tree species. This {{is due to the fact}} that urban peoples use the processed juice from the two fruit tree species. Fentahun Mengistu (2008) also confirms, fruit trees from HGAF have significant role during environmental crisis of households. While family/especially children’s consume fruit trees, it is possible to avoid (buffer) frequency of hanger and decreases number of meals/day. So dependency on other cereal food crops becomes minimal. In the long run, cereal crops are reserved/saved to buffer households during time of stress. In contrary, in NTBG land user this is not possible since household members have no other substitution food items to save cereal crops for difficult time, and so the vulnerability becomes higher than HGAF user. Research findings from South Africa agroforestry fruit trees show, fruits play an important role especially during time of famine and other stress as food, nutrition and cash income (Akinnifesi et al. 2008). All other components of homegarden in the study area help the same as what fruit tree does in one way or other. According to Scherr (1995), rural households survival strategies encompass multiple objectives in maximization of utility, like provision of food, and subsistence goods, cash for purchase of goods, services and saving for future needs, while environmental or other shock happens; in which HGAF can do. A study in Zambia showed that some products from homegardens, particularly fruit and cabbage are important buffers during drought years (Alfred 2009) and consistent with this study.|$|R
40|$|In {{their paper}} Understanding The British Iron Age: An Agenda for Action, Haselgrove et al. (2001, iv) {{identify}} regionality {{and the nature}} of socio-economic changes as two of the five key areas of future research on the British Iron Age. As farming formed the basis of all societies in this period, and as most settlements were farmsteads and most people were farmers (ibid., 10), any assessment of regional differences and socio-economic change will have to include an assessment of farming practices. At a basic level this concerns an assessment of the scale of agricultural production (e. g. ability to produce a surplus, intensive/extensive cultivation regimes) and of the level of specialisation (e. g. crops versus animals, farming versus non-farming settlements). It goes without saying that the success of such assessments hinges on choosing the right methodology and the right scale of analysis and interpretation. To date, much discussion of intra- and inter-regional variation in Iron Age crop production has focussed on the level of specialisation, namely the identification of producer and consumer sites. A model developed by M. Jones (1985) and applied to sites in the upper Thames valley was the first apparently successful attempt to identify settlements which produced their own crops (arable or producer sites) and those which received crops that had been grown elsewhere (pastoral or consumer sites). This pioneering work brought archaeobotanical data into the forefront of mainstream archaeological debate and has stimulated much of the more recent research in this area. The model aimed to facilitate easy comparison between sites and monitor the movement of arable produce across the landscape, and the results allowed M. Jones (1996, 35) to suggest the existence of ‘neighbourhood groups of agrarian sites engaged in a common network of plant production and consumption’. While the main assumptions underlying the model and the method of constructing the diagrams were criticised early on (G. Jones 1987; Van der Veen 1987; 1991; 1992, chapter 8), the model, and the conclusions drawn from it, are still widely used. In this paper we argue that the problems associated with M. Jones’ model are such that it cannot be used to distinguish between producer and consumer sites, and that recent explanations of differences between archaeobotanical assemblages at sites in the upper Thames valley (Campbell 2000; Stevens 2003) are also flawed. Here we briefly summarise M. Jones’ model, and the criticisms it has received, and review the more recent interpretations of the observed site differences. We then approach the problem from a different angle, proposing levels of analysis and interpretation more appropriate to the data available and the questions posed. Finally, we put forward our own interpretation of the patterning observed. As the model is based on the interpretation of charred plant remains, our arguments inevitably involve detailed consideration of the formation processes at work. In this paper we try to put our case without recourse to complex archaeobotanical jargon, to keep the paper accessible to a wider readership.

40|$|Section I {{challenges}} Schultz's assertions: (1) {{small farmers}} are rational; (2) low income countries saddled with traditional agriculture have {{not the problem}} of many farmers leaving agriculture for nonfarm jobs; (3) part-time farming can be efficient; (4) economies of scale do not exist in agriculture; and (5) investment in human capital counts much more than institutional changes and {{is the key to}} agricultural growth. It reveals that ever since the 1950 s, after the land reform, the irrational and polyopolistic land use by able-bodied part-time and absent (mainly small) farmers earning higher off-farm income but unwilling to lease their insufficiently produced land beyond family consumption need to full-time farmers, has evolutionarily been a global obstacle with both public and private land ownership, traditional and modern agriculture, fragmented small and consolidatorily enlarged land, low and high income economies, food under-self-sufficiency and overproduction, and developing and developed countries, albeit land property rights have been well defined and sale/lease allowed, causing many negative consequences on agriculture, rural development, income distribution, government expenditure, competition, trade, environment, etc. (Polyopoly is designed by the author to mean the control by many sellers in contrast to monopoly and oligopoly). It has become a microeconomic root of the three persisting global macroeconomic problems: under-self-sufficiency, overproduction and agricultural protectionism. Evidence in Asia, Africa, South and North Americas, and Europe is cited. Section II argues that Hirschman ignores that it has hampered the linkage effects. Section III presents that only China has successfully exercised effective and appropriate solutions, but under public land ownership which may be unacceptable to others. Section IV indicates that effective and appropriate solutions have not been adopted under private land ownership world-wide. It presents two effective (but not appropriate) Western European legislations and their shortcomings at the under-self-sufficiency stage, and fundamental and derived dilemmas at the overproduction stage at which, without a solution, the EU (and many other developed nations) has exercised protectionism by a coupling between subsidies and production (which together with price supports, export aids and import restrictions has made their farmers less competitive and harmed their consumers and taxpayers and the developing countries). In July 2002 the EU proposed a complete decoupling, but retreated in June 2003 to allow the Member States to keep the coupling, due to no solution to avoid production abandonment caused by part-time and absent landowners' refusal to lease their irrationally and polyopolistically used land to full-time farmers at low rents, which has just exposed this microeconomic root of protectionism. Section V proposes effective and appropriate solutions for both developing and developed countries at both under-self-sufficiency and overproduction stages without changing private land ownership to achieve the following aims at the same time: minimize/abolish/prevent protectionism, while avoiding production abandonment and overproduction; reinforce full-time large farmers, whereas not crowding part-time and absent small farmers out of agriculture; reach/maintain <b>basic</b> self-sufficiency in <b>cereals,</b> meanwhile promoting multi-functionality of other agricultural and rural sectors and improving the environment. Section VI predicts the promotion of fraternity among nations if the proposed solutions could be adopted globally.
