5|$|The {{expense of}} {{resources}} during the RomanPersian Wars ultimately proved catastrophic for both empires.

5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W.

Modern nuclear plants, <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island.

2500|$|The Gemara {{employed}} [...] {{to deduce}} that one may not <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> a corpse.

5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, <b>benefiting</b> <b>from</b> {{much more}} {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls {{and came to the}} conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
