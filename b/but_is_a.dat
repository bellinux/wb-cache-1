While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the tub with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game developed by Gas Powered Games {{and published by}} Microsoft Game Studios on April 5, 2002, for Microsoft Windows, and the following year for MacOS. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the high fantasy game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn {{the nearby town of}} the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join him along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other role-playing video games of the time, the world of Dungeon Siege does not have levels <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single, continuous area without loading screens that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting character classes and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.|$|E

5|$|In August 2004, {{during the}} Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a {{training}} mission {{to assist the}} Iraqi security forces {{in conjunction with the}} US led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established {{at the request of the}} Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Meshuggah first {{attracted}} {{international attention}} with the 1995 release Destroy Erase Improve for its fusion of fast-tempo death metal, thrash metal, progressive metal and jazz fusion elements. Since its 2002 album Nothing, Meshuggah has switched from seven-string to downtuned eight-string guitars. Meshuggah {{has become known}} for their innovative musical style, complex, polymetered song structures and polyrhythms. Meshuggah was labelled {{as one of the}} ten most important hard rock and heavy metal bands by Rolling Stone and as the most important band in metal by Alternative Press. Meshuggah has found little mainstream success, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> significant act in extreme underground music and an influence for modern metal bands. In the late 2000s, the band was an inspiration for the djent subgenre within progressive metal.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, a more {{detailed}} classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in this system is chuantongxi, traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is xinbian de lishixi, historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> major focus today. The final category is xiandaixi, contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear, among others.|$|E

5|$|Some doubt {{exists as}} to whether the current {{classification}} accurately represents relationships within the Banksia spinulosa complex. B.spinulosa var.collina is a form of inland gorges and tablelands in central Queensland, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> coastal plant on the New South Wales central and north coast. B.spinulosa var.spinulosa, on the other hand, is coastal in central Queensland and in New South Wales south of Sydney. Similarly, B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii is widely separated between New South Wales and Victorian forms (where the longer leaved form was originally called B.prionophylla by Meissner). Notably both B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.collina in northern Queensland have old spikes bare as opposed to them having persistent old flower parts in New South Wales and Victoria. Mast listed B.spinulosa var.collina and B.spinulosa var.neoanglica as sister clades in 1998, with B.spinulosa var.spinulosa and B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii flanking these. Alex George also reports that the taxon should be reviewed. A molecular study with specimens of each subspecies from the three mainland eastern states they occur would shed light on this matter.|$|E
5|$|The tenth and {{eleventh}} {{books of}} the Bhagavata Purana are widely {{considered to be a}} poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the Harivamsa. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (lila), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king. Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in Harivamsa, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> symbolic universe in the Bhagavata Purana, where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always. The Bhagavata Purana manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.|$|E
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
