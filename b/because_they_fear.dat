The information found at Valor por Tamaulipas is shared by Internet users themselves; the administrator, on the other hand, was active almost all hours during the day and throughout the whole week. Most of the Mexican mainstream media outlets play down the violence <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> reprisals from the country's criminal organizations. Given the censorship, Valor por Tamaulipas was a popular outlet for crime watchdogs concerned with the violence in Tamaulipas. According to crime journalist James Barger from InSight Crime, the information in Valor por Tamaulipas is [...] "spotty, sometimes unreliable, but often the only source of what [...] happening". Several Internet users in Mexico, the United States, and in other countries around the world have shown their support for Valor por Tamaulipas' work and have followed their reports on Facebook and/or Twitter.|$|E
500|$|German {{scholars}} such as Brigitte Schön and Gerald Willms have {{commented that}} rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany: in their view, efforts to [...] "frame" [...] information {{in such a way}} as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities. In Schön's words, this includes both the [...] "efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements" [...] and [...] "Scientology's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution"; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany, she adds that [...] "the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes". Both Willms and Schön assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of Scientology. Schön as well as Irving Hexham, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada, have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars. Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany, which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate.|$|E

2500|$|In Chomsky's view, {{the truth}} about {{political}} realities is systematically distorted or suppressed through elite corporate interests, who use corporate media, advertising, and think tanks to promote their own propaganda.

In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of [...] "monsters" [...] such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic. The film Blade Runner (1982) and the novels The Boys From Brazil (1976) and The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896) depict elements of such scenarios, but Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein is most often alluded to by critics who suggest that biotechnologies could create objectified and socially unmoored people as well as subhumans.
