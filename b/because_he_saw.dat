5|$|When Henry died in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, {{inherited}} the throne. Edward was a precocious {{child who had}} been brought up as a Protestant, but was initially of little account politically. Edward Seymour was made Lord Protector. He was commissioned as virtual regent with near sovereign powers. Now made Duke of Somerset, he proceeded at first hesitantly, partly because his powers were not unchallenged. When he acted it was <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the political advantage in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely {{symbolic}} and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is physical reality.|$|E
5|$|Endecott was a zealous and {{somewhat}} hotheaded Puritan, with Separatist {{attitudes toward the}} Anglican Church. This sometimes put him at odds with Nonconformist views that were dominant among the colony's early leaders, which became apparent when he gave shelter to the vocally Separatist Roger Williams. Endecott also argued that women should dress modestly and that men should keep their hair short, and issued judicial decisions banishing individuals who held religious views that did not accord well {{with those of the}} Puritans. He notoriously defaced the English flag <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> St George's Cross {{as a symbol of the}} papacy, and had four Quakers put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment. An expedition he led in 1636 is considered the opening offensive in the Pequot War, which practically destroyed the Pequot tribe as an entity.|$|E
50|$|Capp had {{supported}} the Progressive Conservative Party from about 1977 to 1987, but abandoned it <b>because</b> of what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as scandals and financial incompetence of the Mulroney government.|$|R
50|$|During {{his career}} {{he was awarded}} the British War Medal for his {{services}} during World War I, and the War Medal 1939-45 and Africa Service Medal in World War II. Probably <b>because</b> <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> active service in the field during the two world wars he would not wear ribbons on his uniform.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} ideas {{of the book is}} that the source of evil is inseparable from our world as light is from the darkness. Both Satan and Jesus Christ dwell mostly inside people. Jesus was unable to see Judas' treachery, despite Pilate's hints, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> only <b>saw</b> good in people. He could not protect himself, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> did not know how, nor from whom.|$|R
5|$|Samaras {{moved to}} Manchester City on 30 January 2006 {{for a fee}} of £6million, a record for a Greek player. He was given the number 20 shirt. Samaras stated that he was excited about moving to Manchester City, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them as being the next stage in his development. He {{also said that he}} would relish being in a team with the likes of David James, Andy Cole, and Trevor Sinclair. He made his debut for City on 1 February, as a 65th-minute {{replacement}} for Cole in a 3–0 home win against Newcastle United. His first goal for the club came in the following home match, against Charlton Athletic. The following month Samaras scored in a 2–1 home win against Aston Villa, to put City through to the quarter-finals of the League Cup. This was his fourth goal in six appearances. Samaras scored one further goal that season, in a 2–1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
5|$|Audrey and David begin feuding {{over the}} rights to the salon and Lewis notices that the arguing is taking its toll on Audrey's health. He {{suggests}} they go to Wales for a few days instead. When Audrey serves David with an injunction to try and reclaim her business, an argument breaks out and Audrey suffers a heart attack. Lewis comforts Audrey until the ambulance arrives and stays with her at the hospital. Lewis and Audrey go on holiday. On her return, Audrey reveals to her family that Lewis disappeared from the Eurostar on the way home. Lewis later turns up at the salon to see Audrey and explains that he disappeared <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Penny Thornley (Susan Hanson), a woman he once conned. Lewis asks Audrey to run away with him and she agrees. While they are packing, Audrey's family and Penny arrive. Penny reveals that she is going to call the police, but Audrey stops her and gives her the money Lewis took. When Nick refuses to give Lewis his job back, Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) hires him to work at The Rovers Return.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, while {{pitching}} for the Brujos de Guayama, Satchel Paige {{walked off}} the field and left the stadium, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a ghost {{standing next to him}} on the pitcher's mound.|$|E
50|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to find out more}} about his past, Joseph {{encountered}} the Acolytes and their leader Exodus. They too believed that Joseph was Magneto and begged him to lead them. Exodus turned on Joseph when he noticed that Joseph was not the Magneto he knew. Joseph took on the identity of Magneto in order to convince the Acolytes that he truly was Magneto and ordered them to abandon their current activities. Exodus disagreed, but obeyed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believed <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a glimmer of the old Magneto within Joseph. Joseph returned to the X-Men, satisfied that he no longer was Magneto.|$|R
5000|$|Ellis {{was born}} in Memphis, Tennessee. He grew up in Frayser, a suburb of Memphis, in a middle class/working class area. He {{always wanted to be}} an actor <b>because</b> of what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> on television.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Master's an old fidget {{to send me}} {{travelling}} up again, just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> fancied <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> something amiss at the window. Nothing but {{a curtain}} flapping, or a shadder, for the poor dears is sleeping like lambs.' We heard her say this to herself, and a general titter agitated the white coverlets as she departed.|$|R
25|$|In August 2008, Ayalon joined Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu as {{chairman}} of World Yisrael Beiteinu, opening branches of the party around the globe. Ayalon explained that Israel Beiteinu was a natural fit for him as he entered politics <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> many problems, especially with Israeli foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of his}} socialist ideals, he {{proposed}} that Power Jets be nationalised; in part <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that private companies would profit from the technology freely given during the war. By 1964 he had deserted his previously socialist beliefs, {{going so far as}} to launch a fierce attack on the Labour candidate in Smethwick.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Robert C. Ross founded one of {{the first}} {{hazardous}} waste management companies in the U.S. He began Robert Ross Industrial Disposal <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an opportunity to meet the hazardous waste management needs of companies in northern Ohio. In 1958, the company built {{one of the}} first hazardous waste incinerators in the U.S.|$|E
60|$|Horta, {{understanding}} {{nothing of}} what Tarzan said, was none the less enraged <b>because</b> of that. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> only a naked man-thing, hairless and futile, pitting his puny fangs and soft muscles {{against his own}} indomitable savagery, and he charged.|$|R
60|$|With many interruptions, and {{repeated}} insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that, in {{the surprise of}} the moment, he had run after the boy <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>saw</b> him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.|$|R
50|$|On {{a midnight}} train {{trip on the}} way to Limmeridge House as a drawing teacher, Walter Hartright sees a strange woman dressed entirely in white, {{apparently}} fleeing from someone and desperate to share a terrible secret with him. The signalman is scared <b>because</b> although <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no-one, it was predicted a year earlier that in a 'year to this day', someone would be found dead on the railway track.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} she was cast, Varsi already had an agent and had been searching for film roles for a long while, without any luck. She made rounds at several studios, but {{according}} to the actress, they all thought she was suitable for character parts only. She was even dropped by her agent in 1956, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no future in her career.|$|E
25|$|In {{just one}} season, Paige left his mark on Puerto Rican baseball. He arrived in Puerto Rico in late October, {{four weeks after}} the start of the 1939/40 winter season, and joined the Brujos de Guayama (the Guayama Witch Doctors). The town of Guayama is widely known for its Santería, Palo (religion), and other spiritualist {{religious}} practices. In a legendary game in Guayama, Paige walked off the mound <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a ghost standing next to him.|$|E
25|$|ACT Theatre (originally A Contemporary Theatre) is a regional, {{non-profit}} theatre {{organization in}} Seattle, Washington, USA. Gregory A. Falls (1922–1997) founded ACT in 1965 {{and served as}} its first Artistic director; at the time ACT was founded he was also head of the Drama Department at the University of Washington. Falls was identified with the theatrical avant garde of the time, and founded ACT <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the Seattle Repertory Theatre as too specifically devoted to classics.|$|E

50|$|George Fulton (born 10 November 1977 in Birkenhead, Merseyside, United Kingdom) is a British-Pakistani {{television}} {{journalist and}} producer. He lived in Pakistan {{for nine years}} before acquiring Pakistani citizenship, while retaining his British citizenship. On 1 March 2011 Fulton {{announced that he was}} leaving Pakistan on account of security fears and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> increasingly <b>saw</b> Pakistan as a failed state, a view that is widespread among expats who have lived in Pakistan.|$|R
5000|$|In Lost, {{one will}} see the chaotic life of one man in Hong Kong. The film follows him and finds the beauty that {{surrounds}} him; <b>he</b> is lost <b>because</b> <b>he</b> never <b>saw</b> it. I think that one can {{say that this is}} similar to Fan Ho's photographs in the sense that Hong Kong is crowded, busy and chaotic to many, but for Fan Ho, he was able to convert he found and find beauty." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{the break}} {{up of the}} Soviet Union, the new {{independent}} Ukraine had a large arsenal of nuclear weapons on its territory. However, in 1994 Ukraine agreed to give up nuclear arms, {{became a member of}} the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and within two years had removed all atomic weapons. Almost alone among observers, Mearsheimer was opposed to that decision <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a Ukraine without a nuclear deterrent as likely to be subjected to aggression by Russia.|$|E
25|$|Following the Second World War railway {{services}} suffered due to {{skill and}} coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities {{elsewhere in the}} economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Frederick Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He {{turned his attention to}} electrification, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.|$|E
25|$|Michelangelo used bright colours, easily {{visible from}} the floor. On the lowest part of the ceiling he painted the {{ancestors}} of Christ. Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with Jonah over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the Book of Genesis. He was originally commissioned to paint only 12 figures, the Apostles. He turned down the commission <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> himself as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, {{there were more than}} 300. His figures showed the creation, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Great Flood.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{an early}} jazz proponent of {{circular}} breathing. He was also Hamiet Bluiett's favorite baritone player <b>because</b> <b>he</b> [...] "never <b>saw</b> anybody else stop time"http://www.allaboutjazz.com/iviews/bluiett.htm in reference to a concert Bluiett attended where Carney held a note during which all else went silent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, boys," [...] {{said the}} voice, [...] "mind what I tell you. If I hear another word spoken about ghosts in this school, {{it will be}} the worse for all of you. There are no such things as ghosts, and {{therefore}} any boy who believes in ghosts believes in what can't possibly be; and a boy who belongs to Limmeridge School, and believes in what can't possibly be, sets up his back against reason and discipline, and must be punished accordingly. You all see Jacob Postlethwaite standing up on the stool there in disgrace. He has been punished, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a ghost last night, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is too impudent and too obstinate to listen to reason, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> persists in saying <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the ghost after I have told him that no such thing can possibly be. If nothing else will do, I mean to cane the ghost out of Jacob Postlethwaite, and if the thing spreads among any of the rest of you, I mean to go a step farther, and cane the ghost out of the whole school." ...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, he {{ceased to}} believe in the teachings of the Lutheran Church, and {{ultimately}} came not {{to believe in}} Christianity at all. <b>Because</b> of this, <b>he</b> could not in good conscience continue as a minister. At the same time he ceased to be a Lutheran. Although he left the church <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could not reconcile his beliefs with church teachings, he also left the church <b>because</b> of what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> as shabby treatment {{at the hands of the}} church hierarchy.|$|R
25|$|Einstein was {{the first}} {{physicist}} to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (h) would require a rewriting {{of the laws of}} physics. To support his point, in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum (see photon and wave–particle duality). Bohr {{was one of the most}} vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers. Bohr disliked it because it made the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary. He did not like a scientist's having to choose between equations.|$|E
25|$|Kit is {{evaluated}} {{by a state}} psychiatrist, Dr. Oliver Thredson (Zachary Quinto), to determine if he is insane or fit to stand trial. Kit reiterates that he is sane and believes the aliens to have killed those women, and that the third decapitated and skinned body is not Alma. He believes she is still alive <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her while he was being examined by the aliens. Dr. Thredson diagnoses Kit as insane, and before leaving, speaks to Sister Jude about the horrendous conditions at the asylum that he has witnessed during his visit. She rebuffs him and goes to attend to a family who has brought their son to the sanitarium. Dr. Thredson bursts into her office, offering his assistance to the parents as a professional psychiatrist, much to Sister Jude's displeasure.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact there}} is the other {{possibility}}, that + should be read as disjunction, This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give the same answer. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both Boolean rings and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, {{in the form of}} the correct evaluation of x + x. Jevons argued for the result x, which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the equation x + x = 0 as implying x = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.|$|E
50|$|When the Hibernia reaches Hope Nation, Seafort {{expects to}} be relieved, but discovers that {{not only has the}} admiral in command of the naval {{garrison}} died in a strange viral epidemic, but a captain has deserted, leaving a Hope Nation commanding officer who is junior to Seafort. Seafort finds himself in charge of all naval forces in the system. During a tour of the planet, Seafort, Amanda (with whom he has reconciled) and one of his officers run into the officer who had deserted. He is hiding in the mountains with his wife <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believes <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> meteors spraying something in the sky shortly before the epidemic broke out. Believing the man to be mad, Seafort dismisses his story as fantasy, but does not force the couple to return to civilization.|$|R
500|$|Lamason then {{proceeded}} to organise the airmen into groups by nationality and appointed a Commanding officer within each group. Lamason did not do this just to improve their morale but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> also <b>saw</b> it as his responsibility to carry on his war duties despite the adverse circumstances. Captured US pilot Joe Moser believed that Lamason also did this because if the right opportunity presented itself, the group {{would be able to}} operate much more effectively if military discipline and operations were applied.|$|R
6000|$|About tea-time on {{the third}} day--she had just changed her dress, keeping her {{appearance}} {{so as not to}} alarm him, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> noticed everything--she <b>saw</b> a difference.
