5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{first described}} the {{grey reef shark}} in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, in the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this shark around the world include black-vee whaler, bronze whaler, Fowler's whaler shark, graceful shark, graceful whaler shark, grey shark, grey whaler shark, longnose <b>blacktail</b> shark, school shark, and shortnose <b>blacktail</b> shark. Some of these names are also applied to other species.|$|E
5|$|During {{the field}} season of 1987 (early July), {{volunteer}} Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485. By {{the end of}} August, it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. On 23 June 1988, another site was discovered in the vicinity – the <b>Blacktail</b> Creek North. In the summer of 1989, graduate student Scott D. Sampson joined the team, wanting to study {{the function of the}} frill display structures in horned dinosaurs. At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the <b>Blacktail</b> Creek.|$|E
5|$|Carcharhiniformes: Commonly {{known as}} ground sharks, the order {{includes}} the blue, tiger, bull, grey reef, blacktip reef, Caribbean reef, <b>blacktail</b> reef, whitetip reef, and oceanic whitetip sharks (collectively called the requiem sharks) {{along with the}} houndsharks, catsharks, and hammerhead sharks. They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack.|$|E

5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The <b>blacktail</b> reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as the grey reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from the grey reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded the grey reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E
25|$|Heights of {{the tallest}} willows in the <b>Blacktail</b> Creek area {{increased}} {{from less than}} 50cm to more than 250cm between 1997 and 2003. Additionally, canopy cover over streams increased significantly, from only 5% {{to a range of}} 14-73%.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} extant vacation homes, dude ranches {{and small}} working ranches include Dick and Ethel Reimer House, built in 1938 between Moose and Mormon Row {{at the end}} of <b>Blacktail</b> Butte, and the McCollister residential complex farther to the east on Antelope Flats Road. Paul W. McCollister was the primary developer of Teton Village. The McCollister compound was built and expanded between 1953 and 1987. The Aspen Ridge Ranch, in the same area, is a complex of modest log residential and agricultural buildings, built in 1910 and expanded in 1946. The Wolff Ranch, located farther north near Moran, is small dude ranch complex established in the 1940s by Stippy Wolff and Frank Allen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blacktailed</b> spurdog {{has been}} seldom studied for parasites. The 1 mm-long monogenean Triloculotrema chisholmae has been {{described}} in 2009 from three specimens found in the nasal tissue of a single shark caught off New Caledonia.T. chisholmae was the second species described in the genus Triloculotrema Kearn, 1993 (family Monocotylidae).Species of Triloculotrema appear {{to be limited to}} deep-sea sharks, either triakids or squalids (possibly etmopterids).The <b>blacktailed</b> spurdog is also the host of external parasites such as the aegiid isopod Aega angustata on the skin. Internal parasites include several trypanorhynch cestodes in the spiral intestine, such as Vittirhynchus squali and Gilquinia sp.|$|R
50|$|Climate change {{effects on}} the {{wildlife}} in temperate rainforests in the southeast region will be influenced by decreasing snow-pack and lengthening of the growing-season. Snow depth impacts foraging and herbivore animals such as <b>blacktailed</b> deer (Odocoileus hemionus), moose, and mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). Protection by snow-pack is taken advantage of by the northwestern deer mouse (Peromyscus keeni); decreasing snow-pack creates habitat concern for the deermouse. Conversely, less snow for less of time means bigger area of winter range for the <b>blacktailed</b> deer; this would create the availability of high quality foods in spring for the black tailed deer, which would ultimately decrease winter mortality.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blacktailed</b> spurdog, Squalus melanurus, is a dogfish, {{a member}} of the family Squalidae, found around New Caledonia in the central Pacific Ocean, at depths from 320 to 320 m. Its length is up to 75 cm.|$|R

Many mammals can be found around the lake and in the adjacent wilderness area, national forest, and parklands. [...] These include black bear (Ursus americanus), <b>blacktail</b> deer (Odocoileus hemionus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and mountain lion (also known as [...] "cougars" [...] or [...] "puma") (Puma concolor).

500|$|Meanwhile, Horner {{had come}} to a more complex view of the situation. He still thought that the fossil {{material}} had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a chronospecies evolving into a series of subsequent taxa. In 1992, Horner, David Varricchio and Mark Goodwin published an article in Nature based on the six-year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from Montana. They proposed that the expeditions had uncovered three [...] "transitional taxa" [...] spanning the gap between the already known Styracosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. For the moment, they declined to name these taxa. The oldest form was indicated as [...] "Transitional Taxon A", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came [...] "Taxon B" [...] – the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was [...] "Taxon C", represented by skull MOR 485 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the <b>Blacktail</b> Creek.|$|E

The kettles were formed when ice situated under gravel outwash from ice sheets melted as the glaciers retreated.|$|E

It is a subtropical, marine eel which is known from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including southern Portugal, the Mediterranean, and Morocco. It dwells at a depth range of 75-800 metres, and inhabits mud and sand on the continental slope. Males can reach a maximum total length of 60 centimetres, but more commonly reach a TL of 35 centimetres.|$|R
