An observed shift in the location of the maximum L-band copolarization return away from VV, as well as an increase in surface roughness, both occurring with increasing age of abandonment, seems to be attributable to the formation of wind ripple on the relatively vegetationless fields.

40|$|Cross-stratified {{deposits}} {{can give}} rise to a hierarchy of permeability modes, across scales, corresponding to a hierarchy of sedimentary unit types. The shape of the sample semivariogram for permeability can be largely controlled by the shape of the cross-transition probabilities of unit types having the greatest contrast in permeability. The shape of those cross-transition probabilities can be, in turn, largely determined by the variance of the lengths of those unit types. A sufficient condition for an exponential-like semivariogram is the repeated occurrence of unit types having both a contrast in permeability and a large length variance. These relationships are shown through writing the identities for spatial correlation of permeability in a hierarchical and multimodal form and {{as a function of the}} transition probabilities for the sedimentary unit types.

30|$|In this study, we {{assess the}} effect of {{transport}} in controlling the chemical weathering proxies, via its effect on grain size as well as chemical breakdown that occurs during the transport. Degree of alteration can be calculated based on major and trace element compositions. Typically this involves tracking the relative abundance of a water-soluble element compared to an insoluble element {{in order to assess}} the degree of alteration (e.g., Nesbitt et al. 1980). We also examine whether chemical weathering and grain size exert important influences on the trace element composition of the fine-grained sediment. If these effects dominate, then it seems unlikely that rare earth element (REE) or other trace element groups can be used as effective provenance tools. Garzanti et al. (2010) have demonstrated that in South Asia the REE character of sediment is strongly controlled by the presence of a small volume of ultra-dense minerals, such as zircon and monazite and that these in turn are subject to hydrodynamic sorting and concentration so that differences between sediments from different rivers may be small compared to differences between different grain size fractions in a single point <b>bar</b> <b>deposit.</b>|$|E

Based on lithologic correlations, these two units were determined to be the informally named Casey and Freiburg members of the Middle Atoka. Thickness information based on picked tops was used to create isopach maps of the units of interest. The log signatures and geometry of the sand bodies indicate that they were deposited in a deltaic system that prograded across this portion of this basin.

40|$|The {{connectivity}} between SAGD pair-wells {{is the key}} {{for success}} of SAGD processes. The bituminous sands of Corner field situate in middle McMurray, where tidal influenced meandering fluvial point bar dominate the deposits. Thus, to characterize the internal structure of point <b>bar</b> <b>deposit</b> is essential to optimize SAGD production in Corner field. The aim of this thesis is to investigate correspondences between point bar internal structures and VSP responses. Since VSP preserve higher frequency than surface seismic thus VSP data would provide more precise identification and characterization of internal structures if we can recognize them from data. These investigations are done by comparing actual data, synthetic data and targets part in the model. Prior to the comparisons, {{we need to build}} a model that preserves the characteristics of our targets in subsurface as accurate as possible. We decompose the segment of logging data corresponding to the thickness of point bar deposits into a function which is able to represent the influence of gravity on deposition and a function that is able to imply the affect of current. After examining relation between borehole and inclined units of point bar structure, two scaled functions are combined in a way which can produce structures of point bar deposits. As soon as a realistic model is constructed, VSP simulations proceed. Based on the comparison of plane wave source VSP data with the model, it is found that variation of travel-time difference between two levels indicate heterogeneities between these levels. Since finite difference used in this thesis is based on acoustic wave propagation, only travel-time is investigated. While if an elastic modeling is available, the results will be more fruitful with respect to amplitudes variation and wave conversion.

40|$|Upper Miocene heterozoan carbonates crop out {{extensively}} in a NE-SW-trending belt (42 km long and 1. 5 - 8 km wide) along the so-called El Alcor topographic high, from Carmona to Dos Hermanas (Seville, S Spain). These carbonates formed {{at the southern}} active margin of the Guadalquivir Basin, the foreland basin of the Betic Cordillera. They change to marls basinward (NE) and to sands landward (SE and SW). Therefore, carbonate production was constrained to a limited area in an otherwise siliciclastic shelf. The carbonates (up to 40 m thick) overlie a gradually coarsening-upward succession of marls followed by silts and sandstones. The carbonate sequence {{can be divided into}} three subunits corresponding, frombottom to top, to lowstand, transgressive, and highstand system tract deposits. The lower subunit, exhibiting extensive trough cross-bedding, is interpreted as a shallow-water <b>bar</b> <b>deposit.</b> The intermediate subunit onlaps underlying sediments and was deposited in deeper, lowturbulence conditions. The upper subunit deposits accumulated in a well-oxygenated outer platform based on benthic foraminiferal assemblages. The presence of hummocky and swaley cross-stratification in these latter deposits suggests that theywere affected by storms. Pervasive fluid-escape structures are also observed throughout the carbonates. The three subunits consist of bioclastic packstones to rudstonesmade up of abundant fragments of smallmytilids. Isotopic data from serpulid polychaete Ditrupa tubes show 13 C-depleted values (up to − 16. 1 ¿), whereas δ 18 O yields normal marine values. Additional isotopic data on shells of scallops, oysters, and small mussels, as well as bulk sediment, show diagenetic alterations. Based on actualistic examples of massive concentrations of mussels, the nearly monospecific composition of the El Alcor deposits, together with negative δ 13 C values of Ditrupa tubes, indicates that cold seeps presumably promoted carbonate formation. However, the absence of typical features of cold-seep deposits, such as authigenic carbonatesmediated by anaerobic bacterial activity and the typical chemosynthetic shelly organisms, makes the large carbonate body of El Alcor an unusual cold-seep deposit...|$|E
40|$|Quaternary {{alluvial}} fans, and shorelines, spits {{and beach}} bars were dated using 10 Be terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) surface exposure methods in Death Valley. The 10 Be TCN ages show considerable variance on individual surfaces. Samples {{collected in the}} active channels date from ~ 6 ka to ~ 93 ka, showing that there is significant 10 Be TCN inheritance within cobbles and boulders. This suggests that the predominantly bedrock hillslopes erode very slowly and sediment is transferred very gradually in most regions within Death Valley. Comparisons of 10 Be TCN ages on alluvial fan surfaces with chronostratigraphies based on soil development and optically stimulated luminescence dating show that minimum 10 Be TCN ages within sample sets on individual surfaces most closely approximate {{to the age of}} landforms that are younger than ~ 70 ka. Alluvial fan surfaces older than ~ 70 ka have begun to undergo sufficient erosion such that the majority of 10 Be TCN ages for datasets on individual surfaces probably underestimate the true age of the surface due to erosion and exhumation of fresh cobbles and boulders. The spread of 10 Be TCN ages for beach bars near Beatty Junction and shorelines ~ 8 km south of Furnace Creek is large, ranging from ~ 119 ka to ~ 385 ka and ~ 109 ka to ~ 465 ka, respectively. New and previously published luminescence ages and soil development suggest that these landforms may have formed during marine isotope stage (MIS) 2 (~ 22 – 18 ka), but these younger ages may reflect elluviation of material into the <b>bar</b> <b>deposit</b> long after deposition, and hence the younger ages do not record the true antiquity of the landforms. This disparity between dates determined by different dating methods and the large spread of TCN ages suggests that the cobbles and boulders have considerable inherited 10 Be concentrations, suggesting that the clasts have been derived from older shorelines or associated landforms. These results highlight the problems associated with using surface cobbles and boulders to date Quaternary surfaces in Death Valley and emphasizes the need to combine multiple, different dating methods to accurately date landforms in similar dryland regions elsewhere in the world. However, these results highlight the potential to use TCN methods, when used in combination with other dating techniques, to examine and quantify processes such as sediment transfer and denudation in drylands.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). Oolitic ironstones occur within the Lower Palaeozoic Welsh Basin as isolated deposits found over a wide geographical area. There are two phases of ironstone deposition, a minor Upper Arenig phase and a Mid-Ordovician (Upper Llanvirn to basal Caradoc) phase. Both correlate with eustatic falls of sea level which exposed the Irish Sea Landmass lying immediately to the northwest. This exposure resulted in deep chemical weathering and generation of lateritic soils. Erosion of this material formed the source for the oolitic' ironstones in the Welsh Basin. The ironstones formed above stratigraphic hiatuses on sediment starved shallow water shoals, formed by synsedimentary faulting. These shoals were the favourable sites for the formation of berthierine peloids, which formed the nuclei for ooids. Additionally, they were also the site for the accumulation of berthierine mud, which was closely linked with the development of ferruginous algal mats. Bacterial reduction of organic material associated with ironstones, supplied the necessary reducing conditions for the formation and preservation of berthierine from a kaolinite/iron oxide precursor. Ooids formed by rolling over the muddy surface and mechanically accreting berthierine. Subsequent tidal current reworking of this sediment resulted {{in the formation of the}} characteristic lithological features of the ironstones, representing a shallowing-up sequence. Progressive current winnowing led to the formation of a sequence with an upward increasing ooid content and decreasing mud content. The upper facies of the ironstones is an ooid <b>bar</b> <b>deposit</b> worked by tidal currents. Cessation of current reworking allowed faunal colonisation of the bar with significant bioturbation of the sediment, destroying primary sedimentary structures. The presence of some grain-ironstones indicate the original sedimentary state of the upper facies. Tectonic instability during deposition, by synsedimentary faulting, resulted in the formation of disturbed ironstones, and debris flows within the ironstone sequences. Many features of the ironstones are diagenetic in origin, especially the formation of phosphate nodules within the ironstone sequence. These formed just below the sediment/sea water interface, and some nodules were reworked into overlying beds. The source was phosphorus released from adsorption on clays and iron oxides, and also released from organic material. Later siderite development in the ironstones is indicated by the presence of primary cements in grain-ironstones and secondary alterations in pack-ironstones. The generation of diagenetic siderite was dependant upon the amount of organic material within the ironstones, bacterial reduction of which resulted in the formation of bicarbonate and ferrous ions. Sane ironstones were subsequently altered during the Caradoc phase of volcanic activity. The formation of magnetite and stilpnomelane within the ironstones were caused by metasanatic activity associated with dolerite sills and microgranite intrusions. Siderite alteration and base metal sulphides resulted fram late stage hydrothermal activity by some microgranites. Contact metarrorphism by granophyric intrusions led to the extensive replacement of the ironstones by pyrite. Regional metarrorphism resulted in the progressive change of berthierine to chamosite and increased lattice ordering of chamosite...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} between September 2010 and December 2011, Christchurch was shaken {{by a series of}} strong {{earthquakes}} including the MW 7. 1 4 September 2010, Mw 6. 2 22 February 2011, MW 6. 2 13 June 2011 and MW 6. 0 23 December 2011 earthquakes. These earthquakes produced very strong ground motions throughout the city and surrounding areas that resulted in soil liquefaction and lateral spreading causing substantial damage to buildings, infrastructure and the community. The stopbank network along the Kaiapoi and Avon River suffered extensive damage with repairs projected to take several years to complete. This presented an opportunity to undertake a case-study on a regional scale of the effects of liquefaction on a stopbank system. Ultimately, this information can be used to determine simple performance-based concepts that can be applied in practice to improve the resilience of river protection works. The research presented in this thesis draws from data collected following the 4 th September 2010 and 22 nd February 2011 earthquakes. The stopbank damage is categorised into seven key deformation modes that were interpreted from aerial photographs, consultant reports, damage photographs and site visits. Each deformation mode provides an assessment of the observed mechanism of failure behind liquefaction-induced stopbank damage and the factors that influence a particular style of deformation. The deformation modes have been used to create a severity classification for the whole stopbank system, being ‘no or low damage’ and ‘major or severe damage’, in order to discriminate the indicators and factors that contribute to ‘major to severe damage’ from the factors that contribute to all levels of damage a number of calculated, land damage, stopbank damage and geomorphological parameters were analysed and compared at 178 locations along the Kaiapoi and Avon River stopbank systems. A critical liquefiable layer was present at every location with relatively consistent geotechnical parameters (cone resistance (qc), soil behaviour type (Ic) and Factor of Safety (FoS)) across the study site. In 95 % of the cases the critical layer occurred within two times the Height of the Free Face (HFF,). A statistical analysis of the geotechnical factors relating to the critical layer was undertaken in order to find correlations between specific deformation modes and geotechnical factors. It was found that each individual deformation mode involves a complex interplay of factors that are difficult to represent through correlative analysis. There was, however, sufficient data to derive the key factors that have affected the severity of deformation. It was concluded that stopbank damage {{is directly related to the}} presence of liquefaction in the ground materials beneath the stopbanks, but is not critical in determining the type or severity of damage, instead it is merely the triggering mechanism. Once liquefaction is triggered it is the gravity-induced deformation that causes the damage rather than the shaking duration. Lateral spreading and specifically the depositional setting was found to be the key aspect in determining the severity and type of deformation along the stopbank system. The presence or absence of abandoned or old river channels and point bar deposits was found to significantly influence the severity and type of deformation. A review of digital elevation models and old maps along the Kaiapoi River found that all of the ‘major to severe’ damage observed occurred within or directly adjacent to an abandoned river channel. Whilst a review of the geomorphology along the Avon River showed that every location within a point <b>bar</b> <b>deposit</b> suffered some form of damage, due to the depositional environment creating a deposit highly susceptible to liquefaction...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Presentation date: 1981 - 05 - 04 Twelve rock units, from upper Eocene {{to middle}} Miocene are exposed in the Nicolai Mountain-Gnat Creek area. They are, from oldest to youngest: Pittsburg Bluff Formation; Oswald West {{mudstone}}; Big Creek sandstone, upper Silver Point mudstone, and Pipeline mudstone {{members of the}} Astoria Formation; Depoe Bay Basalt; Grande Ronde Basalt; Cape Foulweather Basalt; and sandstone correlative to the Vantage Member of the Ellensburg Formation; Frenchman Springs Member of the Wanapum Basalt; Clifton, Formation (defined by author); and Pomona Member of the Saddle Mountains Basalt. Upper Eocene Pittsburg Bluff Formation is a fine-grained sandstone and laminated siltstone deposited in an inner to middle continental shelf environment. Concordant onlapping by the upper Oligocene, middle shelf to upper slope glauconitic Oswald West mudstone, establishes a tie between the northeastern and northwestern Oregon Coast Range stratigraphies. The lower to middle Miocene Astoria Formation represents another marine onlap sequence, beginning with the fine-grained cross-bedded inner shelf Big Creek sandstone member. The overlying laminted upper Silver Point and Pipeline mudstone members were deposited in a deepening middle shelf to upper slope environment. The middle Miocene tholeiitic basalts extruded from two sources. Grande Ronde, Frenchman Springs, and Pomona basalts of the Columbia River Group erupted from fissures east of the Cascades and flowed down an ancestral Columbia River valley entering the sea in the study area. Simultaneously, petrologically similar but less voluminous Depoe Bay and Cape Foulweather are correlative to the low MgO Grande Ronde and Frenchman Springs in the study area. Abundant dikes and sills and the bathyal mudstone interbeds suggest that the coastal pillow basalts extruded locally onto the sea floor. Subaerial plateau-derived flows are associated with cross-bedded, fluvial to shallow marine arkosic sandstone interbeds. Some of these subaerial lavas flowed into the sea, forming "lava deltas" of foreset pillow palagonite and possibly "invasive" sills. The basalt stratigraphy allows a nearly flow by flow correlation of Grande Ronde and Frenchman Springs units from the Clackamas River area (Western Cascades) into this study area. The presence of Pomona Member {{in this area is}} the first substantiated recognition of this petrologically and chemically distinctive subaerial flow in northwestern Oregon. The 200 -meter thick Clifton formation (previously called the Pliocene (?) sandstone at Clifton) is now dated by diatom assemblages and stratigraphic position as middle Miocene in age. Three lithofacies are recognized. Facies 1, at the base and top of the unit, is an arkosic, fine- to coarse- grained sandstone with cross-bedding, vertical Rosselia burrows, lignitic coal beds, and rare molluscan shells. It represents a river mouth and shallow marine offshore <b>bar</b> <b>deposit.</b> Facies 2, {{in the middle of the}} formation, consitst of well-laminated diatom-bearing carbonaceous and micaceous shelf/slope siltstones with thin fine-grained turbidite sandstones. Facies consists of channelized siltstone breccias, chaotic debris flows, thick amalgamated arkosic grain flows, structureless sandstones, and minor volcanic pebble conglomerates. These lithologies suggest a canyon head and slump deposit formed as a submarine channel cut into the shelf/slope siltstones of Facies 2. Sandstone petrography and grain size analyses indicate that the detritus of the Clifton and other sandstones in the area was derived from acid igneous, metamorphic, and intermediate volcanic provenances similar to those drained by the Columbia River today. Despite high measured permeabilities, breaching limits the reservoir potential of the sandstone. Mudstone units are immature to mature hydrocarbon source rocks. A potential for gas exists in the Cowlitz or its equivalent in the subsurface and in the Clifton channel sandstones projected into the offshore area...|$|E

Therefore, understanding where the river was and how quickly it migrated in the past aids in predicting buried site potential. This study investigates the sedimentology and geochronology of paleochannel deposits along the Lower Ohio River floodplain. A series of low, wide swales are prominent features in a series of bottoms in a ~ 40 km section of the river valley downstream from the Falls of the Ohio. Previous studies in Knob Creek Bottom indicate that one of these paleochannel swales was active during the early Holocene, roughly 10 K to 7. 4 K rcybp. The positioning of the others suggest that they are the remains of a single channel that flowed {{on the west side of}} the river valley during the early Holocene.

Fluvial channel deposits consist primarily of: (1) inclined siltstone stratasets up to 4. 5 m thick and 25 m wide interpreted as point <b>bar</b> <b>deposits,</b> and (2) symmetrically infilled siltstone stratasets up to 2. 4 m thick and 14 m long that may represent avulsion crevasse channels. Both types of channels are dominated by climbing ripple cross-laminae and plane bed laminae, but trough cross-beds are also present, as are several types of soft-sediment deformation structures and desiccation cracks.

Ushinori (Ushinori-yama) located {{in the southern part}} of Okazaki City, Aichi Prefecture. Our purpose in this study was to infer the depositional condition and paleogeography of the study area from analysis of the preferred orientation and imbrication of clasts in the conglomerate beds, but it has not yet been achieved. The studied conglomerate section is about 5 m thick, shows an upward-fining trend, and contains trace fossils of Ophiomorpha isp. In the upper part of the section, we found preferred orientations of granules and pebbles that are similar to each other at six stratigraphic sites, and also an ESE-dipping imbrication at one site. We also present clast fabric measurements from modern foreshore and fluvial lateral <b>bar</b> <b>deposits...</b>|$|R
50|$|Gotland {{is made up}} of a {{sequence}} of sedimentary rocks of a Silurian age, dipping to the south-east.The main Silurian succession of limestones and shales comprises thirteen units spanning 200 to 500 m of stratigraphic thickness, being thickest in the south, and overlies a 75 to 125 m thick Ordovician sequence.It was deposited in a shallow, hot and salty sea, on the edge of an equatorial continent. The water depth never exceeded 175 to 200 m, and shallowed over time as bioherm detritus, and terrestrial sediments, filled the basin. Reef growth started in the Llandovery, when the sea was 50 to 100 m, and reefs continued to dominate the sedimentary record. Some sandstones are present in the youngest rocks towards the south of the island, which represent sand <b>bars</b> <b>deposited</b> very close to the shore line.|$|R
40|$|Outcrop and {{petrographic}} {{studies of}} the Eocene Green River and Colton formations in the Uinta basin, Utah, document the facies architecture and heterogeneity characteristic of lacustrine reservoirs. A southwest-northeast transect of Eocene strata in the Uinta basin records three main marginal lacustrine depositional environments: fluvial, deltaic, and wave-dominated. Heterogeneity exists between and within individual depositional systems. Reservoir rocks of Outcrops One and Two (the flu vial facies of the Colton Formation and the deltaic facies of the Green River Formation, respectively) consist of 2 to 18 m thick lenticular, tabular, or undulatory channel-fill, distributary channel, and distributary mouth <b>bar</b> <b>deposits</b> that are partially to entirely compartmentalized, or encased, by mudstone units. These reservoir analog intervals are dominated by large­ scale heterogeneity, in that sand bodies show a variety of connectivity and lateral continuity. Small-scale heterogeneity exists within these sand bodies {{in the form of}} mud chip lag surfaces, large mud clast horizons, and discontinuous finer-grained beds. These features add complexity to the systems by reducing flow transmissibility or acting as flow baffles. The complex heterogeneity characteristic of these reservoir analogs confirms the need for detailed reservoir characterization studies on all scales in order to improve exploration and production efficiency in such systems. Outcrop Three (the wave-dominated facies of the Green River Formation) is dominated by thinner (2 to 4 m) tabular and laterally extensive offshore <b>bar</b> <b>deposits</b> that are compartmentalized by mudstone units. Large-scale heterogeneity is minimized in these reservoir analogs, in that sand bodies exhibit excellent lateral continuity and less complex amalgamation. Therefore, documentation of the smaller-scale heterogeneities (similar to those mentioned in the previous two outcrops) is necessary to better address exploration and production potential in these types of reservoirs. Data collected in this study were utilized in geostatistical simulations and fluid flow models in an attempt to document the effects of reservoir heterogeneity on hydrocarbon exploration and production efficiency in lacustrine basins. Further studies of this type are necessary if predictable classification systems and hierarchies of bounding surfaces are to be derived for lacustrine reservoirs. (152 pages...|$|R
40|$|Accurate dating is {{necessary}} to get insight in the temporal variations in sediment deposition in floodplains. The interpretation of such dates is however dependent on the fluvial architecture of the floodplain. In this study we discuss the fluvial architecture of three contrasting Belgian catchments (Dijle, Geul and Amblève catchment) and how this influences the dating possibilities of net floodplain sediment storage. Although vertical aggradation occurred in all three floodplains during {{the last part of}} the Holocene, they differ in the importance of lateral accretion and vertical aggradation during the entire Holocene. Holocene floodplain aggradation is the dominant process in the Dijle catchment. Lateral reworking of the floodplain sediments by river meandering was limited to a part of the floodplain, resulting in stacked point <b>bar</b> <b>deposits.</b> The fluvial architecture allows identifying vertical aggradation without erosional hiatuses. Results show that trends in vertical floodplain aggradation in the Dijle catchment are mainly related to land use changes. In the other two catchments, lateral reworking was the dominant process, and channel lag and point <b>bar</b> <b>deposits</b> occur over the entire floodplain width. Here, tracers were used to date the sediment dynamics: lead from metal mining in the Geul and iron slag from ironworks in the Amblève catchment. These methods allow the identification of two or three discrete periods, but their spatial extent and variations is identified in a continuous way. The fluvial architecture and the limitation in dating with tracers hampered the identification of dominant environmental changes for sediment dynamics in both catchments. Dating methods which provide only discrete point information, like radiocarbon or OSL dating, are best suited for fluvial systems which contain continuous aggradation profiles. Spatially more continuous dating methods, e. g. through the use of tracers, allow to reconstruct past surfaces and allow to reconstruct reworked parts of the floodplain. As such they allow a better reconstruction of past sedimentation rates in systems with important lateral reworking. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 80 - 86) Includes digitized image(s) in TIFF format. The Plio-Pleistocene marine lower Saugus Formation is well {{exposed in}} the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California. The lower Saugus is composed mostly of interfingering sandstone, coquinite, and conglomerate deposits, with rare occurrences of intrasparrudite limestone and laminated mudstone. The beds unconformably overlie the Miocene Modelo Formation {{throughout most of}} the study area. The lower Saugus, in the study area, is interpreted to represent a fluvial-dominated delta that is herein named the "Simi Delta". Lithosomes interpreted to be prodelta deposits include clast-supported phosphorite conglomerate and intensely bioturbated, fine to medium sandstone. Delta-front deposits include bedded medium sandstone, serpulid-bearing sandstone, and oyster-pecten coquinites. Distributary-mouth <b>bar</b> <b>deposits</b> are composed of well sorted, parallel-laminated, medium sandstone. Interdistributary bay deposits are composed of poorly sorted, silty, fine sandstone and commonly contain abundant macrofossils. A laminated, lensoidal mudstone, exposed in the Gillibrand Quarry area, is interpreted to represent an abandoned channel which was filled with clay. In Browns Canyon, an angular discordance which is interpreted to represent the transition between topset and foreset beds on a Gilbert-type delta is exposed stable or slightly emergent. This Gilbert-type delta requires a tectonic regime to form. In the Gillibrand Quarry area, where distributary-mouth <b>bar</b> <b>deposits</b> are exposed, a subsiding receiving basin is required. This difference in tectonic regimes suggests that the "Simi Delta" consisted of at least two different delta lobes, which were formed at two different times. Provenance includes an igneous, a high-rank metamorphic, and a reworked sedimentary source. The presence of anorthosite and gneissic clasts indicates that during the Plio-Pleistocene, the San Gabriel Mountain complex was a highland and was shedding these distinctive clasts into the westward-flowing Plio-Pleistocene Santa Clara River which deposited its sediment on the "Simi Delta". Between 1, 000, 000 and 70, 000 years before present, the Santa Susana Mountains were uplifted causing the Pleistocene Santa Clara River to shift to its present course and abandon the "Simi Delta" depositional site...|$|R
40|$|The depositional {{stratigraphy}} of within-channel {{deposits in}} sandy braided rivers {{is dominated by}} a variety of barforms (both singular `unit' bars and complex `compound' bars), as well as the infill of individual channels (herein termed `channel fills'). The <b>deposits</b> of <b>bars</b> and channel fills define the key components of facies models for braided rivers and their within-channel heterogeneity, knowledge of which is important for reservoir characterization. However, few studies have sought to address {{the question of whether the}} <b>deposits</b> of <b>bars</b> and channel fills can be readily differentiated from each other. This paper presents the first quantitative study to achieve this aim, using aerial images of an evolving modern sandy braided river and geophysical imaging of its subsurface deposits. Aerial photographs taken between 2000 and 2004 document the abandonment and fill of a 1 3 km long, 80 m wide anabranch channel in the sandy braided South Saskatchewan River, Canada. Upstream river regulation traps the majority of very fine sediment and there is little clay (< 1 %) in the bed sediments. Channel abandonment was initiated by a series of unit bars that stalled and progressively blocked the anabranch entrance, together with dune deposition and stacking at the anabranch entrance and exit. Complete channel abandonment and subsequent fill of up to 3 m of sediment took approximately two years. Thirteen kilometres of ground-penetrating radar surveys, coupled with 18 cores, were obtained over the channel fill and an adjacent 750 m long, 400 m wide, compound bar, enabling a quantitative analysis of the channel and <b>bar</b> <b>deposits.</b> Results show that, in terms of grain-size trends, facies proportions and scale of deposits, there are only subtle differences between the channel fill and <b>bar</b> <b>deposits</b> which, therefore, renders them indistinguishable. Thus, it may be inappropriate to assign different geometric and sedimentological attributes to channel fill and bar facies in object-based models of sandy braided river alluvial architecture...|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of oilfields and research on the internal configurations of mean-flow river point <b>bar</b> <b>deposits,</b> exploration of the remaining oil at the ultra-high water-cut stage has become a hot topic. The point bar {{is affected by the}} meandering fluvial deposits, and the reservoir is usually distributed in the positive rhythm. In the extra-high water-bearing period, due to the high permeability, high heterogeneity and low degree of consolation, it is easy to form a predominant channel under long-term water flood, which is unfavorable to the production of the site (Sun et al. 2004). Many scholars have studied the laws relating to physical changes in the reservoir during the ultra-high water-cut stage. The development of the superiority channel of the Guan Tao group is 34.7 % in the Gu Dao oil field, as determined by an interwell tracer test of 39 Wells (Cui and Zhao 2004).|$|R
