5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of 1712, Peter the Great ordered that further campaigns in war-ravaged regions of Finland with poor {{transportation}} networks were to be performed along the coastline and the seaways near the coast. Alarmed by the Russian preparations Lybecker requested naval units to be brought in {{as soon as possible}} in the spring of 1713. However, like so often, Swedish naval units arrived only after the initial Russian spring campaign had ended. Nominally under the command of Fyodor Apraksin, but accompanied by Peter the Great, a fleet of coastal ships together with 12,000 men - infantry and artillery - began the campaign by sailing from Kronstadt on 2 May 1713; a further 4,000 cavalry were later sent overland to join with the army. The fleet had already arrived at Helsinki on 8 May and were met by 1,800 Swedish infantry under General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt. Together with rowers from the ships the Russians had 20,000 men at their disposal even without the cavalry. The defenders, however, managed to fend off landing attempts by the attackers until the Russians landed at their flank at Sandviken, which forced Armfelt to retire towards Porvoo (Borgå) after setting afire both the town and all the supplies stored there as well as bridges leading north from the town. It was only on 12 May that Swedish squadron under Admiral Erik Johan Lillie made it to Helsinki <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> it could do.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time, a human foot and ankle {{were found in}} Twickenham. It was clear {{that all of the}} remains belonged to the same corpse, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to connect them with Thomas and no means to {{identify}} the remains. The doctor who examined the body parts erroneously attributed them to [...] "a young person with very dark hair". An inquest on 10–11 March resulted in an open verdict on the cause of death, and the unidentified remains were laid to rest in Barnes Cemetery on 19 March. The newspapers dubbed the unexplained murder the [...] "Barnes Mystery", amid speculation that the body had been used for dissection and anatomical study.|$|E

500|$|The {{crew of the}} [...] spotted Force Z at 02:20, {{reported}} their position, and fired five torpedoes, all of which missed. Based on this report the Japanese launched 11 reconnaissance aircraft before dawn to locate Force Z. Several hours later 86 bombers from the 22nd Air Flotilla based in Saigon were launched carrying bombs or torpedoes. Once the British ships reached Kuantan around 07:50, Express was sent to investigate the area, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to find. The crew of a Mitsubishi G3M [...] "Nell" [...] reconnaissance bomber spotted the British at 10:15 and radioed in several reports; the first bombers arrived {{less than an hour}} later. They ignored the destroyers and sank both Prince of Wales and Repulse by 13:20. Electra and Vampire moved in to rescue survivors of Repulse, while Express rescued survivors of the Prince of Wales. All told, the three destroyers rescued over 2,081 survivors.|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. I felt a few laps before that something was wrong <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged {{a hell of a lot}} per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E

500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I realized I was wrong <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Improbable" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B+". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called the script [...] "very witty". The two wrote that [...] "the brilliance of Chris Carter's direction" [...] allowed the viewer of the episode to see it [...] "from God's point of view". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "is not as smart as it thinks it is. But it's still pretty smart." [...] John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review {{and gave it a}} 6 out of 10 rating. He wrote that [...] "overall, this episode was amusing enough, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired [...] "lite" [...] episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it's a shame to see them do it again." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "bizarre yet amusing" [...] and said that the central numerology story [...] "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".|$|E

I heard the referee give me a warning , <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do. He kept coming in with his head.

2500|$|One of Delta State's {{most notable}} sports coaches was (Lily) Margaret Wade (1912–1995). Wade {{played on the}} {{basketball}} team for Delta State, but the school dropped the sport when she was 19. The school claimed the sport was [...] "too strenuous for young ladies". Wade responded, [...] "We cried and burned out uniforms <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else we could do." [...] Basketball was revived in 1973, and Wade was asked to coach the team. She coached the women's basketball team to three consecutive AIWA national championships and a 93–4 record, including a 51-game winning streak, at the time, the longest winning streak in women's college basketball. Wade {{was elected to the}} Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985. Today, the Division I women's basketball player of the year receives the Margaret Wade Trophy.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1991 case of R v Rowley, the {{defendant}} left notes {{in public places}} {{over a period of}} three weeks offering money and presents to boys with the intention of luring them for immoral purposes, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> lewd, obscene or disgusting in the notes, nor were they printed by a newsmagazine at the behest of Rowley, which would have invoked the element of conspiracy. [...] The judge ruled that the jury was entitled to look at the purpose behind the notes in deciding whether they were lewd or disgusting. On appeal against conviction, it was held that an act outraging public decency required a deliberate act which was in itself lewd, obscene or disgusting, so Rowley’s motive in leaving the notes was irrelevant and, since {{there was nothing in the}} notes themselves capable of outraging public decency, the conviction was quashed.|$|E
2500|$|Lifeson {{was born}} as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in Fernie, British Columbia, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, {{and raised in}} Toronto, Ontario. His stage name of [...] "Lifeson" [...] is a semi-literal {{translation}} of the surname Živojinović, which means [...] "son of life" [...] in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training {{came in the form}} of the viola, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Steve Hackett, and Allan Holdsworth; he explained in 2011 that [...] "Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> I could do with Hendrix." [...] In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer John Rutsey in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.|$|E
2500|$|On June 20, 2017, the day after. The {{opposition}} political party, National Action Party (PAN) {{denounced the}} Mexican {{government to the}} Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for suspicions of violations towards human rights and requested them, to lead an investigation citing such spying causes violations towards the article 16th of the Mexican Constitution, as well as violating article 11th of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While, {{in response to the}} accusations, Peña Nieto made public that such technology was bought and indeed used by the Mexican government, but he denied misuses, and stated that it was only used to protect Mexicans by searching for criminal by saying he [...] "also felt spied upon, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more fake than blaming the (Mexican) government", and that there was [...] "no proof"; saying he ordered the PGR an investigation and that he hoped [...] "under the law, it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government.", with {{the last part of the}} quote making journalist hacking victims feel threatened. Which forced the Mexican president to call writer of the article Azam Ahmed to tell him, he was not menacing him. However, due to his previous presidential scandals, Peña Nieto words lacked credibility to most Mexicans, with journalist like Jorge Ramos complaining about how Enrique Peña Nieto remains in power despite his illegal actions. Later on the day political rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) who competed for the presidency against EPN in 2012 and intends to compete again in 2018 as the candidate from the MORENA political party, was also revealed to be among the hacking targets, with his son also as a target. On June 23, 2017, the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) opened a case regarding the government espionage.|$|E
