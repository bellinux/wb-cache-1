40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of rapid and accurate cytopathological diagnosis in <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancers</b> is increasing due to advances in treatment modalities. Aims: We evaluated the diagnostic methods and cytologic subtypes of <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancers</b> {{to determine the}} diagnostic reliability of different bronchoscopic techniques. Material and methods: Retrospective data {{were obtained from the}} hospital files and pathological specimens of the patients with diagnosis of primary lung cancer from a period of 36 months. Cytological tumor typing was determined using histopathology of bronchoscopic forceps biopsy (FB), bronchial-bronchoalveolar lavage (BL), bronchial brushing (BB), transbronchial fine-needle biopsy. Computed tomography or ultrasonography guided transthoracic biopsy and surgical biopsies were used where the other interventional methods were inadequate for diagnosis. Results: A total of 124 patients were diagnosed during study period. 119 (96 %) of them were male. The median age was 68, ranging between 36 and 88 years. Histopathologic subtypes were determined as non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC) in 104 (83. 9 %), squamous cell carcinoma in 64 (51. 6 %), adenocarcinoma in 16 (12. 9 %), NSCC not otherwise specified in 24 (19. 3 %) and small cell carcinoma in 20 (16. 1 %) patients. The combination of FB, BL and BB established the diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma in most of the cases (92. 6 %). Conclusions: Lung cancer is seen commonly in elderly male patients with smoking history and squamous cell carcinoma is the most common cytologic type. High diagnostic accuracy can be achieved by a combination of bronchoscopic FB, BB and BL procedures.   Keywords: Bronchoscopy; Lung cancer; Bronchial brushin...|$|R

40|$|In vivo {{endoscopic}} microscopy aims {{to provide}} the clinician with a tool to assess architecture and morphology of a living tissue in real time, with an optical resolution similar to standard histopathology. To date, available microendoscopic devices use the principle of fl uorescence confocal microscopy, and thereby mainly analyse the spatial distribution of speci fi c endogenous or exogenous fl uorophores. Fluorescence microendoscopes devoted to respiratory system exploration use a bundle of optical fi bres, introduced into the working channel of the bron- choscope. This miniprobe can be applied in vivo onto the bronchial inner surface or advanced into a distal bron- chiole down to the acinus, to produce in situ, in vivo microscopic imaging of the respiratory tract in real time. Fluorescence confocal microendoscopy has the capability to image the epithelial and subepithelial layers of the pro- ximal bronchial tree, {{as well as the}} more distal parts of the lungs, from the terminal bronchioles down to the alveolar ducts and sacs.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} 15 years, new {{endoscopic}} {{methods have been}} developed {{in order to improve}} the detection of early <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancers,</b> with autofluorescence bronchoscopy being the leading technique.

To overcome these limitations, other techniques emerge including video/autofluorescence bronchoscopy, narrow band imaging, optical coherence tomography, and 'endomicroscopy' using confocal fluorescent laser microscopy. These emerging techniques provide new insight into bronchology, extending the field of exploration from the proximal bronchus down to the most distal part of the lungs, and from macroscopy to in vivo cellular imaging. In the near future, they may enable in vivo, minimally invasive, 'pathological grade' evaluation of abnormal bronchial or parenchymal lung tissue.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{in the early eighties}} for treating patients with malignancies in the tracheobronchial tract. After intravenous injection of the photosensitizers, the tumor area in the tracheobronchial tree is illuminated bronchoscopically using a laser fiber to transmit light of a specific wavelength during the procedure. Secondary tissue necrosis ensues, because of the thrombosis of the tumor vasculature leading to late tissue hypoxia. Ample data have shown that PDT is effective to obtain full depth tissue necrosis with relative sparing of the normal tissue. Local tumor control can be achieved. Competitive endoscopic techniques such as lasers and electrocautery are applicable to debulk tumor in a less selective but more immediate manner. Skin photosensitivity is a potential morbidity of PDT, especially in using the first generation photosensitizers. This limits its palliative potential. More selective and more phototoxic sensitizers in combination with the use of portable diode laser, may improve the clinical usefulness of PDT in the management of lung cancer patients. However, cost-effectiveness studies comparing PDT and other local bronchoscopic treatment modalities such as thermal lasers, electrocautery, cryotherapy, brachytherapy, whether or not in addition to external radiotherapy and chemotherapy, should be conducted to define its definite role in the palliative treatment of advanced obstructive <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Autofluorescence {{bronchoscopy}} (AFB) is {{a highly}} sensitive tool {{for the detection of}} early <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancers.</b> However, its specificity remains limited due to primarily false positive results induced by hyperplasia, metaplasia and inflammation. We have investigated the potential of blue-violet backscattered light to eliminate false positive results during AFB in a clinical pilot study. METHODS: The diagnostic autofluorescence endoscopy (DAFE) system was equipped with a variable band pass filter in the imaging detection path. The backscattering properties of normal and abnormal bronchial mucosae were assessed by computing the contrast between the two tissue types for blue-violet wavelengths ranging between 410 and 490 nm in 12 patients undergoing routine DAFE examination. In a second study including 6 patients we used a variable long pass (LP) filter to determine the spectral design of the emission filter dedicated to the detection of this blue-violet light with the DAFE system. RESULTS: (Pre-) neoplastic mucosa showed a clear wavelength dependence of the backscattering properties of blue-violet light while the reflectivity of normal, metaplastic and hyperplastic autofluorescence positive mucosa was wavelength independent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the detection of blue-violet light has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} false positive results in AFB.

50|$|Some {{evidence}} links HPV to {{benign and}} malignant {{tumors of the}} upper respiratory tract. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has found that people with lung cancer {{were significantly more likely}} to have several high-risk forms of HPV antibodies compared to those who did not have lung cancer. Researchers looking for HPV among 1,633 lung cancer patients and 2,729 people without the lung disease found that people with lung cancer had more types of HPV than noncancer patients did, and among lung cancer patients, the chances of having eight types of serious HPV were significantly increased. In addition, expression of HPV structural proteins by immunohistochemistry and in vitro studies suggest HPV presence in <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancer</b> and its precursor lesions. Another study detected HPV in the EBC, bronchial brushing and neoplastic lung tissue of cases, and found a presence of an HPV infection in 16.4% of the subjects affected by nonsmall cell lung cancer, but in none of the controls.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} a relevant prognostic role of microvessel count (MC) in non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). However, no {{evidence has been}} reported about the involvement of neo-angiogenesis {{in the development of}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>cancers.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze microvessel density both in normal and in pathological features of the bronchial tree detected concomitantly with carcinomas. In a group of 34 patients resected for NSCLC, 48 bronchial lesions (hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, moderate dysplasia and in situ carcinoma) were identified. In addition, 20 samples of normal bronchial epithelium from the same patients were analyzed. A monoclonal antibody was used in order to identify microvessels in the most intense areas of neovascularization from the bronchial specimens. MC was also analyzed in invasive components. An increased number of microvessels was observed from normal to dysplastic epithelium, including in situ carcinoma. Mean MC was significantly lower in normal, hyperplastic and squamous metaplastic epithelium than in dysplastic epithelium and in situ carcinoma. In particular, no differences were observed between normal and hyperplastic/metaplastic components, whereas a statistically significant difference appeared between the latter and dysplastic lesions. Moderate dysplasia and in situ carcinoma showed a number of microvessels in the lamina propria of their mucosa which were not significantly different from the invasive component, whereas hyperplastic/metaplastic lesions presented a much lower number of microvessels than invasive cancer. From these data it appears that normal bronchial epithelium and lesions associated with <b>cancers</b> of the <b>bronchial</b> tree show neovascularization in their stromal component. Hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, unlike dysplasia and in situ carcinoma, show a low microvessel count, and they cannot represent precursor or incipient changes in the bronchial epithelium before the fully developed in situ stage has also been reached.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against CLDN 1,- 2,- 3,- 4,- 7 proteins as well as semiquantitative estimation (IHC scores 0 – 5) were performed. Claudin IHC scores of L-ADC differed significantly from ADC (CLDN 1 : p = 0. 009, CLDN 2 : p = 0. 005, CLDN 3 : p = 0. 004, CLDN 4 : p = 0. 001, CLDN 7 : p < 0. 001, respectively) and SCC (CLDN 1 : p < 0. 001, CLDN 3 : p < 0. 001, CLDN 7 : p < 0. 001, respectively). Highly significant CLDN 3 -CLDN 4 parallel expression could be demonstrated in ADC and L-ADC (p < 0. 001 in both), which was not observed in SCC (p = 0. 131). ADC and SCC showed no correlation with smoking, whereas in case of L-ADC heavier smoking correlated with higher CLDN 3 expression (p = 0. 020). Regarding claudin expression and survival, in SCC significant correlation could be demonstrated between CLDN 1 IHC positivity and better survival (p = 0. 038). In NSCLC as a whole, high CLDN 2 expression proved to be a better prognostic factor when compared with cases where CLDN 2 IHC score was 0 – 1 vs. 2 – 5 (p = 0. 009), however, when analyzed separately, none of the histological subgroups showed correlation between CLDN 2 expression and overall survival. The claudin expression pattern was significantly different not only between the SCC–ADC and SCC–L-ADC but also between the L-ADC and ADC histological subgroups, which strongly underlines that L-ADC represents a distinct entity within the ADC group. CLDN 1 overexpression is a good prognostic factor in NSCLC, but only in the SCC subgroup. © 2016 Arányi Lajos Foundatio...|$|R
