The ZNG was {{therefore}} limited to conducting defensive operations, even though {{the actions of the}} JNA appeared to be coordinated with Croatian Serb forces. This impression was reinforced <b>by</b> <b>buffer</b> zones established by the JNA after fighting between Croatian Serb militia and the ZNG. The JNA often intervened after the ZNG had lost territory, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of areas they had captured before the JNA stepped in. The JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although most of their weaponry was sourced from Serbia's TO and the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{view of the}} JNA role in the Serb revolt {{gradually}} evolved between January and September 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was to win {{support for}} Croatia from the European Community (EC) and the United States, and he dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country.

Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from Serbia's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks. After the start of the JNA intervention in Slovenia in late June, conscripts began deserting from the JNA and very few were drafted to replace them, except in Serbia.|$|E

25|$|In clock tree {{optimization}} (CTO) clock can be shielded so {{that noise}} is not coupled to other signals. But shielding increases area by 12 to 15%. Since the clock signal is global in nature the same metal layer used for power routing {{is used for}} clock also. CTO is achieved <b>by</b> <b>buffer</b> sizing, gate sizing, buffer relocation, level adjustment and HFN synthesis. We try to improve setup slack in pre-placement, in placement and post placement optimization before CTS stages while neglecting hold slack. In post placement optimization after CTS hold slack is improved. As a result of CTS lot of buffers are added. Generally for 100k gates around 650 buffers are added.|$|E
