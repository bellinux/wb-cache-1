5|$|After being {{questioned}} sharply, Đính quickly became angry. Ray Herndon of United Press International {{asked him to}} name the country that he was referring to, but Đính dodged the question. Herndon lampooned him by saying that a national hero should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the national enemy, {{and asked him to}} call Madame Nhu, the de facto First Lady known for her anti-American comments, to get help in identifying the hostile country in question. After several reporters derisively laughed at these comments, Đính stormed out of the conference.|$|E
5|$|Although N. rajah has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape {{making it difficult to}} illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Both {{of these}} {{investigations}} began almost immediately. In {{the days following}} the tornado, Tinker's meteorologists Major Ernest J. Fawbush and Captain Robert C. Miller investigated surface and upper-air weather data from this and past tornado outbreaks, hoping to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> conditions which were favorable for tornadoes. By March 24, they had compiled several possible tornado indicators, and {{decided it would be}} difficult, but possible, to identify large tornado threat areas in the future.|$|E

5|$|Desperate {{to recover}} the money, Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and tortures Bond, {{threatening}} to kill them both {{if he does not}} get the money back. During the torture, a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money. The agent does not kill Bond, saying that he has no orders to do so, but cuts a Cyrillic 'Ш' (sh) to signify the SHpion (Russian for spy) into Bond's hand so that future SMERSH agents will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> him as such.|$|E
5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom {{and the belief that}} humanity is better off believing what it wants; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in {{understanding}} the extent of an epidemic was to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> cases. National sentinel surveillance has been implemented since 1995, but was initially restricted to high-risk areas and to attendees at sexually transmitted disease clinics, female sex workers, drug users, and long-distance truck drivers. Surveillance has gradually been expanded to 845 national sites and now also includes pregnant {{women and men who}} have sex with men.|$|E
25|$|Marc Rotenberg, President and Executive Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Professor of Information Privacy Law at Georgetown Law, {{argues that}} the Laws of Robotics should be {{expanded}} to include a Fourth Law of Robotics, That a Robot must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> itself to the public ("symmetrical identification"), and a Fifth Law of Robotics, That a Robot {{must be able to}} explain to the public its decision making process ("algorithmic transparency").|$|E
25|$|A new {{lighting}} {{legislation was}} enacted in 1736, {{setting up a}} new kind of seal oil lamp giving a better light even during winter. It was also decided that lamps on the main streets should be twenty-five yards apart (and not thirty as before). These changes were well received by the public opinion, and even in the Old Bailey Session Papers was not uncommon to read about victims and witnesses claiming to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the accused because of a better street lightning.|$|E

25|$|Defying orders, Max {{visits a}} former {{colleague}} named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne but, blind from a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity. He {{reveals that the}} resistance fighter Paul Delamare worked with Marianne in France and would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> her. Max seeks out a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph and instructs him to ask Delamare whether she really is Marianne. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop informs him that Hunter was killed while waiting {{on the ground for}} the answer. Max also hears that this whole operation might be a test, before he is given a vital job in the run-up to D-Day.|$|E
25|$|As a result, widely varying principles, emphases, and {{definitions}} {{are used to}} determine local typologies among archaeologists working in the region. Attempts to identify and bridge the gaps made some headway at the Durham conference, though it was recognized that agreement on a single method of ceramic analysis or a single definition of a type may not be possible. The solution proposed by Dessel and Joffe is for all archaeologists {{in the field to}} provide more explicit descriptions of the objects that they study. The more information provided and shared between those in related sub-disciplines, {{the more likely it is}} that they will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> and understand the commonalities in the different typological systems.|$|E
25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with {{intravascular}} contrast may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> abnormalities in {{the brain}} arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred {{as a result of}} venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.|$|E

25|$|Data mining {{requires}} {{data preparation}} which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way {{for this to}} occur is through data aggregation. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) {{in a way that}} facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent). This is not data mining per se, but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.|$|E
25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up would be something like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E
