5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust <b>bathing</b> and water <b>bathing.</b> Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust <b>bathing</b> (or water <b>bathing</b> where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. <b>Bathing</b> with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|Swimming or <b>bathing</b> {{outdoors}} was discouraged in the Christian West, {{so there}} was little demand or need for swimming or <b>bathing</b> costumes until the 18th century. The <b>bathing</b> gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{storage in}} the Pushkar Lake {{has been reduced}} alarmingly, leaving only a small puddle of water in many years during the festival season when pilgrims flock to the lake for sacred <b>bathing</b> during the Hindu holy month of Kartik, when the Pushkar Fair is held. During the 2009 Pushkar fair, the {{situation}} became very grim when the lake dried up entirely. Alternate arrangements were made to facilitate sacred <b>bathing</b> by providing water in concrete tanks {{near one of the}} upper ghats, fed by tube wells from ground water sources. While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} whether this species obtains {{all of the}} water it needs from its food or if it must also drink; however, it has been {{observed}} both drinking and <b>bathing</b> in pools of water after rain storms.|$|E

5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and a <b>bathing</b> complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure that housed the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E

Some, such as Emma Lundgren and Stüssy, have created their own designs or integrated camouflage patterns with other symbols.|$|E
5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town, having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater for the late 19th century craze for <b>bathing</b> in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and <b>bathing</b> machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following {{the opening of a}} branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of the}} country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust <b>bathing</b> and resting.

5|$|In 1901 and 1902, Caldas da Rainha welcomed 350 Boer men, women, and {{children}} who sought refuge from the ravages of the Second Boer War in their South African homeland. Initially housed in the thermal hospital, the refugees were transferred to the park pavilions {{at the onset of}} the <b>bathing</b> season. Some rented rooms in town, marveling at the low rates.|$|E
5|$|In Pakistan, {{fishermen}} {{were also}} warned {{to avoid the}} sea, and people in coastal areas were evacuated.

5|$|On 4 May a {{group of}} around forty men carried out the Acre Prison break, {{releasing}} forty-one Jews and 214 Arabs. At {{the same time a}} mortar attack was carried out on the 2nd Parachute Battalion's camp, as a diversion. The first unit to reach the prison was a platoon from the 1st Parachute Battalion, 35 minutes later. Other men from the battalion and some divisional units were <b>bathing</b> in the sea a short distance from the prison. A truck load of escaping prisoners opened fire on one unit's armoured car. The escaping truck then reached an improvised road block set up by some bathers and crashed under fire. The division's <b>bathing</b> party killed four attackers, four Jewish and one Arab escapee, and recaptured thirteen Jews. The bathers had eight men wounded during the short battle. While this was going on, the 1st Parachute Brigade was establishing a cordon around Acre and the surrounding area but no further escapees were caught.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake is {{surrounded}} by 52 <b>bathing</b> ghats (a series of steps leading to the lake), where pilgrims throng in large numbers to take a sacred bath, especially around Kartik Poornima (October–November) when the Pushkar Fair is held.
