5|$|In 1837 Euston {{railway station}} opened, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, {{and thus the}} station was built on {{what was then the}} northern boundary of the <b>built-up</b> area. Other main line termini soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the <b>built-up</b> area, making them inconvenient to reach.|$|E
5|$|Bani Zeid {{had a total}} {{land area}} of 22,249 dunams in 1945, of which 90 dunams were {{classified}} as <b>built-up</b> areas (Deir Ghassaneh was larger than Beit Rima) and 8,400 dunams were planted with olive or fig groves. Today the Bani Zeid municipality has a jurisdiction of over 21,979 dunams, of which 80.6% is cultivable land. today Beit Rima is the larger village. The <b>built-up</b> areas of the town constitute 918 dunams, 832 of which is geared towards residential areas while the remaining 86 is used for commercial, industrial and transportation purposes. The town is surrounded by olive groves, which Bani Zeid is well known for, and 14,505 dunams are planted with olive trees. The old village center of Deir Ghassaneh consists of three quarters: Harat al-Barghouti (Harat al-Fauqa), Harat al-Shu'aibi and Harat al-Tahtani.|$|E
5|$|Blade Runner has {{numerous}} deep {{similarities to}} Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including a <b>built-up</b> urban environment, {{in which the}} wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building– the Stadtkrone Tower in Metropolis and the Tyrell Building in Blade Runner. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from Metropolis when lining up Blade Runners miniature building shots.|$|E
5|$|If the broach {{is large}} enough the costs can be reduced by using a <b>built-up</b> or modular construction. This {{involves}} producing the broach in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only that section has to be replaced, instead of the entire broach.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Bayt Jibrin had 2,430 Muslim inhabitants, with a {{total of}} 56,185 dunams of land. Of this, 2,477 dunums were {{irrigated}} or used for plantations, 31,616 dunams used for cereals, while 287 dunams were <b>built-up</b> (urban) areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Isdud had a {{population}} of 4,620 Arabs and 290 Jews, {{with a total of}} 47,871 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 3,277 dunams were used citrus and bananas, 8,327 for plantations and irrigable land, 23,762 for cereals, while 131 dunams were <b>built-up</b> land.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of public {{concerns}} following the cholera epidemics and {{the findings of a}} Royal Commission, the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis (Burials Act) was passed in 1851. Under the Burials Act, new burials were prohibited in what were then the <b>built-up</b> areas of London.|$|E
5|$|Nearby villages {{have been}} subsumed into the <b>built-up</b> {{area of the}} town, so that now it {{incorporates}} High Brooms to the north, Hawkenbury to the south, and Rusthall (whose name resonates with the iron content of the rocks) to the west.|$|E
5|$|Al-Birwa's total {{land area}} {{consisted}} of 13,542 dunams (13.42 hectares), of which 59 dunams were <b>built-up</b> areas. of which 130 were Christians. Cultivable land accounted for 77% {{of the total}} land area. Orchards were planted on 1,548 dunams of which 1,500 were used for olive groves, while 8,457 were allotted to grains. The residents of the town sold 536 dunams to Jews, {{and most of the}} rest was Arab-owned.|$|E
5|$|Bedfordshire is {{a county}} in the East of England. It is bounded by Hertfordshire to the south-east, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the north, and Buckinghamshire to the west. It has an area of , and a {{population}} estimated in 2016 at 640,000, with an increase of 11% over the previous ten years. Geographically, it is mainly rural, but still the fourteenth most densely populated county of England, with over half the population living in the two largest <b>built-up</b> areas, Luton and Bedford.|$|E
5|$|Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham {{the river}} leaves behind the <b>built-up</b> area of Newbury and runs in {{generally}} rural surroundings. It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{had been}} mined at Bradford {{since at least}} the early 17th century, when the area around the pits was largely rural; it became {{increasingly}} <b>built-up</b> and industrialised as nearby Manchester expanded during the 19th century. Coal was transported from the colliery by canal and railway, but most was consumed locally by the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. In the mid-20th century a 469-yard (420 m) underground tunnel was dug to supply coal directly to the Stuart Street Power Station.|$|E
5|$|Common {{over most}} of its range in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very <b>built-up</b> habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E
5|$|Euston {{railway station}} opened in 1837, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London {{itself and the}} station {{was built on the}} northern boundary. Other termini north of London followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were outside the <b>built-up</b> area, making them inconvenient.|$|E
5|$|Henry's burial at Reading Abbey {{is marked}} by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly {{demolished}} during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The exact location is uncertain, but the most likely location of the tomb itself is now in a <b>built-up</b> area of central Reading, {{on the site of the}} former abbey choir. A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from English Heritage and Philippa Langley, who aided with the successful exhumation of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a plan {{to build}} an {{industrial}} zone on part of the Ashdod Sand Dune was approved. The plan calls for a hi-tech industrial park, events halls, and coffee shops to be built adjacent to the train station. It will cover , including 130 dunams of <b>built-up</b> space, {{with the rest of}} the area being preserved as a nature reserve. In addition, the Port of Ashdod is undergoing a massive expansion program.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers {{with the ability}} to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and <b>built-up</b> industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.|$|E
5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into <b>built-up</b> areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a major}} predator {{of smaller}} woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting attacks are successful. It hunts by surprise attack, using hedges, tree-belts, copses, orchards and other cover near woodland areas; its choice of habitat is dictated by these requirements. It also makes use of gardens in <b>built-up</b> areas, {{taking advantage of the}} prey found there.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} absorbed the coastal Deir al-Balah Refugee Camp, {{although}} it remains outside of Deir al-Balah's municipal administration. While the total land area was recorded as 14,735 dunams (14.7km² or 1,473.5 hectares) in 1997, the total <b>built-up</b> {{areas of the}} city consist of between 7,000 and 8,000 dunams (7–8km² or 700-800 hectares.) Deir al-Balah is divided into 29 administrative areas.|$|E
5|$|The present-day {{northern}} border of Somerset (adjoining {{the counties of}} Bristol and Gloucestershire) runs along the southern bank of the Avon from the Bristol Channel, then follows around {{the southern edge of}} the Bristol <b>built-up</b> area, before continuing upstream along the Avon, and then diverges from the river to include Bath and its historic hinterland {{to the north of the}} Avon, before meeting Wiltshire at the Three Shire Stones on the Fosse Way at Batheaston.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Woolhampton and the canal {{settlement}} of Aldermaston Wharf {{are the only}} significant settlements until the river enters the <b>built-up</b> area of Reading at Sheffield Lock in Theale. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide floodplain surrounding the river. In this stretch is Garston Lock, the other turf-sided lock on the navigation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{man-made}} waterways, or Lodes nearby, including Wicken Lode and Soham Lode. Researchers suggest the Fenland Lodes are Roman in origin—almost certainly Soham Lode. Other researchers disagree, presenting {{a case for}} such lodes being Anglo-Saxon or later. The Thetford catchwater (drain), constructed in 1838, runs south-west to north-east around {{the eastern edge of}} the <b>built-up</b> part of the village. It drains by gravity, into the River Great Ouse north-east of the village, at the Braham Dock drain.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of <b>built-up</b> areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E
5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, {{the valley}} floor widens, filled with farms and subdivisions as the road gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to {{increase}} in the surrounding valley and the road soon turns to the south again as it passes a <b>built-up</b> area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. A {{mile and a half}} after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opposite}} {{each other}} across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's <b>built-up</b> area began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E
5|$|As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to {{the west}} between the two rivers into {{the foothills of the}} Berkshire Downs as far as Calcot, Tilehurst and Purley; to the south and {{south-east}} {{on the south side of}} the Kennet as far as Whitley Wood, Lower Earley and Woodley; and to the north of the Thames into the Chiltern Hills as far as Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Caversham Park Village. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved floodplain. Apart from the M4 curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet floodplain. All other routes between the three <b>built-up</b> areas are in the central area, which is a cause of road congestion there.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, the {{executive}} committee of the Berlin city council proposed a site {{on the banks of}} the river Spree, roughly corresponding to the current location of the Berlin Finance Department and the offices of the Social Association of Germany. The proposal was rejected by the full city council because it would overshadow the city hall. Further proposals were put on hold for several years. After discussing many locations, in 1898, chief of construction Ludwig Hoffmann became involved and the council agreed on Molkenmarkt. The 32 <b>built-up</b> parcels of land on the site were bought up and cleared.|$|E
5|$|Melcombe Regis {{is thought}} to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, {{possibly}} either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the <b>built-up</b> area.|$|E
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through <b>built-up</b> areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E
5|$|The City of Manila is {{situated}} {{on the eastern shore}} of Manila Bay, on the western edge of Luzon, 1300 km from mainland Asia. One of Manila's greatest natural resources is the protected harbor upon which it sits, regarded as the finest in all of Asia. The Pasig River flows through the middle of city, dividing it into the north and south. The overall grade of the city's central, <b>built-up</b> areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's <b>built-up</b> area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E
5|$|The London–Brighton turnpike {{ran through}} the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road. When Britain's major roads were {{classified}} by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923, it was given the number A23. It was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1938 (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to {{the east side of}} the town by the M23 motorway, which was opened in 1975. This connects London's orbital motorway, the M25, to the A23 at Pease Pottage, at the southern edge of Crawley's <b>built-up</b> area. The original single-carriageway A23 became the A2219.|$|E
5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved {{too small for the}} football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily <b>built-up</b> area, was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street of the same name remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of skyscrapers {{was made possible}} by technological improvements {{during the middle of the}} 19th century. One of these developments was the iron framed building. Masonry buildings supported their internal floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base. In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using <b>built-up</b> plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames. These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls. The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} habitats of {{this species}} were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago, it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more <b>built-up</b> areas.|$|E
