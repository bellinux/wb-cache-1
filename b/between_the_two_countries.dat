We use comparable industry level data for 17 OECD countries and investigate the importance of horizontal and vertical spillovers, and differences between CEEC and other OECD countries. Results {{show that there is}} evidence for spillovers through vertical backward linkages between multinationals and domestic firms for all countries, but that this effect is much higher for CEEC than other OECD countries. We also find some evidence for positive effects from horizontal FDI, but these do not differ <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>country</b> groups.

40|$|We {{assess the}} effect of income {{inequality}} on life expectancy by performing separate estimations for developed and developing countries. Our empirical analysis challenges the widely held view that inequality matters more for health in richer countries than for health in poorer countries. Employing panel cointegration and conventional panel regressions, we find that income inequality increases life expectancy in developed countries. By contrast, the effect on life expectancy is significantly negative in developing countries. While the quantitative effects are small, <b>the</b> striking contrast <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>country</b> groups proves to be robust to modifications in measurement, specification and methodological choices...|$|R
