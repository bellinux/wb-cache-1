40|$|Mechanical systems {{including}} conveyor belts, <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> {{and power}} transmission belts {{are influenced by}} the lateral motion of the moving structure. This phenomenon was studied in the literature both using the theory of the continuous linear and nonlinear systems and following the multibody technique.

The contributions of the Coriolis forces, the negative stiffness linked to the transport speed, and the bending stiffness due to the transverse moment of inertia are discussed. The dynamic behavior of a prototypical belt transmission layout with two fixed pulleys and an automatic tensioner is then analyzed. The results show the effect of the transport speed on the reduction of the flexural natural frequencies of the mode shapes strictly related to the lateral motion of the belt span and evidence the design strategy that needs to be followed for a correct operation of the whole syste...|$|E

40|$|Power {{transmission}} pipes {{are widely}} present in industrial applications. Moreover, {{the physical and}} mathematical model describing the dynamics of a pipe {{is similar to that}} of many mechanical systems such as heat exchangers high-speed magnetic tapes, <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> aerial cable threadlines, and sheet production processes. All previous systems are axially moving systems. The dynamic behaviour of an axially moving system is greatly influenced from the presence of the internal flowing fluid, which affects the pipes dynamics and stability. When a critical value of the axial speed is reached, the first linear natural frequency vanishes; the straight equilibrium position loses stability and bifurcates into new equilibrium states. In the sub-critical speed range, all natural frequencies decrease as the axial speed increases and the vibration modes are complex. In actual operating conditions, pipe lines are subjected to many external disturbances, such as external excitations or dynamic disturbances exerted by the flow fluctuations induced by a volumetric pump. Some example of pump-pipes interactions can be found in literature, that highlight the great influence of pump irregularity on lines stability and system noising. When an oscillating external excitation causes a resonance, very dangerous conditions can be met and the axially moving continuum can undergo to catastrophic failures. The presence of an internal flow can cause divergence and flutter type instabilities. The fluid structures interaction analysis requires a deep investigation of the internal velocity fiel...|$|E

40|$|In most cases, {{the cutting}} of wood is {{proceeded}} at high feed speed and high cutting {{speed of the}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades.</b> The circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> teeth rotate in outer ambient and thus are source of noise with unadvisable effects on working environment. The results of the measuring the noise level of three structuraly different circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are presented in this paper. The types of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are: with six compensating slots in radial direction, with six compensating slots in tangential direction and with six sigmoid compensating slots. The diameters of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> were 350 mm. The measurements of the noise level were performed in the cutting process using the standard equipments. The circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> with compensating slots emited high cutting noise level but their noise level was different.

30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is more easily affected by thermal stress. For saving materials, the stability of <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is very important, especially for thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R

50|$|Diamond: Fixed {{onto the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade's</b> base to form diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades.</b> As diamond is a superhard material, diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> {{can be used}} to cut hard brittle or {{abrasive}} materials, for example, stone, concrete, asphalt, bricks, ceramics, glass, semiconductor and gem stone. There are many methods used to fix the diamonds onto the blades' base and there are various kinds of diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> for different purposes. High speed steel (HSS): The whole <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is made of High Speed Steel (HSS). HSS <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are mainly used to cut steel, copper, aluminum and other metal materials. If high-strength steels (e.g., stainless steel) are to be cut, the blades made of cobalt HSS (e.g. M35, M42) should be used.|$|R
30|$|When {{circular}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{is cutting}} the work piece, tangential and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> which could cause the buckling deformation of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4, the {{tensioning}} stress {{distribution of the}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model followed the same trend as previous research results [2, 6, 18]. The values of tensioning stress of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model and the measured results in radial path of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were similar in most regions. The results mentioned above demonstrated that the tensioning stress of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the model in this paper was true and reliable. The tensioning stress distribution of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after roll tensioning process was the key analysis object in the following.|$|R

In order to improve the life of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> the material is separated from the blade on both sides before the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is retracted from the cut.|$|R
30|$|For {{tangential}} tensioning stress, the tangential tensioning stress {{difference between}} {{outer edge of}} the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region was increased with yield strength when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was under the same deformation, which meant that the tensioning effect was improved with the increase of yield strength, because the greater tangential tensioning stress difference between edge of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region meant that the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> could maintain stability during large temperature differences when it was at work.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, a 2 -D and 3 -D {{finite element}} model of roll {{tensioning}} process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were established by Static/General module of ABAQUS software based on finite element method.

The effects of yield strength of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> on tensioning stress distribution and rolling force were studied. The research achievements showed that a circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength obtained a higher tangential compressive stress and radial compressive stress in the rolled region during roll tensioning process, which has both advantages and disadvantages for {{the stability of the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Besides, a circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength also put forward higher requirements for roll tensioning equipment because of the large rolling force during roll tensioning process.|$|R

The linear elastic unloading process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with initial stress field calculated by the dynamic/explicit model was established by static/general solution module. The tangential tensioning stress of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after unloading was finally obtained by the above-mentioned two models.
