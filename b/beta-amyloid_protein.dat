5|$|In 2009, {{this theory}} was updated, {{suggesting}} that a close relative of the <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein,</b> and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP {{by one of the}} same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so {{it is possible that the}} N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} water {{deprivation}} or i. p. injection of hypertonic salt solution on {{the expression of}} the amyloid precursor polypeptide (APP) were studied immunohistochemically in the rat brain, in particular in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, both known to be involved in electrolytic and water homeostasis and to contain mRNAs coding for the various forms of APP. In parallel, {{the expression of the}} immediate early gene c-fos was also studied by immunohistochemistry. Both hypertonic saline injection and water deprivation resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in the levels of amyloid precursor protein-like immunoreactivity in neurones of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei.

In contrast, no changes were observed in other brain areas, including the subfornical organ, which also contained mRNA and APP-like immunoreactivity.

[...] It is now believed to be a chaperon molecule involved in protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi. The protein contains two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that help anchoring the molecule on the ER membrane, such that its large luminal domain orients inside the ER lumen and both the N- and C-termini are facing the cytosol. ERGIC2 forms a complex with two other proteins, ERGIC3 and ERGIC32, resulting in a shuttle for protein trafficking between ER and Golgi. [...] It has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, such as <b>beta-amyloid,</b> <b>protein</b> elongation factor 1alpha, and otoferlin. Therefore, it may {{play an important role in}} cellular functions besides of being a component of a protein trafficking shuttle.More recently, a variant transcript of ERGIC2 has been reported. [...] It has a deletion of four bases at the junction of exons 8 and 9, resulting a frame-shift mutation after codon #189. The variant transcript encodes a truncated protein of 215 residues, which loses 45% of the luminal domain and the transmembrane domain near the C-terminus. This effectively abrogates its function as a protein transporter. A similar variant is also reported in armadillo. So this is not a random mutation.

Amyloid precursor protein was enriched within the cytoplasm of pyramidal and nonpyramidal neuronal cell bodies in young and old monkeys. In the neuropil, amyloid precursor protein was most abundant within dendrites and dendritic spines; few axons, axonal terminals, and resting astrocytes and microglia contained the amyloid precursor protein. At synapses, amyloid precursor protein was found predominantly within postsynaptic elements and was enriched at postsynaptic densities of asymmetrical synapses. The earliest morphological change related to senile plaque formation was an age-related abnormality in the cortical neuropil characterized by the formation of dense bodies within presynaptic terminals and dendrites and an augmented localization of the amyloid precursor protein to astrocytes and microglia. In most monkeys > 26 years of age, the neocortical parenchyma exhibited neuritic pathology and plaques characterized by swollen cytoplasmic processes, interspersed somata of neurons, and reactive glia within or at the periphery of senile plaques. Neurites and reactive astrocytes and microglia within these plaques were enriched with the amyloid precursor protein. In diffuse plaques, nonfibrillar <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was visualized within cytoplasmic lysosomes of neuronal perikarya and dendrites and the cell bodies and processes of activated astrocytes and microglia. In mature plaques, <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was associated with extracellular fibrils within the parenchyma; some cytoplasmic membranes of degenerating dendrites and somata as well as processes of activated glia showed diffuse intracellular <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity.

The goal was to identify differences in nitrosylated proteins - at cysteine residues, and {{in the composition of}} ubiquinated proteins between aging and Alzheimer's samples by using a proteomic approach. A polyclonal anti-S-nitrosyl-cysteine, a mono- and a polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody were used for the detection of modified or ubiquitinated proteins in middle-aged and aged human entorhinal autopsy brains tissues of 14 subjects without neurological signs and 8 Alzheimer's patients. Proteins were separated by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Coomassie blue and immuno-blot staining. We identified that the glial fibrillary acidic and tau proteins are more ubiquitinated in brain tissues of Alzheimer's patients. Furthermore, glial fibrillary proteins were also found in nitrosylated state and further characterized by 2 D Western blots and identified. Since reactive astrocytes localized prominently around senile plaques one can speculate that elements of plaques such as <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> may activate surrounding glial elements and proteins...|$|R

Current diagnostic criteria rely on innovative imaging and biological tools, in order to detect pathological cues from very early stages, and with best sensibility and sensitivity. STATE OF ART: Advances in neuro-imaging enabled the development of different tools to help establishing the diagnosis, such as cerebral atrophy assessment on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral metabolism study on positron emission tomography (PET). Besides, {{the increasing use of}} in vivo biological markers, combined to clinical criteria, enables to discriminate patients from healthy controls at even earlier stages. This includes studies on tau and <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>proteins</b> concentrations in the cerebrosinal fluid, and amyloid-specific radioligands uptake. Familial forms of Alzheimer represent a great model for studying early or even pre-symptomatic AD, as genetic analyses constitute a diagnosis of certainty, even though they usually evolve earlier and faster. PERSPECTIVES, CONCLUSION: Diagnostic tools are more and more numerous and performant. According to patients' clinical heterogeneity, it appears essential to associate different method to investigate, {{in order to make a}} diagnosis as early and as reliable as possible...|$|R
