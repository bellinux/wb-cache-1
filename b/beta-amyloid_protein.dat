5|$|In 2009, {{this theory}} was updated, {{suggesting}} that a close relative of the <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein,</b> and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP {{by one of the}} same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so {{it is possible that the}} N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.|$|E

Both hypertonic saline injection and water deprivation resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in the levels of amyloid precursor protein-like immunoreactivity in neurones of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei.

5000|$|The {{biological}} function of ERGIC2 protein is unknown, {{although it was}} initially identified as a candidate tumor suppressor of prostate cancer, and {{has been shown to}} induce cell growth arrest and senescence, to suppress colony formation in soft agar, and to decrease invasive potential of human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3 cells). [...] It is now believed to be a chaperon molecule involved in protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi. The protein contains two hydrophobic transmembrane domains that help anchoring the molecule on the ER membrane, such that its large luminal domain orients inside the ER lumen and both the N- and C-termini are facing the cytosol. ERGIC2 forms a complex with two other proteins, ERGIC3 and ERGIC32, resulting in a shuttle for protein trafficking between ER and Golgi. [...] It has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, such as <b>beta-amyloid,</b> <b>protein</b> elongation factor 1alpha, and otoferlin. Therefore, it may {{play an important role in}} cellular functions besides of being a component of a protein trafficking shuttle.More recently, a variant transcript of ERGIC2 has been reported. [...] It has a deletion of four bases at the junction of exons 8 and 9, resulting a frame-shift mutation after codon #189. The variant transcript encodes a truncated protein of 215 residues, which loses 45% of the luminal domain and the transmembrane domain near the C-terminus.

Amyloid precursor protein was enriched within the cytoplasm of pyramidal and nonpyramidal neuronal cell bodies in young and old monkeys. In the neuropil, amyloid precursor protein was most abundant within dendrites and dendritic spines; few axons, axonal terminals, and resting astrocytes and microglia contained the amyloid precursor protein. At synapses, amyloid precursor protein was found predominantly within postsynaptic elements and was enriched at postsynaptic densities of asymmetrical synapses. The earliest morphological change related to senile plaque formation was an age-related abnormality in the cortical neuropil characterized by the formation of dense bodies within presynaptic terminals and dendrites and an augmented localization of the amyloid precursor protein to astrocytes and microglia. In most monkeys > 26 years of age, the neocortical parenchyma exhibited neuritic pathology and plaques characterized by swollen cytoplasmic processes, interspersed somata of neurons, and reactive glia within or at the periphery of senile plaques. Neurites and reactive astrocytes and microglia within these plaques were enriched with the amyloid precursor protein. In diffuse plaques, nonfibrillar <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was visualized within cytoplasmic lysosomes of neuronal perikarya and dendrites and the cell bodies and processes of activated astrocytes and microglia. In mature plaques, <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity was associated with extracellular fibrils within the parenchyma; some cytoplasmic membranes of degenerating dendrites and somata as well as processes of activated glia showed diffuse intracellular <b>beta-amyloid</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactivity.
