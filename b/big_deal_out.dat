During the {{childbirth}} scene, gas-burners were set a distance away from a fire-proof bed.

Producer John Shiban said that the film crew made [...] "a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of the eyes" [...] to make the scene frightening. The devil sonogram was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member's wife. The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E

40|$|At {{first sight}} the "big (or all-you-can-eat) deal" seems {{excellent}} value for libraries and their users, and represents the shining {{possibilities of the}} electronic age. A more thorough-going evaluation, however, exposes dangers for libraries, their funders and publishers. This paper examines some {{of the implications of}} electronic resources for collection development. The roles and strengths of the players in the information supply chain are defined: creators, publishers, intermediaries, libraries. Traditional hard-copy procurement is analysed in terms of these roles and the concepts of authority, branding and monopoly. The fundamentals of procuring electronic resources are discussed in terms of the same roles and concepts. The advantages of the <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> are laid <b>out</b> - access to resources, low unit costs etc. The dangers are also discussed. These arise mainly from the publishers' position as monopolists. The possible effects on academic publishing of dealing with monopoly suppliers are examined. Means of avoiding or minimising these dangers - consortia, alternative publishing methods - are examined. ...|$|R
2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.".

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} if “Big Deal” journal subscription packages are a cost-effective {{way to provide}} electronic journal access to academic library users versus individual subscriptions, pay-per-view, and interlibrary loans (ILL). Design – Cost-per-article-use analysis. Setting – Public research university in the United States of America. Subjects – Cost-per-use data from 1) journals in seven <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages, 2) individually subscribed journals, 3) pay-per-view from publishers’ websites, and 4) interlibrary loans. Methods – The authors determined cost-per-use for <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> titles by utilizing COUNTER JR 1 metric Successful Full-Text Article Request (SFTAR) reports. Individual journal subscription cost-per-use data were obtained from individual publishers or platforms. Pay-per-view cost was determined by recording the price listed on publishers’ websites. ILL cost-per-use was established by reviewing cost-per-article obtained from libraries outside of reciprocal borrowing agreement networks. With the exception of pay-per-view numbers, title cost-per-use was averaged {{over a three-year period}} from 2010 through 2012. Main Results – Cost-per-article use for journals from <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> varied from 2. 11 to 9. 42. For individually subscribed journals, the average cost-per-article ranged from 0. 25 to 84. 00. Pay-per-view charges ranged from 15. 00 to 80. 00, with an average cost of 37. 72. Conclusion – The authors conclude that <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> are cost effective, but that they consume such a large amount of funds that they limit the purchase of other resources. The authors go on to outline the options for libraries thinking about <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages. First, libraries should keep <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> packages in place if the average cost-per-article is less than individual subscriptions. Second, libraries could subscribe only to the most-used journals in <b>Big</b> <b>Deals,</b> cancel the packages, and rely on ILL and pay-per-view access. Third, consortia could be joined to favourably negotiate <b>Big</b> <b>Deal</b> package prices. Fourth, <b>Big</b> <b>Deals</b> could be dropped completely.
