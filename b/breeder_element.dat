40|$|The Dounreay site, in North Scotland, {{was opened}} in 1955 {{and a wide}} range of nuclear {{facilities}} have been built and operated there by UKAEA (The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) for the development of atomic energy research. The Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR) was built between 1955 and 1957, and operated until 1977 for demonstration purposes and for producing electricity. Today, its decommissioning is {{a key part of the}} whole Dounreay Site Restoration Plan that integrates the major decommissioning activities such as the fuel treatment and the waste management. The paper presents the contract strategy and provides an overview of the BFR project which consists in the removal of the <b>breeder</b> <b>elements</b> from the reactor and their further treatment.

Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other <b>elements).</b> <b>Breeder</b> reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|R

Recent discoveries by the American University in Cairo of mummified dachshund-like dogs from ancient Egyptian burial urns may lend credibility to this theory. In its modern incarnation, the dachshund is a creation of German <b>breeders</b> and includes <b>elements</b> of German, French, and English hounds and terriers. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria, who was particularly enamored of the breed.|$|R

His collaborations with Nina Breeder * http://www.lowave.com/?language=EN&section=artists&id_artist=115 on New Reproductive Systems, films and installations received attention from The Pompidou Museum (Paris, France), Anthology Film Archive (NYC) and Guggenheim Museum (NYC).

In his work Mr. <b>Breeder</b> explores <b>elements</b> of nature, employing narrative models from other domains, such as biology, geology, politics, characterized by concepts like restraint, fluids under pressure, violence and sexuality [...] In 2009, while working on a public installation [...] "Crude Oil" [...] in the Arabic neighborhood Darom - Tel Aviv, Mr.Breeder developed an interest in the Middle East and its endangered cultures and confines.

40|$|In {{the nuclear}} sector, {{elemental}} sodium {{is being used}} as coolant in the primary circuit of fast breeder reactors. Other alkali metals or eutectics are also encountered (e. g. NaK is used for trapping hydrogen isotopes). Next to nuclear safety, classical safety is a very critical issue for the recovery, treatment and conditioning of these metals, due to their chemical reactivity. The acceptance criteria of the final waste are also quite severe. Therefore, the total costs associated to all related dismantling and treatment operations are high. The SCK•CEN (Studie Centrum voor Kernenergie / Centre d'étude de l'Energie Nucléaire) faces these questions {{as a result of}} tests carried out in the past, mainly for qualifying fast <b>breeder</b> fuel <b>elements.</b> An R&D program has been launched, focussing on all required operations from the extraction of the metal to the safe conditioning of the final waste. Five main steps were identified: (a) recovery of the metal, (b) dismantling of the process vessels and piping, (c) cleaning of the dismantled pieces, (d) treatment of the recovered alkali metals and (e) final conditioning of the waste. For the first three steps, adequate technical solutions are being developed. However, these techniques depend heavily on the initial concept and particularly on the geometry of the installation to be dismantled. Therefore, they may not be applicable in other practical cases. For the treatment of the recovered metal, the SCK•CEN has conceived and patented a new and safe process that is fully compatible with the further conditioning of the waste into an acceptable form. In this process, molten alkali metal is injected into a fluidized bed reactor containing calibrated sand particles. The fluidizing gas i...|$|R

This {{semester}} I {{was chosen}} by the Argonne National Laboratory Center for Educational Affairs as a participant in their Undergraduate Research Participation Program. For my semester project, I {{was assigned to the}} Safety Research Experiment Facilities Division (SAREF). SAREF's current task is the TREAT Upgrade Project. This project entails the design and modification of several aspects of the Transient Reactor Test Faciltiy (TREAT). TREAT, a test fast breeder reactor located at the Idaho Argonne National Laboratory, has the capacity to expose <b>breeder</b> reactor fuel <b>elements</b> to transients (short bursts of high power from the reactor). [...] . In order to realize the value of surface analysis techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy, one must obtain a comprehension of the role surfaces play, if any, in the behavior of solids. There are instances in which surfaces have been found to influence the behavior of the material as a whole. The various ways in which these effects occur have been studied by this author. The results of this study have been summarized and are included in Section 5. 0 of this report. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe article reevaluates the {{reception}} of Mendelism in France, and more generally considers the complex relationship between Mendelism and plant breeding {{in the first half}} on the twentieth century. It shows on the one side that agricultural research and higher education institutions have {{played a key role in}} the development and institutionalization of genetics in France, whereas university biologists remained reluctant to accept this approach on heredity. But on the other side, plant breeders and agricultural researchers, despite an interest in Mendelism, never came to see it as the breeders' panacea, and regarded it instead as of only limited value for plant breeding. I account for this judgment in showing that the plant breeders and Mendelism designed two contrasting kinds of experimental systems and inhabited distinct experimental cultures. While Mendelian geneticists designed experimental systems that allowed the production of definite ratios of different forms that varied in relation to a few characters, plant breeders' experimental systems produced a wide range of variation, featuring combinations between hundreds of traits. Rather than breaking this multiple variation down into simple <b>elements,</b> <b>breeders</b> designed and monitored a genetic lottery. The gene was a unit in a Mendelian experimental culture, an “epistemic thing” as H. -J. Rheinberger put it, that could be grasped by means of statistical regularities, but it remained of secondary importance for French plant breeders, for whom the strain or the variety –not the gene– was the fundamental unit of analysis and manipulation...|$|R
