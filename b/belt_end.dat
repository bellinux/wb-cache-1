50|$|Although any {{device that}} serves to secure two loose ends is casually called a buckle, if it {{consists}} of two separate pieces with one for a hook {{and the other for}} a loop, it should be called a clasp.

5000|$|There is some {{supporting}} evidence for this, for example, Bishop William Reade in the 14th century requested, {{in his will}} dated 1382, {{that he should be}} buried before the high altar of the church at Selsey once the cathedral church of my diocese. A late Saxon object found at the [...] 'mound', in Church Norton, was a bronze tab (<b>belt</b> <b>end)</b> of a type found in ecclesiastical contexts. Also various stone artefacts have been found in the area including remnants of Wilfrid's palm cross, that would have stood outside his cathedral. The design on the remains of the cross are similar to those on the Bewcastle Cross and it is thought that the Selsey cross would have been identical to the one at Bewcastle.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} komatiites to preserve during alteration {{a record of the}} geochemical and isotopic composition of the Archean mantle, we studied the petrology and geochem-istry of a komatiite flow from Alexo, Ontario. Although this flow is relatively well preserved, two main types of alteration are recognized: (1) hydration of variable intensify throughout the whole flow; (2) local rodingitization. In samples only slightly affected by hydration, the alteration was essentially isochemical; where more intense, hydration was accompanied by the mobility of T 1 O 2, Zr an ^ the Mght rare-earth elements (LREE). The mobility of these reputedly immobile trace elements is influenced by texture and secondary mineral assemblages. Rodingitization was accompanied by still greater mobility. An Nd isochron with an age of 2726 ± 98 Ma and £Nd(T) = + 2 - 5 is defined by whole-rock samples. Because the spread of Sm—Nd ratios is far greater than can be explained by magmatic processes, the age is interpreted as that of the main alteration event during or soon after emplacement. Scattered initial Sr isotopic ratios and eNdp:) (+ 3 - 6 to + 0 - 7) provide evidence for several younger events. The eNd^Y) of magmatic clinopyroxene (~ + 3 - 8) is higher than that of mafic tofelsic rocks and pyroxenes from the Abibiti <b>belt</b> (<b>eNd</b> ^ ~ + 2 - 5). This result implies: (1) the komatiites exchanged Nd with surrounding rocks during water-rock interaction; (2) the isotopic composition of komatiites and their mantle source differed from that of the more common basalts of the Abitibi belt.

40|$|THE CAMBONGO-NEGUNZA RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: AN EXAMPLE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DRAINAGE PATTERNS IN ANGOLA. The hydrographical {{basin of}} River Cambongo-Negunza, {{situated}} in the coastal area of central Angola, was selected {{as an example of}} the complexity of drainage patterns in Angola. From its sources in the massifs of the Marginal Mountain (more than 2 000 m) the river flows through the stepped planed erosion surfaces to the Ocean. In its lower course the river valley presents a narrow and V-shaped cross profile cut in sedimentary rocks (Cretaceous-Quaternary). The coastal erosion surface, including the raised beaches (mean altitudes from 40 to 100 m), levelling the rocks of the Sedimentary Belt and those of the ancient crystalline massif, gradually rises towards the east until a well marked topographical limit, the base (altitude approx. 280 - 300 m) of the steep western slopes of a NNE-SSW quartzitic ridge with a dissymmetrical cross-sectional profile: the serra do Engelo (altitudes between 1 400 - 1 700 m), whose faults are peppered with thermal springs. Above the coastal surface, in the crystalline rock strip, some quartzitic hills with Inselberge characteristics rise out of the plains, leading to problems in relation to, for example, the western extension of the quartzite formations and their dismantling, and the behaviour of the same material in the complex genesis and evolution processes of the extensive regional line of N-S escarpments, against which the erosion surfaces of the coastal <b>belt</b> <b>end.</b> In the limestones near the coast, the river Cambongo-Negunza has a subterranean network of large caves and galleries surfacing near the small plain from which it flows into the ocean. Not far from the valley sinks and dolines of various sizes and lapies can be seen. The climatic conditions are semi-arid, with annual precipitation less than 700 mm and high evaporation rates. Vegetation is a mix of that which can be found in savanna, steppe and xerophytic habitats, with few to no trees. A vast area of outcrops of granitic and related rocks, sometimes covered by regoliths of various thicknesses, can be found between the Serra do Engelo and the massifs of the Marginal Mountain chain. The altitudes of the general levelling range between 1 100 and 1 200 m. The area is covered by forest and savannas with low trees, shrubs and tall grasses growing in rather thin and variable soils, fersialitic being among the most frequent. The average temperature is around 22 ºC and annual rainfall is about 1 400 mm. Lateritisation or bauxitisation lines and subaerean duricrust can be seen in many places. Above this surface, there are many Inselberge-type hills, isolated or in groups, mostly with square-shaped forms, linked or not to the geometrical patterns of the hydrographic networks, revealing the structural control of fractures and faults over these watercourses, whether small or large, permanent or temporary. Note that the majority of the Inselberge is not found near the escarpments of the marginal mountain chain, the eastern limit of the 1 100 - 1 200 metre-high plain, but rather quite a distance away to the west, near the Serra do Engelo quartzitic ridge. The same can be seen in the neighbouring basins of the River Cuvo-Queve to the north and to the south of the Cambongo-Negunza river basin. Fracture valleys and residual hills call for more detailed explanations, with suggestions of criteria for their study. Moreover, there has been the concern regarding how to correlate several factors relative to external dynamics (meteorisation and erosion in a broad sense) with those relative to internal dynamics (geology and tectonics) to explain the genesis and evolution of the landforms. Therefore, the study wraps up with some brief thoughts regarding a dynamic geo-chronological approach...|$|E

50|$|Flat belts were {{traditionally}} made {{of leather}} or fabric. Today most {{are made of}} rubber or synthetic polymers.

40|$|The Santaren Anticline {{constitutes}} the frontal {{termination of the}} Cuban fold and thrust belt within the Bahamian foreland. New well and seismic data allow us to constrain in detail the evolution of this anticline. Pre-growth and syntectonic (partly post-tectonic?) units, separated by a major unconformity, {{are associated with the}} Santaren Anticline. Their geometrical features are consistent with a detachment fold. The precise age of the beginning of fold growth remains unknown. However, the complete record of well-dated syntectonic sediments documents its kinematic evolution from Mid-Eocene to Pliocene/present day, and reveals an approximately constant and very slow growth rate from Early Miocene to Pliocene/present day. The timing of evolution of the Santaren Anticline is not consistent with previous models that postulate that deformation associated with the Cuban fold and thrust <b>belt</b> <b>ended</b> in the Eocene. Our data suggest that the most external part of the Cuban fold and thrust belt was still being deformed under a compressional regime during the late Palaeogene, Neogene and probably during the Quaternary.
