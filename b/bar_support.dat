5000|$|For {{dowel bar}} retrofit, dowels, bond breaker, {{expansion}} caps, dowel <b>bar</b> <b>support</b> chairs, foam core insert, caulking filler, non-shrink concrete backfill material and submittals are needed. The dowels {{need to be}} smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker {{is to be applied}} on all surfaces of the dowel bar. The expansion caps belong {{at each end of the}} dowel bar and the dowel <b>bar</b> <b>support</b> chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re-establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. Non-shrink concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects.|$|E

40|$|Background: Modifications defined to ease bending of the <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> {{and lateral}} {{stabilizer}} placement during minimal invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) {{have not been}} reported. We herein report our experience with MIRPE including several technical modifications. Methods: A total of 87 patients who underwent MIRPE were evaluated retrospectively. Technical modifications are (1) a template drawn preoperatively according to the anthropometric measurements, (2) more laterally placed thoracal incisions, (3) single existing incision for multiple <b>support</b> <b>bars,</b> (4) to secure lateral stabilizers to <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> in inverted position. Results: The mean patient age was 11. 2 ± 3. 8 years. The mean operating time was 63. 7 ± 18. 7 min. The mean Haller index was 5. 4 ± 2. 1. Eight patients necessitated two <b>support</b> <b>bars.</b> The <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> were removed in 69 patients {{after the completion of}} treatment. <b>Support</b> <b>bars</b> were left in place 26. 8 ± 4. 3 months. Final chest contours of the 56 patients were evaluated as 12 months passed after <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> removal and excellent repair results were determined in 84. 2 %. Conclusion: Preoperative bending of the <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> according to anthropometric measurements and fixation of the lateral stabilizers to the <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> in inverted position facilitates bar shaping and lateral stabilizer placement...|$|R

50|$|The {{truss bridge}} was built between 1894 and 1898. Its span {{measures}} 49 metres, arching over both the 40-metre wide canal and the 9-metre wide towpath. The {{construction of the}} bridge was made necessary for structural reasons; the three main bearing walls and the strong horizontal <b>bar</b> <b>support</b> both {{the weight of the}} bridge and the pressure created by the damming of the water in the canal (the weir is also referred to as a bridge weir as a result). The Schemmerlbrücke was however also needed for the weir machinery. In April 1945, the Schemmerlbrücke, along with the other bridges over the Donaukanal, was intentionally rendered unusable. In 1947, a wooden structure was built which made it possible for pedestrians to cross the canal. Between 1953 and 1955, the bridge was repaired and in 1978 it was thoroughly restored.|$|E

40|$|The new Swiss implant system SPI became {{available}} {{three years ago}} and is used in combination with fixed and removable prosthetic reconstructions. In a pilot study the clinical procedures were evaluated and data of prosthetic complications of maintenance service were collected. 25 patients participated in the study with a total of 79 SPI implants during the time period from 2003 - 2004. 37 implants were located in the maxilla and 42 implants in the mandible. Two implants failed during the healing period, but no loaded implant was lost. Thus, the survival rate was 97. 5 % (77 / 79). 44 implants supported a fixed prosthesis, including nine single crowns and 33 implants were used in combination with removable partial denture. Four implants were used with ball anchor retention, 29 with <b>bar</b> <b>support.</b> The ELEMENT implant with the low implant shoulder allows very good esthetics. Prosthetic complications and maintenance service {{during the first year of}} function was comparable with other implant systems. Since the design of the abutment screws, healing caps and screwdriver was changed, the system has become easier in its application...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{suggest a}} custom <b>bar</b> <b>supported</b> overdenture {{treatment}} modality for prosthodontic management {{of patients with}} severe gag reflex. Background: Some patients have a severe gag reflex and cannot tolerate conventional maxillary complete dentures with maximum palatal coverage and extensions of all borders. The condition further gets complicated in patients suffering from respiratory problems along with severe gag reflex. Severe gagging acts {{as a barrier to}} treat such patients with accepted clinical procedures and prevent patients from wearing the prosthesis. By saving some of the remaining natural teeth and fabricating, a horse shoe shape palateless simple tooth or <b>bar</b> <b>supported</b> overdenture can be successfully used for treating such patients. Materials and Methods: The remaining maxillary right and left canines were prepared with the tapered round end diamond bur to receive copings of custom bar after intentional root canal treatment of same teeth. Impression was made with light body and putty of the polyvinyl siloxane elastomer with double step putty wash technique. Impression was poured with die stone. Wax pattern of copings with bar was fabricated with inlay wax which was invested and casted. After retrieving the bar, it was finished and its fit was evaluated. The coping-bar assembly was finally cemented with the glass ionomer cement. Palateless overdenture was fabricated by conventional technique used for the fabrication of complete denture. Conclusion: Palateless custom <b>bar</b> <b>supported</b> overdenture procedure can be successfully used for the management of patients with severe gag reflex with improved denture retention, stability, chewing efficiency and comfort of the patient...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{reinforced}} concrete coupling beams in regions of high seismicity typically includes {{the use of}} diagonal bars designed to resist the entire shear demand, along with closely spaced transverse reinforcement to provide concrete confinement and diagonal <b>bar</b> <b>support.</b> While results from experimental investigations indicate that this design leads to stable behavior under large displacement reversals, the required reinforcement detailing is labor intensive and time consuming. One alternative that has been proven successful to simplify reinforcement detailing in coupling beams is the addition of discontinuous, deformed steel fibers to the concrete. Test results indicate that elimination of diagonal reinforcement, along with substantial reductions in confinement reinforcement {{over most of the}} beam span, are possible in coupling beams with span-to-depth ratios {{greater than or equal to}} approximately 2. 2 when a tensile strain-hardening fiber reinforced concrete is used. Given the advantages of eliminating diagonal reinforcement in coupling beams, this new design was incorporated in high-rise structures in the State of Washington, USA, starting in the early 2010 s. In this paper, a brief summary of relevant experimental results and the implementation of fiber reinforced concrete coupling beams in high-rise earthquake-resistant construction is provided...|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) {{composite materials}} are making an {{entry into the}} construction market in both buildings and pavements. The application to pavements so far has {{come in the form}} of joint reinforcement (dowels and tie bars). FRP resistance to salt corrosion in dowels has made it an alternative to standard epoxy-coated steel dowels for pavements. Iowa State University has completed a large amount of laboratory research to determine the diameter, spacing, and durability of FRP dowels. This report documents the performance of elliptical FRP dowels installed in a field situation. Ten joints were monitored in three consecutive test sections, for each of three dowel spacings (10, 12, and 15 inches) including one instrumented dowel in each test section. The modulus of dowel <b>bar</b> <b>support</b> was determined using falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing and a loaded crawl truck. FWD testing was also used to determine load transfer efficiency across the joint. The long-term performance and durability of the concrete was also evaluated by monitoring faulting and joint opening measurements and performing visual distress surveys at each joint. This report also contains similar information for standard round, medium elliptical, and heavy elliptical steel dowels in a portion of the same highway. In addition, this report provides a summary of theoretical analysis used to evaluate joint differential deflection for the dowels...|$|E
