Its bore and stroke are 97mm x 92mm. The dual-resonance intake manifold with tuned runners helps create optimized torque and power outputs by taking advantage of two resonant frequencies to increase performance.

5000|$|Six {{original}} examples (along {{with six}} Romney huts) are still {{located at the}} Central Ordnance Depot Bicester, part of the British Ministry of Defence's Logistic Services Bicester facility. The Bicester huts were completed by July 1944, by which time the design had been almost entirely phased out elsewhere. They were needed in connection with Operation Bolero, the build-up of U.S. forces in Britain for the campaign in Europe, which aimed to accommodate 1,446,000 U.S. service personnel on British soil by 30 April 1944. It resulted in [...] "the greatest expansion of military infrastructure ever to occur in British history."

It runs in five oil pressure lubricated bearing shells and {{is driven by}} gears {{in the front of}} the engine. Mechanical roller lifters (cam followers) ride atop the cam lobes and drive the steel push rods up into the steel rocker arms that actuate the valves. The rockers are of roller tip type on the intake and exhaust sides. Like the cam follower rollers, the steel tip roller rotates on a steel roller bearing and the steel rocker arms rotate on a pair of through-hardened tool steel shafts within bronze bushings. Intake and exhaust rockers are billet. The dual valve springs are of coaxial type and made out of titanium. Valve retainers are also made of titanium, as are the rocker covers.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to fitting two turbochargers and an intercooler system, Lotus directed {{a number of}} engineering changes to the engine {{so that it would}} perform reliably with the higher power output. To cope with the higher cylinder pressures (about 95 bar), the external webbing on the engine block was reinforced. The crankshaft was replaced as well; early development crankshafts were machined from <b>billet</b> <b>steel</b> in Italy, but the production units were forged by Opel and sent to Maschinenfabrik Alfing Kessler for machining. The cylinder head was left mostly the same as the 24-valve head from the Opel Omega, although the combustion chamber was milled to reduce the static compression ratio to 8.2:1 (from 10.0:1). The engine is fitted with forged slipper pistons produced by Mahle. Piston connecting rods were replaced with new units made to an original Lotus design.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce unit {{production}} costs, the engines that actually went into production, called Speed Six, were TVR modified versions of the initial AJP-6 prototypes with 3.6 and 4.0 litre capacities. Prominent modifications were alterations to valve train geometry, a switch from a <b>billet</b> <b>steel</b> crank to cast iron (with a crank damper), different con-rods, oil filter relocation to the inlet side of the engine, and removal of the exhaust cam oil feed. The two different capacities were achieved through stroke alterations from a con-rod design able to accommodate two different stroke lengths, and different piston crown designs altering the compression ratios. The bores diameters were shared.Pistons were made in Italy by Asso Werke from pre-existing casts, initially designed for the Rotax-Aprilia RSV 1000 engine. Those casts, refused by Rotax, were modified and used to produce the smaller Speed Six pistons.|$|E
