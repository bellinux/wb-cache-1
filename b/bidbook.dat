Future talk has both a conceptual side for expressing predictions (Dahl 2000), and a series of grammatical categories and constructions for doing so. The focus of Italian and constructional research on grammar and aspect of the future as a conceptual category has largely been focusing on verbal predication (Berghs 2010, Hilpert 2008, Bertinotti 1991), i. e. on inflectional tense or periphrastic constructions (Dahl and Velupillai 2011, Fleischman 1982). Moreover, the Italian (verbal) future has clearly been studied less than the grammar of past tenses, due to a low degree in morphological complexity (Renzi and Salvi 1991), and, even from a functional point of view, nominal and other kinds of grammatical structures have been largely ignored (Proudfoot 2005). In this talk, we concentrate on how the grammar and lexis contribute to the construction of the future not as tense but as future time (Bittner 2005), i. e. a functional category for conceptualizing a time slot opposed to past and present in discourse by means of additional metaphoric mappings. Our corpus consists of the Italian 120 page <b>bidbook</b> of the Matera 2019 project, the Italian candidate city accepted for European Capital of Culture (ECOC) 2019. ECOCs typically develop a future vision of their city, a project evolving over time in which they connect local heritage with a European, global dimension. This future discourse constantly involves setting up connections between past, present and future, conceiving of the latter as a space of both continuity and rupture with the present, in which Matera’s project designers metaphorically ‘envisage’ future change. We analyse future change expressions based on a constructional, usage-based perspective, using Langacker’s (2008) extended epistemic model as a semantic template for treating the conceptual status of futurity in terms of associations with rich metaphorical source domains and this apart from their (verbal or) nominal morphosyntactical realization (Author 2012). Typically grammar and phraseology refer to different source domains such as organic growth, vision, spatial distance. Changes toward the future are then conceived of paths connecting spatial past/present versus future entities, through different kinds of physical (ACT, DO: ‘transform the past’), mental (PERCEIVE, THINK, ‘foresee/imagine the future’) and emotive (FEEL: ‘hope’ and ‘fear’) operations.
