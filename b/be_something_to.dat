5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be looked at and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial {{should be on the}} road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E
25|$|Bhava-taṇhā (craving for being): craving to <b>be</b> <b>something,</b> <b>to</b> unite with an experience. This is ego-related, states Harvey, the seeking {{of certain}} {{identity}} and desire for {{certain type of}} rebirth eternally. Other scholars explain {{that this type of}} craving is driven by the wrong view of eternalism (eternal life) and about permanence.|$|E
500|$|On 4 December 2014, Chris Martin {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 that Coldplay {{are in the middle of}} working on their seventh studio album, A Head Full of Dreams. Martin stated it might be the band's final album and compared it to Harry Potter; [...] "It's our seventh thing, and the way we look at it, it's like the last Harry Potter book or something like that." [...] He added that, unlike their promotion efforts for Ghost Stories, the band will tour for the seventh record. In an interview with Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 2, Martin hinted at the style of the album by saying that the band was trying to make something colourful and uplifting, yet not bombastic. He also stated that it will <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> [...] "shuffle your feet" [...] to.|$|E

500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film. Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E
500|$|Riot Act {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} music critics according to Metacritic, where it holds a 73 after 20 reviews. NME gave Riot Act an {{eight out of}} ten. Reviewer Louis Pattison stated that [...] "Riot Act {{is the sound of}} a band entering a powerful middle-age. They still deserve your attention." [...] AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying [...] "given several plays, this does indeed seem like the richest record Pearl Jam has made in a long time." [...] Spin gave the album seven out of ten stars. The review said, [...] "Pearl Jam's seventh studio album balances emotive bombast with a taut-sweaty hard-rock attack." [...] Critic Robert Christgau described Pearl Jam on the album as [...] "masters of their own audio, with soft spots where their emotions can go." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Keith Harris gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "like Neil Young at his most deliberately despondent, Pearl Jam sound purposefully tired." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Vedder's lyrics [...] "rarely cohere", and that [...] "too few of the tense rhythmic setups build to the kind of...catharsis that would <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Riot home about." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars. The review called the album [...] "An adult rock record in which nuance succeeds over bombast." ...|$|E
500|$|Clive Russell, who portrayed Blackfish, {{spoke about}} working with Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth, noting [...] "There's {{something}} very curious, by the way, I'm probably about 6'6" [...] tall. I think she's about 6'3", but all the time I worked with her, I {{felt like she was}} taller than me. Now I don't really know what {{that has to do with}} it. It might <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with being confronted by a physically charismatic very tall woman, or maybe it's that she's caught the impressiveness of the character of that woman, that soldier. She's also an extraordinarily hilarious woman. We had great fun together. It was great fun to play." [...] Gwendoline Christie also spoke about filming with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime Lannister, again, saying [...] "I was excited, It was really fun to be with Nikolaj again, and I thought the way of which their reunion happens is not really expected. I just loved that it was so formal, because within the confines of such formality, and having to negotiate with each other, there are so many other stories begging to be told in those moments. There's a slow process of creeping familiarity among two people who haven't been together for a long time; it was allowed to build." [...] Coster-Waldau also spoke about their first reunion scene, stating [...] "It's a great scene. These characters are so much about holding their cards so close to their chest and they don't want to reveal how they're feeling. But we know there's history between them, that this is more than two knights meeting. But they would never acknowledge that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who claim}} it has {{symbolic}} meaning cannot explain {{what it would}} have meant. Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum notes that [...] "the engraving is at the point in the cave where the cave's orientation changes by 90 degrees" [...] and speculates whether the scratches were related to the location: [...] "It's almost like Clapham Junction, like it's showing an intersection. I'm speculating, but it does make you wonder whether {{it has something to do}} with mapping, or saying: 'This is where you are'." [...] Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: [...] "It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave." [...] Harrold Dibble comments that [...] "It takes more than a few scratches—deliberate or not—to identify symbolic behaviour on the part of Neanderthals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{protects against}} the {{deprivation}} of liberty interests {{at the hands of}} the state. [...] In order to trigger due process protection, the liberty interest in question must be more than merely abstract or theoretical; it must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> which a person has a [...] "legitimate claim of entitlement". [...] No prisoner has a liberty interest in being released before his sentence expires, because the trial and appeals processes have ensured that the state has lawfully deprived the person of his interest in being free from confinement. [...] A state may create a parole system for its prisoners, but it is not required to do so. [...] Parole exists as an adjunct to the penological goals of rehabilitation and deterrence. [...] Like the prison system itself, the parole regime is created and managed by the executive branch, which has no obligation to make error-free determinations in executing the laws.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, 2010, in an {{interview}} on the CBS television program 60 Minutes, Whitney stated that 50 to 100 counties, cities, and towns in the United States would have [...] "significant" [...] municipal bond defaults totaling [...] "hundreds of billions" [...] of dollars, and that [...] "it'll <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> worry about within the next 12 months." [...] Since the record amount of municipal bond defaults in one year was just over $8 billion at the time, Whitney's comments about hundreds of billions in defaults briefly shook the market and drew a great deal of attention, much of it critical. She later described her forecast as a [...] "guesstimate" [...] involving [...] "fifth-derivative dimensions". Her prediction was far in excess of what actually occurred in the following years, including record-setting defaults by Jefferson County, Alabama in 2011 ($4 billion debt, $1 billion loss), Detroit in 2013 ($18 billion debt, $7 billion loss), and even Puerto Rico in 2017 ($74 billion debt, with loss to be determined by bankruptcy court).|$|E

2500|$|Nietzsche {{alleged that}} [...] "...one is not 'converted ' to Christianity [...] {{one must be}} {{sufficiently}} sick for it." [...] The decadent and sick types of people came to power through Christianity. From everywhere, the aggregate of the sick accumulated in Christianity and outnumbered the healthy. [...] "The majority became master; the democratism of the Christian instincts conquered...." [...] The meaning of the God on the Cross is that [...] "...verything that suffers, everything that hangs on the Cross, is divine...." [...] "Because sickness belongs to the essence of Christianity, the typical Christian condition, 'belief,' {{has to be a}} form of sickness. Every straightforward, honest, scientific road to knowledge has to be repudiated by the Church as a forbidden road. Even doubt is a sin." [...] Knowledge requires caution, intellectual moderation, discipline, and selfovercoming. But Christianity uses sick reasoning, such as martyrdom, to try to prove its truth. Christians think that [...] "...there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> a cause for which someone is willing to die." [...] In response, Nietzsche quoted a passage from his earlier work: [...] "And if someone goes through fire for his doctrine [...] what does that prove?" [...] "he need for belief, for some unconditional Yes and No,...is a need born of weakness." ...|$|E
