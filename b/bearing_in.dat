5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both airspeed indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. <b>Bearing</b> <b>in</b> mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
50|$|Today {{ball and}} roller <b>bearings</b> are used <b>in</b> many {{applications}} {{which include a}} rotating component. Examples include ultra high speed <b>bearings</b> <b>in</b> dental drills, aerospace <b>bearings</b> <b>in</b> the Mars Rover, gearbox and wheel bearings on automobiles, flexure <b>bearings</b> <b>in</b> optical alignment systems, bicycle wheel hubs, and air <b>bearings</b> used <b>in</b> Coordinate-measuring machines.|$|R

5|$|Tod's {{enthusiasm for}} bardic poetry {{reflected}} {{the works of}} Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history {{on the basis of}} the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone– for example, the polymath James Mill– accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E

5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems. In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the number}} of {{soldiers}} and casualties at the battle vary widely. A Song source reports that there were 18,000 Song soldiers stationed in Caishi, a number that historian Herbert Franke considers plausible. However, Song estimates {{for the number}} of Jin troops are likely inflated. One document claims that 400,000 Jin soldiers were present at the battle. This number is doubtful, <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> mind that the Song had only 120,000 soldiers fighting on the entire front. Song historians may have confused the total number of Jin personnel deployed on the front with the number of Jin combatants at Caishi. The inflated figure could have referred to the number of soldiers that the Jin army had before crossing the Huai River toward the Yangtze. The desertions and casualties from suppressing revolts while advancing southward would have shrunk that number by the time the Jin reached the Yangtze. The History of Jin, a document written {{from the perspective of the}} Jin, reports Jin casualties between one meng'an (a Jurchen unit of a thousand soldiers) and a hundred men, and two meng'an and two hundred men. The History of Song reports Jin casualties numbering four thousand soldiers and two commanders of wanhu (ten thousand men) rank. An account of the battle by a different Song source holds that 24,000 Jin soldiers died and that 500 combatants and five meng-an were taken as prisoners. A more conservative Song source estimates that the Jin only had 500 soldiers and 20 ships at Caishi. It is not certain which of these figures is more accurate; Franke believes that the safest conclusion that can be drawn is that the number of Jin casualties was not greater than four thousand.|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, <b>bearing</b> <b>in</b> mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E

In addition, we investigated {{the influence of}} ceramics, such as Si 3 N 4, ZrO 2 and SiC, on rolling life of <b>bearings</b> <b>in</b> water. All ceramic bearings possess from 15 to 70 times longer rolling life than all AISI 440 C steel bearings. All Si 3 N 4 and ZrO 2 ceramic bearings possess from 3. 5 to 5 times longer rolling life than hybrid bearings. Rolling life of all SiC ceramic bearings is approximately the same as hybrid bearings. Rolling life of ceramic <b>bearings</b> <b>in</b> water is mainly due to propagation of cracks, pitting and flaking...|$|R
