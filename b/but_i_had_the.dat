2500|$|As much as possible, Buñuel {{preferred}} {{to work with}} actors and crew members {{with whom he had}} worked before and whom he trusted, leading some critics to refer to these people as a [...] "stock company", including such performers as: Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Pierre Clementi, Julien Bertheau, Michel Piccoli, Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Paul Frankeur and Georges Marchal. [...] In his final film, That Obscure Object of Desire, the central character was played by Rey, but voiced by the French-speaking Piccoli. He told actors as little as possible, and limited his directions mostly to physical movements ("move to the right", [...] "walk down the hall and go through that door", etc.), [...] arguing that he had a better chance of capturing reality with inexperienced players who projected a desired sense of awkwardness. [...] He often refused to answer actors' questions and was known to simply turn off his hearing aid on the set. [...] One of his stars, Catherine Deneuve, has stated: [...] "I've always thought that he likes actors, up to a point. I think he likes very much the idea of the film, and to write it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> impression that the film-making was not what he {{preferred to}} do. He had to go through actors, and he liked them if they were easy, simple, not too much fuss." [...] Though they found it difficult at the time, many actors who worked with him acknowledged later that his approach made for fresh and excellent performances.|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E

60|$|At last a {{policeman}} came along, and arrested me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people on shore for help. The judge fined me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> advantage of him. My money {{was with my}} pantaloons, and my pantaloons were with the Indians.|$|E

60|$|Accordingly he {{sent the}} fellow to Newgate for that assault, and his master gave bail, and so we came away; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> {{satisfaction}} of seeing the mob wait upon them both, as they came out, hallooing and throwing stones and dirt at the coaches they rode in; and so I came home to my governess.|$|E

60|$|To {{my great}} surprise, the duke saluted me quite civilly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> feeling of facing a treacherous bull which would gore {{me as soon}} as ever my back was turned.

6000|$|... . But {{this has}} been one of the idlest days that I ever spent in Boston. [...] .

6000|$|In fact, {{the boat}} might almost {{as well have}} gone to St. Jo. by land, for she was walking most of the time, anyhow--climbing over reefs and clambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long.
