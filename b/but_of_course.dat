During Vermeer’s time, Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and {{in the content of}} trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E

25|$|Fund yields are {{typically}} somewhat higher than bank savings accounts, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> these are different products with differing risks (e.g., money fund accounts are not insured {{and are not}} deposit accounts). Since Retail funds generally have higher servicing needs and thus expenses than Institutional funds, their yields are generally lower than Institutional funds.|$|E

25|$|The whole pattern can {{be shifted}} up by three courses, so {{that instead of}} a D-major scale one would have a G-major scale, and so on. This transposes one equally {{tempered}} scale to another. Shifting down three courses transposes the D-major scale to A-major, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the first Do-Re-Mi would be shifted off the instrument.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1743, the British Admiral George Anson {{captured}} the China treasure galleon Nuestra Señora de Covadonga off the Philippines, {{en route from}} Manila for New Spain. The merchandise and the 1,318,843 pesos of silver ingots it was carrying were taken. Anson sold his prize for £400,000 in China. The viceroy was accused of perfidy in the affair, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> nothing came of that.|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Jennifer Hale, as a {{supporting}} character. After a mysterious explosion at the Institute, Jean was lost and the X-Men disbanded until Wolverine reformed the X-Men. Mr. Sinister fooled Cyclops in to thinking that Jean {{was in the}} villain's clutches <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> {{it was only a}} set-up. Unknown to anyone, Jean was in a hospital. When she finally awoke, the doctors asked for her name but she could not remember anything.|$|E

25|$|When {{flying the}} four wings are spread quite far apart, fore and hind {{wing of the}} same side far apart, body horizontal. Flight slow enough so that the {{movements}} of each separate wing can be seen—insect consequently moves slowly but can dodge. Mr. Barnes compared {{the movements of the}} wings to that of a windmill, but the revolving movements are lacking; I should say the effect produced by the wings is more like that of a jumping-jack with moveable arms and legs pulled by one string, rather slowly, <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> at regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} and elucidation of aberration is now {{regarded as a}} classic case of the application of scientific method, in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{applies to}} a Banach space, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> {{other types of}} space exist as well, for example, topological vector spaces include Banach spaces, but can be more general. On the other hand, Banach spaces include Hilbert spaces, and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results. With suitable restrictions, much {{can be said about}} the structure of the spectra of transformations in a Hilbert space. In particular, for self-adjoint operators, the spectrum lies on the real line and (in general) is a spectral combination of a point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and a continuous spectrum.|$|E

25|$|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab (r.800-812) and his descendants, {{known as}} the Aghlabids (800-909), ruled in Ifriqiya from 800 to 909. The Aghlabids also ruled lands to the west (Constantine) and lands to the east (Tripolitania). The Aghlabids were {{predominantly}} of an Arab tribe the Bani Tamim. At that time there were perhaps 100,000 Arabs living in Ifriqiya, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> the Berbers constituted the great majority. The Aghlabid military forces were drawn from: (a) immigrant Arab warriors (both those recently sent against the Berber Kharajite revolts, and those descendants of earlier Arab invasions), (b) Islamized and bilingual natives (Afariq) {{most of whom were}} Berbers, and (c) black slave soldiers from the south. The black soldiery formed the ruler's last resort.|$|E

However, the door {{supposedly}} leading to O'Brien's set was locked, leaving Colbert and Stewart no other choice but to use forced entry—via a bobby pin. [...] A later interview with O'Brien revealed further information of how Stewart and Colbert were able to slip through security: ...|$|E

Errata Security pointed out that a widely used non-malicious program called Masscan, introduced six months before Heartbleed's disclosure, abruptly terminates the connection in the middle of handshaking in the same way as Heartbleed, generating the same server log messages, adding [...] "Two new things producing the same error messages might seem like the two are correlated, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> they aren't." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to come. I felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I tried so hard... It took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I really tried to forget... <b>But</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> I was never able to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E

500|$|The {{disabling}} of the LinkNYC tablets' browsers had stoked {{fears about}} further {{restrictions on the}} Links. The Independent, a British newspaper, surveyed some homeless New Yorkers and found that while most of these homeless citizens used the kiosks for legitimate reasons (usually not to browse NSFW content), many of the interviewees were scared that LinkNYC may eventually charge money {{to use the internet}} via the Links, or that the kiosks may be demolished altogether. The Guardian, another British newspaper, came to a similar conclusion; one of the LinkNYC users they interviewed said that the Links are [...] "very helpful, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> bad people messed it up for everyone.” In a press release, LinkNYC refuted fears that service would be paywalled or eliminated, though it did state that several improvements, including dimming the kiosks and lowering maximum volumes, were being implemented to reduce the kiosks' effect on the surrounding communities.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} reveal that Fitz was just imagining the {{presence}} of Simmons due to the injuries he sustained {{at the end of}} the first season, Tancharoen said, [...] "We didn’t want him to come out of that experience unscathed. He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How do you come out of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. <b>But,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E
500|$|After Ferrari's {{victory at}} the {{previous}} race, their team principal Jean Todt, said that [...] "we {{seemed to be in}} a strong position <b>but,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> it is the order at the finish that counts", while Michael Schumacher said that his car's tyres dropped in performance after taking his first pit stop. McLaren technical director Adrian Newey said that the pit stop strategy was crucial in winning the race: [...] "The tyre wear did not spring any surprises on us {{and we were able to}} trust our estimations and co-ordinate the pit-stops to our best advantage." [...] Villeneuve was happy with his strong finish and was surprised by his good start. Heidfeld, who made contact with his teammate Alesi during the race, apologised for the collision. Ralf Schumacher said that he reduced his pace to secure his fifth position. Trulli described his race as [...] "difficult" [...] because of the hot temperatures though he praised his mechanics for their work.|$|E
