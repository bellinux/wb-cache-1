5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, {{was made of}} a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain.

5|$|Sasuke is {{introduced}} in Part I as a young, spiky black-haired teenager {{who wears a}} <b>blue</b> <b>shirt,</b> with a fan representing his clan on his back. He also wears short white pants and the customary Konohagakure head band. Early in the series, a man named Orochimaru brands Sasuke with a cursed seal that causes black marks to cover his body, and later grants him new Cursed Seal powers, which give him gray skin, white hair, and claw-like wings. In Part II, he usually appears wearing a white kimono with black pants. While skilled {{in the use of}} shurikens, in Part II Sasuke wields a chokutō sword which he calls Kusanagi. Besides using Kusanagi for Kenjutsu, Sasuke can additionally combine it with lightning-based techniques to increase the range of his attacks.|$|E
5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks, {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear <b>blue</b> <b>shirt,</b> blue shorts and blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and white socks for their away kit.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the regular}} first-team {{members from the}} {{previous}} season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released. Fred Speller, who had suffered a badly broken leg early in the season, had been playing in practice matches and {{was believed to be}} back to full fitness. Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club, and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business. Goalkeeper George Hollis, backs Arthur Littleford, Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, half-backs Ted Devey, Caesar Jenkyns, Teddy Jolley and Billy Ollis, and forwards Jack Hallam, Tommy Hands, Frank Mobley, Billy Walton and Fred Wheldon all remained with the club. Newcomers included forwards Jack Lee, Charles Izon and Walter Jackson, all signed from non-league clubs in the West Midlands area. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. The team adopted a new kit, keeping the white knickerbockers but replacing the royal <b>blue</b> <b>shirt</b> and stockings with shirts in a lighter shade of blue, with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket and navy stockings.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their <b>blue</b> <b>shirt</b> for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} colours of all IFK {{associations are}} blue and white, and IFK Göteborg is no exception. Soon after the club's foundation in 1904, {{it was decided}} that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts. But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used. Thus the club's first kit used a <b>blue</b> <b>shirt</b> with a single horizontal white stripe and a four-pointed star, one of the IFK association symbols, in white on the chest. During the next few years, white or blue shirts without stripes were used. In 1910, a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of Kjøbenhavns Boldklub. This kit has remained as the home colours ever since. The small amount of sponsor logos, together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes, has made the kit a classic in Swedish football. The most common away kit has been red and white in different styles, though other colour combinations, for example orange and white, have been used, mainly in the 1990s and 2000s. The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white. An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid-2007 after requests from supporters. In the 2010s, the away-kit colours have seen much variation, including a pink shirt with black shorts, a black kit with light-grey details, the more traditional red kit with white trimmings, and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016.|$|E

50|$|Other fascist {{countries}} largely {{copied the}} symbolism of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis for their movements. Like them, their uniforms looked typically like military uniforms with Nationalist type insignia of the movement. The Spanish Falange adopted dark <b>blue</b> <b>shirts</b> for their party members, symbolizing Spanish workers, many of whom wore <b>blue</b> <b>shirts.</b> Berets were also used, representing their Carlist supporters. The Spanish Blue Division expeditionary volunteers sent to the Eastern Front of WW2 in (relatively indirect) support of the Germans likewise wore <b>blue</b> <b>shirts,</b> berets and their army trousers.|$|R

25|$|In {{international}} association football, blue is {{a common}} colour on kits, as a majority of nations wear the colours of their national flag. A notable exception is four-time FIFA World Cup winners Italy, who wear a blue kit based on the Azzuro Savoia (Savoy blue) of the royal House of Savoy which unified the Italian states. The team themselves are known as Gli Azzurri (the Blues). Another World Cup winning nation with a <b>blue</b> <b>shirt</b> is France, who are known as Les Bleus (the Blues). Two neighbouring countries with two World Cup victories each, Argentina and Uruguay wear a light <b>blue</b> <b>shirt,</b> the former with white stripes. Uruguay are known as the La Celeste, Spanish for 'the sky blue one', while Argentina are known as Los Albicelestes, Spanish for 'the sky blue and whites'.|$|E
