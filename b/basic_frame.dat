25|$|Cost cutting led to Indian {{designing}} a new <b>basic</b> <b>frame</b> for 1932 that would {{form the basis}} for the Scout, Chief, and Four frames. The 1932 Standard Scout that was based on this new frame was heavier and bulkier than the 101 frame, and was less successful as a result. The Standard Scout remained in production until 1937.|$|E
25|$|The KR200 {{replaced}} the KR175 in 1955. While {{using the same}} <b>basic</b> <b>frame</b> as the KR175 with changes to the bodywork (notably including wheel cutouts in the front fenders) and an improved canopy design, the KR200 was otherwise an almost total redesign. The rear suspension and engine mounting were reworked, and hydraulic shock absorbers were installed at all three wheels. Tire sizes were enlarged to 4.00×8.|$|E
25|$|As soon as two {{adjacent}} columns {{had been}} erected, a girder was hoisted into place {{between them and}} bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the <b>basic</b> <b>frame</b> of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was {{essentially the same as}} for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.|$|E

It allows frame length detection on a port by a two-octet field. As of IEEE 802.3-2015, allowed values are 1518 (only <b>basic</b> <b>frames),</b> 1522 (802.1Q-tagged frames), and 2000 (multi-tagged, envelope frames).|$|R

50|$|After some {{instruction}} on <b>basic</b> <b>framing</b> knowledge from Jill, each contestant {{could choose to}} redesign their sheds to new specifications. This was necessary for four of the contestants, whose sheds are either too tall for the warehouse door (Candace, Terry, Jaime) or would fail a building inspection (Jeff). These redesigned shed frames would then be assembled by the show's staff.|$|R
25|$|Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence {{to produce}} a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design {{reflected}} the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The <b>basic</b> <b>frame</b> could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.|$|E
25|$|At its peak, the Ottoman Empire {{stretched}} from the Caucuses down to northern Africa {{and parts of}} the middle east. This long reach meant that many aspects of Ottoman culture, including the davul and other janissary instruments, were likely introduced {{to other parts of the}} world. In Africa, the indigenous population took the basic idea of the davul – that is, a two-headed cylindrical drum that produces a deep sound when struck – and both increased the size of the drum and changed the material from which it was made, leading to the development of the long drum. The long drum can be made a variety of different ways, but is most typically constructed from a hollowed out tree trunk. This is vastly different from the davul, which is made from a thick shell. Long drums were typically 2 meters in length and 50 centimeters in diameter, much larger than the Turkish drums on which they were based. The indigenous population also believed that the tree from which the long drum was made had to be in perfect shape. Once an appropriate tree was selected and the <b>basic</b> <b>frame</b> for the long drum was constructed, the Africans took cow hides and soaked them in boiling hot water, in order to stretch them out. Although the long drum was an improvement on the davul, both drums were nevertheless played in a similar fashion. Two distinct sticks were used on the two distinct sides of the drum itself. A notable difference between the two is that long drums, unlike davuls, were used primarily for religious purposes.|$|E

A synthesis of our recent work is presented with the purpose of refining this rationale on two points. First, observations of contraction activity and passive elasticity suggest that <b>basic</b> <b>frames</b> of serial-order control correspond to contraction-relaxation cycles not present in non-speech motions such as mastication. Second, on explaining prosodic grouping, results show a relationship between “size effects ” on such patterns and grouping effects on recall. Converging evidence suggests that grouping may arise from capacity limits on attention processes of short-term memory...|$|R

500|$|The most <b>basic</b> <b>frames</b> {{are called}} primary {{framework}}s. A primary framework takes an individual's experience or {{an aspect of}} a scene that would originally be meaningless and makes it meaningful. One type of primary framework is a natural framework, which identifies situations {{in the natural world}} and is completely biophysical, with no human influences. The other type of framework is a social framework, which explains events and connects them to humans. An example of a natural framework is the weather, and an example of a social framework is a meteorologist who predicts the weather. Focusing on the social frameworks, Goffman seeks to [...] "construct a general statement regarding the structure, or form, of experiences individuals have at any moment of their social life".|$|R

This paper reports on an experience in analyzing and specifying the requirements of a controller for traffic lights of an intersection using Problem Frames and the SysML notation. The problem has been decomposed into simpler sub-problems that fit the definition of <b>basic</b> <b>frames.</b> All the sub-problems have been individually analyzed by identifying their requirements and defining a machine specification. The re-composition of the sub-problems {{has been carried out}} by merging the requirements of the sub-problems, defining new requirements that solve the conflicts among the sub-problems, and specifying a new machine that, in combination with the problem domains, satisfies the requirements. This case study allowed us to identify two decomposition and re-composition patterns...|$|R

40|$|In his paper, “Missed Opportunities in Argument Evaluation,” Daniel Cohen has in {{his sights}} a “curious” {{asymmetry}} in how we evaluate arguments: while we criticize arguments for failing to point out obvious objections to the proposed line of reasoning, we do not consider it critically culpable to fail {{to take into account}} arguments for the position. Cohen views this omission as a missed opportunity, for which he lays the blame largely at the metaphorical feet of the “Dominant Adversarial Model” of argumentation – the DAM account. We argue here that, while Cohen criticizes the DAM account for conceptualizing arguments as essentially agonistic, he accepts its <b>basic</b> <b>framing</b> and does not follow his critique where it leads. In so doing, he misses the opportunity to develop an alternative, non-adversarial account of argumentation which would avoid his criticism of how we evaluate arguments...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} three <b>basic</b> <b>frames</b> of {{reference}} to describe spatial relations has taken firm root in linguistics and cognitive science {{over the past}} twenty years. Levinson contends that speakers of a particular language tend to use the frames of reference predominant in that language to solve nonlinguistic spatial tasks - in short, in the domain of spatial reference and reasoning, language can be shown to influence cognition. I examine data taken from the spatial language that players use to navigate the virtual world of the popular MMO World of Warcraft, and attempt to demonstrate that many factors other than native language are responsible for the spatial systems used to address different situations. These factors, including the availability of time to formulate precise directions and the availability or lack of certain paralinguistic tools, may outweigh the influence of native language in determining which system of reference to use...|$|R
