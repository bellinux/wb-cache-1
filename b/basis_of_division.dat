The compression {{is based on}} SCAN language and it is lossless in nature. The SCAN is a formal language based two dimensional spatial-accessing methodology which can efficiently specify and generate {{a wide range of}} scanning paths or space filling curves. Prior to the compression, a framework is presented which ensures the secure storage of images on <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> of knowledge. Finally, QR code is used for efficient indexing of the secure images. QR codes are 2 -dimensional bar codes which can store huge amount of data as compared to 1 -dimensional barcodes. The results are analysed constrained to medical images in the hope of getting better results than that of the generic domain. Thus, this thesis presents compression specific SCAN language, compression-decompression algorithms, framework ensuring security and indexing, and test results of the methodology...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 On April 1, 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} agreement to found Apple Computer. In the decade that followed, Apple experienced remarkable growth and success, as Jobs catapulted Apple to the Fortune 500 list of top‐flight companies faster than any other company in history. Under direction of Jobs, Apple, an idea that started in a garage, transformed into {{a major force in}} the computer industry of the 1980 s. Though Jobs' leadership undoubtedly influenced Apple’s success during this time, in 1995, he was forced to resign, when conflicts mounted at the executive level. Using Kenneth Burke’s theory of identification and the dramatistic process, this thesis examines Jobs’ discourse through a series of interviews and textual artifacts. First, I provide a framework for Jobs' acceptance and rejection of the social order at Apple, and then consider the ways in which Jobs identified with employee and consumer audiences on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division.</b> Analysis shows that Jobs identified with individual empowerment, but valued separation and exclusivity. Jobs' preference to create identification through division, therefore, established the foundation for new identifications to emerge.

40|$|The genetic <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> {{of labor}} in social insects is a central {{question}} in evolutionary and behavioral biology. The honey bee is a model for studying evolutionary behavioral genetics because of its well characterized age-correlated division of labor. After an initial period of within-nest tasks, 2 – 3 week-old worker bees begin foraging outside the nest. Individuals often specialize by biasing their foraging efforts toward collecting pollen or nectar. Efforts to explain the origins of foraging specialization suggest that division of labor between nectar and pollen foraging specialists is influenced by genes with effects on reproductive physiology. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of foraging behavior also reveals candidate genes for reproductive traits. Here, we address the linkage of reproductive anatomy to behavior, using backcross QTL analysis, behavioral and anatomical phenotyping, candidate gene expression studies, and backcross confirmation of gene-to-anatomical trait associations. Our data show {{for the first time}} that the activity of two positional candidate genes for behavior, PDK 1 and HR 46, have direct genetic relationships to ovary size, a central reproductive trait that correlates with the nectar and pollen foraging bias of workers. These findings implicate two genes that were not known previously to influence complex social behavior. Also, they outline how selection may have acted on gene networks that affect reproductiv...|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{from the}} 17 th century onward {{anticipate}} the 20 th -century mood of legal mapping. They classify legal arrangements by languages, races and genetic roots, then by their ideologies and technicalities. Later on {{they do so}} by separating the Western from the Soviet/socialist law, by their correspondence to underlying general cultures, as well as according to legal families. It is the insufficiency of resorting to dichotomy contrasting the Western “Us” to any differing Eastern “Others” that has recently resulted in typologising {{in terms of the}} dynamism and directions of legal development in the duality of professionalism and traditionalism or in the cross-reference of what is established/stable and unestablished/instable, and of what is drawn from Western and non-Western sources. Material taxonomy cannot be accomplished in law through genuine class-concepts. Characterisation through concepts of order can be achieved at most. In want of any meta-system, cultures formed to idealise and hypostasise ideas of order by independent principles can provide no common <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> for law. Accordingly, only some division to major and minor sets and subsets can be achieved. The own arrangement will be better cognised by other schemes’ understanding. The gradual transcendence of rule-fetishism by identifying law with some specific culture may prevent the coming “clash of civilizations” from reaching aggressive self-assertion and care for the sustainability of the laws’ diversity. ...|$|E

With these Human Rights issues are directly related and human rights are an important concept in civilized and democratic society.

First this paper also highlights the schemes and policies of the government to eliminate this system and their failure in part of unavailability to socially deprived persons. These policies are only in the paper form and cannot become part of practical concerns. Secondly these problems related to caste- discrimination can be solved only by social awareness and social interaction among different communities but not only by policies and schemes. Since independence {{there is not a single}} case of social awareness programme conducted by political parties and government and this become the root cause of social inequality till now.

40|$|Social insects {{exhibit a}} variety of caste-specific {{behavioral}} tendencies that constitute the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> of labor within the colony. In termites, the soldier caste display distinctive defense behaviors, such as aggressively attacking enemies with well-developed mandibles, while the other castes retreat into the colony without exhibiting any aggressive response. It is thus likely {{that some form of}} soldier-specific neuronal modification exists in termites. In this study, the authors compared the brain (cerebral ganglion) and the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) of soldiers and pseudergates (workers) in the damp-wood termite, Hodotermopsis sjostedti. The size of the SOG was significantly larger in soldiers than in pseudergates, but no difference in brain size was apparent between castes. Furthermore, mandibular nerves were thicker in soldiers than in pseudergates. Retrograde staining revealed that the somata sizes of the mandibular motor neurons (MdMNs) in soldiers were more than twice as large as those of pseudergates. The enlargement of MdMNs was also observed in individuals treated with a juvenile hormone analogue (JHA), indicating that MdMNs become enlarged in response to juvenile hormone (JH) action during soldier differentiation. This enlargement is likely to have two functions: a behavioral function in which soldier termites will be able to defend more effectively through relatively faster and stronger mandibular movements, and a developmental function that associates with the development of soldier-specific mandibular muscle morphogenesis in termite head. The soldier-specific enlargement of mandibular motor neurons was observed in all examined species in five termite families that have different mechanisms of defense, suggesting that such neuronal modification was already present in the common ancestor of termites and is significant for soldier function...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of research relating to the morphogenesis of the villages in the community of Uniejów. This work is an attempt to apply retrogressive methods to clarify the process of formation and development of layouts of villages and identify the historical relics of rural forms in contemporary cultural landscape of analyzed area. The study included irregular early medieval villages, regular villages that have passed the regulations associated with the location under the German law in the Middle Ages, the villages from the period of development of the manorial economy, villages from the modern period connected with Dutch settlement, and the villages formed {{as a result of the}} process of spatial reorganization in the nineteenth century. Development of rural forms in the community of Uniejów was the result of natural, legal, ownership and socio-agrarian influences. In the early Middle Ages one can identify the irregular layouts in the form of a road villages, an oval and multi-road villages. The process of location under the German law brought the development of settlement forms in the shape of large, regular street and oval villages. In the modern period one can identify the manorial forms as morphological elements closely connected with villages of older origin or the manorial forms as an autonomous settlement units. It is also characteristic that one can recognize many hamlets formed on the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> of property. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century in the studied area one can identify a couple of row villages inhabited by German population. Significant changes in the settlement network of community of Uniejów took place in the nineteenth century. The processes of regulation and parceling-out implicated the formation of new settlement units in the form of row villages with stripes fields and scattered villages with block layout of the fields...|$|E

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} one of the most common {{malignancies}} worldwide and ranks second in cancer-related deaths in many parts of the Western world. Once in the lymph or blood vessels, colorectal cancer can quickly spread and the liver is known to be a favourable site for metastases. The presence of colorectal liver metastasis (CLM) is associated with a poor outcome. In last centuries new developments in techniques and anatomical knowledge have improved the outcome for this group of patients. Kousnetzoff and Pensky (1896) suggested the use of haemostasis by electrocautery, tourniquet, and suturing with flexible needles for controlling bleeding. The Pringle manoeuvre (1908), a technical advance which established the vascular control of the liver by compressing the portal triad, was a major step in surgery. Different techniques to reduce bleeding followed, including ligation, vascular and aortic clamping. Topographic liver anatomy generally describes the liver in terms of four lobes: right, left, quadrate, and caudate. However, the veins, arteries, and bile ducts of the liver do not conform to this anatomic division. Healey (1953) used the hepatic arteries and bile ducts as the <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> and Couinaud (1957) the portal and hepatic veins. In 1999 Couinaud described that the portal and hepatic vein segmentation has to be preferred over the arteriobiliary segmentation. Throughout the world, liver surgeons used different terms. In 2000, a group of international liver surgeons proposed a standardized Nomenclature. The use of Brisbane 2000 terminology of hepatic anatomy and resection has led to better communication among surgeons. Many technical tools in the last 20 - 30 years further refined hepatic surgery: the concept of routine intraoperative ultrasonography for liver surgery, vena portal embolization (VPE) and the introduction of the ultrasonic dissector for division of the hepatic parenchyma. The introduction of low central venous pressure anaesthesia and vascular inflow and outflow control were essential to minimize blood loss during hepatectomy. Today, resection for liver metastasis provides favourable outcomes compared with the natural history...|$|E
