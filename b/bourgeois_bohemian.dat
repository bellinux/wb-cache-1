5000|$|Salacus Fields: A bohemian district, popular {{amongst the}} left-wing {{inhabitants}} of New Crobuzon. Many artists either live or {{work in this}} district and it is notably more socially progressive and liberal than other districts.

Not only did the audience profit from it, but the institutions as well. The Louvres, Guggenheims, MOMAs and other mega-organisms, like the British Museum and other anthropological collections, such as the Tropenmuseum Amsterdam and the Völkerkundemuseum Vienna were suddenly able to attract audiences, users and customers which {{do not belong to}} the classical <b>bourgeois</b> <b>bohemian</b> elite lured to visit these institutions...|$|E

50|$|The word bobo, Brooks' {{most famously}} coined term, is an {{abbreviated}} {{form of the}} words <b>bourgeois</b> and <b>bohemian,</b> suggesting a fusion of two distinct social classes (the counter-cultural, hedonistic and artistic bohemian, and the white collar, capitalist bourgeois). The term is used by Brooks to describe the 1990s successors of the yuppies. Often of the corporate upper class, they claim highly tolerant views of others, purchase expensive and exotic items, and believe American society to be meritocratic. The term has also become widely used in France, although without general recognition of its origins.|$|R
