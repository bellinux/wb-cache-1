40|$|International audienceThe surface {{composition}} of bimetallics can be strongly altered by adsorbing molecules where the metal with the strongest {{interaction with the}} adsorbate segregates into the surface. To investigate the effect of reactive gas on the surface {{composition of}} Au–Cu alloy, we examined by means of density functional theory to study the segregation behavior of copper in gold matrices. The adsorption mechanisms of CO, NO, and O 2 gas molecules on gold, copper, and gold-copper low index (111), (100), and (110) surfaces were analyzed from energetic and electronic points of view. Our results show a strong segregation of Cu toward the (110) surface {{in the presence of}} all adsorbed molecules. Interestingly, the Cu segregation toward the (111) and (100) surface could occur only inthe presence of CO and at a lower extent in the presence of NO.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{natural product}} Emodin {{demonstrates}} {{a wide range}} of pharmacological properties including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferation, vasorelaxant and anti- H. pylori activities. Although its H. pylori inhibition was discovered, no acting target information against Emodin has been revealed to date. Results Here we reported that Emodin functioned as a competitive inhibitor against the recombinant β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase from Helicobacter pylori (HpFabZ), and strongly inhibited the growth of H. pylori strains SS 1 and ATCC 43504. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) based assays have suggested the kinetic and thermodynamic features of Emodin/HpFabZ interaction. Additionally, to inspect the <b>binding</b> <b>characters</b> of Emodin against HpFabZ at atomic level, the crystal structure of HpFabZ-Emodin complex was also examined. The results showed that Emodin inhibition against HpFabZ could be implemented either through its occupying the entrance of the tunnel or embedding into the tunnel to prevent the substrate from accessing the active site. Conclusion Our work is expected to provide useful information for illumination of Emodin inhibition mechanism against HpFabZ, while Emodin itself {{could be used as a}} potential lead compound for further anti-bacterial drug discovery. </p...|$|R

The intracellular kinase function of PknB {{is thought to be}} triggered by peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments that are recognized by the extracytoplasmic domain of PknB. The PGN in the cell wall of M.  tuberculosis has several unusual modifications, including the presence of N-glycolyl groups (in addition to N-acetyl groups) in the muramic acid residues and amidation of d-Glu in the peptide chains. Using synthetic PGN fragments incorporating these diverse PGN structures, we analyzed their <b>binding</b> <b>characters</b> through biolayer interferometry (BLI), NMR spectroscopy, and native mass spectrometry (nMS) techniques. The results of BLI showed that muropeptides containing 1, 6 -anhydro-MurNAc and longer glycan chains exhibited higher binding potency and that the fourth amino acid of the peptide stem, d-Ala, was crucial for protein recognition. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy indicated the major involvement of the stem peptide region in the PASTA-PGN fragment binding. nMS suggested that the binding stoichiometry was 1 : 1.

Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) promising potential applications in carbon dioxide capture due to their unique structural properties such as high porosity and high thermal stability. These MOFs have application in separation processes and gas storage. By the assembly of the organic ligands and metal oxide clusters, porous MOFs can be synthesized.

40|$|Abstract — Managing the {{behavior}} of a huge number of non-player characters (NPCs) is a major challenge in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) for a few reasons. First, the moving characters are highly dynamic and their positioning is highly skewed in swarm regions. Second, players are more intelligent and they often collaborate as teams. Third, the characters are complex by design as they can be armed with different weapons and armors, possess different capabilities, and switch from one role to another. Decision making on {{the behavior}} of NPCs in swarm regions is therefore complex because of the rich game semantics in these regions. NPCs in MMOGs are also required to act in teams so that they can fight against teamed player characters (PCs) effectively. This leads to the problems of dynamically managing team members and effectively analyzing information of the local game environment, which are real challenges in MMOGs with a large population due to the high computational cost of handling the dynamics of characters. To address these two problems, we propose a data centric <b>character</b> <b>binding</b> model which manages NPCs in teams. Effective NPC teams are dynamically maintained through self-tuning of binding memberships. Information of local game environment is summarized by bindings. The updates of binding information are efficiently handled by applying lazy updates and model-driven updates. We conduct experiments and the results show that our proposed <b>character</b> <b>binding</b> model achieves the much needed effectiveness and scalability desired by game AI in MMOGs. I...|$|R

40|$|MastersThere is an {{increasing}} interest in Carbopol polymers as gel matrix formers for extended release of drugs. Thus, it was {{the objective of this}} dissertation to evaluate the Carbopol 71 G as extended release excipient in development of extended release matrix tablets of dextromethorphan hydrobromide using direct compression technique. The evaluation of Carbopol was carried out in comparison with the non-ionic polymer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K 15 M and HPMC 15) and the ionic polymer, methacrylic acid co-polymer (Eudragit L 100 - 55) individually and in combination at different drug to polymer ratios. The effect of polymer concentration, polymers combination, compression force and storage conditions on the tablet physical properties, and drug release profile were evaluated on the manufactured tablets. The extended release formulations were compared to a marketed capsule product by applying the FDA dissolution recommended model independent f 2 similarity test. Additionally, the mechanism of drug release from the extended release formulations were evaluated by applying different mathematical kinetic models on drug release profiles. It was found that the Carbopol polymer boost the tablet physical properties as investigated by crushing strength and friability test, indicating the good compressibility and <b>binding</b> <b>characters</b> of the investigated Carbopol polymer. A minimum concentration of 20 % polymer was necessary to achieve a coherent matrix, able to extend the release of dextromethorphan. Increasing the concentration of Carbopol in the formulation leads to more retardation of drug release. A combination of Carbopol with other matrix forming excipients could modulate the release pattern of the drug, providing the formulator the great flexibility in achieving the desired drug release profiles. Drug release followed square root of time dependent kinetics, thus indicating a diffusion-controlled release mechanism. It was found that variation in compression force showed no significant change in release profile. This finding is considered a significant advantage for Carbopol formulations. On the other hand the Carbopol formulations showed reproducibility in the tablet physical properties and drug release profile. Therefore, a robust delivery system was attained using Carbopol polymer. A significant change in tablet physical properties was observed during stability test under accelerated storage conditions (40 ± 2 oC / 75 ± 5 % RH) but no significant change in release profile up to 6 months. On the other hand, tablets stored under long term storage conditions (25 ± 2 oC / 60 ± 5 % RH) showed no significant change in both tablet physical properties and release profile up to 12 months. It was concluded that Carbopol 71 G is a good matrix forming excipient for the production of extended release matrix tablets. The combination of Carbopol and HPMC showed synergistic effect on the release of dextromethorphan thus, with this blend, it is possible to reduce the total amount of polymers in matrix and minimize the size and weight of the tablet...|$|R
