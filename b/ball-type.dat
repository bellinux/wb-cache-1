50|$|The {{exhaust pipe}} {{manifold}} nuts were problematic to the end, loosening from vibration {{no matter how}} tightly they were fastened, leading to a ruined cylinder head and constant rattling of the header pipes. The brake light switches were unreliable, leading at times to no brake light indicator (front was improved with disc brake). The steering head bearings were <b>ball-type,</b> and took a permanent set under the bearing pre-load, leading to weaving at speed (later switched to roller bearings). There was a rear chain oiler which covered the rear wheel in oil, {{and had to be}} pinched off by the owner.|$|E

50|$|In the Universal Century timeline, mobile pods were {{civilian}} craft used {{to construct}} the space colonies, long before the mobile suit concept was developed. Later, when the Earth Federation came under attack by Zeon's first mobile suits, many civilian SP-W03 Space Pods were retrofitted into the RB-79 Ball type units. It is designed as a mid-range support unit for both space ships and mobile suits. During the Earth Federation Space Force's offensive {{at the end of}} the One Year War, the Ball was used as a fighter unit before EFSF's mass production of their own mobile suit finished and form a group of 6 to counter Zeon mobile suits. Later, it is used as a middle to long range support unit in conjunction with the EFSF's mobile suit, the RGM-79 GM. Despite being generally unsuited to anti-mobile suit combat, the standard Ball saw service in 0083, when it was used in the defense of the Earth Federation's Solar System II during Operation Stardust.

The formation of these secondary structures {{is thought to}} inhibit the expression of certain genes, such as the inhibition of telomerase. The inhibition of telomerase and suppression of a specific gene expression are important approaches for interruption of cancer cell's proliferation. In the present study, {{the effect of a}} versatile water soluble <b>ball-type</b> phthalocyanine on G-quadruplex formation and stabilization was investigated to demonstrate its potential usage in cancer chemotherapy. Two important guanine rich oligomers, cMYC and Tel 21 were used as G-quadruplex former sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study about the interaction of a <b>ball-type</b> phthalocyanine with G-quadruplex structures.   The interactions of the compound with G-quadruplex molecules were monitored spectrophotometrically.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviews the}} history of phthalocyanines in Turkey. Phthalocyanines are {{chemical}} compounds that were accidently discovered nearly a century ago. The relevant research and articles have grown dramatically in Turkey since our rst paper on them containing four [15]crown[5] published in 1986. The <b>ball-type</b> phthalocyanines were produced and published as a new concept in phthalocyanine chemistry for the rst time by our group in Turkey in 2006. Unfortunately, {{with the exception of}} our work on this subject, almost no papers have been published in Turkey or in other countries since then. We strongly urge scientists to consider working on this new type of phthalocyanine, which shows interesting development potential in electrical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic applications as well as oxygen reduction for fuel cells.

We report a case of fungus ball sinusitis with multiple sinuses involvement in an Iranian 21 -year-old woman.

40|$|Due to {{radiation}} losses, resonances in open systems are generally complex valued. However, near symmetric, centred objects in ducted domains, or in periodic arrays, so-called trapped modes can exist below the cut-off {{frequency of the}} first non-trivial duct mode. These trapped modes have no radiation loss and correspond to real-valued resonances. Above the first cut-off frequency isolated trapped modes exist only for specific parameter combinations. These isolated trapped modes are termed embedded, because their corresponding eigenvalues are embedded in the continuous spectrum of an appropriate differential operator. Trapped modes are of considerable importance in applications because at these parameters the system can be excited easily by external forcing. In the present paper directly computed embedded trapped modes are compared with numerically obtained resonances for several model configurations. Acoustic resonances are also computed in two-dimensional models of a butterfly and <b>ball-type</b> valve as examples of more complicated geometries...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{performance}} of different Sn based solder alloys applied for large to small sized solder interconnects was undertaken. From the theoretical and experimental investigations on creep, fatigue and brittle fracture behaviors the paper focuses on the low cycle fatigue performance in test and field thermal environments. Special focus was put on a newly developed highly creep resistant solder alloy "Innolot" (SnAg 3. 8 Cu 0. 7 Bi 3. 0 Sb 1. 4 Ni 0. 2). In addition to results of previous studies on lead free materials, particularly their longterm durability and their microstructure-properties dependence was addressed. Phenomenological models based on finite element analyses including solder creep behaviors were applied to study the component and cyclic regime dependent creep straining and creep dissipation in several joints to assess solder failure. For this purpose, creep properties of several solders were measured for <b>ball-type</b> joint sized specimens...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an electromagnetically-actuated reciprocating pump for high-flow-rate microfluidic applications. The pump comprises four major components, namely a lower glass plate containing a copper microcoil, a middle PMMA plate incorporating a PDMS diaphragm with a surface-mounted magnet, upper PMMA channel plates, and a <b>ball-type</b> check valve {{located at the}} channel inlet. When an AC current is passed through the microcoil, an alternating electromagnetic force is established between the coil and the magnet. The resulting bi-directional deflection of the PDMS diaphragm causes the check-valve to open and close; thereby creating a pumping effect. The experimental results show that a coil input current of 0. 4 A generates an electromagnetic force of 47 mN and a diaphragm deflection of 108 μm. Given an actuating voltage of 3 V and a driving frequency of 15 Hz, the flow rate {{is found to be}} 13. 2 mL/min under zero head pressure conditions...|$|E

40|$|Oligomers with α-aminooxy acids are {{reported}} to form very stable turn and helix structures, and {{they are supposed to}} be useful peptidomimetics for drug design. A recent report suggested that homochiral oxa-peptides form a strong eight-member-ring structure by a hydrogen bond between adjacent aminooxy-acid residues in a CDCl 3 solution. In order to design an α-MSH analog with a stable turn conformation, we synthesized four tetramers and one pentamer, based on α-MSH sequence, and determined the solution structures of the molecules by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations. The solution conformations of the three peptidomimetic molecules (TLV, TDV, and TLL) in DMSO-d 6 contain a stable 7 -membered-ring structure that is similar to a γ-turn in normal peptides. Newly-designed tetramer TDF and pentamer PDF have a <b>ball-type</b> rigid structure that is induced by strong hydrogen bonds between adjacent amide protons and carbonyl oxygens. In conclusion, the aminooxy acids, easily prepared from natural or unnatural amino acids, can be employed to prepare peptidomimetic analogues with well-defined turn structures for pharmaceutical interest...|$|E
