5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E

The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States (1943) is an example of this principle. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring, among other things, all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be [...] "within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m." [...] and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area. The defendant, Gordon Hirabayashi, was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement. The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty. Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens {{solely on the basis of}} ancestry [...] "are, <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality", because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order, which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack. The Court said: [...] "We cannot close our eyes to the fact, demonstrated by experience, that, in time of war, residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry." ...|$|E

30|$|Civil air {{transportation}} {{is an example}} of a complex socio-technical system. Each airport comprises of interactions between a variety of facilities, users, technical systems, human resources, rules, and procedures, and is embedded in a large network of other airports, multiple airlines, and ATM centers. This type of complex socio-technical systems is characterized by a large number of interconnected parts, the difficulty to predict the behavior, and the existence of many different stakeholders (Forrester 1971; 6061). Moreover, in civil {{air transportation}}, different parties are involved in the operation of an airport with varying boundaries of responsibility per region or country. At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol for instance, the parties involved in air transport related operations include the airport operator, the airport authority, the ministry of infrastructure and environment, the slot coordinators, the air navigation service provider, the airlines, as well as the general public (Deregee 2006). All these stakeholders have a certain viewpoint on performance which adds to the airport complexity (Bouarfa et al. 2012). In addition, each airport is characterized by a number of runways, taxiways, navigational aids, stop-bars, markings, and so on. Technology plays a central role in the airport system as does the social context within which the system is operating. This makes major airports <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>very</b> own <b>nature</b> complex socio-technical systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One {{large and}} quite {{interesting}} family of MAS applications is characterized (1) <b>by</b> <b>their</b> large scale {{in terms of}} number of agents and physical distribution, (2) <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>very</b> dynamic <b>nature</b> and (3) <b>by</b> <b>their</b> complex functional and non-functional requirements. This family includes a. o. manufacturing control, traffic control and web service coor-dination. BDI-based agent architectures have proven their usefulness in building MASs for complex systems- their explicit attention for coping with dynamic environments is one obvious explanation for this. For the family of applications mentioned above, {{the complexity of the}} software for the individual agents using traditional BDI-approaches, however, is overwhelming. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to BDI agents which alleviates agent complexity through so-called “delegate MASs”, which use the environment and its resources to obtain BDI functionality. Del-egate MASs consist of light-weight agents, which are issued either by resources for building and maintaining information on the environment, or by task agents in order to explore the options on behalf of the agents and to coordinate their intentions. We describe the approach, and vali-date it in a case study of manufacturing control. The evaluation in this case study shows the feasibility of the approach in coping with the large scale of the application and shows that the approach elegantly achieves flexibility in highly dynamic environments. ...|$|R

As annual reports grow in narrative and photographic content, we consider metaphoric meaning of these lavishly illustrated additions to numerate reporting.

40|$|From the Introduction: When {{pondering the}} {{question}} of the “sustainable corporation,” as we did in this symposium, one of the intractable problems {{is the nature of the}} corporation to produce externalities. By noting this characteristic, I am not making a moral point but an economic one. The nature of the firm is to create financial wealth by producing goods and services for profit; without regulatory or contractual limits, the firm has every incentive to externalize costs onto those whose interests are not included in the firm’s current financial calculus. In fact, because of the corporation’s tendency to create benefits for itself by pushing costs onto others, the corporation could aptly be called an “externality machine. ” The obvious kind of externality is the one that happens in the same time frame as the benefits gained. These current externalities take a number of forms. A company might refuse to provide health benefits to its employees, leaving Medicare or Medicaid to pick up the tab. The company might save on production costs by skirting environmental laws, thereby forcing communities, neighbors, or employees to suffer risks of harm that do not need to be accounted for on the company’s financial statements. Alternatively, the company could sell shoddy products to one-time purchasers, produce goods in sweatshops, or underfund employees’ pension funds. These kinds of externalities are routine to notice and remark on. They are also the subject of some push-back from stakeholders and regulators. Those who bear the cost can assert their interests in various ways. The more difficult kind of externality to address—especially if our focus is on the sustainability of the corporation—is the future externality. What I mean here is the kind of cost that a corporation’s management can externalize to the future. From management’s perspective, the future is a much more attractive place to push off costs. Stakeholders who must bear such future costs will be less aware of those costs than current costs, and even if they do learn of such future costs, they will be less able to gain the attention of regulators. The aim of this Essay is to ask about one particular kind of future externality: future costs to shareholders. I recognize that shareholders are not usually the focus in a discussion of externalities. In the present, their interests are sufficiently (even if not perfectly) aligned with those of management that we need not concern ourselves with externalities borne by shareholders other than through the usual corporate governance tools. But in the case of future externalities, the analysis is more complex. Current shareholders may prioritize present returns over future returns, and current shareholders may not expect to be future shareholders at all. This means that corporate managers have incentives not only to externalize costs to current and future stakeholders whose interests they can ignore but also to future shareholders as well. This means that corporations will, <b>by</b> <b>their</b> <b>very</b> <b>natures,</b> be fixated on the short term...|$|R
