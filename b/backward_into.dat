5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan {{station and}} hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic dinoflagellates and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 2006, 21 {{people were}} injured at Liseberg when two roller coaster trains, on the rollercoaster Lisebergbanan, collided. The crash {{happened}} when the chain that pulls trains up the initial climb malfunctioned, causing a fully loaded train to roll <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the loading platform, hitting another train that was unloading riders. Since {{only part of the}} train was on the lift, the anti-rollback mechanism had not fully engaged and broke. The steel roller coaster was built in 1987 and is one of Sweden's largest, reaching speeds up to 80km/h. Since the accident the roller coaster has opened again, after a technical adjustment.|$|E
25|$|All {{solenoids}} and coils used on microprocessor games {{include a}} special reverse-biased diode {{to eliminate a}} high-voltage pulse of reverse EMF (electromotive force). Without this diode, when the solenoid is de-energized, the magnetic field that was built up in the coil collapses and generates a brief, high-voltage pulse <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the wiring, capable of destroying the solid-state components used to control the solenoid. Proper wiring polarity must be retained during coil replacement or this diode will act as a dead short, immediately destroying electronic switches. Older electromechanical AC game solenoids do not require this diode, since they were controlled with mechanical switches. However, electromechanical games running on DC do require diodes to protect the rectifier.|$|E

The brake fins in the launch section are mounted to keep fast-moving trains from moving <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the station. [...] However, the fast-moving train being pulled forward caused an unexpected stress on a number of fins bending them forward. Not all required replacement, but there were more damaged brake fins than Six Flags had replacements for. Extra brake fins had to be ordered from the manufacturer, Intamin in Switzerland, and the ride had to undergo thorough testing following the repair. Kingda Ka reopened on August 4.|$|E

500|$|On 29 August 2002, Shakira {{performed}} [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City. Instead of tango, {{the performance}} of the song was inspired by samba and featured a large number of percussionists on the stage. Shakira incorporated belly dancing moves in her choreography and near {{to the end of the}} performance, she fell <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the crowd and [...] "was delivered back to the stage quickly enough not to miss a single line." [...] Jon Wiederhorn from MTV praised Shakira's stage presence and called her belly dancing routine [...] "seductive." [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] was included in the setlist of Tour of the Mongoose, Shakira's first worldwide tour that was launched in support of Laundry Service. Similar to the MTV Video Music Awards, a samba-oriented version of the song was performed and it was the final performance before the encore segment. The performance boasted instrumentation from numerous bongo drums. Corey Moss from MTV opined that it [...] "featured Shakira's best belly dancing yet" [...] and [...] "had the audience screaming for an encore." [...] Steve Baltin from Rolling Stone selected {{the performance of}} the song as one of the highlights of the show, saying [...] "surrounding herself with bongo drums during [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] she embodied all the glitz and glamour of good old-fashioned rock & roll." [...] At the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards ceremony, Spanish music duo Estopa performed a live cover of the song in rumba as part of the Latin Grammys tribute to Shakira, where she was honored Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the rule}} to allow QBs to simply kneel didn't take effect until 1987, Pisarcik took the snap on first down [...] and rolled {{on the ground}} (a common play for QBs in the pre-kneel era). Eagles middle linebacker Bill Bergey charged into Giants' center Jim Clack, {{knocking}} him <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> Pisarcik {{in a desperate attempt}} to force a fumble. Since defensive players usually are not blocked in this situation, they usually in turn do not rush. Offensive players consider any breach of this tacit agreement as a provocation, particularly linemen whose job it is to protect the quarterback, and fights between angry linemen and the opposition were not uncommon.|$|E
2500|$|The Browns {{faced the}} San Francisco 49ers, a {{perennial}} rival {{and one of}} the top teams in the AAFC, in their second preseason game. The 49ers took the lead seven minutes into the first period when Otto Graham attempted a lateral pass that was deflected by tackle Lou Rymkus and rolled <b>backward</b> <b>into</b> the Browns' own end zone. San Francisco end Gail Bruce fell on the ball and scored a touchdown. The 49ers scored again in the second quarter on a long pass from quarterback Frankie Albert to end Alyn Beals, extending their lead to 14–0. Cleveland came back, however, with a 66-yard drive that included a 46-yard touchdown pass from Graham to Dub Jones. The Browns advanced to the 49ers' 2-yard line in the final minute of the first half, but failed to score because of a fumble recovered by San Francisco. Cleveland scored two touchdowns in the third quarter and took a 21–14 lead; the first was a pass to end Dante Lavelli and the second a 35-yard rush by halfback Ara Parseghian. The score remained that way until the final minute of the fourth quarter, when a touchdown pass from Albert to Johnny Strzykalski tied the game. After the game, Brown said he considered the game a loss and [...] "wasn't at all satisfied" [...] with several players' performances.|$|E
