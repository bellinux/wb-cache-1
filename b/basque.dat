5|$|The Erromintxela {{arrived in}} the <b>Basque</b> Country in the 15th century {{speaking}} Kalderash Romani. They integrated much more deeply into <b>Basque</b> society than other Romani groups. In the process, they acquired the <b>Basque</b> language and adopted aspects of <b>Basque</b> culture such as increased rights of women and important traditions such as bertsolaritza (extemporaneous poetic song) and pelota (the national <b>Basque</b> ballgame). Muñoz and Lopez de Mungia suspect that the morphological and phonological similarities between Romani and <b>Basque</b> facilitated the adoption of <b>Basque</b> grammar by the bilingual Romanis.|$|E
5|$|According to Baudrimot, the Erromintxela {{have adopted}} the <b>Basque</b> names of the months. Note {{that some of the}} <b>Basque</b> names {{represent}} pre-standardisation names of the months, e.g. August is Abuztua in Standard <b>Basque</b> rather than Agorrila.|$|E
5|$|<b>Basque</b> {{people were}} the first to hunt right whales commercially, {{beginning}} as early as the 11th century in the Bay of Biscay. They initially sought oil, but as meat preservation technology improved, the animal was also used for food. <b>Basque</b> whalers reached eastern Canada by 1530 and the shores of Todos os Santos Bay (in Bahia, Brazil) by 1602. The last <b>Basque</b> voyages were made before the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). All attempts to revive the trade after the war failed. <b>Basque</b> shore whaling continued sporadically into the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Early {{attestations}} of {{the name}} in <b>Basque</b> include Errama-itçéla, Erroumancel, later errumanzel and erremaitzela. The initial E- is the <b>Basque</b> prosthetic vowel, added because no <b>Basque</b> word may begin with an R-, and the final -a is the absolutive case suffix, used when citing a name. If this etymology is correct, it is a rare case of a native Romani name for themselves (an endonym) being borrowed by another language.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} <b>Basque</b> grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into <b>Basque</b> society and the resultant bilingualism in <b>Basque.</b> The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the <b>Basque</b> Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern <b>Basque</b> Country.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{account of}} the {{language}} dates to 1855, when the French ethnographer Justin Cenac-Moncaut located the Erromintxela primarily in the Northern <b>Basque</b> Country. The oldest coherent Erromintxela text, a poem entitled Kama-goli, published by <b>Basque</b> writer Jon Mirande {{in a collection of}} <b>Basque</b> poetry, only dates to ca. 1960.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>Basques,</b> {{primarily}} from northern Spain, {{came to the}} area looking for gold but, meeting discrimination, it seemed to many that a better occupation was shepherding, familiar from their homeland.

5|$|There are {{currently}} an estimated 500 speakers in the Southern <b>Basque</b> Country in Spain, approximately 2% {{of a population}} of 21,000 Romanis, and another estimated 500 in France. In Spain the remaining fluent speakers are elderly people mostly {{over the age of}} 80; some are equally fluent in Spanish, <b>Basque,</b> or Caló. Middle-aged Erromintxela are mostly passive bilinguals, and the youngest speak only <b>Basque</b> or Spanish. In the Northern <b>Basque</b> Country, however, the language is still being passed on to children. The percentage of speakers among Spanish Erromintxela are higher than 2%, as large numbers of Caló-speaking Romanis moved to the <b>Basque</b> Country in the intense period of industrialisation in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|<b>Basque,</b> not an Indo-European language, {{survived in}} the region of the Pyrenees. The people of southwestern Gaul and northeastern Hispania (roughly present-day Aquitaine and Navarre) were {{regarded}} by Julius Caesar as ethnically distinct from the Celts, and the Aquitanian language they spoke was Vasconic like <b>Basque,</b> judging from place names. The Aquitani adopted Latin under Roman rule.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the <b>Basques</b> {{enjoyed a}} great deal of {{self-government}} until the French Revolution (1790) and the Carlist Wars (1839/1876), when the <b>Basques</b> supported heir apparent Carlos V and his descendants.

25|$|The {{new line}} west to Port aux <b>Basques</b> was {{completed}} between 1894 and 1898.

The Bruce arrived in the fall of 1897, before the line was completed to Port aux <b>Basques,</b> so her initial runs to Cape Breton Island were made from Little Placentia Sound. On 29 June 1898 the first passenger train arrived at Port aux <b>Basques</b> and the Bruce set sail with passengers for North Sydney.|$|R

5|$|St. John's {{is one of}} North America's oldest European settlements, with {{fishermen}} {{setting up}} seasonal camps in the early 16th century. Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name {{when he and his}} father, the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, in the morning of 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the <b>Basque</b> Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by <b>Basque</b> fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the <b>Basque</b> Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in <b>Basque,</b> Donibane).|$|E
50|$|In 602, the Merovingians {{created a}} {{frontier}} duchy to their southwest during the tripartite wars between Franks, Visigoths, and <b>Basques.</b> A certain Genial was then appointed dux wasconum {{as a way}} of better handling their relations with the <b>Basques.</b> At the same time, the Visigoths created the Duchy of Cantabria as a buffer against the <b>Basques</b> inhabiting west of current Navarre.The march of Vasconia (or Wasconia) was created with the purpose of controlling the <b>Basques</b> in Novempopulania, but it extended at this stage on the lands south and around the axis provided by the river Garonne between Bordeaux and Toulouse. About this period duke Francio is reported to vow allegiance to the Franks in Cantabria, an area inhabited by the <b>Basques,</b> but c. 612, the Gothic king Sisebut seems to have conquered the territory.|$|R
50|$|Les <b>Basques</b> (the <b>Basques)</b> is a {{regional}} county municipality in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region in eastern Quebec, Canada. It {{is located on}} the south bank of the Saint Lawrence River halfway between Rimouski and Rivière-du-Loup.|$|R
50|$|The strongest {{distinction}} between the <b>Basques</b> and their traditional neighbours is linguistic. Surrounded by Romance-language speakers, the <b>Basques</b> traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. The prevailing belief amongst <b>Basques,</b> and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity {{with the people who}} were in this region since not only pre-Roman and pre-Celtic times, but since the Stone Age.|$|R
5|$|When Captain John Halliday assumed {{command of}} Gibraltar in April 1807, she was {{serving in the}} Channel, part of a fleet under Admiral James Gambier. On 17March 1809 this fleet joined with Robert Stoppard's squadron, which was blockading the French fleet in the <b>Basque</b> Roads.

5|$|According to some authors, {{the name}} killer whale is a {{mistranslation}} of the 18th century Spanish name asesina-ballenas which means literally whale killer. <b>Basque</b> whalers {{would have given}} it such name after observing pods of orcas hunting baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French <b>Basque</b> Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted a reaction from anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a <b>Basque</b> bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
40|$|<b>Basques</b> are a {{cultural}} isolate, and, according to mainly allele frequencies of classical polymorphisms, also a genetic isolate. We investigated the differentiation of Spanish <b>Basques</b> {{from the rest}} of Iberian populations by means of a dense, genome-wide SNP array. We found that F ST distances between Spanish <b>Basques</b> and other populations were similar to those between pairs of non-Basque populations. The same result is found in a PCA of individuals, showing a general distinction between Iberians and other South Europeans independently of being <b>Basques.</b> Pathogen-mediated natural selection may be responsible for the high differentiation previously reported for <b>Basques</b> at very specific genes such as ABO, RH, and HLA. Thus, <b>Basques</b> cannot be considered a genetic outlier under a general genome scope and interpretations on their origin may have to be revised. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
