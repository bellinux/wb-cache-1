40|$|This AR {{system allows}} a user to watch “virtual <b>baseball</b> <b>game</b> ” {{on a real}} {{tabletop}} baseball field model through a web-camera attached to a LCD monitor. The <b>baseball</b> <b>game</b> scenes generated with CG are overlaid onto images of the field model where multiple planar markers are distributed. The <b>baseball</b> <b>game</b> played on the field model is the replayed game, which is reproduced by input history data of an actual game. Our system can help the user to understand the game history easily via watching the replayed game by virtual 3 D players. For the registration of the virtual <b>baseball</b> <b>game</b> scenes onto {{the images of the}} real world captured with the web-camera, the camera motion is estimated by multiple planar markers distributed at arbitrary positions and directions. This system can automatically estimate the geometrical arrangement of the markers via multiple projective 3 D spaces, which are constructed by some reference images. Therefore, manual measuring tasks in advance is not required. The virtual <b>baseball</b> <b>game</b> can be watched from various view points with moving around the wide space. Various arrangements of the markers also realize the stable registration of the virtual objects. This system will provide a new style of watching and enjoying the <b>baseball</b> <b>game...</b>|$|R
