40|$|Transcription begins] METEROLOGY UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCE January 19, 1944 Dear Bryant Service Club Members, Thanks {{a million}} for {{remember}}ing me at Christmas with that swell package of holiday candy. I remember well {{the time of}} its arrival for I was confined to my room with a bad cold, and rather at sword’s points with the world. But your gift with the Christmas cheer and the news of other Bryant fellows in the service made me feel one hundred percent better. This is my ninth month here at Hamilton College studying Meteorology in the Air Force. I thought the course was tough at Bryant, but you should see this one. The academic schedule gets under way weekly on Mondays at 8 A. M. and breezes along with eleven hours of fixed appointments daily or a nice little total 59 hours a week, this including drill and physical education which are thrown in along with mathematics, physics, English, history, public speaking, and cartography. Mathematics, of course, is the big load; it comes at a rate of 28 hours a week, starting out mildly with college algebra and working into trigonometry, calculus, differential equations, and advanced calculus, all to the accompaniment of vector analysis and mechanics. Except that the emphasis is more on the practical and less on the philosophical -. So much for the math. By comparison, the physics is easy. It takes 11 hours a week including laboratory, but in general is not much more advanced than work that would normally be encountered by a sophomore in college. Eight more hours a week go into cartography, which early in the year blends into world geography. The English is the equivalent of about one year of freshman composition. One hour a week is spent in class discussing assigned reading, while two hours are spent also turning out 500 word themes in a writing laboratory. The Public Speaking is about what I had in Bryant, with possibly more than the normal emphasis on extemporaneous appearances. In history we study some of the basic documents, and then look behind these documents to find origins in the philosophy of Voltaire, Rousseau, Locke, etc. So much for the strictly academic side of the program which with meals, one hour of military drill, one hour of physical fitness (calisthenics, obstacle-racing, and swimming), and a whole half-hour of leisure just before dinner fills every chink of spare time from 8 A. M. to 9 : 30 P. M., Monday through Friday, and 8 A. M. to 3 P. M. on Saturday. Taps sounds at 10 : 30, thus giving us a whole hour {{at the end of the}} day to catch our breath, <b>bull</b> <b>session</b> over cokes, write letters, shave, or simply stare at the ceiling. But it’s taps for this letter too. Remember me to the faculty and everyone else there at Bryant. Sincerely, Irving W. Knight ‘ 43 Hamilton College Clinton, N. Y. – Flight 12.

40|$|Transcription begins] 27 November 1944 Somewhere in Germany My {{wonderful}} sweets, Today {{the mailman}} brought me 4 letters 2 ̆ 6 2 packages. Ukie’s letter, your v-mail {{letter of the}} 14 th of Nov., and your air mail letter[s] of the 16 th and 17 th of November arrived {{as well as a}} Christmas package from Harold 2 ̆ 6 Alma and the cigarette lighter from Mort. This regular mail delivery is doing wonders for my morale even though it hasn’t suffered of late. That party for Sanford sounded darn cute. Gee, hon, I’m so terribly sorry that you didn’t feel so well that evening. Darling, I’ve asked you to mentioned [sic] the dates you receive my letters—merely to determine how long my letters take to reach you. You know, I’ve sent you the suede brush in the same package I mailed you the film. Some of the remarks in this letter may be rather disjoined [sic] since I am scanning your letters for queries, etc. Is it considered a privilege to join the Cleve. Assoc. for Nursery Education? Do join, ear, if you think that you’ll get anything which will benefit you professionally. As far as money, dear, don’t worry your pretty little head. I can’t spend money here for “love or money. ” I think we’ll be sitting pretty nicely by the time the war is over and I hope it’s over tomorrow. That little story of the “Jones Boys” is cute. All of the officers are getting a kick out of it. And as far as that article by Richard Harding—we said the same thing ever since we had the opportunity to visit San Antonio. Darling, I’m becoming quite a correspondent, if I have to say so myself. I’m right up to the minute on all my correspondence and have been averaging 6 to 7 letters per night. Sweets, if you were at my side, you’d be doing all the letter writing—you know it, don’t you? What I wouldn’t give to have you at my side—Oh, Boy! Just one hour of love!! Lt. Haygood[‘s], one of the battery officer’s [sic] wife is expecting a baby around Christmas. Gee, but he worries himself sick and is really “sweating it out. ” Watching him makes me glad that we didn’t plunge before I came over. The Rueben’s [sic] Xmas box arrived in excellent shape. It contained anchovies, salted pecan nuts, mints, gums, book, cheese spread, gum, candy 2 ̆ 6 canned frankfurters. Each item was individually wrapped in pieces of “P. M. ” paper. This makes the second time I received anchovies. The first came in Rosen’s [sic] package. I really and truly like them, too. Ukie’s picture is rather charming and does her proud. I’m sending out some G. I. Christmas cards if I can get to it. Say, sweets, how is your dieting coming along? I’m awaiting a report on latest developments. This evening we took pictures of our little cellar “den. ” If the pictures come out O. K. I’ll send you the negatives. There’s an awful lot of “rigarole” [sic] you’ve got to go through to get films printed. First you’ve got to send the roll of exposed film to a censor who develops the film 2 ̆ 6 censors it. Your negatives are returned and I’ve yet to learn where you get them printed. Are you adding any photos to the album? Why not? O. K., so you are. You know, I’d like to spend about 10 minutes with you in a “hollering session” followed by a love session (frustrated personality). I suppose you know I’m saving all your letters and {{hope to be able to}} read them to our kids when we gather around the fire for a family <b>bull</b> <b>session.</b> That will be fun, darling. Honestly, honey, I’m feeling swell and my morale is excellent. As soon as the censorship ban is lifted I’ll be able to tell you all about our outfit[‘]s contribution to history. Are you saving all the clippings about the 9 th Army[?] I want to put them in a scrap book. Goodnight, darling. It’s late and I must have my 10 hrs. sleep. I love you like mad and can’t wait to have you in my arms. Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E

The study divides the firms into two groups in terms of the ratios of price on earning as well as price on book value into two groups of value and growth portfolios.
