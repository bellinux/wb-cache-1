40|$|This season, {{partly due}} to the {{departure}} of my co-writer Joel Jorgensen and {{partly due to}} mental aging, I have shortened the species accounts by including only data that add to our current knowledge base. I will not routinely list early and late dates and peak counts for each species unless they are significant; readers should refer to past issues of NBR for guidelines as to what are early or late dates and high counts. Observers are, however, urged to report early and late dates and high counts of all migrant species; {{it is difficult to know}} if a sighting is significant until all the reports are pooled in my computer. In general, most observers thought this a fairly routine fall, although the Panhandle continued to be a source of significant new information, thanks to consistent coverage by Steven Dinsmore. Similar coverage of the Rainwater Basin by Joel Jorgensen also has enhanced our knowledge considerably. Every report is valuable: very few of the large list of observers fail to have at least one of their sightings included in the report. There were no new species added to the state list this fall, but this year was amazing in that respect, with 7 new species (some awaiting approval by the Records Committee) bringing the total state list to a very respectable 441 species. Rarest this fall was the pair of <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Ducks</b> in the Rainwater Basin, a second documented state record. Also very rare were a 7 th state record White-winged Dove and 8 th state record Lesser Goldfinch. Other interesting finds included a Brant of the western race, 3 Pomarine Jaegers, the first documented central Nebraska Blue-headed Vireo, a Mountain Chickadee, a Varied Thrush, another report of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow, the first Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole for fall east of the Panhandle, and a White-winged Crossbill. Some rather amazing counts were made: 35, 000 Western Grebes (considered conservative by the experienced observer!), a total of about 300 Great Egrets, 6000 and 4200 Blue-winged Teal, 1492 Ruddy Ducks (no estimating there!), 12, 000 Cliff Swallows, 16 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharp-tailed Sparrows, and good numbers of Purple Finches for a change. Interesting range expansions were noted for Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Chipping Sparrow, while the continued presence of Pileated Woodpeckers at Fontenelle Forest adds to the uniqueness of that area in terms of species which breed there and nowhere else that we know about: Red-shouldered Hawk and Yellow-throated Warbler are others.

40|$|On 29 October 1989 John Andersen of Ong, Nebraska, {{shot and}} killed an adult male <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Duck</b> while duck hunting at Hansen Waterfowl Production Area, 3 miles north and 1 mile west of Ong, Clay Co., Nebraska (T 6 N R 5 W Section 35). Andersen 2 ̆ 7 s brother-in-law, Stewart Porterfield of Lincoln, {{was present at the}} time and {{tentatively}} identified the specimen but returned to their vehicle to get a bird book for reference (Porterfield, pers. comm. 2 November 1989). Mr. Porterfield took the frozen, intact duck specimen to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission office in Lincoln where it was recommended that the specimen be deposited at the University of Nebraska State Museum (UNSM). The frozen specimen was delivered and donated to UNSM (Accession Z- 1989 - 55) by Mr. Porterfield on 2 November 1989. The specimen was prepared as a standard study skin and partial skeleton by the author on 7 November 1989 and catalogued into Division of Zoology 2 ̆ 7 s collections as UNSM ZM- 16079. Dendrocygna autumnalis (Linnaeus), the <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Duck,</b> is not on the official list of birds in Nebraska (N. O. U. R. C., 1988, 1989) and was not listed as even hypothetical in a critically evaluated list of Nebraska birds (Bray et al., 1986). However, Black-bellied Whistling-Ducks, whose normal range is from southern Arizona and southern Texas south to southern Brazil and Argentina, have wandered north, including to Kansas, Iowa, and Michigan (AO. U., 1983). There are three records of this species in Kansas (Thompson 2 ̆ 6 Ely, 1989) and a recent sighting in Minnesota that is under consideration of the Minnesota Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Records Committee (Tveten, 1989). A written description and photographs of UNSM ZM- 16079 have been submitted to the Nebraska Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union Records Committee for consideration...|$|E
40|$|This {{summer was}} marked by {{continuing}} high water tables along the Missouri River and good water levels in the eastern Rainwater Basin. As a result, American and Least Bitterns, King Rail, Common Moorhen, and several American Coot nests in Sarpy Co were reported. However, Great and Snowy Egrets were scarce, and Black-necked Stilts were absent from the eastern Rainwater Basin after several good breeding years there. First breeding records for the state are always exciting; Lesser Goldfinch finally took the plunge this year in Banner Co. Also encouraging were increased reports of Black-billed Cuckoo (9) and both Black-billed Magpie and Black-capped Chickadee. Mountain Plovers are present in southwest Kimball Co in surprising numbers, with excellent conservation work being done there. The group responsible for the effort has an excellent Facebook site (see species account). Significant breeding records were made for Burrowing Owl, Long-eared Owl, and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Blackbird. Strangely, three species of migrant warblers were found in midsummer: Orange-crowned, Nashville, and Blackburnian, {{as well as a}} late June White-crowned Sparrow. Dickcissels again made a good showing in the west. Other eastern birds far west included Eastern Wood-Pewee and Summer Tanager. On the other hand, the earliest ever Rufous Hummingbird {{in the eastern part of}} the state was in Lincoln. True rarities were few: a <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Duck</b> and a summer American Black Duck were probably the best...|$|E
40|$|We present 9 recent {{records of}} rare waterfowls in Baja California Sur, {{all of them}} in {{artificial}} wetlands: 3 freshwater sites and 1 concentration area for a saltworks. We present the first records of the Ross's Goose in the state. The remaining 8 species are: <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Duck</b> (breeding), Fulvous Whistling-Duck, Greater White-fronted Goose, Snow Goose, Cackling Goose, Tundra Swan, Mallard and Hooded Merganser. To this list we added an historical compilation of the records of these species in artificial sites of the state. The artificial wetlands are no replacement for their natural counterparts, they are nevertheless {{an important part of the}} region's landscape mosaic. As the records of the present work exemplify, this man-made habitat increases the regional species richness, and should be considered as important areas that need to be protected.

40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the spring season had {{something}} for everyone: potential range expansions, an incredible shorebird migration through the eastern Rainwater Basin, a scarcity of migrant warblers, and some genuinely rare birds. Timely spring rainfall transformed the Rainwater Basin, leaving large areas of sheetwater for migrant shorebirds and improving the attractiveness of wetlands, particularly renovated wetlands, to certain breeding species. Perhaps the most important bits of information we can record here are changes in breeding ranges or behavior. Of significance here is the second nesting record for Hooded Merganser, the increasing occurrence of Greater Prairie-Chickens at Rainwater Basin grasslands, the return of Mississippi Kites to Red Cloud, nesting Black-necked Stilts and American Avocets in the Rainwater Basin, discovery of Barn Owls in northeast Nebraska, expansion into the state of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, possible breeding of Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcrackers on the Pine Ridge, the continued feeding of grackle and robin chicks by the Sioux Co Curve-billed Thrasher (now {{considered to be a}} Husker), increasing evidence of Spotted Towhee introgression at Schramm State Park, and extra-limital nestings of Pine Siskin. The shorebird migration through the Rainwater Basin was one for the ages, with record numbers of Hudsonian Godwits, Ruddy Turnstones, Dunlin, and Buff-breasted Sandpipers found. Numbers of other species were also high, and L Mcconaughy contributed with a record count of Whimbrels. On the other hand, migrant warblers were drastically lower in numbers, notably Nashville Warbler (8), Chestnut-sided Warbler (3), Magnolia Warbler (1), Black-throated Green Warbler (1), and Blackburnian Warbler (0). What this means will have to wait for a regional or national perspective. Rarities were in evidence also, with some real 2 ̆ 2 zooties 2 ̆ 2 : <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Duck,</b> Anhinga, Glossy Ibis, White-tailed Kite, Red Knot, Ruff, Little Gull, White-eyed Vireo (in Sioux Co, no less), and Connecticut Warbler...|$|E
40|$|This summer most of Nebraska {{was very}} dry, with 2 ̆ 2 Exceptional Drought 2 ̆ 2 {{everywhere}} but the extreme southeast, {{according to the}} United States Department of Agriculture 2 ̆ 7 s Drought Monitor ([URL] Although no really striking effects were noted, several bits of evidence attested to the difficult conditions. Wetlands dried up in most cases in the Rainwater Basin, reflected {{by a lack of}} Great Egrets, Cattle Egrets, and Black-necked Stilts, and there were no stilt nests reported. However, Yellow-crowned Night-Herons surprisingly staged an incursion, perhaps continuing to disperse northward from their customary haunts in the almost equally dry Kansas and Oklahoma. Cliff Swallow colonies may have been a casualty of dried up wetlands also; flocking began about a month earlier than usual. A significant incursion of Red Crossbills and early arrival of Red-breasted Nuthatches indicated problems in their usual pinewoods habitats in the Pine Ridge and Rocky Mountains (recordings from Kansas [Jon King, pers. comm. ] suggested that most if not all of the crossbills were Type 2 Ponderosa Pine specialists). Red Crossbills moved eastward to cover the state in July, the first such summer incursion in about 20 years. Other significant observations involved nesting of 3 raptor species: both Broad-winged Hawk and Mississippi Kite nested in North Platte, and Ospreys again attempted to nest in the Panhandle but continue to be thwarted by severe weather. Black-billed Cuckoo is becoming rare; only one was reported. On the other hand, Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widow is doing well, expanding northwestward and increasing in numbers, and Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are being reported more often westward; photos are supporting the identification of these westerly birds. It was a quiet summer for summer resident passerines; no significant trends or phenomena were noted, except for the pinewoods residents mentioned above. Similarly, rarities were almost non-existent; <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-Duck</b> and an easterly Broad-tailed Hummingbird were about it...|$|E
40|$|Laguna de Cuyutlán, in {{the state}} of Colima, Mexico, is the only large coastal wetland in a span of roughly 1150 km. Despite this, the study of its birds has been largely neglected. Between 2003 and 2006 we {{assessed}} the waterbirds nesting in the middle portion of Laguna Cuyutlán, a large tropical coastal lagoon, through field visits. We documented the nesting of 15 species of non-Laridae waterbirds: Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), Tricolored Egret (Egretta tricolor), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), Great Egret (Ardea alba), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), Black-crowned Nightheron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Yellow-crowned Night-heron (Nyctanassa violacea), Green Heron (Butorides virescens), Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Whistling-duck</b> (Dendrocygna autumnalis), Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris), Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus), and Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus). These add to six species of Laridae known to nest in that area: Laughing Gulls (Larus atricilla), Royal Terns (Thalasseus maximus), Gull-billed Terns (Gelochelidon nilotica), Forster’s Terns (S. forsteri), Least Terns (Sternula antillarum), and Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger), and to at least 57 species using it during the non-breeding season. With such bird assemblages, Laguna Cuyutlán is an important site for waterbirds, which should be given conservation status. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (1) : 391 - 397. Epub 2008 March 31. Durante la prospección de la parte media de la Laguna Cuyutlán, una gran laguna costera en Colima, México, entre 2003 y 2006, documentamos la anidación de 15 especies de aves acuáticas que no pertenecer a la familia Laridae: Phalacrocorax brasilianus, Egretta tricolor, Egretta thula, Egretta caerulea, Ardea alba, Bubulcus ibis, Nycticorax nycticorax, Nyctanassa violacea, Butorides virescens, Platalea ajaja, Eudocimus albus, Dendrocygna autumnalis, Rallus longirostris, Charadrius alexandrinus e Himantopus mexicanus. Estas se suman a seis especies de Laridae que anidan en esta parte de la laguna: Larus atricilla, Thalasseus maximus, Gelochelidon nilotica, Sterna forsteri, Sternula antillarum y Rynchops niger, y a cuando menos 57 especies de aves acuáticas que la usan durante la época no reproductiva.
