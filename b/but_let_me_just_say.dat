40|$|I vividly {{recall a}} {{time in my life}} [...] {{especially}} my late teens and early 				twenties [...] when I thought I could be anyone but had no idea which anyone to be. For 				this I blame (or credit) my liberal arts education, which convinced me that there 				was really nothing I couldn 2 ̆ 7 t master but gave me little or no indication of what I 				should do (beyond platitudes like 2 ̆ 2 discover myself 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 do good 2 ̆ 2). So I thrashed 				about, armed with an ounce of knowledge and a ton of arrogance. I was insufferable. 				I won 2 ̆ 7 t go into details, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>say</b> my quest to discover who I was ended 				rather badly, albeit not in the long term. Life taught me what my liberal arts 				education couldn 2 ̆ 7 t: that I was who I was and not much more. Having read Rosamund 				Bartlett 2 ̆ 7 s excellent Tolstoy: A Russia Life (Houghton Mifflin, 2011), I 2 ̆ 7 m left 				wondering if Tolstoy ever came to this realization. Throughout his life, he searched 				for his true self. His launching pad was not a liberal arts education, but rather an 				aristocratic background, a flock of tutors, and a remarkable talent. The first 				taught Tolstoy that he could do anything he wanted (which was largely true as it 				concerned the serfs that Tolstoy 2 ̆ 7 s family owned); the second gave him the cultural 				tools he needed to conduct his search; and the third gave him the ability to rise 				above all the other Russian aristocrats who were {{trying to figure out what}} they 				should do and where Russia should go. Tolstoy tried on Russian identities the way 				you try on cloths at a department store. He was, by turns, a student, a slacker, 				an enfant terrible, a rake, a soldier, a pianist, a slave master, a gambler, a 				journalist, a teacher, a bee-keeper, a patriarch, a national poet, a peasant, a 				pundit, and a child-of-nature. At the end of his life he became a holy fool, or 				monk, or cult leader [...] take your pick. Some see this identity as his final 				destination, his moment of Buddha-like enlightenment. I don 2 ̆ 7 t think so. Had he lived 				another five years he would have become someone else. Tolstoy [...] perpetual 				adolescent. Thankfully for us, the common thread in his loosely woven life was 				writing. He was a always a writer, and one with preternatural descriptive and 				dramatic gifts. Rosamund Bartlett is also a writer with considerable gifts, which 				explains why her grasp of Tolstoy is so solid and why her ability to vividly portray 				him so great. If you want to know Tolstoy, read Bartlett...|$|E

When a man makes an {{unsuitable}} marriage (nobody's fault, you know, but purely accidental incompatibility of tastes); when he is deprived by that misfortune of the domestic sympathy which, I take it, is what a man marries for; when in short, his wife is rather worse than no wife at all (through no fault of his own, of course), is it to be wondered at if he makes matters worse at first by blaming her, and even, in his desperation, by occasionally drinking himself into a violent condition or seeking sympathy elsewhere? ...|$|R

40|$|Thank you for {{the kind}} {{introduction}} and for the very clear summary of the arguments of Multicultural Citizenship. So I thought I’d just mention {{a couple of the}} ideas that I’ve been working with more recently. The first concerns this. There are two main types of groups that I’ve been thinking of - immigrant groups and national minorities. What kinds of rights are appropriate for these two different types of groups. I discuss this in the book. I’ve been thinking a little bit just about trying to be more precise about the types of institutions and policies that are appropriate for these two kinds of groups and I’ve changed the terminology a bit. I would now talk about these in terms of immigrant multiculturalism for immigrant groups and multi-nation federalism for national minorities. So <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> say that I hope it’s not dramatically different from what’s in the book <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> clarify what I mean by those terms, because I will use them...|$|R

In 2008, the duo's song [...] "Hey Baby" [...] was featured on the Sex and the City, Vol. 2: More Music soundtrack. During her {{time away from the}} spotlight, Walker also provided backing vocals for Jennifer Hudson and Fergie. She explained that [...] "I wasn't really thinking about coming back with another album because I thought, 'You know what? I'm not really trying to do the artist thing anymore. I love to sing <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> work alongside people." [...] She explained her hiatus from the music industry by saying [...] "If you're an artist doing something else you feel like people aren't really trying to buy into it because these artists have flooded the market so much. It just makes you wonder, 'Why should I bother? No one's going to be interested in what I'm trying to do. I was locked into that industry. When I got out I realized there was a shortage of the kind of music I was making, what the Jill Scott's and Erykah Badu's were making; so I think someone needs to come back and rectify that." ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> {{begin by}} {{focusing}} on the long list of agreements between the Dan Zahavi and me. As he is such a careful and scholarly author, there are almost no misunderstandings {{to get out of the}} way first. At the beginning of section 2, there is a conflation of different concepts of possibility. If we grant that imaginability is conceivability (in the sense of being describable without any logical contradictions), if we pass over “practical ” possibility as a non-defined term, and grant that by “physically ” possible Zahavi very likely means “nomologically ” possible, it still would present a major step to say that something is conceptually or (my emphasis) metaphysically possible. Not everything that is logically or conceptually possible is metaphysically possible as well—metaphysically possible worlds (just like nomologically possible worlds) have to be interpreted as a subset of logically possible worlds. How this can be done is a subject of intense and highly technical debates in current philosophy of mind. We cannot possibly enter this debate here, <b>but</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>just</b> point out how, for instance, Zahavi’s remarks in the second paragraph of page 4 rest on a conflation between nomological and logical possibility. A second misunderstanding, traditionally and typically reiterated by phenomenologists, is the rhetorical question of whether pathology can actually reveal something fundamental about the deep structure of normal experience. Neurophenomenological case studies are simply instruments in the search for a functionalist theory of mind. The aim is not to make sweeping claims about the structure of non-pathological experience, but to isolate distinct causal roles, to find double dissociations—to investigate which forms of phenomenal content are independent of eac...|$|R
