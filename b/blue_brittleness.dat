50|$|Because the PLC {{effect is}} related to a {{strengthening}} mechanism, the strength of steel may increase; however, the plasticity and ductility of a material afflicted by the PLC effect decrease drastically. The PLC effect is known to induce <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> in steel; additionally, the loss of ductility may cause rough surfaces to develop during deformation (Al-Mg alloys are especially susceptible to this), rendering them useless for autobody or casting applications.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> is {{exhibited}} by some steels after being heated to an elevated temperature. Although at high temperature a given strain {{is associated with}} a lower stress level, at the temperature at which <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> is observed there is a pronounced work-hardening effect. Furthermore, the temperature at which <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> occurs {{is a function of the}} strain rate. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations of hot or warm working which utilizes the thermal softening of steels, a dynamic constitutive equation which can model the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> phenomenon is needed. In this paper we present such a constitutive equation, which has two parts : one models the ordinary constitutive relation and the other the phenomenon of <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness.</b> Unknown material constants in the equation are determined by a non-linear least-squares method from uniaxial impact and static compressive test results. The equation is then evaluated by comparing it to experiments over a wide temperature range...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a temperature dependent static constitutive equation for carbon steels, {{which can be}} applied for wide temperature range involving the range where <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> occurs. Generally, a stress induced in steel at a certain strain decrees with the temperature. However, the occurrence of <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> of steels increases the values of work hardening. As a result, the stresses increase with the temperature due to the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness.</b> Thus, the stress-strain relation-ships of steels seemingly have negative dependence to the {{temperature within the range}} involving the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness.</b> Since this phenomenon arises remarkably at static strain-rate, the present paper has proposed a temperature dependent static constitutive equation. Concretely, the paper decomposes the stress-strain relation of steels into an unaffected part and affected part by the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness,</b> and derives equations revealing those parts respectively. The proposed constitutive equation is expressed by the sum of them. The paper actually obtains unknown material constants involved in the proposed equations by a nonlinear least squares from measured results and confirms the appropriateness of the proposed constitutive equation over the wide temperature range...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, some visual {{observations}} {{have been}} demonstrated therein, depending on the surface colour, as they are valuable for an approximate estimation of the experienced temperature in steel. In particular, at a temperature of 300  °C, blue colour has been observed (<b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> phenomenon), while above 600  °C, the surface becomes dark and the fire damage on the steel specimens has been visible. In addition, the surface is clean for specimens cooled in air, while rust has been observed for the ones cooled by water.|$|E
40|$|Snoek {{has shown}} that when carbon atoms move from one {{possible}} set of interstitial sites in the lattice of a-iron to another set they cause shear strains. Cottrell {{has shown that}} the stress around a dislocation may be relieved by the migration of solute atoms in its neighbourhood, and that the dislocation is then bound to its present position. By combining these theories with the usual theory of age-hardening it is possible to explain the existence of a yeield point, quench aging, strain aging, delayed yield and <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> as consequences of the presence of carbon in iron. A rough quantitative theory of the time-aging effects is given, and shown to agree with experiment. The need for further experiment is emphasized. Royal Society Warren Research Fello...|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} {{model of}} a temperature and strain-rate dependent dynamic constitutive equation for carbon steels is proposed. Unknown material constants involved in the proposed constitutive equation can {{be determined by the}} non-linear least squares method, which approximates ordinary-impact-test results with calculated values of elasto-plastic waves propagation analyses. In addition static stress-strain curves, longitudinal elastic modulus and yield stress, which are needed for elasto-plastic waves propagation analyses with the proposed constitutive equation, are expressed as a function of temperature. These results enable elasto-plastic waves propagation analyses under wide strain-rate and temperature ranges easily. The present paper has actually determined material constants involved in the proposed constitutive equation and compared the calculated results with measured ones. As a result, it has been confirmed that the proposed equation is applicable at a wide strain rate range and at a room temperature to less than one in which <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> occurs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{promising}} light-weight and high-performance structure components, large-diameter thin-walled (LDTW) Ti– 6 Al– 4 V {{titanium alloy}} (TC 4) bent tubes are needed most urgently in many {{industries such as}} aviation and aerospace. Warm bending may be a feasible way for manufacturing these components. Understanding their temperature and strain rate dependent tensile behavior is the foundation for formability improvement and warm bending design. In this paper, uniaxial tensile tests were conducted at elevated temperatures ranging from 298 K to 873 K at tensile velocities of 2, 10, 15 mm/min. The main {{results show that the}} tensile behavior of LDTW TC 4 tubes is different from that of TC 4 sheets. The typical elongation of TC 4 tubes at room temperature is 10 % lower than that of TC 4 sheets. The flow stress of TC 4 tubes decreases greatly by about 50 % with the temperature rising to 873 K. At temperatures of 573 – 673 K, the hardening exponent is at its highest value, which means the deformation mechanism changes from twining to more dislocation movement by slipping. The fracture elongation of TC 4 tubes fluctuates with increasing temperature, which is associated with changes in the deformation mechanism and with the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness.</b> The fractography of TC 4 tubes at various temperatures, especially at 673 K, shows that second phases and impurities significantly influence fracture elongation. By considering the characteristics of the tensile behavior and by properly choosing the die material, the warm bending for TC 4 tubes can be achieved at temperatures of 723 – 823 K...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{chemical}} composition and cooling rate on the static strain aging (SSA) and dynamic strain aging (DSA) behaviors of four IF steels was investigated after reheating to different temperatures and cooling {{to room temperature}} at various rates. In the case of DSA, tensile tests were carried out over the range from room temperature to 450 °C and at strain rates of 10 - 4 to 10 - 1 s- 1. The DSA behavior was also studied in torsion in the austenite and ferrite regions. Aging index (AI) tests were carried out to evaluate the response to SSA and to estimate {{the amount of carbon}} in solution after employing various cooling rates. In all cases, although the atomic Ti/C ratio was greater than one, even still air cooling (3 °C/s) led to a supersaturated/unstabilized material and to the occurrence of both DSA and SSA. By contrast, there were no signs of SSA and DSA after furnace cooling (0. 05 °C/s). The three Ti and the Ti-Nb IF grades studied displayed serrated flow behavior at all strain rates in the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> temperature range (100 to 300 °C). A simple model is described that predicts whether or not DSA will occur at the strain rates and temperatures involved in the processing of IF steels. It was found that the higher the Ti/S ratio, the higher the solute C. Steels with different chemistries but equal Ti/S ratios displayed the same aging behavior. Internal friction measurements were executed to establish a calibration between the AI values and solute C levels. Two novel techniques for the strengthening of IF steels by dynamic bake hardening (BH) are presented. These techniques lead to much higher BH values compared to those produced by conventional BH methods. The observations also show that when C supersaturation results from cooling after coiling, lower annealing temperatures after cold rolling lead to higher solute C levels...|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{finite element}} {{modelling}} of key elements {{is essential to}} improve the robustness assessment of structures subjected to a coupled effect of fire and blast. Focusing the attention on steel structures, a method for a realistic multi-hazard approach is presented. The problem has been investigated at the material level first {{and then at the}} structural level. The material level was studied performing a detailed experimental investigation {{in a wide range of}} strain rates and temperatures. A typical structural steel, namely S 355, has been studied. A Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar equipped with a water-cooled induction heating system was used for the mechanical characterisation at high strain rates (300 1 /s, 500 1 /s and 850 1 /s) and in a wide range of temperatures (20 C, 200 C, 400 C, 550 C, 700 C and 900 C). A Hydro-Pneumatic machine and a universal electromechanical testing machine were used for intermediate (5 1 /s and 25 1 /s) and quasi-static (0. 001 1 /s) strain rate tests at room temperature, respectively. Results showed that the S 355 structural steel is strain rate sensitive, keeping its strain hardening capacity with increasing strain rates. The temperature effect was studied by means of the reduction factors for the main mechanical properties. Results at high strain rates highlighted also the <b>blue</b> <b>brittleness</b> phenomenon between 400 C and 550 C. The link between the material and the structural level is a material constitutive law able to take into account the strain rate sensitivity and the thermal softening. The widely used constitutive law proposed by Johnson and Cook was calibrated using the experimental results. A critical review of this material model highlighted a perceptible variation of the thermal softening parameter at different temperatures. Following a fitting approach, a modification of the dimensionless temperature (T*) has been proposed. The structural level was numerically investigated adopting the calibrated material model. Explicit non-linear dynamic analyses of a steel column under fire conditions and followed by an explosion were performed. The commercial code LS-DYNA was used. A method for a realistic multi-hazard approach has been proposed by studying the residual load bearing capacity. The results can be also of great interest to establish the initial conditions that could potentially lead to the onset of progressive collapse in steel framed structures under a combined effect of fire and blast. As expected, the results indicated that the load bearing capacity is influenced by the stand-off distance, the charge size as well as the column boundary conditions. The time of fire loading at which an explosion is triggered is a critical parameter as well...|$|E
