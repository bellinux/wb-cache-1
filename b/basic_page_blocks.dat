40|$|Abstract—Web pages—especially {{dynamically}} generated ones—contain {{several items}} that cannot {{be classified as}} the “primary content, ” e. g., navigation sidebars, advertisements, copyright notices, etc. Most clients and end-users search for the primary content, and largely do not seek the noninformative content. A tool that assists an end-user or application to search and process information from Web pages automatically, must separate the “primary content sections ” from the other content sections. We call these sections as “Web <b>page</b> <b>blocks</b> ” or just “blocks. ” First, a tool must segment the Web pages into Web <b>page</b> <b>blocks</b> and, second, the tool must separate the primary content blocks from the noninformative content blocks. In this paper, we formally define Web <b>page</b> <b>blocks</b> and devise a new algorithm to partition an HTML page into constituent Web <b>page</b> <b>blocks.</b> We then propose four new algorithms, ContentExtractor, FeatureExtractor, K-FeatureExtractor, and L-Extractor. These algorithms identify primary content blocks by 1) looking for blocks that do not occur {{a large number of}} times across Web pages, by 2) looking for blocks with desired features, and by 3) using classifiers, trained with block-features, respectively. While operating on several thousand Web pages obtained from various Web sites, our algorithms outperform several existing algorithms with respect to runtime and/or accuracy. Furthermore, we show that a Web cache system that applies our algorithms to remove noninformative content blocks and to identify similar <b>blocks</b> across Web <b>pages</b> can achieve significant storage savings...|$|R

40|$|Making use ofblock {{information}} in Web IR and Data Mining tasks {{calls for a}} good understanding of the function of each block. Existing works on classifying block functions andjudging block importance have not made full use of the image factor, and only simple image features were considered. We regard image as a strong indicator of Web <b>page</b> <b>blocks</b> with various functions and propose to learn block functions using roles of images as part of block features. Blocks are generated from Web page segmentation and roles of images are automatically decided by image classification. We experiment on 140 Web pages and demonstrate that utilizing roles of images can significantly improve the classification quality of learning Web <b>page</b> <b>block</b> functions. We also measure the usefulness of diferent roles of images and evaluate the effect oftwo page segmentation methods...|$|R

40|$|One {{means of}} {{enforcing}} Web censorship is {{to return a}} <b>block</b> <b>page,</b> which informs the user that an attempt to access a webpage is un-successful. Detecting <b>block</b> <b>pages</b> can provide a more complete picture of Web censorship, but automatically identifying <b>block</b> <b>pages</b> is difficult because Web content is dynamic, personalized, and may even be in different languages. Previous work has manu-ally detected and identified <b>block</b> <b>pages,</b> which is difficult to repro-duce; it is also time-consuming, which {{makes it difficult to}} perform continuous, longitudinal studies of censorship. This paper presents an automated method both to detect <b>block</b> <b>pages</b> and to fingerprint the filtering products that generate them. Our automated method enables continuous measurements of block pages; we found that our methods successfully detect 95 % of <b>block</b> <b>pages</b> and identify five filtering tools, including a tool that had not been previously identified “in the wild”. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As {{web sites}} {{are getting more}} complicated, the {{construction}} of web information extraction systems becomes more troublesome and time-consuming. A common theme is the difficulty in locating the segments of a page in which the target information is contained, which we call the informative blocks. This article reports on the Recognising Informative <b>Page</b> <b>Blocks</b> algorithm (RIPB), which is {{able to identify the}} informative block in a web page so that information extraction algorithms can work on it more efficiently. RIPB relies on an existing algorithm for vision-based <b>page</b> <b>block</b> segmentation to analyse and partition a web page into a set of visual blocks, and then groups related blocks with similar content structures into block clusters by using a tree edit distance method. RIPB recognises the informative block cluster by using tree alignment and tree matching. A series of experiments were performed, and the conclusions were that RIPB was more than 95 % accurate in recognising informative block clusters, and improved the efficiency of information extraction by 17 %...|$|R

40|$|In {{the view}} of massive content {{explosion}} in World Wide Web through diverse sources, it has become mandatory to have content filtering tools. The filtering of contents of the web pages holds greater significance in cases of access by minor-age people. The traditional web <b>page</b> <b>blocking</b> systems goes by the Boolean methodology of either displaying the full <b>page</b> or <b>blocking</b> it completely. With the increased dynamism in the web pages, {{it has become a}} common phenomenon that different portions of the web page holds different types of content at different time instances. This paper proposes a model to block the contents at a fine-grained level i. e. instead of completely <b>blocking</b> the <b>page</b> it would be efficient to block only those segments which holds the contents to be blocked. The advantages of this method over the traditional methods are fine-graining level of blocking and automatic identification of portions of the <b>page</b> to be <b>blocked.</b> The experiments conducted on the proposed model indicate 88 % of accuracy in filtering out the segments.
