Bence defined the film as [...] "one of the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> cinema...

[...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's like to be an American these days. It's pretty aggressive, especially when you turn it loud." [...] Gossard added that after many experimental albums, Pearl Jam was [...] "like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> experiments".|$|E

In writing to Disney, he reported that Stokowski was [...] "really serious in his offer to do the music for nothing. He had some very interesting ideas on instrumental coloring, which would be perfect for an animation medium". In his excited response dated October 26, 1937, Disney wrote that he felt [...] "all steamed up over the idea of Stokowski working with us... The union of Stokowski and his music, together with the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> medium, would be the means of a success and should lead to a new style of motion picture presentation."

Noting {{that there is a}} {{difference}} between [...] "rock critics" [...] and the [...] "rock press", he lists the [...] "establishment" [...] members as himself, Jon Landau, Dave Marsh, Paul Nelson, and John Rockwell. Christgau also concedes that [...] "Because we are all self-taught (of necessity, since our academy is as yet informal), even the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> work has the faults of autodidacticism: eccentricity, incompleteness, self-indulgence. The worst of our work, meanwhile, has the faults of drivel. ... Yet I read on, as much from inclination as from duty, and find that a fair portion of what is bad, like some strains of 'bad' rock and roll, has the sloppy appeal of all open, democratic phenomena." [...] Christgau later accused Rolling Stone of promoting a [...] "boring rock-as-idealism myth" [...] and [...] "claiming suzerainty over the music ever since" [...] the magazine was founded in 1967.|$|E

After working with producer Bob Rock on the album Gravity, his voice became less nasal, and his tone became slightly deeper. His lyrics were also less Delphic, although these attributes have been abandoned and his older singing style and lyrical work has returned to a certain degree on the band's most recent album, [...] "Curve" [...] in 2012.
