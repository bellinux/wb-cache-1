5|$|According to {{researchers}} from the National Australian Dictionary Centre {{there is evidence that}} <b>barley</b> (Scotland and the west of England), barlies (Aberdeen and a few English towns), bar (Swansea) and bars (Devon), are used in Australia. In Australia the terms are used regionally with Victorians using <b>barley,</b> New South Welshmen using bar or bars and the people of Western Australia using barlies.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture was {{independently}} {{developed on}} the island of New Guinea. In Greece from c. 11,000 BC lentils, vetch, pistachios, and almonds were cultivated, while wild oats and wild <b>barley</b> appear in quantity from c. 7,000 BC alongside einkorn wheat, <b>barley,</b> sheep, goats and pigs, while emmer was used on Cyprus between 9,100 and 8,600 BC.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barley</b> evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit <b>Barley</b> had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. <b>Barley</b> disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay <b>Barley</b> 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, <b>Barley</b> could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E

5|$|<b>Barley</b> himself {{published}} {{four books}} under his patent. In March 1612, one of Barley's servants died, possibly from plague. After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, <b>Barley</b> moved, {{first to the}} parish of St Katherine Cree, and later to a house on Bishopsgate. Records from St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees of the will of Pavier. Mary <b>Barley,</b> who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to printer John Beale. Some of Barley's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to the printer Thomas Snodham.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, <b>Barley</b> seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. <b>Barley</b> took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and <b>Barley.</b> However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from <b>barley</b> malt and roasted <b>barley,</b> {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of <b>barley.</b> Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} <b>barley</b> malt as {{the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, <b>barley</b> is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no <b>barley</b> malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, <b>barley,</b> and rye.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE. Radiocarbon dating on postholes and pits {{in the area}} show activity from 1690 to 1390, 1319 to 1214, and 977 to 899 BCE. Wheat and <b>barley</b> grains {{have been found in}} these excavations. Tests show that most of the <b>barley</b> was dehulled, but that absence of such debris may mean that the cereal was brought in from other areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined <b>Barley</b> 40 shillings for illicitly {{publishing}} {{a number of}} works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing privileged books. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the Accidence, a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, <b>Barley,</b> along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and Thomas Pavier (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company {{within a few years}} so that they could continue their trade. Curiously, <b>Barley</b> did not join them until 1606. The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars. Bibliographer J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected <b>Barley</b> because he had no experience in the printing business. Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley, who held a royal patent on music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles. The Stationers' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring <b>barley,</b> wheat, maize, winter <b>barley,</b> other cereals for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and other crops. The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of arable land (6%), and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E

5|$|The Irish {{version of}} FES is brewed with pale malt, 25 per cent flaked <b>barley</b> (for head {{retention}} and body) and 10 per cent roasted <b>barley,</b> {{the latter being}} what gives the beer its dark hue. It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process. There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and the beer has 47 Bitterness Units. The beer is force carbonated.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common examples in English speaking cultures are <b>barley,</b> fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of <b>barley</b> in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
