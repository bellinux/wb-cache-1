5000|$|<b>Binding</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Rules</b> or [...] "BCRs" [...] were {{developed}} by the European Union Article 29 Working Party to allow multinational corporations, international organizations and groups of companies to make intra-organizational transfers of personal data across borders in compliance with EU Data Protection Law.

40|$|The ECJ’s ruling Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner has invalidated the EU-US Safe Harbor Agreement. The {{decision}} {{is the third}} step of the European Court of Justice — after the Digital Ireland and Costeja Gonzales cases — towards the acknowledgment of per- sonal data protection as a fundamental right, pursuant to article 9 of the Treaty of Nice, and marks the rift between EU and US on the fair balance among surveillance systems and privacy laws.

40|$|The Safe Harbour {{agreement}} {{was the result}} of an economic and political compromise between the European Union and the United States in the field of data protection, where the European regulatory model has demonstrated its influence in an interdependent world. The ECJ judgement has {{put an end to this}} compromise. Against this background, the author points out the different solutions that private companies may adopt in the short-, medium- and long-term. In this light, the article considers the chance of reaching a new international bilateral agreement in short time and the limits posed by the ECJ decision to this potential agreement. Focusing on the medium-term scenario, the author takes into account the impact of the Schrems case on the different legal alternatives for data transfer (data subject's consent, standard contractual clauses, and <b>binding</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>rules)</b> and discusses the consequences of this judgement on business strategies. In the long-term scenario, a more optimistic outlook is possible, given the increasing demand for data protection coming from U. S. companies and society at large, as demonstrated by the support provided the U. S. business community to new regulatory initiatives and by the In re Microsoft Corp. cas...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{critical}} {{approach to the}} current regime of <b>Binding</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Rules</b> (“BCR”) used by large companies to transfer personal data within the same corporate group to third countries which do not offer adequate levels of data protection. Our study focuses on the substantial and formal shortcomings that multinational companies particularly highlighted {{in connection with the}} implementation of the BCR mechanism. The analysed substantial shortcomings mainly relate to burdensome requirements set by the Working Documents issued by the Article 29 Working Party (“WP”), {{as well as to the}} problem of the binding nature of BCR when they adopt the form of unilateral declarations. The investigated formal shortcomings have to do with the complex and time consuming process to have the BCR approved at the EU/EEA level and from the relevant Data Protection Authorities (“DPAs”). Our thesis statement is that the BCR -as developed today- has proven ineffective. Multinational corporations are nowadays demanding more reliance on their own internal mechanisms of corporate governance to transfer personal data internationally within the same corporate group. Mandated accountability could have been the key in the proposed Regulation to reform the EU Data Protection Directive, combined with a stronger ex-post privacy control by the competent supervisory authorities. Unfortunately, the proposed reform does not follow such path...|$|E

40|$|A {{growing concern}} {{in the era of}} cloud {{computing}} is protecting Internet users 2 ̆ 7 privacy. This concern is {{compounded by the fact that}} there are no effective international solutions. This article considers the latest European Union (EU) proposed development in this area – a regulatory model based on amended <b>Binding</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>Rules</b> (BCR) – as introduced by the EU Justice Commissioner. These planned changes would have worldwide effects on international companies 2 ̆ 7 online activities in transboundary cyberspace. After providing a background on the concept of defining privacy in general, the article describes the BCR proposal, and proceeds to consider the likelihood of both its application as well as alternatives to the proposed model. Next, the article offers an international law solution to the challenges presented by alternatives to the BCR proposal and emphasizes the significance of the BCR 2 ̆ 7 s proposal. The article concludes that determining the scope of human rights for online activities will be the biggest challenge to the information society in the near future, and that success will be realized only if the global community unites to tackle the challenge together. If states create 2 ̆ 2 walled gardens 2 ̆ 2 creating only their residents 2 ̆ 7 privacy, the global information society will face its doom. However, a consensus-based global solution such as the BCR may function as a starting point for finding a global consensus on human rights online protection...|$|E

Hand-collected data show that 80 % of cross-listed firms opt out {{of at least one}} exchange governance rule. Relative to firms that comply, firms that opt out have a smaller share of independent directors. Cross-listed firms opt out more when coming from countries with weak <b>corporate</b> governance <b>rules,</b> but if firms based in such countries are growing and have a need for external finance, {{they are more likely to}} comply. Opting out also substantially affects the value of cash holdings. ...|$|R

This paper argues that the thin line between efficiency and bureaucracy is crossed when firms introduce a managerial turnover policy to curb agency problems in a multi-layer hierarchy. Bureaucratic rules to record actions and events then arise to minimize the costs of managerial turnover. The model predicts that bureaucracy increases upon managerial turnover and it establishes a link between bureaucracy, incentive schemes, {{and the frequency of}} managerial turnover in a cross-section of firms...|$|R

He also claimed that <b>corporate</b> <b>rule</b> would eliminate the contentious political climate which he believed was caused by universal suffrage. The new constitution was to take effect in mid-1953. Before that happened, however, Gómez was overthrown in a military coup. His successor, Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, eventually convened a hand-picked assembly, which was to continue the process of constitutional reform begun by Gómez. The assembly never did so, however, and the impetus for such reform withered with Gómez’s exile.|$|R
