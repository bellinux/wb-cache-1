40|$|Representative {{samples of}} smokers of regular middle tar and regular low tar {{cigarettes}} {{responded to a}} questionnaire concerning their smoking habits and participated in a <b>blind</b> <b>product</b> <b>test,</b> returning 24 hour butt collections from the smoking of both middle tar and low tar cigarettes. An estimate of the mouth intake of tar derived from a measurement of filter nicotine confirmed partial compensation by the low tar smokers relative to the middle tar smokers, resulting in 32 % lower tar delivery rather than the 46 % expected from the standard machine values. Most middle tar smokers (98 %) achieved an estimated tar delivery within or below that of the league table middle tar band when smoking middle tar cigarettes, while 70 % of low tar smokers had a mouth intake of 10 X 49 mg or below within the low tar band when smoking low tar cigarettes. These results support the current tar league tables {{as a guide to}} the smoker in selecting a lower delivery cigarette...|$|E
40|$|When {{comparing}} alternate product formulations, or evaluating competitors' formulations, researchers often conduct <b>blind,</b> {{forced choice}} <b>product</b> <b>tests.</b> In this study, the authors present {{an approach to}} designing these tests and evaluating their results. Two types of tests are considered: repeat paired comparisons formats, and formats consisting of several triangle tests and a single paired comparison. The approach consists of psychophysical assumptions, discrimination and preference constructs, {{and a set of}} analytical techniques. Using this approach, a researcher can compare <b>product</b> <b>test</b> formats to see which one most efficiently estimates a given construct of interest. The approach {{can also be used to}} gauge sample size requirements for a particular <b>product</b> <b>test</b> format and to estimate confidence intervals for an observed <b>product</b> <b>test</b> result. To illustrate the approach the authors compare two popular <b>product</b> <b>test</b> formats—the Four Paired Comparisons, and the Double Triangle Single Preference. preferences, discrimination, fisher information...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese {{market for}} home {{appliances}} has matured and become almost completelysaturated, {{making it more}} difficult to produce hot-selling products that satisfy variouscustomer needs. Companies have thus shifted their product development strategies from“product-out” (company-oriented product design) to “market-in” (user-oriented productdesign), in which they focus mainly on user benefits. Some companies have combined theirmarketing groups and have strengthened their marketing research. Depending on theresearch objective, subjects are used for in-home use <b>testing,</b> <b>blind</b> <b>product</b> <b>testing,</b> and so on. Research is also done using surveys by mail and the web. Although much marketing researchis being carried out, it is difficult to extract “potential customer needs” from the dataobtained. The final results depend greatly on the ability of the analysts. This ability issometimes termed “KKD” in Japanese: “keiken” (experience), “kan” (intuition), and“dokyo” (courage). We have developed a method for analyzing data collected using a customersatisfaction questionnaire that enables the efficient extraction of potential customer needs. This method is practical because simple and objective analysis can be done withoutadvanced statistical knowledge, and the results can be used to develop specific strategies forproduct development and sales promotion. Quality elements (product functions) are mappedin three dimensions, (1) degree of satisfaction, (2) degree of expectation, and (3) degree ofsignificance. Degree of satisfaction is the customers’ evaluation of each quality elementwhen they use the product. Degree of expectation is the customers’ subjective priority foreach element when they purchase the product. Degree of significance is the significance, asperceived by the customers, of each element to the product as a whole when they use theproduct. This mapping enables “potential needs” to be distinguished from “surface needs”and customer needs to be categorized as “real needs” or “false needs”. Strategies forproduct development and sales promotion can be developed based on where each qualityelement is mapped. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R

40|$|Brass is a {{material}} {{widely used in}} drinking water applications such as faucets, mixers and fittings. Brass contains small amounts of lead (Pb) which may, under unfavourable circumstances, be released to the drinking water. The parameters which affect this release are many and not fully understood today. Among these parameters are water chemistry, operation time, stagnation time, material composition, product geometry, treatment and processing of the material. The {{aim of this study}} is to summarize current knowledge about Pb contamination from brass products to drinking water and to compare three methods for assessment of Pb release; a European material <b>test,</b> a Scandinavian <b>product</b> <b>test</b> and an American <b>product</b> <b>test.</b> This study shows that a product will perform differently depending on the test method, and that the results from a short-term <b>product</b> <b>test</b> are not related to the results in a long term material <b>test.</b> The two <b>product</b> <b>tests</b> proved to give very different results; while all samples passed the Scandinavian <b>product</b> <b>test,</b> no sample passed the American <b>product</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, the Scandinavian <b>product</b> <b>test</b> has been proved to be unreliable due to a number of reasons such as low repeatability, inconsistency with current drinking water parametric value and test water which does not represent a worst case. The conclusion is that the choice of test method influences the result and that short-term test cannot be used to predict the outcome of a long term test. The current Scandinavian product approval is not a reliable method for long term <b>testing</b> of <b>products.</b> Validerat; 20120703 (anonymous...|$|R
