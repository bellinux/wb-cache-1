This work examines the problem of mapping a high-level specification to an arbitrary, but fixed architecture that uses particular bus protocols for interprocessor communication. The approach detailed in this paper illustrates that global considerations are necessary to achieve a correct implementation. A communication model is presented that allows for easy retargeting to different <b>bus</b> <b>topologies</b> and protocols.

50|$|In {{local area}} {{networks}} where <b>bus</b> <b>topology</b> is used, each node {{is connected to}} a single cable, by the help of interface connectors. This central cable is {{the backbone of the}} network and is known as the bus (thus the name.) A signal from the source travels in both directions to all machines connected on the bus cable until it finds the intended recipient. If the machine address does not match the intended address for the data, the machine ignores the data. Alternatively, if the data matches the machine address, the data is accepted. Because the <b>bus</b> <b>topology</b> consists of only one wire, it is rather inexpensive to implement when compared to other topologies. However, the low cost of implementing the technology is offset by the high cost of managing the network. Additionally, because only one cable is utilized, it can be the single point of failure. In this topology data being transferred may be accessed by any workstation.|$|E

The Energyoptimal Sectioned Bus (ESB) template is an energy efficient architecture style for on-chip communication between components. To achieve minimum energy operation, the netlist topology of the ESB bus should however be optimized accordingly. In this paper we present a strategy for the definition of an energy optimal netlist for the ESB bus. An initial floorplanning stage provides information about the eventual lengths of the interconnect wires and a subsequent exploration step defines the optimal topology for the communication architecture.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to RS-422, {{which has a}} single driver circuit which cannot be switched off, RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. This allows RS-485 to implement linear <b>bus</b> <b>topologies</b> using only two wires. The equipment located along a set of RS-485 wires are interchangeably called nodes, stations or devices. The recommended arrangement of the wires is as a connected series of point-to-point (multidropped) nodes, i.e. a line or bus, not a star, ring, or multiply connected network. Star and ring topologies are not recommended because of signal reflections or excessively low or high termination impedance. If a star configuration is unavoidable, special RS-485 star/hub repeaters are available which bidirectionally listen for data on each span and then retransmit the data onto all other spans.|$|R
