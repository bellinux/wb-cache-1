5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the <b>blood</b> <b>mark</b> made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E

50|$|Picking {{up where}} Abyss left off, Vestara Khai hypothesizes what the Dathomiri <b>blood</b> <b>mark</b> is on her, {{so instead of}} {{returning}} to her homeworld of Kesh where she would have inadvertently led the Skywalkers to, she instead travels to the planet of Dathomir. The Skywalkers follow her there, and {{in their search for}} Vestara, they call out for the help of the Solos. The Solos arrive in time to join the Skywalkers in the search party, and they soon run into a Dathomiri Witch tribe known as the Raining Leaves. The Raining Leaves are preparing to marry into a freed male slave tribe known as the Broken Columns following a series of tournaments which would last for several days. Among the Raining Leaves, Vestara claims to have renounced for Sith ways, though the Skywalkers doubt her honesty. Nevertheless, the Skywalkers and Solos, in honor of what Luke, Han, and Leia did for them so many years earlier during the fledgling days of the New Republic, are invited {{to get involved in the}} tournaments. However, the tournaments take a tragic turn when members of both the Raining Leaves and of the Broken Columns are attacked through mysterious means, and these means are by the hand of the Dathomiri Nightsisters. The Nightsisters, who remain loyal to the traditions of Dathomir, don't want freed male slaves to become legitimate citizens of the planet, and the attacks on the Raining Leaves and the Broken Columns are supposed to threaten the tribes into disengaging. However, this simply unites the two tribes even further as they prepare to face off against the threat of the Nightsisters, with the Skywalkers and the Solos on their side.|$|E
40|$|There {{appears to}} be a limited but growing body of {{research}} on the sequential analysis/treatment of multiple types of evidence. The development of an integrated forensic approach is necessary to maximise evidence recovery and to ensure that a particular treatment is not detrimental to other types of evidence. This study aims to assess the effect of latent and <b>blood</b> <b>mark</b> enhancement techniques (e. g. fluorescence, ninhydrin, acid violet 17, black iron-oxide powder suspension) on the subsequent detection of saliva. This study aims to contribute to a strategy for maximising evidence recovery and efficiency for the detection of latent marks and saliva.

40|$|A {{bottom up}} in situ proteomic method has been {{developed}} enabling the mapping of multiple blood signatures on the intact ridges of blood fingermarks byMatrix Assisted Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI). This method, at a proof of concept stage, builds upon recently published work demonstrating the opportunity to profile and identify multiple blood signatures in bloodstains via a bottom up proteomic approach. The present protocol addresses the limitation of the previously developed profiling method with respect to destructivity; destructivity should be avoided for evidence such as blood fingermarks, where the ridge detail must be preserved {{in order to provide}} the associative link between the biometric information and the events of bloodshed. Using a <b>blood</b> <b>mark</b> reference model, trypsin concentration and spraying conditions have been optimised within the technical constraints of the depositor eventually employed; the application of MALDI-MSI and Ion Mobility MS have enabled the detection, confirmation and visualisation of blood signatures directly onto the ridge pattern. These results are to be considered a first insight into a method eventually informing investigations (and judicial debates) of violent crimes in which the reliable and non-destructive detection and mapping of blood in fingermarks is paramount to reconstruct the events of bloodshed...|$|E
50|$|Lack of {{exercise}} is another {{common cause of}} water retention in the legs. Exercise helps the leg veins work against gravity to return blood to the heart.

Physical and sensory disability in the Gospel of John : an exegesis of John 5 : 1 - 18 and 9 : 1 - 41 [...] Chapter Eight. Conclusion. The New Testament gospels feature numerous social exchanges between Jesus and people with various physical and sensory disability. Yet, traditional biblical scholarship has considered these exchanges as merely incidental. For many scholars addressing the gospels, people with disability described therein have not been considered agents in their own right but exist only to highlight the actions of Jesus as a miracle worker. The aim {{of this study is to}} use disability as a lens through which to explore a number of these passages anew. Although these pericopae have been examined at length by numerous scholars, they have rarely been figured specifically in relation to disability. Using the cultural model of disability as the theoretical basis for this examination, we contend that ancient authors use disability as a means of understanding, organising, and interpreting the experiences of humanity. In much the same way that different cultures have their own unique interpretations and expectations of the body based on gender, ethnicity, or sexuality, so it is also the case with human ability/disability. In this way, every body, whether deemed able-bodied or ‘deviant’, is assigned meaning within the context of its own social, cultural, and religious milieu. This study examines both the Greco-Roman and Jewish background of the gospels prior to assessing the New Testament gospels themselves through three case studies, each addressing different aspects of human ability/disability within the framework of Jesus’ ministry. These investigations highlight the ways in which the gospel writers reinforce and reflect, as well as subvert, culturally-driven constructions of disability {{in the ancient world}}. We contend that the use of disability as a tool for reading the New Testament will afford us the opportunity to evaluate the gospel material from a new and illuminating perspective and thus contribute to the growing field of disability and biblical studies.
