After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary, they discovered that Dean Lyons had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> killings. Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideas for}} [...] "One More Day" [...] {{began to develop}} almost two years before its release, at one of Marvel's {{creative}} summits for creators and editors. Quesada, Straczynski, Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, Jeph Loeb, Tom Brevoort and Axel Alonso developed the concept between them, and Ed Brubaker and Dan Slott added more at the next summit. [...] "One More Day" [...] was announced as the concluding storyline of Straczynski's run on Amazing Spider-Man in early 2007, and Quesada was named as the artist for the storyline. Although Quesada had become more selective in choosing projects to do as an artist since becoming editor-in-chief, he felt compelled to do the art for One More Day because he felt {{very close to the}} story, and because since he had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> project for so long, he felt he [...] "needed to put my money where my mouth is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lynch and Frost {{pitched the}} idea to ABC during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, {{with nothing more than}} this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was {{initially}} {{going to be in the}} foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera. ABC liked the idea and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. They had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> project for three months and wrote the screenplay in 10 days. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like Benjamin Horne, while Lynch was responsible for Agent Cooper. According to the director, [...] "He says a lot of the things I say." [...] ABC Entertainment President Brandon Stoddard ordered the two-hour pilot for a possible fall 1989 series. He left the position in March 1989 as Lynch went into production. They filmed the pilot for $4 million with an agreement with ABC that they would shoot an additional [...] "ending" [...] to it so that it could be sold directly to video in Europe as a feature film if the TV show was not picked up. ABC's Robert Iger and his creative team took over, saw the dailies, and met with Frost and Lynch to get the arc of the stories and characters. Although Iger liked the pilot, he had difficulty persuading the rest of the network executives. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse, younger group, who liked it, and the executive subsequently convinced ABC to buy seven episodes at $1.1 million apiece. Some executives figured that the show would never get on the air or that it might run as a seven-hour mini-series, but Iger planned to schedule it for the spring. The final showdown occurred during a bi-coastal conference call between Iger and a room full of New York executives; Iger won, and Twin Peaks was on the air.|$|E

60|$|Any fair {{critical}} {{account of}} Dickens must always make him out {{much smaller than}} he is. For any fair criticism of Dickens must take account of his evident errors, as I have taken account {{of one of the}} most evident of them during the last two or three pages. It would not even be loyal to conceal them. But no honest criticism, no criticism, though it spoke with the tongues of men and angels, could ever really talk about Dickens. In all this that I have said I have not been talking about Dickens at all. I say it with equanimity; I say it even with arrogance. I have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gaps of Dickens. I have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> omissions of Dickens. I have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> slumber of Dickens and the forgetfulness and unconsciousness of Dickens. In one word, I have been talking not about Dickens, but about the absence of Dickens. But when we come to him and his work itself, what is there to be said? What is there to be said about earthquake and the dawn? He has created, especially in this book of David Copperfield, he has created, creatures who cling to us and tyrannise over us, creatures whom we would not forget if we could, creatures whom we could not forget if we would, creatures who are more actual than the man who made them.|$|E

60|$|I do {{not know}} how it will appear to you, but to me it seems that this book I have <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> <b>the</b> Bible of to-day's civilization, is not simply a {{conceivable}} possibility, it is a great and urgent need. Our education is, I think, pointless without it, a shell without a core. Our social life is aimless without it, we are a crowd without a common understanding. Only by means of some such unifying instrument, I believe, can we hope to lift human life out of its present dangerous drift towards confusion and disaster.|$|E
6000|$|That's my luck again. When I make serious {{observations}} people chuckle; when I {{attempt a}} joke nobody sees it. I {{had a beautiful}} one last week.

I forget how exactly, but we had <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> attitude of Shakespeare toward the Reformation, and I said something and immediately added, [...] "Ah, that reminds me; such {{a funny thing happened}} the other day in Whitechapel."

[...] "What your father will say I don't know," [...] she continued; [...] "for he's <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wedding up at Rolliver's and The Pure Drop every day since, and about his family getting back to their rightful position through you--poor silly man!--and now you've made this mess of it!

6000|$|One {{peculiarity}} of {{the genuine}} kind of {{enemy of the}} people is that his slightest phrase is clamorous with all his sins.

Thus I see that a Nonconformist pastor in Bromley has <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pathetic little presents of tobacco sent to the common soldiers. This is how he talks about it. He is reported as having said, [...] "By the help of God, they wanted this cigarette business stopped."
