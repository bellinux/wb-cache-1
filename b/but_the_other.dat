5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> giant planets Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|M.pithecoides {{from the}} central plateau was a {{specialized}} leaf-eater (folivore), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two species had a more mixed diet, eating fruits and seeds in addition to leaves. The level of seed predation varies between the three species, with tooth wear indicating that M.dolichobrachion exhibited the greatest level of seed predation within the genus.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September 1950, two EF-84Es, {{flown by}} David C. Schilling and Col. William Ritchie, flew across the North Atlantic from Great Britain to the United States. Ritchie's {{aircraft}} {{ran out of}} fuel over Newfoundland <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> successfully made the crossing which took ten hours two minutes and three aerial refuelings. The flight demonstrated {{that large numbers of}} fighters could be rapidly moved across the Atlantic.|$|E

50|$|Unknown to everyone, {{the test}} {{has been moved}} ahead an hour due to {{favorable}} weather conditions. When the five-minute warning sounds earlier than expected, Sam and Bart hurry to Neal's car and a desperate Kay gets in with them. Larry overpowers Dummy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> drive away. Asa leads Dottie, Larry, and Neal to safety in a nearby mine. Sam, Bart and Kay are killed by <b>the</b> explosion, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> emerge unharmed.|$|R

5|$|Part of the {{collection}} was returned {{at the end of}} World War II, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders by Chiang Kai-shek, whose Kuomintang was losing the Chinese Civil War. This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public, as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.|$|E
5|$|A {{spacecraft}} crashes at Wiekamp Air Force base in West Virginia, and {{the surviving}} Rebel passenger is {{captured by the}} military. Mulder shows Scully more photos of the victims and, having found more implants in them, believes the implant in Scully {{may be able to}} answer all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced {{that two of the}} ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> eight were of dubious origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.|$|E

5|$|After a near {{accident}} {{at the dinner}} table, Marge begs Homer {{to get rid of}} the gun. He promises to, but later, Bart and Milhouse find it in the refrigerator's vegetable crisper. Marge discovers this and berates Homer, then leaves with the children and checks into a motel. That night, Homer hosts an NRA meeting at his house, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members kick him out of the association after seeing how recklessly he uses his pistol. Realizing what his behavior has cost him, Homer goes to the motel and tells Marge that he got rid of the gun.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Regina Maria Pia was badly burned in the battle, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three vessels were not seriously damaged. The ships served {{in a variety of}} roles for the {{remainder}} of their long careers; they were modernized in the late 1880s and thereafter used as a training ships. Regina Maria Pia, San Martino, and Ancona were discarded in 190304, and Castelfidardo joined them in the breaker's yard in 1910.|$|E
5|$|All {{three of}} the ships in Toulon were placed in reserve {{and two of them}} were {{captured}} virtually intact when the Germans attempted to seize the French fleet in November 1942. They were turned over to the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina), but they were only used for transport missions before the Italy surrendered in September 1943. The Italians scuttled one, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> escaped to join the Free French and spent the remainder of the war as a convoy escort in the Mediterranean or protecting Allied forces in the Ligurian Sea.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, as Scott's ships neared Cape Hunter at the {{northwest}} end of Guadalcanal, three of Scott's cruisers launched floatplanes. One crashed on takeoff, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two patrolled over Savo Island, Guadalcanal, and Ironbottom Sound. As the floatplanes were launched, Jojima's force was just passing around the mountainous northwestern shoulder of Guadalcanal, and neither force sighted each other. At 22:20, Jojima radioed Gotō {{and told him}} that no U.S. ships were in the vicinity. Although Jojima's force later heard Scott's floatplanes overhead while unloading along the north shore of Guadalcanal, they failed to report this to Gotō.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
5|$|By 1989, the {{building}} still housed La Tasca, La Cantina, and Tabaquero, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> shops {{were replaced by}} a sports shop. La Tasca was replaced in the 2000s by Starbucks coffee shop, and the Streetwear store replaced La Cantina in 2005. An outdoor Mr. Sub counter franchise operated from 2004 to 2012, this location and two others became Subway in 2013. In 2015, a Mill Street Brewery outlet was added next to it.|$|E

5|$|By the Iron Age, Scotland {{had been}} {{penetrated}} by the wider La Tène culture. The Torrs Pony-cap and Horns {{are perhaps the}} most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain. The Stirling torcs, found in 2009, are a group of four gold torcs in different styles, dating from 300 BC and 100 BC Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France and the Greek and Roman worlds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came within range of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E
5|$|By {{this period}} Scotland had been {{penetrated}} by the wider La Tène culture, which {{is named after}} the archaeological site of La Tène {{on the north side}} of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland.

5|$|Elgar's {{recordings}} {{were released}} on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 {{recording of the}} Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> recordings {{were out of the}} catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Group 3 is a {{group of}} {{elements}} in the periodic table. This group, like other d-block groups, should contain four elements, but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group. Scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) are always included, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac), or by lutetium (Lu) and lawrencium (Lr); less frequently, it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements (with all the lanthanides and actinides included) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium. When the group is understood to contain all of the lanthanides, its trivial name is the rare-earth metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 one {{of these}} 3-pounder guns was mounted on each turret top and, three years later, the 3-pounders in the {{fighting}} tops were transferred to the forward superstructure. At {{the same time the}} above-water torpedo tubes were removed. About 1902–03 the 6-pounders on the main deck were removed; two were remounted on the superstructure, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two were not replaced. In 1905 the 3-pounders on the forward superstructure were removed while the 3-pounders in the lower fighting tops were removed while the ship was in reserve from 1907–09.|$|E
