5|$|In 1989 the centenary of the <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> {{a revival}} of {{interest}} in the line. Over the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{the number of}} {{passengers}} using the branch stabilised at about 800 people each weekday. In 2009 the Chesham <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> 427,000 journeys each year. The proposal to close the Aylesbury–Marylebone route was dropped, and instead the line was upgraded and equipped with fast British Rail Class 165 trains in the early 1990s. These reduced the travel time between Chalfont& Latimer and Marylebone to 33 minutes, increasing usage of the line as a commuter route. The Chesham branch was proposed as a terminus for the original Crossrail scheme, which would have seen Crossrail trains running from Paddington to serve the stations between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury and the Chesham branch, allowing London Transport to withdraw from Buckinghamshire and cut the Metropolitan line back to serve only the branches to Watford and Uxbridge. The bill proposing the scheme was defeated in Parliament and abandoned in 1995, and the revived scheme authorised by the Crossrail Act 2008 {{did not include the}} branches to Aylesbury and Chesham. By this time the little-used Central line branch from Epping to Ongar had closed, with the last services running on 30 September 1994, leaving Chesham—already the westernmost point of the London Underground network since 1961's withdrawal from Aylesbury—as the northernmost point on the London Underground.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> a single mixed train daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline {{to a point where}} only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime loadings saw traffic increase to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was pulpwood.|$|E
60|$|Central was a long, dislocated {{trunk of}} a wild Banian; like a huge {{centipede}} crawling on its hundred <b>branches,</b> <b>sawn</b> of even lengths for legs. This table was set out with wry-necked gourds; deformities of calabashes; and shapeless trenchers, dug out of knotty woods.|$|R
50|$|Many contemporaries (starting {{with the}} King's {{brother and the}} cadet Bourbon <b>branches)</b> <b>saw</b> the changed {{succession}} as illegal on various counts. They {{formed the basis for}} the dynastic Carlist party, which only recognized the semi-Salic succession law that gave Infante Carlos precedence over Ferdinand's daughter, the future Isabella II.|$|R

The Scotts AirShoc line, on the other hand, aims at lawn care professionals and serious DIY’ers. It includes loppers, hedge shears, <b>branch</b> <b>saws</b> and grass and garden shears.|$|R
25|$|After {{fighting}} against insurgents {{during the early}} to mid-1930s, the Manchukuo Imperial Army played mainly a supporting role during the actions in Inner Mongolia against Chinese forces, with news reports stating that some Manchukuoan units performed fairly well. Later it fought against the Soviet Red Army during the Soviet-Japanese border conflicts. A skirmish between Manchukuoan and Mongolian cavalry in May 1939 escalated as both sides brought in reinforcements and began the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. Although they did not perform well in the battle overall, the Japanese considered their actions decent enough to warrant expansion of the Manchukuo Army. Throughout the 1940s the only action it saw was against Communist guerrilla fighters and other insurgents, although the Japanese chose to rely only on the more elite units while the majority were used for garrison and security duty. Although Japan took the effort of equipping the Manchukuoan forces with some artillery (in addition to the wide variety it had inherited from Zhang Xueliang's army) along with some elderly tankettes and armored cars, the cavalry was the Imperial Army's most effective and developed branch. This was the force that was confronted by 76 battle-hardened Red Army divisions transferred from the European front in August 1945 during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. The cavalry <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> the most action against the Red Army, but the Manchukuo Army and their depleted Japanese Kwantung Army allies were quickly swept aside by the Soviet offensive. While some units remained loyal to their Japanese allies and put up a resistance, many mutinied against their Japanese advisors while others simply melted away into the countryside. Many of these Manchukuo Army troops would later join the Communists since the Chinese Nationalists would execute former collaborators with Japan, which became {{an important source of}} manpower and equipment for the Communists in the region.|$|E
2500|$|From its opening, the <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> two {{mixed trains}} each way {{per day and}} a {{locomotive}} depot was established in Oxford. Once the connection with the Eyreton Branch was established, one daily train ran to Oxford from that line too. [...] The trip from Christchurch to Oxford took three hours, including an hour and 40 minutes from Rangiora to the terminus.|$|E
2500|$|The city briefly {{planned to}} keep the library for storage or repeat the bid process, but {{eventually}} negotiated {{a contract with the}} third choice bidder, Main Branch LLC, whose $3.25 million bid for a mixed-use project would retain most of the building's character. An agreement was reached and the city council approved the sale on November 15, 2006. The sale closed in April, 2007 and the building was renamed [...] "122 Ocean". One component of Main Branch's plan was to build two additional floors for condominiums, but that was to be a later phase. The building would include a number of businesses, including City Market, downtown's first urban grocery store. Negotiations were ongoing with prospective tenants, including Folio Weekly, a wine bar, a [...] jazz club, a bar, two coffee shops, a cereal bar, a residential Realtor, a pair of film companies, a design & furniture store and a four-screen movie theater, according to Tony Allegretti, a Main Branch partner and investor. Some developers suggested tearing down the 1960s landmark, but Main <b>Branch</b> <b>saw</b> historical and financial value in its redevelopment. [...] Allegretti stated, [...] "One of the real motivations in this real estate cycle is you couldn't build this building for $20 million".|$|E

50|$|At {{the third}} conference of CP(BSTI), Cardiff, 4 December, the Statutes and Theses of the Third International were accepted, {{although}} there was a consensus that they were not bound to parliamentary action. The four Manchester <b>branches</b> <b>saw</b> this as a sell out, and resigned, taking 200 members with them. Whitehead and Pankhurst maintained they still had the freedom to fight for abstentionism within the CPGB, and they formally fused with them at the second Communist Unity Conference in Leeds, January 1921.|$|R

This thing, of course, was meant as a warning." [...] Then he addressed the boys: [...] "You needn't wait. You can get some more of those <b>branches</b> <b>sawed</b> off in the slashing." ...|$|R
60|$|So that Wau, rising {{over the}} edge and {{clutching}} the straight willow <b>branches,</b> <b>saw</b> Ugh-lomi towering over him, gigantic against the blue; saw his whole body swing round, and the grip of his hands upon the antler. The edge of the antler came sweeping through the air, and he saw no more. The water under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson six feet down the stream. Uya following stopped knee-high across the stream, {{and the man who}} was swimming turned about.|$|R

50|$|The work {{included}} {{the building of}} transhipment warehouses and wharves at Barbridge Junction, although the <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> little traffic until the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal finally opened in 1835.

50|$|The {{origins of}} the AICD {{can be traced back}} to the United Kingdom’s Institute of Directors (IoD), formed by Royal Charter in 1906. Branches of the IoD {{appeared}} in the Australian states in the 1960s. These branches were amalgamated in January 1971 under the Institute of Directors in Australia, an autonomous body affiliated with the IoD in the United Kingdom. The challenge of servicing state <b>branches</b> <b>saw</b> the emergence of the Company Directors Association of Australia in 1982. The two bodies merged on 1 January 1990 to form the Australian Institute of Company Directors.|$|R

50|$|Although not as {{susceptible}} as some suburban {{lines to}} competing road and tram transport the Chingford <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> {{a decline in}} passenger traffic in the 1920s. This is partly as industrial developments northwards along the Lea Valley saw employment patterns changing although through the 1920s continuing house building along the route offset this. By 1928 all services were {{in the hands of}} the N7 0-6-2T locomotives and LNER Quint Art sets replaced the older GER four wheelers (by 1931).|$|E
5000|$|The line saw several {{historic}} moments, {{with new}} or experimental vehicles from Derby being tested {{on the line}}, such as [...] "Number 10000", the first mainline LMS diesel-electric locomotive, which was tested {{on the line in}} late 1947. Subsequently the Wirksworth <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> Derby's first experiments with diesel railcars. The main line saw some initial test runs of the Advanced Passenger Train and, towards Derby, a length of experimental slip-paved concrete track was installed in the 70's. This can still be seen in the up line cess.|$|E

50|$|Weymouth Quay {{railway station}} is a disused {{terminus}} in the town. Its passenger station was used solely for trains connecting with cross-channel ferries, {{which have not}} run since 1987, though the line remains part of the network and the station, in theory, still open. Its use had been suggested {{as part of the}} transport infrastructure for the 2012 Olympic sailing events to take place on the Isle of Portland, though since it is accessed via the Weymouth Harbour Branch, which runs along public streets, this posed difficulties. Previously, the <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> both freight and passenger traffic, most recently fuel-oil trains.|$|E
50|$|This three-mile branch, {{constructed}} in 1862, {{led to a}} ¾-mile-wide shingle bank known locally as The Crumbles. The LB&SCR used the shingle as ballast for its railway lines. Ballast trains ran until 1932 when the Southern Railway favoured granite. Other branches appeared on the line; a siding was built in 1870 when the Eastbourne Gas Company built their works which straddled the line. Coal was transported to the gas works. In return it produced coke and was taken away and in 1926 a line was created for the Eastbourne Corporation Electric Works to transport coal, also supplying fuel to the bus garage and taking scrap metal away from the refuse destructor works. The <b>branch</b> <b>saw</b> its last steam engines in April 1960 and diesel shunting locomotives were provided for the work until the line closed in early 1967.|$|E
50|$|The school {{eventually}} {{moved to}} its present location, a converted house on St. Clair Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood of Toronto. Barbara Arrowsmith Young remains its Director and owner {{as she does}} of a second, smaller branch in Peterborough, Ontario which opened in 2005. Both <b>branches</b> <b>saw</b> increasing numbers of students from outside Canada following Arrowsmith Young's 2012 speaking tour to New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom to promote her book The Woman Who Changed Her Brain. In October 2012, international students made up {{about a third of}} the student population of the Peterborough branch (seven from Australia, one student from Dubai, and one from the United States).|$|R
60|$|A half-mile {{from the}} main road, which seemed to him to have dropped out of sight the moment he had left it, he came upon a half-cleared area, where the hastily-cut stumps of pines, of {{irregular}} height, bore an odd resemblance to the broken columns of some vast and ruined temple. A few fallen shafts, denuded of their bark and tessellated <b>branches,</b> <b>sawn</b> into symmetrical cylinders, lay beside the stumps, and lent themselves to the illusion. But the freshly-cut chips, so damp that they still clung in layers {{to each other as}} they had fallen from the axe, and the stumps themselves, still wet and viscous from their drained life-blood, were redolent of an odor of youth and freshness.|$|R
