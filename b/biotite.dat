40|$|ABSTRACT: Smectite genesis in two {{granitic}} saprolites was studied, using {{qualitative and}} quantitative mineralogical methods and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The primary minerals (plagioclase and mica) give rise {{to the formation of}} different kinds of smectites according to the weathering conditions (pH and drainage). Under a relatively basic, drained environment, a neoformed montmorillonite with a spheroidal organization exists in fillings of plagioclase cores. In the same conditions <b>biotites</b> are transformed into beidellites with a quasi-crystal organization. Under hydromorphic conditions, muscovites evolve incompletely towards mectites, whereas <b>biotites</b> lead to a montmorillonite with a tactoid organization. The evolution of granitic rocks in temperate r gions is characterized by the formation of sandy saprolites. When not eroded, the saprolites are rather thick (from one to a few metres). The clay fraction in these saprolites can have a large diversity of compositions: kaolinite is the most widespread mineral, but other steps of evolutio...|$|R

The garnets in the granite crystallized early in the sequence and are thought o have formed in response to the ponding of Mn-rich fluids against he wall of the pluton.

Its rocks are typical volcanic-arc rocks in elemental chemistry, and may stem from mantle-derived magma. The satellite centre rocks differ from the main centre rocks in composition, suggesting that different processes generated the magmas which constructed the cones. There is a compositional trend from Bazman over Taftan to Sultan, with the latter having more potassium in its rocks than the other centres. Such compositional trends may come from different partial melting ratios and different fluid contributions to magma generation at each volcano.|$|E
