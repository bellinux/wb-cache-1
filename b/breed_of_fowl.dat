60|$|Finally, we may {{conclude}} {{with respect to}} the various <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fowl,</b> that the main bones of the wing have probably been shortened in a very slight degree; that they have certainly become lighter relatively to the leg-bones in all the breeds in which these latter bones are not unnaturally short or delicate; and that the crest of the sternum, to which the pectoral muscles are attached, has invariably become less prominent, the whole sternum being also extremely liable to deformity.

60|$|This {{principle}} is, indeed, {{in one way}} {{so obvious}} that it escapes attention. We possess a number of races of animals and plants, which, when compared {{with one another and}} with their parent-forms, present conspicuous differences, both in their immature and mature states. Look at the seeds of the several kinds of peas, beans, maize, which can be propagated truly, and see how they differ in size, colour, and shape, whilst the full-grown plants differ but little. Cabbages, on the other hand, differ greatly in foliage and manner of growth, but hardly at all in their seeds; and generally it will be found that the differences between cultivated plants at different periods of growth are not necessarily closely connected together, for plants may differ much in their seeds and little when full-grown, and conversely may yield seeds hardly distinguishable, yet differ much when full-grown. In the several <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> poultry, descended from a single species, differences in the eggs and chickens whilst covered with down, in the plumage at the first and subsequent moults, {{as well as in the}} comb and wattles, are all inherited. With man peculiarities in the milk and second teeth (of which I have received the details) are inheritable, and longevity is often transmitted. So again with our improved <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> cattle and sheep, early maturity, including the early development of the teeth, and with certain <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowl</b> the early appearance of secondary sexual characters, all come under the same head of inheritance at corresponding periods.|$|R
50|$|The Marsh Daisy is a hardy, {{economical}} barnyard chicken, but is slow to mature.

60|$|I {{am aware}} that such cases as the {{foregoing}} have been ascribed by various authors, not to one species, race, or individual being prepotent {{over the other}} in impressing its character on its crossed offspring, but to such rules as that the father influences the external characters and the mother the internal or vital organs. But the great diversity of the rules given by various authors almost proves their falseness. Dr. Prosper Lucas has fully discussed this point, and has shown (14/18. 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 book 2 chapter 1.) {{that none of the}} rules (and I could add others to those quoted by him) apply to all animals. Similar rules have been announced for plants, and have been proved by Gartner (14/19. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 264-266. Naudin 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 148 has arrived at a similar conclusion.) to be all erroneous. If we confine our view to the domesticated races of a single species, or perhaps even to the species of the same genus, some such rules may hold good; for instance, it seems that in reciprocally crossing various <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls</b> the male generally gives colour (14/20. 'Cottage Gardener' 1856 pages 101, 137.); but conspicuous exceptions have passed under my own eyes. It seems that the ram usually gives its peculiar horns and fleece to its crossed offspring, and the bull {{the presence or absence of}} horns.|$|R
60|$|Before {{we enter}} {{on the subject}} of colour, more {{especially}} in reference to Mr. Wallace's conclusions, it may be useful to discuss some other sexual differences under a similar point <b>of</b> view. A <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls</b> formerly existed in Germany (6. Bechstein, 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands,' 1793, B. iii. 339.) in which the hens were furnished with spurs; they were good layers, but they so greatly disturbed their nests with their spurs that they could not be allowed to sit on their own eggs. Hence at one time it appeared to me probable that with the females of the wild Gallinaceae the development of spurs had been checked through natural selection, from the injury thus caused to their nests. This seemed all the more probable, as wing-spurs, which would not be injurious during incubation, are often as well-developed in the female as in the male; though in not a few cases they are rather larger in the male. When the male is furnished with leg-spurs the female almost always exhibits rudiments of them,--the rudiment sometimes consisting of a mere scale, as in Gallus. Hence it might be argued that the females had aboriginally been furnished with well-developed spurs, but that these had subsequently been lost through disuse or natural selection. But if this view be admitted, {{it would have to be}} extended to innumerable other cases; and it implies that the female progenitors of the existing spur-bearing species were once encumbered with an injurious appendage.|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{secondary}} sexual characters which {{belong to the}} species {{in a state of}} nature are sometimes quite lost, or greatly diminished, under domestication. We see this in the small size of the tusks in our improved <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> the pig, in comparison with those of the wild boar. There are sub- <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls,</b> in which the males have lost the fine-flowing tail-feathers and hackles; and others {{in which there is no}} difference in colour between the two sexes. In some cases the barred plumage, which in gallinaceous birds is commonly the attribute of the hen, has been transferred to the cock, as in the cuckoo sub-breeds. In other cases masculine characters have been partly transferred to the female, as with the splendid plumage of the golden-spangled Hamburgh hen, the enlarged comb of the Spanish hen, the pugnacious disposition of the Game hen, and as in the well-developed spurs which occasionally appear in the hens <b>of</b> various <b>breeds.</b> In Polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot, that of the male being formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is a new male character in the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge, new characters are more apt to appear in the males of our domesticated animals than in the females (14/29. I have given in my 'Descent of Man' 2nd edition page 223 sufficient evidence that male animals are usually more variable than the females.), and afterwards to be inherited exclusively or more strongly by the males. Finally, in accordance with the principle of inheritance as limited by sex, the preservation and augmentation of secondary sexual characters in natural species offers no especial difficulty, as this would follow through that form of selection which I have called sexual selection.|$|R
5000|$|Nor must {{we forget}} {{to mention a}} hen-coop, of very reverend antiquity, that stood in the farther corner of the garden, not a great way from the fountain.

In proof of the authenticity of this legendary renown, Hepzibah could have exhibited the shell of a great egg, which an ostrich need hardly have been ashamed of. Be that as it might, the hens were now scarcely larger than pigeons, and had a queer, rusty, withered aspect, and a gouty kind of movement, and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of their clucking and cackling. It was evident that the race had degenerated, like many a noble race besides, in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure. These feathered people had existed too long, in their distinct variety; a fact of which the present representatives, judging from their lugubrious deportment, seemed to be aware. They kept themselves alive, unquestionably, and laid now and then an egg, and hatched a chicken, not for any pleasure of their own, but that the world might not absolutely lose {{what had once been}} so admirable a <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls.</b> The distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest, of lamentably scanty growth, in these latter days, but so oddly and wickedly analogous to Hepzibah's turban, that Phoebe - to the poignant distress of her conscience, but inevitably - was led to fancy a general resemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative.|$|R

The higher numerical differences observed in morphometric parameters, GSR and ESR during the early and late dry seasons suggested that the dry season favors sperm production, hence sperm reserve potentials. The testicular weight was significantly (p< 0. 001) correlated {{not only to the}} body weight (r = 0. 63) but to paired Tunica albuginea (= 0. 98, p< 0. 001) and paired epididymal weight (r = 0. 69, p< 0. 001).

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{one or two}} males were to vary ever so {{slightly}} in paleness, and the variations were from the first limited in their transmission to the male sex, the task of making a new <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> the desired kind would be easy, for such males would simply have to be selected and matched with ordinary females.

Even when this form of inheritance prevails, it might well happen {{that some of the}} successive steps in the process of variation might be transferred to the female, who would then come to resemble in a slight degree the male, as occurs in some <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fowl.</b> Or again, the greater number, but not all, of the successive steps might be transferred to both sexes, and the female would then closely resemble the male. There can hardly be a doubt that this is the cause of the male pouter pigeon having a somewhat larger crop, and of the male carrier pigeon having somewhat larger wattles, than their respective females; for fanciers have not selected one sex more than the other, and have had no wish that these characters should be more strongly displayed in the male than in the female, yet this is the case with both breeds.|$|R
6000|$|In various <b>breeds</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fowl</b> {{the males}} and females often differ greatly; and these {{differences}} are {{far from being the}} same with those which distinguish the two sexes of the parent-species, the Gallus bankiva; and consequently have originated under domestication. In certain sub-varieties of the Game race we have the unusual case of the hens differing from each other more than the cocks. In an Indian <b>breed</b> <b>of</b> a white colour shaded with black, the hens invariably have black skins, and their bones are covered by a black periosteum, whilst the cocks are never or most rarely thus characterised. Pigeons offer a more interesting case; for throughout the whole great family the two sexes do not often differ much; and the {{males and females}} of the parent-form, the C. livia, are undistinguishable: yet we have seen that with pouters the male has the characteristic quality of pouting more strongly developed than the female; and in certain sub-varieties the males alone are spotted or striated with black, or otherwise differ in colour. When male and female English carrier-pigeons are exhibited in separate pens, the difference {{in the development of the}} wattle over the beak and round the eyes is conspicuous. So that here we have instances of the appearance of secondary sexual characters in the domesticated races of a species in which such differences are naturally quite absent.] ...|$|R
