5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of the law on its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> does not apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Florida's {{consideration}} {{of a bill}} to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who {{had nothing to do}} with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that the statute of limitations applied <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report's writers asked leading questions in their interviews.|$|E

Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, Poe v. Lynchburg Training School & Hospital (1981), was filed in the courts {{on the grounds that}} the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was no longer in effect at the time of the filing.

25|$|The BSA {{requires}} {{financial institutions}} {{to engage in}} customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as know your customer.

Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters.

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Chile {{is a serious}} issue affecting {{a large percentage of}} the population, especially among lower income demographics. The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address {{violence in}} the home, but <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005. A 2004 SERNAM study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse. According to another study from 2004, 90 percent of low-income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence. Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal. The legalization of divorce in 2004 won the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned about domestic violence, as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws.|$|E
25|$|With heavy {{lobbying}} by southern politicians, the Compromise of 1850 {{was passed}} by Congress after the Mexican–American War. It stipulated a more stringent Fugitive Slave Law; ostensibly, the compromise addressed regional problems by compelling officials of free states to assist slave catchers, granting them immunity to operate in free states. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> required sparse documentation to claim a person was a fugitive, slave catchers also kidnapped free blacks, especially children, and sold them into slavery. Southern politicians often exaggerated the number of escaped slaves and often blamed these escapes on Northerners interfering with Southern property rights. The law deprived suspected slaves {{of the right to}} defend themselves in court, making it difficult to prove free status. In a de facto bribe, judges were paid a higher fee ($10) for a decision that confirmed a suspect as a slave than for one ruling that the suspect was free ($5). Many Northerners who might have ignored slave issues in the South were confronted by local challenges that bound them to support slavery. This was a primary grievance cited by the Union during the American Civil War, and the perception that Northern States ignored the fugitive slave law was a major justification for secession.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application {{was made in the}} hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknolwedged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it amounts to an error of law, and that the Commissioner erred when interpretating the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.|$|E
