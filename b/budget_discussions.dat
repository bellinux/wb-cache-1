40|$|We present precise lattice {{computations}} for the b-quark mass, the quark mass ratios mb/mc and mb/ms {{as well as}} the leptonic B-decay constants. We employ gauge configurations {{with four}} dynamical quark flavors, up/down, strange and charm, at three values of the lattice spacing (a ~ 0. 06 - 0. 09 fm) and for pion masses as low as 210 MeV. Interpolation in the heavy quark mass to the bottom quark point is performed using ratios of physical quantities computed at nearby quark masses exploiting the fact that these ratios are exactly known in the static quark mass limit. Our results are also extrapolated to the physical pion mass and to the continuum limit and read: mb(MSbar, mb) = 4. 26 (10) GeV, mb/mc = 4. 42 (8), mb/ms = 51. 4 (1. 4), fBs = 229 (5) MeV, fB = 193 (6) MeV, fBs/fB = 1. 184 (25) and (fBs/fB) /(fK/fpi) = 0. 997 (17).

Based on a new dataset on 34 low-income countries, it catalogues forecasting practices and procedures from inception until budget submission, focusing primarily on institutional aspects and processes. The paper also synthesizes three key characteristics of forecasting practices, formality, organizational simplicity, and transparency, and empirically explores their determinants. High levels of country corruption are associated with less formal and less transparent forecasts.

Our library’s administrative group, Cabinet, developed a set of working assumptions for BAG based on our values and the University’s priorities as we understand them (see Appendix 1 : Cabinet Charge to BAG). BAG set a timetable and solicited feedback and suggestions for how we should approach the cuts from all faculty and staff and then from each team.

40|$|Introduction and Aims. Despite the {{persistent}} socioeconomic gradient associated with smoking, {{little is known}} about how to ‘close the gap’. There is a debate regarding the implications of directing resources away from general population efforts towards disadvantaged groups. The study explored views of those with expertise in tobacco control about the appropriate balance of tobacco control resourcing between the general population and disadvantaged groups. Design and Methods. A Web-based survey of 192 respondents (response rate 65 %) working in tobacco control in Australia and New Zealand was completed. Respondents were sampled from the Australian and New Zealand Tobacco Control Contact List and a literature search. Respondents were asked to allocate a hypothetical budget for: (a) anti-tobacco mass media campaigns; and (b) tobacco control research. Results. The vast majority (93 %) of respondents believed that some tobacco control resources should be specifically directed towards disadvantaged groups. Respondents believed up to half of mass media resources should be directed towards disadvantaged groups. In the case of tobacco control research, the median allocation to the general population was approximately one-third of a hypothetical research <b>budget.</b> <b>Discussion</b> and Conclusions. It appears there is a desire among the Australian and New Zealand tobacco control community for substantial effort to be directed towards disadvantaged groups. It is important to develop an evidence base to ensure an efficient and equitable approach to balancing the potentially competing demands of general population versus disadvantaged group activities in relation to tobacco control...|$|R
