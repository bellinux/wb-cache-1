40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{introduces}} a simple method to test between two general approaches to defining <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> thrift product markets. I estimate two models that endogenize market structure using data on <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> thrifts from 1, 884 rural markets {{for the year}} 2000. The first model assumes that <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> thrifts are in “independent product markets, ” i. e., that bank profitability depends only on competition from other <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> that thrift profitability depends only on competition from other thrifts. An alternative model is then estimated assuming that <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> thrifts are “perfect strategic substitutes, ” i. e., that a bank’s equilibrium profitability falls equally {{with the presence of}} another bank or an additional thrift (and vice-versa). A transformation of the likelihood for the “independent markets ” model allows me to test it against the “perfect strategic substitutes ” model using Vuong’s (1989) non-nested likelihood ratio test. The hypothesis that <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> thrifts compete in independent product markets is soundly rejected against the hypothesis that <b>banks</b> <b>and</b> thrifts are perfect strategic substitutes...|$|R
