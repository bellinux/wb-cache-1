5|$|A {{prominent}} {{tradition is}} that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a <b>boat,</b> <b>or</b> a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his earthly status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains {{in order to create a}} tumulus.|$|E
5|$|New Washington was looted {{and burned}} on April 20 by Mexican troops, {{and as many}} as 5,000 civilians fled, either by <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> across land. Those {{attempting}} to cross the San Jacinto River were bottlenecked for three days, and the vicinity around the crossing transformed into a refugee camp. Burnet ordered government assistance all across Texas for fleeing families.|$|E
5|$|The in-game {{exploration}} is chiefly {{based on}} walking and running; however, there are instances when swimming and sometimes levitation is involved. Transportation of other kinds, such as teleportation, and traveling by <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> {{on the back}} of giant flea-like creatures called silt striders, is available for a fee when moving between the various settlements on Vvardenfell.|$|E
50|$|The {{particular}} phases {{are different}} for different objects, e.g., for ships {{a distinction between}} assembly and embarkation (to <b>boats</b> <b>or</b> rafts) is made. These are separate from each other. The decision whether to enter the <b>boats</b> <b>or</b> rafts is thus usually made after assembly is completed.|$|R

5|$|By far {{the most}} {{expensive}} variant in the BA range, the Fairmont Ghia featured leather upholstery, wood grain highlights, full power options and a unique suspension assembly. The premium sound system, which incorporated a full-colour LCD screen, was standard, and the centre console stack was characterised by an analogue clock. Reverse parking sensors were available {{for the first time}} in the BA, standard on the Ghia. The sensors feature an automatic turn-off function for use when towing a <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> trailer for example.|$|E
5|$|Players journey between field screen {{locations}} {{on the world}} map, a three dimensional, downsized representation of Final Fantasy IXs world presented from a top-down perspective. Players can freely navigate around the world map screen unless restricted by terrain like bodies of water or mountain ranges. To overcome geographical limitations, players can ride chocobos, sail on a <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> pilot airships. Like previous Final Fantasy installments, travel across the world map screen and hostile field screen locations is interrupted by random enemy encounters.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{information}} as {{to the effects of}} Pauline on Mexico, but during the passage of the hurricane over Magdalena Bay, a boat disappeared with its five occupants. Despite a large-scale search for the <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> any possible remnants, no trace was ever found. The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Before Joy struck Australia, {{residents}} {{evacuated from}} resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> plane. Officials set up evacuation centres {{on the mainland}} and put the Australian Army on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville. A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter {{in advance of the}} storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close just before Christmas. Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000travellers, many of whom spent Christmas in the airport. Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers.|$|E
5|$|Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch is a {{role-playing}} {{game that}} uses a third-person perspective. Players complete quests—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of quests, players can freely roam the overworld. Players explore towns, villages, dungeons and dangerous places scattered throughout the world, and possess the ability to travel between the world and Oliver's hometown of Motorville. Upon leaving a location, players enter the World Map, {{which can be used}} to select a destination. The world may be fully explored {{from the beginning of the}} game without restrictions, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content and forms of transport to navigate the world: players initially run to navigate the world, though later gain the ability to travel by <b>boat,</b> <b>or</b> on the back of a dragon.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E

5|$|The towpath {{continues}} to Rotherham Lock, where the Rotherham cut starts, but {{from here to}} Conisbrough, {{the only way to}} see the navigation is from a <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> from one of the bridges which cross it. To the north of the cut are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, {{in the shadow of the}} A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal turns off to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the towpath resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June, {{a letter}} arrived from William Tayler, the {{commissioner}} of Patna district, warning that an outbreak of mutiny from the Bengal Native Infantry units in Dinapore was to be expected. The European population in Arrah spent {{that night at the}} house of Arthur Littledale, a judge working in Arrah, and during the night it was decided that the European women and children were to be sent by boat to Dinapore, escorted by armed members of the European male population, where they would be taken into the care of the 10th Regiment of Foot—this decision was acted upon on the 9th. The following morning a meeting was held at the house of Herwald Wake, the magistrate of Shahabad district, to discuss what to do next. The East India Company civil servants stated that they did not intend to abandon the town and they would remain. All but two of the remaining European male residents of Arrah who were not civil servants or Government employees decided to leave for the relative safety of Dinapore by <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> on horseback and did so the same day. This reduced the European male population of Arrah to eight, rising to sixteen {{over the next few weeks}} as men arrived in the town from the surrounding district. The defence of the town was augmented on 11 June when a party arrived consisting of 50 sepoys and 6 sowars from the Bengal Military Police Battalion, known as Rattray's Sikhs (now the 3rd Battalion of the Sikh Regiment, Indian Army), under the command of Jemadar Hooken Singh. The party had been sent from Dinapore, part of a larger detachment under their commander Captain Rattray whose presence in the area had been personally requested by Tayler, and placed under the direct command of Wake.|$|E

5000|$|The current {{lock gates}} weigh 22 tons each, and require {{a team of}} at least three lock-keepers to operate the staircase. They usually operate on an [...] "efficiency basis"; that is, they try either to fill each cut with {{ascending}} <b>boats</b> <b>or</b> with descending <b>boats,</b> <b>or</b> to allow for passing, i.e. a dropping craft to pass a rising craft on the same fill/empty cycle.|$|R
