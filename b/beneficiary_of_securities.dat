40|$|This article {{explores the}} concept of ‘human security’: {{the idea that the}} {{referent}} object and <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> should be individuals. It demonstrates that the concept has had some success as a normative reference point for human-centred policy movements internationally, and it reflects a broader shift towards human agency and human-centred conceptions <b>of</b> <b>security.</b> As a theoretical concept, therefore, the idea contributes to a multi-disciplinary reconceptualization <b>of</b> <b>security</b> that draws upon theoretical debates in political science and criminology. However, attempts to operationalize it have exposed fundamental problems in the new security discourse more broadly, generating critiques in political science and criminology which share common foundations but which are rarely engaged in an integrated manner.

In addressing this debate from an international relations perspective, the article also engages with criminological scholarship on security in order to identify and strengthen links across the disciplines...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} realist {{analysis}} of the contemporary concept of popular sovereignty {{in its ability to}} make sense of the EU’s legitimacy. Drawing upon Bernard Williams’ political thought, a conception of legitimacy should make sense of hierarchical rule as a desirable civic order from within its own historical circumstances at the normative level. In addition, it should offer realistic guidance to political agents, meaning that its political fictions must therefore acquire a certain degree of practical resonance in order to act as heuristic tools. The modern concept of popular sovereignty sets appropriate criteria of legitimacy based upon the bonds created between citizens. Through a genealogical inquiry, I reconstruct conceptions of popular sovereignty which underpin defences of the EU’s output, democratic, and identitarian legitimacy from canonical arguments. These justifications of the state consider the people as <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> and economic prosperity, as a self-governing demos, and as a cultural nation, respectively. I propose a realist vindication of this multi-faceted conception of popular sovereignty at the normative level, because these different conceptions complement one another in making sense of the sovereign state’s legitimacy. The thesis then discusses how the political fictions of the people could simultaneously make sense within the European polity. In short, the citizens of Europe’s polities have become part of the normative systems which create judicial-economic, civic-democratic, and socio-cultural relationships within the territorial borders of the European states. In addition, the centralisation of decision-making power and implementation resources has given plausibility to the political fiction of sovereignty. European integration has, however, resulted in a reconfiguration of these normative systems and restructuring of power into a two-tier political order. In this novel context, a realist vindication of the contemporary conception of popular sovereignty is no longer possible. The thesis concludes by suggesting that a demoicratic reconceptualisation of popular sovereignty offers a constructive way {{to make sense of the}} EU’s legitimacy.

40|$|Between {{the early}} 1980 s and 2002, both the {{prevalence}} of obesity and the number <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> the Social <b>Security</b> Disability Insurance program doubled. We test whether these trends are related; specifically, we test whether obesity causes disability and movement onto the disability rolls. We estimate models of instrumental variables using two nationally representative data sets, the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 Cohort. The results are mixed but we find evidence that weight increases the probability of health-related work limitations and the probability of receiving disability related income. Our {{results suggest that the}} failure to treat obesity as endogenous leads to dramatic underestimates of the link between obesity and disability outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} historical {{trends in}} the demographic and health-related characteristics <b>of</b> disabled worker <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> the Social <b>Security</b> Disability Insurance (SSDI) program since 1960. Descriptive trend data show SSDI awards are increasingly made not only to younger persons, but also to persons with health impairments that at any age typ-ically require longer durations of program entitlement. As a result, the expected number of years a new awardee stays on the rolls has risen over time, putting additional pressure on already strained program financing. A time-series regression analysis suggests that these compositional trends are shaped by {{a complex set of}} external and internal forces, not just a single source of change such as the growth in the population insured for work disability. Health status trends turn out to be especially significant determinants of awards to younger beneficiaries. Some policy implica-tions of compositional changes and their determinants are discussed.

40|$|The ongoing Great Recession has {{triggered}} numerous proposals {{to improve the}} regulation of financial markets and, most importantly, the regulation of organizations such as credit rating agencies, underwriters, hedge funds, and banks, whose behavior {{is believed to have}} caused the credit crisis that spawned the economic collapse. Not surprisingly, some of the reform efforts seek to strengthen the use of private litigation. Private suits have long been championed as a necessary mechanism not only to compensate investors for harms they suffer from financial frauds but also to enhance deterrence of wrongdoing. However, in recent years there has been a chorus calling for reform, singing a distinctly deregulatory tune and calling for serious restraints on private litigation as a vehicle for protecting investors. In this revisionist story, securities class action suits were cast as the villain that placed U. S. capital markets at a serious competitive disadvantage without producing any net benefits for institutional investors, whose trading makes them not only dominant participants in securities markets but also important <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> successful <b>securities</b> class action settlements. It is interesting to note, though, how quickly a crisis can change the discourse of public debate on the value of private litigation. Now it seems likely that reform will occur. While we are hopeful that the recession will ultimately abate, a significant question nonetheless remains: which of these two views <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> class actions should guide the formation of public policy with respect to the role of private litigation in the greater constellation of financial market regulatory mechanisms?

The {{aim of this study}} is to describe recent oral health services utilization and its association with socio-demographic characteristics and co-morbidity in Mexican Social Security beneficiaries 60 years and older. Methods A sample of 700 individuals aged 60 + years was randomly chosen from the databases of the Mexican Institute <b>of</b> Social <b>Security</b> (IMSS). These participants resided in the southwest of Mexico City and made up the final sample of a cohort study for identifying risk factors for root caries in elderly patients. Sociodemographic variables, presence of cognitive decline, depression, morbidity, medication consumption, and utilization of as well as reasons for seeking oral health services within the past 12 months were collected through a questionnaire. Clinical oral assessments were carried out to determine coronal and root caries experience. Results The sample consisted of 698 individuals aged 71. 6 years on average, of whom 68. 3 % were women. 374 participants (53. 6 %) had made use of oral health services within the past 12 months. 81 % of those who used oral health services sought private medical care, 12. 8 % sought social security services, and 6. 2 % public health services. 99. 7 % had experienced coronal caries and 44. 0 % root caries. Female sex (OR = 2. 0), 6 years' schooling or less (OR = 1. 4), and caries experience in more than 22 teeth (OR = 0. 6) are factors associated with the utilization of these services. Conclusion About half the elderly <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> have made use of oral health services within the past 12 months, and many of them have to use private services. Being a woman, having little schooling, and low caries experience are factors associated with the use of these services. </p...|$|R

40|$|By {{drawing on}} the hegemony of {{politics}} over the administration and social policy in the Kurdistan Region, researching the implementation <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> programmes is critically important for understanding the outlook of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) towards social policy. This research broadly examines policy implementation theories {{within the context of}} this politically underdeveloped region, taking into account the social <b>security</b> programmes <b>of</b> the KRG as a case study. Primary questions could be asked here, such as what are the critical factors in the implementation <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> in the KRG? Why has the KRG not adopted and implemented an effective social policy with its developmental programmes since its relative economic growth in 2001 ? My focused question in the current research is: why has the KRG implemented its two main social cash transfers (‘Rights and Privileges to Families of Martyrs and Genocide Survivors’ and ‘Social Safety Net’) differently? Exploring these cases would favour understanding {{of the extent to which}} the political conditions of the Kurdistan Region have influenced the implementation of social benefit schemes of the KRG. Experiencing its national struggle in the past, intra-Kurdish civil war during the 1990 s and partisanship afterwards has formed the KRG. As for the theoretical framework of this research, I have used two sets of literature: policy implementation and clientelism. Having employed qualitative semi-structured interviews with forty-six individuals and six focus groups from implementers of the aforementioned programmes in the region, this research discusses the critical factors in the implementation process <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> programmes in the KRG. In contrast to almost all policy implementation theories and models, which lay emphasis on the role of top officials (top-down approach), bureaucrats and implementers (bottom-up approach), I argue that the political character of the programme and its beneficiaries is potentially a determinant actor in the policy implementation success. The KRG deals with social cash transfers in accordance with the profile and socio-political status <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> In this regard two types of clients could be distinguished: high value clients treated within a preferred programme (RPFMGS) and low-value clients treated within a neglected programme (SSN). The profile and status <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> social <b>security</b> schemes play a decisive role in the salience given to the social programme, and in the effectiveness of its implementation. Both aforementioned social security programmes are implemented at a ministerial level. However, the performance of the two programmes appears to be complicated and evidently different. The main difference between both programmes is that the first programme, RPFMGS, serves a population who are characterised as ‘political victims’, while the second programme, SPF, covers ‘socio-economic victims’. Labelling beneficiaries based on their socio-political status will primarily explain the reason why the KRG deals with each social security programme very differently. The first programme is highly prioritised politically, while the second is neglected politically...|$|R
