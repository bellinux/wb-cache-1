5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant <b>because</b> <b>without</b> adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary <b>because</b> <b>without</b> the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge can not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Select Committee {{assigned}} {{to deal with}} the bill was chaired by Lord Cromer and sat during November and December 1908. After several sessions, the committee declared several important decisions. It reaffirmed that federation would benefit {{of the people of the}} Potteries, that a differential rating system for a fixed period was required, that asset valuation in each town should be abandoned, and that the committee reserved the right to decide a course of action should the parties not be able to reach agreement. This last point was important <b>because</b> <b>without</b> it all disputes would have to be passed back either to the Local Government Board or the House of Commons. With prorogation of the current Parliament on the horizon, this would have led to delays that jeopardised the passage of the whole bill through Parliament during that parliamentary session.|$|E

25|$|Although timber barons orchestrate {{the illicit}} operations, {{including}} export, their operations are financed by international sources. This financing {{comes in the}} form of down payments of up to half the total sale from foreign buyers and loans from international banks that have branches in Antananarivo. The loans are critical, even in such a profitable industry, <b>because</b> <b>without</b> full payment, most of the capital gets tied up in the stockpiles of logs waiting to be exported.|$|E

25|$|According to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik, {{the lack}} of unifying {{language}} to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem <b>because</b> <b>without</b> a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and {{is in need of}} a specific vernacular.|$|E

The Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern lose themselves in yet another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language. The Player leaves in order to prepare for his production of The Murder of Gonzago, set {{to be put on}} in front of Hamlet and the King and Queen.|$|E
25|$|The {{report also}} {{rejected}} the suggestion to allow solicitors rights of {{audience in the}} High Court The report concluded {{that the practice of}} law was a profession, and that a profession had to be independent of government, <b>because</b> <b>without</b> independence the interests of a client cannot be a primary consideration. It did not challenge the existing professional self-regulation through organisations such as the Law Society and Bar Council. The Commission did recommend an examination of the court and legal procedures to see if time and money could be saved for the parties involved.|$|E

Landry would say he expected a rollout pass attempt because an incompletion would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie and send the game into overtime). But Green Bay's pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E
25|$|Motivational {{models are}} central to game design, <b>because</b> <b>without</b> motivation, a player will not be {{interested}} in progressing further within a game. Several models for gameplay motivations have been proposed, including Richard Bartle's. Jon Radoff has proposed a four-quadrant model of gameplay motivation that includes cooperation, competition, immersion and achievement. The motivational structure of games {{is central to the}} gamification trend, which seeks to apply game-based motivation to business applications. In the end, game designers must know the needs and desires of their customers for their companies to flourish.|$|E

If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) where no one got hurt, the kids would likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house partiesânot after the dance, but all night. And, without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. <b>Because</b> <b>without</b> organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E

25|$|The {{front lines}} were not {{continuous}} because the dense forest terrain meant that visibility {{was down to}} metres, so there was danger of ambush and sudden assault for both sides. Smoke from burning sections of the forest, set alight by shell fire, helped the Germans and hindered the Soviets because it shielded the Wehrmacht troops from aerial reconnaissance and attack. On the other hand, the smoke hindered many groups <b>because,</b> <b>without</b> a compass and no sun, {{it was difficult to}} judge which direction to go. The sandy soil precluded the digging of foxholes and {{there was no time to}} construct anything more elaborate, so there was little to no protection from wooden splinters created by artillery and tank HE shells which the Soviet forces deliberately aimed to explode at tree-top height.|$|E
25|$|The pig cull {{negatively}} affected the Zabbaleen in several ways. First, because the pigs eat the organic waste, {{they are a}} vital component in their recycling system, the pig cull literally destroyed the Zabbaleen recycling system. Deprived of their pig herds, the Zabbaleen stopped collecting such organic trash, leaving food piles to rot in the streets, leading to the increase of trash in the streets. According to Engi Wassef, recycling and sorting activities in the Zabbaleen villages all but ceased after the pig cull, <b>because</b> <b>without</b> the pigs, the sorting and recycling activities of the Zabbaleen became economically unfeasible. Less trash was brought into the village, {{because there was no}} place to put the trash. Hence, the entire recycling system was broken, placing the Zabbaleen out of work.|$|E
25|$|Many Jews {{continued}} to live as lower class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult. They could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills <b>because</b> <b>without</b> the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. But as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry. In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses {{in the city and}} 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of Paris and Nancy increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.|$|E
