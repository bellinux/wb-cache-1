Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso, indicating that fish made up a majority of the diet of Pteranodon (though they may also have taken invertebrates).|$|E
5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} <b>bolus</b> (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the <b>bolus</b> enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
40|$|International audience—This paper {{analyses}} {{the interaction}} forces between two magnetic <b>boluses</b> for future drug targeting applications. To transport the drugs, {{it is necessary}} to convey several therapeutic magnetic <b>boluses</b> using magnetic gradients. The main difficulty is to control a group of different therapeutic <b>boluses</b> at desired states, despite the presence of interaction forces between <b>boluses.</b> To overcome this issue and designing robust control strategies, it is important to fully understand these interactions forces. Based on a dipole-dipole interaction model and dynamic modeling of two magnetic <b>boluses,</b> the magnetic and non magnetic forces are expressed. Finally, an experimental investigation is carried out in a tank under the presence of the magnetic field in order to to assess the prevalence between the magnetic and the non-magnetic interaction forces...|$|R

5|$|Due {{to safety}} {{concerns}} with viral vectors, nonviral delivery methods, typically employing lipid-based or polymeric vectors, are also promising candidates. Computational modeling of nonviral siRNA delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene knockdown studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems. The model used an input <b>bolus</b> dose of siRNA and computationally and experimentally showed that knockdown duration was dependent {{mainly on the}} doubling time of the cells to which siRNA was delivered, while peak knockdown depended primarily on the delivered dose. Kinetic considerations of RNAi are imperative to safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed.|$|E
5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{collecting}} and analyzing <b>boluses</b> {{to characterize the}} cephalopod diet of albatrosses {{has been used in}} many diet studies. However, no study has validated this method. We compared <b>boluses</b> and stomach samples from Gray-headed Albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma) and Black-browed Albatrosses (T. melanophris) to (1) study the consumption and diversity of cephalopods in these species, (2) investigate biases associated with each sampling method, and (3) estimate the number of samples needed to characterize these albatross’s cephalopod diet. We found that collection and analysis of <b>boluses</b> is a simple, efficient, and noninvasive method for assessing the cephalopod diet of these albatross species, but it is inadequate for characterizing the more easily digestible dietary components, such as fish and crustaceans. Both <b>boluses</b> and stomach samples showed that the two albatross species fed on cephalopods of similar sizes and from the same families (Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, and Cranchiidae). Furthermore, the main prey species (Martialia hyadesi, Kondakovia longimana, and Galiteuthis glacialis) and the total number of cephalopod species consumed (18 – 24 species) were the same for both albatrosses. To include all cephalopod species, using a sample-randomization technique, a minimum of 61 and 43 <b>boluses</b> were needed for Gray-headed and Black- browed albatrosses, respectively; but to adequately describe the diversity and size frequency of the main prey species, 82 and 371 <b>boluses</b> would be needed...|$|R
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a <b>bolus</b> of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1950s, the {{diagnosis}} of pituitary disease remained based on clinical features and visual field examination, sometimes aided by pneumoencephalography and X-ray tomography. Nevertheless, the field of pituitary surgery developed during this time. The major breakthrough in diagnosis came {{with the discovery of}} radioimmunoassay by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in the late 1950s. This allowed the direct measurement of the hormones of the pituitary, which {{as a result of their}} low concentrations in blood had previously been hard to measure. Stimulation tests were developed in the 1960s, and in 1973 the triple <b>bolus</b> test was introduced, a test that combined stimulation testing with insulin, GnRH and TRH. Imaging of the pituitary, and therefore identification of tumors and other structural causes, improved radically with the introduction of computed tomography in the late 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAimTo {{present the}} results {{obtained}} using radiochromic films EBT and RTQA 1010 P for the reconstruction the dose distributions for targets irradiated by proton beam and modified by wax <b>boluses.</b> BackgroundIn Medico-Technical Complex at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna implemented technology of wax <b>boluses.</b> Materials and methodsWax <b>boluses</b> are easier to make and they give better dose distributions than <b>boluses</b> made from modeling clay previously used at our center. We irradiated two imaginary targets, one shaped as a cylinder {{and the other one}} as two cuboids. The evaluated calibration curve was used for calculation of the dose distributions measured by the EBT and RTQA radiochromic film. In both cases, the measured dose distributions were compared to the dose distributions calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). We also compared dose distributions using three different conformity indices at a 95 % isodose. ResultsBetter target coverage and better compliance of measurements (semiconductor detectors and radiochromic films) with calculated doses was obtained for cylindrical target than for cuboidal target. The 95 % isodose covered well the tumor for both target shapes, while for cuboidal target larger volume around the target received therapeutic dose, due to the complicated target shape. The use wax <b>boluses</b> provided to be effective tool in modifying proton beam to achieve appropriate shape of isodose distribution. ConclusionEBT film yielded the best visual matching. Both EBT and RTQA films confirmed good conformity between calculated and measured doses, thus confirming that wax <b>boluses</b> used to modify the proton beam resulted in good dose distributions...|$|R

25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include moistening food {{and helping to}} create a food <b>bolus.</b> This lubricative function of saliva allows the food <b>bolus</b> to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus.

25|$|Bubblegum bubbles {{are formed}} when {{the tension and}} {{elasticity}} of gum polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum <b>bolus.</b> Bubble gum bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the <b>bolus</b> acts equally {{on all of the}} interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the gum base stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble recoils and the wad of gum is ready to continue being chewed.|$|E
25|$|Technology – The dawn of Western alchemy is {{sometimes}} {{associated with that}} of metallurgy, extending back to 3500. Many writings were lost when the emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X. Dating from 300–500, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver. These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of <b>Bolus</b> of Mendes (or Pseudo-Democritus), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements. Between the time of <b>Bolus</b> and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} missed insulin <b>boluses</b> for snacks in youth with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Three months of simultaneous continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring data from nine subjects were retrospectively evaluated. Glucose excursions between 1330 and 1700 h were defined as relating to snacks with insulin or snacks with no insulin administered. Area under the curve � 180 mg/dl (AUC � 180), average � glucose, and rate of change were analyzed and compared within and between groups. RESULTS — A total of 94 snacks without insulin and 101 snacks with insulin were analyzed. Snacks without insulin had significantly higher log (AUC � 180 � 1) (1. 26 vs. 0. 44 mg/dl per event; P � 0. 001), � glucose (114 vs. 52 mg/dl; P � 0. 001), and average rate of change (1. 3 vs. 1. 1 mg/dl per minute; P � 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS — This study shows that afternoon snacks without insulin <b>boluses</b> are common and result in significantly higher glucose excursions than snacks with insulin administration. Previous studies have demonstrated the deleterious effect of missed insulin doses for meals (1 – 4). None, however, have examined the effect of missed insulin <b>boluses</b> for snacks. Because youth frequently snack when unsupervised, {{it is likely that}} missed insulin <b>boluses</b> are even more common for snacks than for meals. The purpose of this investigation was to use data from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) together to {{evaluate the}} glycemic profiles of missed insulin <b>boluses</b> for afternoon snacks...|$|R
40|$|Deglutitive upper esophageal {{sphincter}} opening (UES) in {{the elderly}} has been incompletely studied. Our aim was to determine {{in the elderly}} the temporal and dimensional characteristics of deglutitive UES opening; anterior and superior hyoid and laryngeal excursions as measures of distracting forces imparted on the UES; and hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressure (IBP). Fourteen healthy elderly and 14 healthy young volunteers were studied by concurrent videofluoroscopy and hypopharyngeal manometry during swal-lowing of 5 - and 10 -mL barium <b>boluses.</b> The anteroposterior UES diameter, {{as well as the}} anterior hyoid bone and laryngeal excur-sion, was significantly smaller in the elderly compared to the young (p <. 05) for 5 -mL barium <b>boluses,</b> but not for 10 -mL <b>boluses.</b> The lateral diameter of UES opening was similar between groups for all <b>boluses.</b> The IBP for 5 - and 10 -mL swallows in the elderly was significantly higher than that in the young (p <. 05). We conclude that anteroposterior deglutitive UES opening and hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage anterior excursion are reduced in the elderly. These changes are associated with increased IBP, suggesting a higher pharyngeal outflow resistance in the elderly compared to the young.
