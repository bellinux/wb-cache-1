Development of formalized {{description}} of automatic <b>block</b> <b>system</b> of numerical code {{based on the}} analysis of characteristic failures of automatic <b>block</b> <b>system</b> and procedure of its maintenance. Methodology. For this research a theoretical and analytical methods have been used. Findings. Typical failures of the automatic <b>block</b> <b>systems</b> were analyzed, as well as basic reasons of failure occur were found out. It was determined that majority of failures occurs due to defects of the maintenance system. Advantages and disadvantages of the current service technology of automatic <b>block</b> <b>system</b> were analyzed. Works that can be automatized by means of technical diagnostics were found out.

40|$|Abstract — This paper studies discrete-time linear {{systems with}} multirate outputs, {{assuming}} that two measured output streams {{are available at}} coprime rates. In the literature this type of system, which {{can be considered as}} periodic time-varying, is commonly studied in its blocked version, since the well-known techniques of analysis developed for linear time-invariant systems can be used. In particular, we focus on some structural properties of the <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> and we prove that, under a generic setting i. e. for a generic choice of parameter matrices, the <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> are minimal when the underlying multirate system is defined using a minimal dimension system. Moreover, we focus on zeros of tall <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> i. e. <b>blocked</b> <b>systems</b> with more outputs than inputs.

Channel impuls response (CIR) was required to overcome the intersymbol interference (ISI). Channel impuls response information was obtained from channel estimation processing. Iterance simulation used monte-carlo technique to determined the performance of bit error rate (BER) and mean squared error(MSE). Simulation {{results show that the}} mean squared error performance on MIMO system was better than the SISO system. On MMSE channel estimation, the MIMO 2 Tx- 2 Rx system provided 2 dB improvement that compared to SISO system at value of MSE 10 - 2. Furthermore, MIMO 3 Tx- 2 Rx produce improvement about 1. 5 dB, MIMO 4 Tx- 2 Rx improve about 3. 5 dB at BER 10 - 4, respectively. The MIMO 2 Tx- 2 Rx system, MMSE channel estimation produced better performance 1 dB than LS channel estimation with sufficient SNR value for MSE 10 - 2. Pilot arrangement, the simulation results show that the block type-pilot arrangement produced better performance than the comb type-pilot arrangement at fast fading channel. <b>Block</b> type-pilot <b>arrangement</b> <b>system</b> produced better 10 dB than the comb type-pilot arrangement with MMSE method at value of BER 2 10 - 2 </sup...|$|R

In order to make KARAMATSU forests into the single tree working forests in future, the working aim of KARAMATSU forests and of the clear-cutting in alternate <b>blocks</b> <b>system</b> are same. 2. Judging from the total height growing process of KARAMATSU, it is forecasted that the maximum volume rotation is 40 years and the technological final cutting age is 60 to 80 years. 3. When we plan to make the regulation period into the difference of the technological final cutting age and the maximum volume rotation, the working system of KARAMATSU forests agree with that of the clear-cutting in alternate <b>blocks</b> <b>system.</b> 4. From the above results, if KARAMATSU is mainly planted in the regulation period, it is possible to attain the purpose of the clear-cutting in alternate <b>blocks</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
