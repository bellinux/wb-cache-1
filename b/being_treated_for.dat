5|$|An incensed Democratic {{majority}} in the Kentucky General Assembly created a committee to investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E
5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many aspects}} of Hubbard's life story are disputed, there is general {{agreement}} about its basic outline. Born in Tilden, Nebraska, {{he spent much of}} his childhood in Helena, Montana.

5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the explosion {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, was <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm.

5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>for</b> gunshot wounds after last night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E
