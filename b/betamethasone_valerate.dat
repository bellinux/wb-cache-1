40|$|Dermatoses are wide-spread. Beside {{physical}} discomforts like {{pain and}} itches, often psychosocial problems are caused {{and the quality}} of life of patients is strongly affected. In addition, the treatment of dermatoses is still unsatisfying in many cases, as only symptoms are considered and results are moderate. Researches in pathophysiology and therapeutics are therefore of great need. An important tool thereby are in vitro / ex vivo skin models. They allow to carry out experiments under definite conditions and regardless of human subjects. Penetrationexperiments with active ingredients and potentially toxic chemicals by means of in vitro / ex vivo skin models are common nowadays. Also for measuring the irritant and phototoxic effect as well as the allergic potential of substances and preparations such models are established in the mean time. But by now, only few investigations make use of both applications in parallel. In vitro / ex vivo skin models potentially allow an integrated examination, whereas not only galenical aspects but also attributes of the active substance of a pharmaceutical are considered. The elaboration of a corresponding test procedure as a screening instrument for research and development of dermatics will be of great value. With regard to these purposes, the present study investigates the possibilities and limits of three currently available in vitro / ex vivo skin models: SkinEthic®, Phenion FT® and Natskin®. SkinEthic® and Phenion® FT are both in vitro reconstructed models of human skin cells. Whereas SkinEthic® is an epidermis model, consisting exclusively of keratinocytes, Phenion® FT contains epidermis and dermis (fibroblasts in collagen matrix). Natskin® is a ready to use model consisting of excised human skin. All three models were exposed to external stimuli, namely chemical irritants or UV irradiation. Subsequently, betamethasone 17 -valerate, a potent and widely documented glucocorticoid, particularly designed for dermatological administration, was applied in different dosages. Due to its anti-inflammatory efficacy, a reduction of the previously provoked skin irritation was expected. For measuring the reaction on the external stimuli as well as the effect of the antiinflammatory treatment, cytokines (interleukin- 1 a, interleukin- 6, tumour necrosis factor-a), chemokins (interleukin- 8), and other proteins (interleukin- 1 soluble receptor type II, interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist, lipocortin- 1), which are involved in the cutaneous inflammatory response, were quantified. These mediators were analysed, on the one hand on protein level by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (in homogenised tissue and secretion), and on the other hand on transcriptional level (mRNA) by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, skin viability was assessed by means of different enzymatic and histological methods. In parallel to its impact on the skin, the penetration / permeation of <b>betamethasone</b> 17 - <b>valerate</b> through all three models and after administration in two vehicles (ethanol - phosphate buffer and oil-in-water emulsion) was compared. The present study provides evidence that SkinEthic®, Phenion® FT, and Natskin® are appropriate skin models for quantifying effects in response to UV irradiation (290 - 400 nm, 20 - 250 mJ/cm 2). However, the mode and extent of these effects vary from model to model. Particularly, the expression profile of the SkinEthic® model differs from that of the Phenion® FT model. While in the SkinEthic® model the interleukin- 1 a secretion increases depending on the applied UV dose, it is not affected in the Phenion® FT model. For the Phenion FT® model, however, interleukin- 8 turned out to be a suitable indicator of irritation. Depending on the UV dose, both in the tissue and in the culture medium an enhanced interleukin- 8 concentration could be detected. Nevertheless, in the SkinEthic® model interleukin- 8 was not a reliable indicator of cellular and pathophysiological processes at all. Additionally, the viability was influenced differently by UV irradiation in the three tested skin models. The SkinEthic® model proved to be most susceptible to UV induced tissue damage (plasma membrane damage [LDH-test] and number of metabolic active cells [MTT-test]). The Phenion® FT and the Natskin® model showed better robustness. Most likely, these different reactions are due to the varying composition of the particular skin models. The presence of a dermis (fibroblasts and connective tissue) and thus, effects due to the interaction of keratinocytes and fibroblasts seemed to play an important role. Furthermore, the irritant effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate (0. 1 to 0. 4...|$|R

Material and Method: Patients with stable, mild to moderate plaque psoriasis at the Department of Medicine, Lerdsin General Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were randomized for treatment with either coal tar (10 % LCD) cream or <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> cream (0. 1 %). All patients entered a 2 week wash-out period followed by the creams being applied twice daily until completion at 6 weeks. The patient severity of psoriasis was assessed using the modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at baseline and after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment. Result: At {{the end of the}} trial, the mean reduction of the PASI score from baseline was 38. 39 % with the coal tar group and 69. 36 % with the <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> group.

40|$|Ten {{children}} with severe asthma, {{who had been}} well controlled on maintenance <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> aerosol {{for an average of}} 11 months, were given placebo aerosols without their knowledge. The period of placebo substitution was campared with one 28 -day period of <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> therapy beforehand, and two 28 -day periods afterwards. Symptoms were increased during the placebo period, and patients did not return to their previous well-controlled state until the second month after reinstitution of therapy. Changes in the means of twice-daily peak expiratory flow readings (PEFR) followed the same pattern as changes in symptoms. The exacerbation of asthma which occurred during placebo treatment was accompanied by a widening in the diurnal variation between morning and evening PEFR.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of three different formulations containing <b>Betamethasone</b> <b>Valerate</b> versus placebo in the topical treatment of phimosis. As a secondary goal, we compared the outcomes after 30 and 60 days of treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty boys aged 3 to 10 years old with clinical diagnosis of phimosis were enrolled. Patients were randomized {{to one of the}} following groups: Group 1 : <b>Betamethasone</b> <b>Valerate</b> 0. 2 % plus Hyaluronidase; Group 2 : <b>Betamethasone</b> <b>Valerate</b> 0. 2 %; Group 3 : <b>Betamethasone</b> <b>Valerate</b> 0. 1 % or Group 4 : placebo. Parents were instructed to apply the formula twice a day for 60 days and follow-up evaluations were scheduled at 30, 60 and 240 days after the first consultation. Success was defined as complete and easy foreskin retraction. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients were included at our final analysis. Group 1 (N = 54), 2 (N = 51) and 3 (N = 52) had similar success and improvement rates, all treatment groups had higher success rates than placebo(N = 38).

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that the skin barrier function is altered in atopic dermatitis. Little information is available {{about the effect of}} topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors on this function. PURPOSE: To assess the water content and its rate of accumulation in the stratum corneum of atopic patients using an indirect electrometric method while on tacrolimus or <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> treatment. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with moderate atopic dermatitis affecting both forearms completed this double-blind randomized study. One forearm was treated twice daily for 3 weeks with 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment. The other forearm was similarly treated with 0. 12 % <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> ointment. Electrometric measurements were made under continuous occlusion secured by a Nova Dermal Phase Meter sensor probe. Assessments were performed at inclusion, after the 3 -week treatment and after a further 3 -week follow-up out of treatment. RESULTS: During treatment, both compounds yielded a similar improvement in skin barrier function. Indeed, under probe occlusion, the rate of water accumulation was significantly decreased. This improvement was sustained after stopping the tacrolimus treatment. By contrast, the benefit was in part lost at the site that had been treated by <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate.</b> CONCLUSION: The difference in the effect of the 2 compounds {{may be due to the}} negative influence of <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> on the epidermal metabolism leading to progressive atrophy of the tissue. The better preservation of the skin barrier function after stopping tacrolimus treatment may help retarding relapses of atopic dermatitis. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Background: Vitiligo, {{a common}} {{disorder}} of depigmentation, {{is often difficult}} to treat. Corticosteroids are known to be effective, but with modest results. Although simvastatin has been reported to be effective for immunorelated dermatologic disorders including vitiligo, controlled trials are lacking. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of topical <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> 0. 1 % cream (as a standard method of treatment for vitiligo) versus a combination of <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> plus oral simvastatin in the treatment of vitiligo. Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight subjects with symmetric vitiligo who had body surface involvement up to 20 % were divided randomly into two groups. Group A were treated with <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> 01 % cream twice daily and Group B with <b>betamethasone</b> <b>valerate</b> 01 % cream twice daily and oral simvastatin 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Finally, 46 patients completed treatment after 12 weeks in both groups. The results were evaluated by a blind dermatologist using Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) score at baseline, 4 th, 8 th, and 12 th week of treatment. In a similar way, subjective assessment performed by patients based on photo evaluation {{at the end of the}} study. Results: Despite a continuous reduction in VASI score in both groups, according to both physician (P = 0. 13) and patient (P = 0. 374) assessment oral simvastatin was not statistically more effective than conventional treatment of vitiligo. Conclusion: This study indicates that oral simvastatin is not associated with significant impacts in the treatment of vitiligo as compared to other inflammatory dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis.
