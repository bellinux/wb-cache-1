5000|$|Over the years, as Foster's film {{experience}} in Hollywood grew, producers and directors gained increasing {{respect for his}} ability to play an array of characters, ranging from the [...] "snarling family‐deserting criminal" [...] in The People's Enemy in 1935 to the soft-spoken, fatherly chaplain on the Pacific battlefront in the 1943 film Guadalcanal Diary. [...] Once, when asked if he ever regretted performing in villainous roles, Foster gave some insight into his family's reaction to them: I don't, but my mother does. Every time I do a part like The People's Enemy, she writes, ‘It was a nice picture, Preston, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to play roles like that?’ ...|$|E

[...] "Sullivan had to fend off his hard-won sponsor, Ford's Lincoln dealers, after kissing Pearl Bailey on the cheek and daring to shake Nat King Cole's hand," [...] Nachman wrote. [...] According to biographer Jerry Bowles, [...] "Sullivan once had a Ford executive thrown out of the theatre when he suggested that Sullivan stop booking so many black acts. And a dealer in Cleveland told him 'We realize that you got to have niggers on your show. <b>But</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put your arm around Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson {{at the end of his}} dance?' Sullivan had to be physically restrained from beating the man to a pulp." [...] Sullivan later raised money to help pay for Robinson's funeral. [...] “As a Catholic, it was inevitable that I would despise intolerance, because Catholics suffered more than their share of it," [...] he told an interviewer. [...] "As I grew up, the causes of minorities were part and parcel of me. Negroes and Jews were the minority causes closest at hand. I need no urging to take a plunge in and help.” ...|$|E

40|$|When {{touring the}} {{highlands}} {{with a new}} theatrical production {{the director of a}} famous Scottish theatre company was reputedly asked by a petrol pump attendant the significance of the 7 : 84 ratio displayed on a poster adhered to the vehicle. He politely explained that it represented the imbalance of wealth distribution in Britain. The attendant admiring the Director's new car retorted [...] . 'fair enough, <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to flaunt it?' When it comes to land ownership in the UK the 7 : 84 ratio represents something akin to communism, with only 0. 6 % of the UK population owning 100 % of the land. A remarkable proportion of this tiny percentage is made up of families who arrived in Britain some time ago. The Duke of Westminster who owns Belgravia (and another 140 000 acres) can trace his roots back to Hugh de Gras Venuer who seized these considerable tracts of land - circa 1066 - in 'negotiations' that did not require the input or exorbitant fees now demanded by the legal profession...|$|E
40|$|Narrator: A teacher {{approaches}} a man after an educational conference. She {{has a large}} bag of materials on one arm that she {{picked up at the}} vendor stands. She is excited to meet Dr. Timothy Rasinski, a literacy researcher and leader. Teacher: Dr. Rasinski, I was wondering if I could ask you a question. My students seem to be having some issues with fluency. Their automaticity, when reading a text, is lacking. I can tell that many of them have a rather limited sight word vocabulary and struggle with prosody and expression. I know about how fluency and comprehension walk hand-in-hand. I'm just {{not sure what to do}} now. Dr. Rasinski: You make a good point here about the connection between comprehension and fluency. Fluency, the ability for readers to read quickly, effortlessly, and efficiently with good expression is a key component of effective literacy instruction. Teacher: Yes, I agree. I see the link every day with my students. Sadly, sometimes, I see my students struggle with comprehension due to lack of fluency. We do paired readings and repeated readings to build fluency. These do help <b>but</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any other suggestions that might be more fun and exciting? Dr. Rasinski: Why, yes! I think you might consider trying Reader’s Theater. It’s an authentic and entertaining activity that helps students improve their word recognition, fluency, and comprehension. Teacher: I don't know if this is for me. I don’t have a great deal of time to put on a theatrical play with props and costumes. Dr. Rasinski: That’s the great part about Reader's Theater! It requires no props, costumes, or scenery unless the teacher and students want to include them. Teacher: This sounds great. What are the steps? Dr. Rasinski: Let me share with you how this strategy works...|$|E
