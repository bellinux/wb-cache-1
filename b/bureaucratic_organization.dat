5|$|In {{consolidating}} his power, Muhammad Ali, {{the rebel}} governor of Ottoman Egypt, was modeling his {{rule on the}} <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organization</b> characteristic of modern European states. Like earlier rulers of Egypt, Muhammad Ali desired to exercise control over greater Syria (Bilad al-Sham), both for its strategic value and for its natural resources. In addition to its abundant natural resources, Syria also had a prospering international trading community with well-developed markets. In addition, in Ali's strategy, Syria {{would serve as a}} captive market for goods being produced in Egypt. Moreover, the extension of Egyptian control over Syria was sought because it would serve as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. Ali was attempting to become independent of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organization</b> has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people it has to go through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E
50|$|Bureaucratic inertia is the {{inevitable}} tendency of <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organizations</b> {{to perpetuate the}} established procedures and modes, {{even if they are}} counterproductive and/or diametrically opposed to established organizational goals. This unchecked growth may continue independently of the organization's success or failure. Through <b>bureaucratic</b> inertia, <b>organizations</b> tend to take on {{a life of their own}} beyond their formal objectives.|$|R
50|$|Adhocracy is {{characterized}} by an adaptive, creative and flexible integrative behavior based on non-permanence and spontaneity.

They believe that by referring to the notion of the learning organization it was possible to make change less threatening and more acceptable to participants. 'However, individual and collective learning, which has undoubtedly taken place, has not really been connected to organizational change and transformation'. Part of the issue, they suggest, has to do with the concept of the learning organization itself. They argue that the concept of the learning organization: ...|$|E
2500|$|After being {{defeated}} repeatedly by Western {{nations in}} the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology {{as part of the}} Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communist victory in 1949 science and technology research was organized based on the model of the Soviet Union. It was characterized by a <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organization</b> led by non-scientists, research according to the goals of central plans, separation of research from production, specialized research institutes, concentration on practical applications, and restrictions on information flows. Researchers should work as collectives for society rather than as individuals seeking recognition. Many studied in the Soviet Union which also transferred technology. The Cultural revolution, which sought to remove perceived [...] "bourgeois" [...] influences and attitudes, caused large negative effects and disruptions. Among other measures it saw the scientific community and formal education attacked, intellectuals were sent to do manual labor, universities and academic journals were closed, most research ceased, and for nearly a decade China trained no new scientists and engineers.|$|E
40|$|Most {{contemporary}} scholars regard bureaucracy as an inefficient phenomenon. At {{the same}} time, {{we may find}} {{a great number of}} <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organizations</b> in the various social spheres. Max Weber, who introduced the concept of bureaucracy into the social sciences, however, was convinced that bureaucracy is superior to any other organizational form and explained its prevalence by the immanent rationality of <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organizations.</b> In analyzing Weber’s text, the author argues that Weber was mistranslated into English and then misinter-preted. Weber’s term rationality is not at all identical to efficiency. Rationality includes also uncertainty reduction regarding internal organizational procedures as well as outputs. Un-certainty reduction may induce several advantages, which, in several cases, ensure organi-zational superiority...|$|R

The Commission and its staff are to enjoy diplomatic privileges, and its salaries are to be paid by Germany, who will, however, have no voice in fixing them, If the Commission is to discharge adequately its numerous functions, it will be necessary for it to establish a vast polyglot <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organization,</b> with a staff of hundreds.

40|$|Some feminist {{writings}} {{have claimed}} that ‘bureaucracy’ is inherently ‘patriarchal’. This paper challenges this argument by comparing the experience of women in Ireland in a state sector organization and in a cluster of software firms. While the bureaucratic state company has been reformed to incorporate equal opportunities, in the individualised or ‘marketized’ software companies women’s progress is at the whim of individual managers and motherhood and a career are largely incompatible. If <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organizations</b> can be reformed in this way, it cannot be claimed {{that there is any}} inherent link between bureaucracy and patriarchy. Instead organizations can be either bureaucratic or marketized, and either patriarchal or woman-friendly. These are two separate dimensions which change independently of each other. On this basis the paper suggests that the contemporary ‘remasculinization’ of management occurs because earlier reforms in <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>organizations</b> are now being eroded. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that small firms are a key source of growth, employment and innovation in modern economies.

30|$|Towards the 1980 decade {{survival}} {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SME), as a relevant part of economy, was still in debate.
