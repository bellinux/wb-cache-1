50|$|The {{downside}} to the <b>beam-type</b> system of navigation {{is that the}} beams cannot be focused perfectly and in practice are fan shaped, growing wider with increasing distance from the broadcaster.

50|$|In principle, the {{electromagnetic}} field mainly {{depends on the}} shape of the mass analyzers. As a result, a smaller magnet fitting with small size MS reduces the system weight significantly. In practice, when reducing the size, the geometries of mass analyzer are distorted. For example, smaller volume in ion trap leads to lower trapping capacity and therefore results in a loss of resolution and sensitivity. However, by operating tandem MS which is capable to give the structural information of the sample from a complex mixture, resolution and selectivity are greatly enhanced. In general, <b>beam-type</b> mass analyzers, such as TOF and sector mass analyzers, are much larger than ion trap type such as Paul trap, Penning trap or Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). Additionally, ion trap mass analyzers can be used to perform multistage MS/MS in a single device. As a result, ion traps are received dominant attention for building a MMS.|$|E

The Chief himself taunts the Resistance, having made his home all but invincible {{with the force of}} the Blue Teardrop Gem. With no other options, Sir Gareth decrees that the Blue Teardrop Gem must be destroyed (though the peace it brought was enjoyable, its use for war must be stopped)! The Gem proves incredibly hardy (as well as ferocious, as it fires magical beams with a mind of its own), but eventually shatters under enough pressure. The Gem's shattering leaves a black mark on the land, and likewise sends Ramhorn's rage straight through the roof. However, the Red Teardrop Gem still stands (and proves as bad-tempered as its blue counterpart), forcing Gareth to break this one as well. With the aid of a new <b>beam-type</b> weapon (created from the shards of the Blue Teardrop Gem), the battle ends swiftly. Another beam weapon is gained from the second Gem and, for a moment, victory seems within reach. The only real obstacle is Ramhorn's fortress, which possesses a strange means of defense—crazed turkeys. Despite this, the battle seems won.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A unified {{approach}} is proposed {{to evaluate the}} compliance and energy release rate (ERR) of generic <b>beam-type</b> interface fracture specimens. Based on a sub-layer Timoshenko beam theory, the classic composite (rigid joint), shear deform-able (semi-rigid joint), and interface deformable (flexible joint) bi-layer beam models are revisited, from which the compliance and ERR of the generic <b>beam-type</b> fracture specimens are determined. According to specific combinations of loading conditions and material properties of each sub-layer, the generic fracture specimens are reduced to the conventional fracture specimens for actual applications. The effects of the crack tip deformation on the ERR of the interface crack are compared among the three different joint models, from which the evolving accuracy of the joint models to the ERR predictions of <b>beam-type</b> fracture specimens is manifested. The derived explicit formulas and improved solution for the compliance and ERR of the common <b>beam-type</b> fracture specimens can be effectively used to reduce data in interface fracture experiments and increase accuracy of fracture toughness evaluation of dissimilar material interfaces.

Within these applications, pipelines normally span hundreds of meters {{and are thus}} analysed using <b>beam-type</b> onedimensional finite elements when the global behaviour of the pipeline is sought at a reasonably low computational cost. Standard <b>beam-type</b> elements, while computationally economic, {{are based on the}} assumption of rigid cross-section. Thus, they are unable to capture the effects of cross-sectional localized deformations. Such effects can be captured through shell-type finite element models. For long pipelines, shell models become prohibitively expensive. Within this context, the present study formulates an efficient numerical modelling technique which effectively combines the efficiency of <b>beam-type</b> solutions while retaining the accuracy of shell-type solutions. An appealing feature of the model is that it is able to split the global analysis based on simple <b>beam-type</b> elements from the local analysis based on shell-type elements. This is achieved through a domain-decomposition procedure {{within the framework of the}} bridging multi-scale method of analysis. Solutions based on the present model are compared to those based on full shell-type analysis. The comparison demonstrates the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method...|$|E

To reduce the takt time and increase productivity, accurate position control becomes increasingly important as {{the size of the}} substrate increases. However, the vibration caused by the flexible forks in <b>beam-type</b> robots interferes with accurate positioning, which results in long takt times in the manufacturing process. To minimize the vibration and transport substrates on the fork as fast as possible, the trajectories should be prevented from exciting the flexible modes of the forks. For this purpose, a fifth-order polynomial trajectory generator and input shaping were incorporated into the controller of the <b>beam-type</b> robot in this study. The flexible modes of the forks were identified by measuring the frequency response function (FRF), and the input shaping was designed so as not to excite the flexible modes.

40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to conduct}} a comprehensive investigation on the design optimization for passive and semi-active vibration suppression of <b>beam-type</b> structures utilizing the Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) and Semi-Active Mass Damper (SAMD) to prevent discomfort, damage or outright structural failure through dissipating the vibratory energy effectively. The finite element model for general curved beams with variable curvatures under different assumptions (including/excluding {{the effects of the}} axial extensibility, shear deformation and rotary inertia) are developed and then utilized to solve the governing differential equations of motion for <b>beam-type</b> structures with the attached TMD system. The developed equations of motion in finite element form are then solved through the random vibration state-space analysis method to effectively find the variance of response under stationary random loading. A hybrid optimization methodology, which combines the global optimization method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the powerful local optimization method based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), is developed and then utilized to find the optimal design parameters (damping, stiffness and position) of the attached single and multiple TMD systems. Based on the extensive numerical investigation, a design framework for vibration suppression of <b>beam-type</b> structures using TMD technology is then presented. An in-house experimental set-up is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed optimal design approach for vibration suppression of <b>beam-type</b> structures using TMD technology. Next, the Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid damper is utilized to design the SAMD system. A new hysteresis model based on the LuGre friction model is developed to analyze the dynamic behavior of large-scale MR-damper (MR- 9000 type) accurately and efficiently. The gradient based optimization technique and least square estimation method have been utilized to identify the characteristic parameters of MR-damper. Moreover, based on the developed hysteresis model, an effective inverse MR-damper model has also been proposed, which can be readily used in the design of semi-active vibration suppression devices. The controller for SAMD system using MR-damper is designed based on the proposed inverse MR-damper model and H 2 /LQG controller design methodology. The developed SAMD system along with the MR-damper model is then implemented to <b>beam-type</b> structures to suppress the vibration. It has been shown that the designed SAMD system using MR-damper can effectively suppress the vibration in a robust and fail-safe manner...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} the pull-in {{behavior}} of non-linear microelectromechanical coupled systems. The generalized differential quadrature method {{has been used as}} a high-order approximation to discretize the governing nonlinear integro-differential equation, yielding more accurate results with a considerably smaller number of grid points. Various electrostati-cally actuated microstructures such as cantilever <b>beam-type</b> and fixed–fixed <b>beam-type</b> microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches are studied. The proposed models capture the following effects: 1) the intrinsic residual stress from fabrication processes; 2) the fringing effects of the electrical field; and 3) the nonlinear stiffening or axial stress due to beam stretching. The effects of important parameters on the mechanical performance have been studied in detail. These results are expected to be useful in the optimum design of MEMS switches or other actuators. Further, the results obtained are summarized and compared with other existing empirical and analytical models.
