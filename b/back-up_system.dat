40|$|Wind {{power in}} China has been {{experiencing}} substantial growths {{in the past}} decade. Accumulated generation capacity increased from 381. 2 MW in 2001 to 62, 364. 2 MW in 2011, which could increase to 200 GW and 1, 000 GW by 2020 and 2050, respectively. Despite the considerable growth in generation capacity and promises of a bright future, {{issues such as the}} power grid infrastructure and <b>back-up</b> <b>systems,</b> and life cycle environmental impacts of wind power development in China are largely overlooked. This thesis aims to investigate the capability of power grid infrastructure, the feasibility of <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> and the carbon dioxide and water implications of wind power in China. The research shows that (in Chapter 4) China’s power grid infrastructure is not capable of absorbing and transmitting wind-powered outputs. In addition, <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> are either geographically unavailable or financially infeasible. An analysis use the input-output based hybrid life cycle analysis to estimate the CO 2 emissions and water consumption of wind power in China (in Chapter 5). The results show that China’s wind energy consumes 0. 64 litre/kWh of water and produces 69. 9 grams/kWh of CO 2 emission, which could contribute a 23...|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} CSP {{is the ability}} to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5hours of thermal storage. With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and night. If the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant. Reliability can further be improved by installing a back-up combustion system. The <b>back-up</b> <b>system</b> can use most of the CSP plant, which decreases the cost of the <b>back-up</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|On October 1, 2010, Tesla {{issued a}} second product safety recall in the US {{affecting}} 439 Roadsters. The recall involved the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable from a redundant <b>back-up</b> <b>system.</b> The recall followed an incident where the low voltage auxiliary cable {{in a vehicle}} chafed {{against the edge of}} a carbon fiber panel, causing a short smoke and a possible fire behind the right front headlamp. This issue was limited to the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable and did not involve the main battery pack or main power system.|$|E
25|$|Technical divers may use diving {{equipment}} {{other than}} the usual single cylinder open circuit scuba equipment used by recreational divers. Typically, technical dives take longer than average recreational scuba dives. Because a decompression obligation prevents a diver in difficulty from surfacing immediately, {{there is a need}} for redundancy of breathing equipment. Technical divers usually carry at least two independent breathing gas sources, each with its own gas delivery system. In the event of a failure of one set, the second set is available as a <b>back-up</b> <b>system.</b> The backup system should allow the diver to safely return to the surface from any point of the planned dive, but may involve the intervention of other divers in the team. Stage cylinders may be dropped along the guideline for later use during the exit or for another dive.|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{design methodology}} for ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems has been developed, {{based on the}} evaluation of energy exchange and performance during the entire operational life. This novel procedure takes into account design solutions in which GSHPs are coupled with other heating and cooling technologies and finds the reciprocal optimal shares of thermal loads in terms of cost-benefit indicators. The proposed method is holistic; in other words, it incorporates in a single set of equations all the interactions among the three macro-systems governing the energy balance of GSHPs: building thermal energy loads, efficiencies of generators (heat pump and <b>back-up</b> <b>systems),</b> and thermal response of the ground (taking into account the sustainability of the source). The optimal design parameters and energetic and economic outputs of the procedure are: - thermal capacities of the heat pump and back-up generators; - size, number and position of ground heat exchangers; - flow rate in the ground-coupled loop; - load shares between GSHP and <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> (control strategy); - required energy input during multi-year operation; - energy savings {{with respect to the}} exclusive use of conventional <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> or, conversely, {{to the use of the}} sole geothermal system; - installation and operational costs; - key investment indicators. Guidelines to be followed by professionals for an effective design procedure in the case of ground-coupled vertical borehole heat exchangers (BHEs) are illustrated step-by step...|$|R

Skaggs immediately understood that the current plans left an unacceptable amount of time for the bombardiers to safely escape from the drop zone.

25|$|The factory was {{not well}} {{equipped}} to handle the gas created by the sudden addition of water to the MIC tank. The MIC tank alarms had not been working {{for four years and}} there was only one manual <b>back-up</b> <b>system,</b> compared to a four-stage system used in the United States. The flare tower and several vent gas scrubbers had been out of service for five months before the disaster. Only one gas scrubber was operating: it could not treat such a large amount of MIC with sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), which would have brought the concentration down to a safe level. The flare tower could only handle a quarter of the gas that leaked in 1984, and moreover it was out of order {{at the time of the}} incident. To reduce energy costs, the refrigeration system was idle. The MIC was kept at 20 degrees Celsius, not the 4.5 degrees advised by the manual. Even the steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was non-operational for unknown reasons. Slip-blind plates that would have prevented water from pipes being cleaned from leaking into the MIC tanks, had the valves been faulty, were not installed and their installation had been omitted from the cleaning checklist. As MIC is water-soluble, deluge guns were in place to contain escaping gases from the stack. The water pressure was too weak for the guns to spray high enough to reach the gas which would have reduced the concentration of escaping gas significantly. In addition to it, carbon steel valves were used at the factory, even though they were known to corrode when exposed to acid.|$|E

2500|$|Demand for {{hydraulic}} power {{began to fall}} in the 1930s, as electric power became more popular, but {{although the number of}} customers dropped, the supply pipes were extended until the system reached its maximum length of [...] in 1948. The Pott Street pumping station closed in 1939. By the 1960s, the motor converter set was 50 years old, and most of the pumps were older still. The effects of corrosion on high-pressure water mains were also a cause for concern. In 1964, a similar system in Glasgow, opened a year later than the Manchester system using water at [...] was switched off and some of its equipment was used to refit Whitworth Street station. The two centrifugal pumps and a converted steam pump were removed and replaced by two high-speed reciprocating pumps from Glasgow. Although not ideal for a diminishing network, because they were fixed speed devices, they provided a <b>back-up</b> <b>system</b> if there were problems at Water Street.|$|E

Control rods are inserted to stop the reactor, but without coolant the reactor temperature continues to rise rapidly. During an officers' review of emergency protocols, Polenin and Radtchenko learn that <b>back-up</b> coolant <b>systems</b> were not installed; without these, the protocols are useless, as {{they are based on}} the assumption that <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> are in place.

Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|R

Disadvantages of TBMs arise from their usually large size - the difficulty of transporting the large TBM {{to the site of}} tunnel construction, or (alternatively) the high cost of assembling the TBM on-site, often {{within the confines of the}} tunnel being constructed.|$|R
