40|$|Site: Arabian Sea, major {{region for}} {{container}} shipping <b>bulk</b> <b>breaking.</b> World trade {{is growing at}} a rate twice the world's economy. The assembly and customization of traded goods are increasingly decentralized around the globe. The frequency of their transportation and exchange is increasing. The phenomenon is of container freights, specifically: transshipment. Trans-shipment ports are no portals to cities, but are increasingly becoming autonomous global entities. The ports are mere switchboards, an exchange mechanism between ships. Transshipment is the fastest growing shipping market. Ships are getting bigger. Ports are expanding and dredging deeper, as they struggle today with overcapacity. New terminals are built, as economies of scale reach saturation in existing ports. The form of the global infrastructure is changing. In response, a new infrastructural move is necessary: a Megaport for transshipment. The Megaport is a transshipment port solely for ultra large containerships. It affords an economy for such transoceanic ships to remain in sea, and for local ports to be served through feeder ships. The Megaport is self-sufficient, autonomous and off-shore. In this colony of globalization, an infrastructural architecture is absolutely necessary. by Saud Anwar Sharaf. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|Widespread and {{increasing}} rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa {{has been of}} great concern to development community. Low use of inputs by farmers, due to market constraints that reduce profitability of input use, {{is one of the}} factors responsible for the gap between potential and actual yields. Using questionnaire, this study interviewed 130 agro-input dealers in Kenya to analyze challenges and opportunities in input delivery. Results indicate {{that there has been a}} steady annual growth (2 – 22 %, with mean of 16 %) in their number. Di-ammonium phosphate fertilizer (stocked by 92 % respondents) was most commonly stocked, followed by Calcium Ammonium Nitrate fertilizer (84 %), Urea (78 %), and NPK (40 %). Other services provided by agro-dealers are input information (75 % respondents), credit (13 %), <b>bulk</b> <b>breaking</b> (8 %), and spraying (4 %). Inputs selling price increased with distance to markets; long distances to market disconnect villages from input supply chain. High transport cost (53 %), low demand (30 %), lack of market information (21 %), lack of storage facilities (13 %), and limited business knowledge (12 %) were the most important constraints faced by agro-dealers. Policies and institutional frameworks suggested by dealers to streamline input trade were associated. The study concludes with suggestions on how to enhance efficiency of agro-dealers in input delivery. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
