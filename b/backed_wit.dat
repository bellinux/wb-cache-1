40|$|In this paper, a {{study of}} random times on {{filtered}} probability spaces is undertaken. The main message is that, as long as distributional properties of optional processes up to the random time are involved, there is no loss of generality in assuming that the random time is actually a randomised stopping time. This perspective has advantages in both the theoretical and practical study of optional processes up to random times. Applications are given to financial mathematics, {{as well as to}} the study of the stochastic behaviour of Brownian motion with drift up to its time of overall maximum as well as up to last-passage times over finite intervals. Furthermore, a novel proof of the Jeulin–Yor decomposition formula via Girsanov’s theorem is provided. Introduction. Consider a filtered measurable space (,F), where F = (Ft) t∈R+ is a right-continuous filtration, as well as an underlying sigma-algebra F over such that F ⊇ F ∞: = ∨t∈R+ Ft, where the last set-inclusion may be strict. A random time is a [0,∞]-valued, F-measurable random variable. The in-terplay between random times and the filtration F goes a long way <b>back,</b> <b>wit...</b>|$|R

This journal has two purposes: 1. To give WIT members an opportunity to write about and share their technical expertise, and 2. To provide a platform for WIT to display its technical talent. WIT members were asked to submit a one-page abstract describing the technology and their role in the development or application of the technology. The IT SIG Steering Committee reviewed the abstracts and selected them for inclusion in this journal. The abstract owners then elaborated on their technology in a paper, which comprises the content of this journal. Thanks to the following WIT members for their participation in this journal...|$|R

She {{referred to it as}} an upper-class comic and by increasing its influence and circulation made it an interesting enough operation for the then owner, Gary Bogard, to sell to the Publishers Condé Nast.

The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Beyoncé's deemed them as personal to her. Paul remarked, [...] "She's telling me about her fantasies and picturing me and her going here and there, all over the world... I'm answering <b>back,</b> like, 'I'm <b>wit</b> it'." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the toast–chorus–verse form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other verses and choruses. The pattern is repeated twice; a further chorus and verse follow, resolving at the toasting and final verse.|$|R
50|$|There {{were other}} satirists {{who worked in}} a less virulent way, who took a bemused pose and only made lighthearted fun. Tom Brown, Ned Ward, and Tom D'Urfey were all satirists in prose and poetry whose works {{appeared}} {{in the early part}} of the Augustan age. Tom Brown's most famous work in this vein was Amusements Serious and Comical, Calculated for the Meridian of London (1700). Ned Ward's most memorable work was The London Spy (1704 - 1706). The London Spy, before The Spectator, took up the position of an observer and uncomprehendingly reporting <b>back.</b> Tom D'Urfey's <b>Wit</b> and Mirth: or Pills to Purge Melancholy (1719) was another satire that attempted to offer entertainment, rather than a specific bit of political action, in the form of coarse and catchy songs.|$|R
6000|$|He spoke quite naturally, and {{lay down}} again, while I {{returned}} to my charge, thinking that this paroxysm was probably his last. But by another hour I perceived a hopeful change, for the tremor had subsided, the cold dew was gone, his breathing was more regular, and Sleep, the healer, had descended to save or take him gently away. Doctor Franck looked in at midnight, bade me keep all cool and quiet, and not fail to administer a certain draught {{as soon as the}} captain woke. Very much relieved, I laid my head on my arms, uncomfortably folded on the little table, and fancied I was about to perform one of the feats which practice renders possible,--"sleeping with one eye open," [...] as we say: a half-and-half doze, for all senses sleep but that of hearing; the faintest murmur, sigh, or motion will break it, and give one <b>back</b> one's <b>wits</b> much brightened by the permission to [...] "stand at ease." [...] On this night, the experiment was a failure, for previous vigils, confinement, and much care had rendered naps a dangerous indulgence, Having roused half a dozen times in an hour to find all quiet, I dropped my heavy head on my arms, and, drowsily resolving to look up again in fifteen minutes, fell fast asleep.|$|R

[...] Thereupon they tied the Cobbler's hands behind him, and led him off with a rope, as the farmer leads off the calf he hath brought from the fair. Robin stood looking after them, and when they were gone he laughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks; for he knew that no harm would befall the honest fellow, and he pictured to himself the Bishop's face when good Quince was brought before him as Robin Hood. Then, turning his steps once more to the eastward, he stepped out right foot {{foremost}} toward Nottinghamshire and Sherwood Forest.|$|R
60|$|In the lurid {{sheen of}} them {{she saw the}} lad leap from his rock and rush towards her. A flash fell and split a boulder not thirty paces from him, causing him to stagger, but he {{recovered}} himself and ran on. Now he was quite close, but the water was closer still. It was coming in tiers or ledges, a thin sheet of foam in front, then other layers laid upon it, each of them a few yards behind its fellow. On the top ledge, in its very crest, was a bull buffalo, dead, but held head on and down {{as though it were}} charging, and Rachel thought vaguely that from the direction in which it came in a few moments its horns would strike her. Another second and an arm was about her waist--she noted how white it was where the sleeve was rolled up, dead white in the lightning--and she was being dragged towards the shore that she had left. The first film of water struck her and nearly washed her from her feet, but she was strong and active, and the touch of that arm seemed to have given her <b>back</b> her <b>wit,</b> so she regained them and splashed forward. Now the next tier took them both above the knees, but for a moment shallowed so that they did not fall. The high bank was scarce five yards away, and the wall of waters perhaps a score.|$|R

50|$|Alexander Belyavsky {{was born}} in Moscow, to Boris Moiseyevich Belyavsky and his wife Lyubov Alexandrovna. He was the family's eldest child, with two younger siblings. After {{finishing}} school in 1949 he enrolled into the Geological research faculty of the Moscow's Gold and Non-ferrous metals Institute where he studied up until 1955, making frequent trips to the Central Asian Soviet republics for professional practice. After the graduation Belyavsky spent several years in Irkutsk, working for the East-Siberian Geological department. He made his debut as an actor at the Irkutsk Drama Theatre, playing Molchalin in Alexander Griboyedov's Woe from <b>Wit.</b> <b>Back</b> in Moscow Belyavsky continued working as a geology engineer, occasionally taking part in amateur theatrical productions staged by The Teachers' House. He decided then to quit his regular job, enrolled into the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute, and joined Vladimir Etush's class at the Vakhtangov Theatre. In summer 1957 Belyavsky made his debut on screen in Tales About Lenin (as a young worker Kolya). Three years later, still a student, he appeared in the Kiev Studio's film Save Our Souls (1960).|$|R
40|$|RECENT {{work has}} shown that {{numerous}} conditions other than diabetes mellitus are accompanied by hyperglycemia; the more significant of these conditions include obesity, liver damage, and hyperpituitarism. That this symptom appears in such diverse diseases is explicable {{by the fact that}} control of the blood sugar is determined not only by the level of insulin in the blood but by the state of the liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract {{as well as by the}} level of the pituitary-adrenal hormones. OBSERVATIONS While engaged in testing a modified insulin prepafation in a series of diabetic patients, the authors felt obliged to ascertain directly the severity and definiteness of the disease in each case. This was done by keeping the pa-tient on his regular hospital diet but withholding insulin for 24 to 48 hours. Blood sugars were run at- regular intervals (four to eight hours) and urine samples were checked for sugar and acetone every four hours. At the end of the experimental period the patients were brought <b>back</b> under control <b>wit...</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{laughed at}} {{himself as he}} lay on his pillow, {{thinking}} of this second cure which had been effected upon him. He did not care the least about Fanny now: he wondered how he ever should have cared: and according to his custom made an autopsy of that dead passion, and anatomised his own defunct sensation for his poor little nurse. What could have made him so hot and eager about her but a few weeks <b>back?</b> Not her <b>wit,</b> not her breeding, not her beauty--there were hundreds of women better-looking than she. It was out of himself that the passion had gone: it did not reside in her. She was the same; but the eyes which saw were changed; and, alas, that it should be so! were not particularly eager to see her any more. He felt very well disposed towards the little thing, and so forth, but as for violent personal regard, such as he had but a few weeks ago, it had fled {{under the influence of the}} pill and lancet, which had destroyed the fever in his frame. And an immense source of comfort and gratitude it was to Pendennis (though there was something selfish in that feeling, as in most others of our young man), that he had been enabled to resist temptation at the time when the danger was greatest, and had no particular cause of self-reproach as he remembered his conduct towards the young girl. As from a precipice down which he might have fallen, so from the fever from which he had recovered, he reviewed the Fanny Bolton snare, now that he had escaped out of it, but I'm not sure that he was not ashamed of the very satisfaction which he experienced. It is pleasant, perhaps, but it is humiliating to own that you love no more.|$|R
