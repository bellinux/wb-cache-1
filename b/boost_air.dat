30|$|Urban areas often {{suffer from}} {{so-called}} urban heat islands (UHIs), characterized by aridity, heat and lower wind strengths {{compared to the}} rural surroundings (Arnfield 2003). Typical physical legacies of mining activities such as wet areas affected by subsidence or dry, wind-exposed dumps can help to mitigate the impact of UHIs if such sites are made safe, free of pollution and planted with specific forms of vegetation to create valuable habitats. Climate-regulating ecosystem services are becoming ever more important to help counter the impact of climate change. In particular, water-logged ground as well as water bodies, which frequently emerge in former mining areas, can mitigate strong temperature differences or serve as pathways for the inflow of cold, fresh air from rural to urban areas. Also, the shift in airflows caused by dumps and hollows could <b>boost</b> <b>air</b> movement and thus balance the UHI.|$|E
40|$|A {{centrifugal}} compressor is a mechanical machine with purpose to convert kineticenergy from a rotating impeller wheel into the fluid medium by compressingit. One application involves supplying <b>boost</b> <b>air</b> pressure to downsized internalcombustion engines (ICE). This allows, {{for a given}} combustion chamber volume,more oxygen to the combustion process, which is key for an elevated energeticefficiency and reducing emissions. However, the {{centrifugal compressor}} is limitedat off-design operating conditions by the inception of flow instabilities causingrotating stall and/or surge. These instabilities appear at low flow rates andtypically leads to large vibrations and stress levels. Such instabilities affectthe operating life-time of the machine and are associated with significant noiselevels. The flow in centrifugal compressors is complex due {{to the presence of}} a widerange of temporal- and spatial-scales and flow instabilities. The success fromconverting basic technology into a working design depends on understandingthe flow instabilities at off-design operating conditions, which limit significantlythe performance of the compressor. Therefore, the thesis aims to elucidate theunderlying flow mechanisms leading to rotating stall and/or surge by means ofnumerical analysis. Such knowledge may allow improved centrifugal compressordesigns enabling them to operate more silent over a broader operating range. Centrifugal compressors may have complex shapes with a rotating partthat generate turbulent flow separation, shear-layers and wakes. These flowfeatures must be assessed if one wants to understand the interactions among theflow structures at different locations within the compressor. For high fidelityprediction of the complex flow field, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approachis employed, which enables capturing relevant flow-driven instabilities underoff-design conditions. The LES solution sensitivity to the grid resolution usedand to the time-step employed has been assessed. Available experimentaldata in terms of compressor performance parameters, time-averaged velocity,pressure data (time-averaged and spectra) were used for validation purposes. LES produces a substantial amount of temporal and spatial flow data. Thisnecessitates efficient post-processing and introduction of statistical averagingin order to extract useful information from the instantaneous chaotic data. Inthe thesis, flow mode decomposition techniques and statistical methods, suchas Fourier spectra analysis, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), ProperOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two-point correlations, respectively, areemployed. These methods allow quantifying large coherent flow structures atvfrequencies of interest. Among the main findings a dominant mode was foundassociated with surge, which is categorized as a filling and emptying processof the system as a whole. The computed LES data suggest that it is causedby substantial periodic oscillation of the impeller blade incidence flow angleleading to complete system flow reversal. The rotating stall flow mode occurringprior to surge and co-existing with it, was also captured. It shows rotating flowfeatures upstream of the impeller {{as well as in the}} diffuser.

Raising the country's infrastructure endowment to that of the region's middle-income countries (MICs) could boost annual growth by about 2. 7 {{percentage point}}s. Senegal has made significant progress in some areas of its infrastructure, including the transport, electricity, water, and information-and-communication-technology (ICT) sectors. But looking ahead, the country faces important infrastructure challenges, including improving road conditions, <b>boosting</b> <b>air</b> and rail traffic, updating electricity infrastructure, and boosting the pace of expansion of the water-and-sanitation network. Senegal currently spends around $ 911 million per year on infrastructure, with $ 312 million lost annually to inefficiencies. Comparing spending needs with existing spending and potential efficiency gains leaves an annual funding gap of $ 578 million per year. Senegal has the potential close this gap by bringing in more private-sector investment.

Jamieson {{returned for}} a second season and was joined by forwards Scott Dick and Brian Jokat and a young defenceman, Colin McHaffie from Ayr. Dick was soon replaced by Marc ‘Moose’ Damphousse and Jokat was then injured {{to be replaced by}} Michel Couvrette. The two French Canadians then went on a scoring spree for several glorious weeks before Couvrette was released due to attitude problems, Dick returning briefly before Jokat’s injury healed. By now, Damphousse was suffering from a groin injury and after rescuing Metros from an embarrassing home defeat to Sunderland with eight goals and three assists, most coming in a memorable final period, Moose too was gone to be replaced by Darren Treloar. Soon after, there was an infamous home game with Telford Tigers. Metros had pulled themselves back into the match at 5-6 before Chuck Taylor started a fight after Jokat had gone in on goal. It seemed that Telford targeted our imports and after Jokat and Treloar as well as McHaffie and Tony Harcourt had departed along with Taylor and lesser Tigers, Telford finished the match (now 3 on 3 with all the penalties) still with three imports and ran out easy 10-6 winners.|$|R

40|$|Gasoline {{partially}} premixed combustion (PPC) has {{the potential}} of high efficiency and simultaneous low soot and NOx emissions. Running the engine in PPC mode with high octane number fuels has the advantage of a longer premix period of fuel and air which reduces soot emissions. The problem is the ignitability at low load and idle operating conditions. In a previous study it was shown {{that it is possible to}} use NVO to improve combustion stability and combustion efficiency at operating conditions where available <b>boosted</b> <b>air</b> is assumed to be limited. NVO has the disadvantage of low net indicated efficiency due to heat losses from recompressions of the hot residual gases. An alternative to NVO is the rebreathing valve strategy where the exhaust valves are reopened during the intake stroke. The net indicated efficiency is expected to be higher with the rebreathing strategy but the question is if similar improvements in combustion stability can be achieved with rebreathing as with NVO. The results show that the rebreathing valve strategy has similar improvements on combustion stability as NVO when the same fuel injection strategy is used. This work also includes results with the NVO valve strategy where a fuel injection is added during the NVO. When a fuel injection is added during the NVO, an additional improvement on combustion stability can be seen which is unmatched by the rebreathing valve strategy...|$|R

A comprehensive transient and steady state, three-dimensional physical-mathematical model and computer program have been developed to predict the circulations and heat transfer in float glass melting furnaces. The submodels of the system model include combustion chamber, batch melting, glass circulation and heat transfer in the glass bath, waist cooler, electric <b>boosting,</b> <b>air</b> cooling in the working end and bottom steps. The governing conservation equations (PDEs) are solved numerically using the SIMPLER algorithm with properly specified boundary conditions. The irregularity of the geometry is handled.

The numerical results for the flow and temperature fields, glass quality related parameters, and particle trajectories have been computed and discussed. The effects of geometry, waist cooling, electric boosting, and stepped bottom of the tank have been examined and their effects on the thermal performance of the furnace are reported. ...|$|R
