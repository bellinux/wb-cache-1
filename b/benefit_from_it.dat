According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it,</b> so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E
5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew would pay the uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to use {{this as an opportunity to}} claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} through the Senate {{practically}} without a problem, but objections of the proposal increased {{by the time it}} reached the House of Representatives. It was generally held by critics that Hamilton was serving the interests of the Northeast by means of the bank, and those of the agrarian lifestyle would not <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> Among those critics was James Jackson of Georgia, who also attempted to refute the report by quoting from The Federalist Papers. Madison and Jefferson also opposed the bank bill. The potential of the capital not being moved to the Potomac if the bank was to have a firm establishment in Philadelphia (the current capital of the United States) was a more significant reason, and actions that Pennsylvania members of Congress took to keep the capital there made both men anxious.|$|E

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

She had also developed many methods for treating some serious illness. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, she returned home to Toowoomba in 1951, where she died on 30 November 1952 at her home Straun in Toowoomba after four days in a coma following a cerebral thrombosis. In a desperate attempt to save her life, Dr Irving Innerfield of New York sent his new experimental drug Trypsin by air mail, with the plane delayed so the drug package could be boarded, to Brisbane, where over 500 people waited for its arrival, after which it was then rushed by car to Toowoomba. Although the drug was administered on 29 November 1952, her doctor believed Kenny was too close to death to <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it,</b> and she died the following day.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, while filming for the show, the CBSA {{conducted}} {{a raid on}} a construction site in Vancouver. They arrested a Mexican national, Oscar Mata Duran, and brought him to an immigration detention centre where he was presented with a filming consent form. Canada's Privacy Commissioner, following a complaint from the man, investigated. The Commissioner found that the CBSA breached Canada's Privacy Act by filming their interaction with Duran before he was advised {{of the purposes of}} filming and found that the coercive nature of being detained in a holding facility would have prevented Duran from providing informed consent for his appearance. The Commissioner lauded Duran as a real hero for lodging the privacy complaint even though he would not personally <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> Duran was deported following the raid. In light of Duran's complaint the Privacy Commissioner recommended that the CBSA end its participation in the show, the CBSA announced that the show would not return for a fourth season.|$|E
500|$|Evidence for the {{evolution}} of [...] "snap-traps" [...] of Dionaea and Aldrovanda from a flypaper trap like D.regia has also emerged and been argued for based on molecular data. The molecular and physiological data implies that the Venus flytrap (Dionaea) and Aldrovanda snap-traps evolved from the flypaper traps of a common ancestor with the Drosera; the living evidence of a link between Drosera and Dionaea is D.regia and its remnant characteristics. In this evolutionary model, pre-adaptations to evolution into snap-traps were identified in several species of Drosera, such as rapid leaf and tentacle movement. The model proposes that plant carnivory by snap-trap evolved from the flypaper traps of Drosera, driven by increasing prey size. Larger prey can easily escape the sticky mucilage of flypaper traps; {{the evolution}} of snap-traps would largely prevent escape and kleptoparasitism (theft of prey captured by the plant before it can derive any <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it).</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{the later}} 1950s an issue arose which {{tarnished}} the reputations of both Braddocks {{in the eyes}} of much of Liverpool's Welsh community and the people of Wales. In 1955 Liverpool council applied for the compulsory purchase of land in the Tryweryn Valley, Merionethshire, North Wales, {{for the construction of a}} reservoir to serve Liverpool's increasing needs for water—some 65 million gallons a day. The proposal would mean the flooding of the small village of Capel Celyn, and several farms. On 7November a deputation led by the Plaid Cymru president Gwynfor Evans sought to address the council in a plea for a change in policy. According to Bessie's biographer Ben Rees, while Evans was speaking, Bessie banged on the table and joined other councillors in insulting Evans and demanding that he [...] "go back to Wales". In July 1957, when the enabling legislation reached its second House of Commons reading, Bessie described the scheme as regional rather than local, and claimed that some parts of Wales would <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> The land to be flooded in the Tryweryn Valley was not, she said, of high agricultural value, and [...] "nothing was done that was not agreed to by the tenants in the area". The bill became law, and construction began in 1959, but protests and demonstrations continued until the reservoir's opening in 1965. The slogan Cofio Treweryn ("I Remember [...] Tryweryn") was coined by nationalists, says Rees, as [...] "a reminder of Liverpool's greed and lack of sensitivity". In October 2015, on the 50th anniversary of the reservoir's completion, protestors demonstrated around the statue of Bessie at Liverpool's Lime Street Station.|$|E
