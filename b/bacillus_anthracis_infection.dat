Treatment regimens directed against such pathogens can be identified only by using data derived from in vitro and animal studies. It is crucial that these studies reliably predict the efficacy of proposed treatments in humans. The objective of this study was to identify a levofloxacin treatment regimen that will serve as an effective therapy for <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infections</b> and postexposure prophylaxis. An in vitro hollow-fiber infection model that replicates the pharmacokinetic profile of levofloxacin observed in humans (half-life [t 1 / 2], 7. 5 h) or in animals, such as the mouse or the rhesus monkey (t 1 / 2, ∼ 2 h), was used to evaluate a proposed indication for levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) for the treatment of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infections.</b> The results obtained with the in vitro model served as the basis for the doses and the dose schedules that were evaluated in the mouse inhalational anthrax model. The effects of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin treatment were compared to those of no treatment (untreated controls). The main outcome measure in the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model was a persistent reduction of culture density (≥ 4 log 10 reduction) and prevention of the emergence of levofloxacin-resistant organisms. In the mouse inhalational anthrax model the main outcome measure was survival. The results indicated that levofloxacin given once daily with simulated human pharmacokinetics effectively sterilized <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> cultures. By using a simulated animal pharmacokinetic profile, a once-daily dosing regimen that provided a human-equivalent exposure failed to sterilize the cultures. Dosing regimens that “partially humanized” levofloxacin exposures within the constraints of animal pharmacokinetics reproduced the antimicrobial efficacy seen with human pharmacokinetics. In a mouse inhalational anthrax model, once-daily dosing was significantly inferior (survival end point) to regimens of dosing every 12 h or every 6 h with identical total daily levofloxacin doses. These results demonstrate the predictive value of the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model with respect to the success or the failure of treatment regimens in animals. Furthermore, the model permits the evaluation of treatment regimens that “humanize” antibiotic exposures in animal models, enhancing the confidence with which animal models may be used to reliably predict the efficacies of proposed antibiotic treatments in humans in situations (e. g., the release of pathogens as agents of bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases) where human trials cannot be performed.

Methods: Solvent extracts were prepared using various high antioxidant Australian fruits and herbs and investigated by disc diffusion assay for the ability to inhibit the growth of an environmental strain of B. anthracis. Their MIC values were determined to quantify and compare their efficacies. Toxicity was determined using the Artemia franciscana nauplii bioassay. The most potent extracts were analysed by non-targeted HPLC-QTOF mass spectroscopy (with screening against 3 compound databases) for the identification and characterisation of individual components in crude plant extracts. Results: Methanolic and aqueous extracts of several high antioxidant plant extract sdisplayed potent antibacterial activity in the disc diffusion assay against B. anthracis.

30|$|The {{responses}} of macrophages to <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection</b> {{are important for}} the survival of the host, since macrophages are required for the germination of B. anthracis spores in lymph nodes, and macrophage death exacerbates anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx)-induced organ collapse. To elucidate the mechanism of macrophage cell death induced by LeTx, we performed a genetic screen to search for genes associated with LeTx-induced macrophage cell death. RAW 264.7 cells, a macrophage-like cell line sensitive to LeTx-induced death, were randomly mutated and LeTx-resistant mutant clones were selected. AMP deaminase 3 (AMPD 3), an enzyme that converts AMP to IMP, was identified to be mutated in one of the resistant clones. The requirement of AMPD 3 in LeTxinduced cell death of RAW 264.7 cells was confirmed by the restoration of LeTx sensitivity with ectopic reconstitution of AMPD 3 expression. AMPD 3 deficiency does not affect LeTx entering cells and the cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) by lethal factor inside cells, but does impair an unknown downstream event that is linked to cell death. Our data provides new information regarding LeTx-induced macrophage death and suggests that there is a key regulatory site downstream of or parallel to MKK cleavage that controls the cell death in LeTx-treated macrophages.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against anthrax protective antigen (PA), an anthrax exotoxin component, to modulate exotoxin cytotoxic activity on target macrophage cell lines. Anthrax PA plays {{a critical role in}} the pathogenesis of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection.</b> PA is the cell-binding component of the two anthrax exotoxins: lethal toxin (LeTx) and edema toxin. Several MAbs that bind the PA component of LeTx are known to neutralize LeTx-mediated killing of target macrophages. Here we describe for the first time an overlooked population of anti-PA MAbs that, in contrast, function to increase the potency of LeTx against murine macrophage cell lines. The results support a possible mechanism of enhancement: binding of MAb to PA on the macrophage cell surface stabilizes the PA by interaction of MAb with macrophage Fcγ receptors. This results in an increase in the amount of PA bound to the cell surface, which in turn leads to an enhancement in cell killing, most likely due to increased internalization of LF. Blocking of PA-receptor binding eliminates enhancement by MAb, demonstrating the importance of this step for the observed enhancement. The additional significance of these results is that, at least in mice, immunization with PA appears to elicit a poly-clonal response that has a significant prevalence of MAbs that enhance LeTx-mediated killing in macrophages...|$|E

To determine the mechanism by which MyD 88 protects against B. anthracis infection, knockout mice were challenged with nonencapsulated, toxigenic B. anthracis or with anthrax toxins. MyD 88 -deficient mice had increased susceptibility to B. anthracis and anthrax lethal toxin but not to edema toxin. Lethal toxin alone induced marked multifocal intestinal ulcers in the knockout animals, compromising the intestinal epithelial barrier. The resulting enteric bacterial leakage in the knockout animals led to peritonitis and septicemia. Focal ulcers and erosion were also found in MyD 88 -heterozygous control mice but with far lower incidence and severity. B. anthracis infection also induced a similar enteric bacterial septicemia in MyD 88 -deficient mice but not in heterozygous controls. We show that lethal toxin and B. anthracis challenge induce bacteremia {{as a result of}} intestinal damage in MyD 88 -deficient mice. These results suggest that loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier and enteric bacterial septicemia may contribute to sensitizing MyD 88 -deficient mice to B. anthracis and that MyD 88 plays a protective role against lethal toxin-induced impairment of intestinal barrier.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Major {{symptoms}} and death from systemic <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infections</b> are {{mediated by the}} action of the pathogen's lethal toxin on host macrophages. High levels of the toxin are cytolytic to macrophages, whereas low levels stimulate these cells to produce cytokines (interleukin- 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which induce systemic shock and death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were performed to assess the possibility that the oxidative burst may be involved in one or both of lethal toxin's effects on macrophages. Toximediated cell lysis, superoxide anion and cytokine production were measured. Effects of antioxidants and macrophage mutations were examined. RESULTS: RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages treated with high levels of toxin released large amounts of superoxide anion, beginning at about 1 hr, which correlates with the onset of cytolysis. Cytolysis could be blocked with various exogenous antioxidants or with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and methionine, which promote production of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione. Mutant murine macrophage lines deficient in production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) were relatively insensitive to the lytic effects of the toxin, whereas a line with increased oxidative burst potential showed elevated sensitivity. Also, cultured blood monocyte-derived macrophages from a patient with Chronic Granulomatous Disease, a disorder in which the phagocyte's oxidative burst is disabled, were totally resistant to toxin, in contrast to control monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that the cytolytic effect of the toxin is mediated by ROIs. Additionally, cytokine production and consequent pathologies showed partial dependence on macrophage ROIs. Antioxidants moderately inhibited toxin-induced cytokine production in vitro, and BALB/c mice pretreated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine or mepacrine showed partial protection against lethal toxin. Thus ROIs are involved in both the cytolytic action of anthrax lethal toxin and the overall pathologic process in vivo...|$|R

Histologically, the hairless and haired HRS/J mice showed markedly reduced numbers of organisms in hair follicles and the interfollicular dermis when compared even with the resistant Balb/c mice; inflammatory cell infiltrates in the superficial dermis were increased in the HRS/J mice compared with more sensitive strains. Therefore, resistance in the HRS/J mice was apparent at the initial site of epicutaneous inoculation and seemed related to an accumulation of dermal neutrophils rather than to a lack of functional hair follicles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnthrax toxin is a {{tripartite}} virulence factor {{produced by}} <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> during <b>infection.</b> Under acidic endosomal pH conditions, the toxin's protective antigen (PA) component forms a transmembrane channel in host cells. The PA channel then translocates its two enzyme components, lethal factor and edema factor, into the host cytosol under the {{proton motive force}}. Protein translocation under a proton motive force is catalyzed {{by a series of}} nonspecific polypeptide binding sites, called clamps. A 10 -residue guest/host peptide model system, KKKKKXXSXX, was used to functionally probe polypeptide-clamp interactions within wild-type PA channels. The guest residues were Thr, Ala, Leu, Phe, Tyr, and Trp. In steady-state translocation experiments, the channel blocked most tightly with peptides that had increasing amounts of nonpolar surface area. Cooperative peptide binding was observed in the Trp-containing peptide sequence but not the other tested sequences. Trp substitutions into a flexible, uncharged linker between the lethal factor amino-terminal domain and diphtheria toxin A chain expedited translocation. Therefore, peptide-clamp sites in translocase channels can sense large steric features (like tryptophan) in peptides, and while these steric interactions may make a peptide translocate poorly, in the context of folded domains, they can make the protein translocate more rapidly presumably via a hydrophobic steric ratchet mechanism...|$|R

Using the spleen as an indicator for host response, we found that intravenous inoculation of LT-deficient mutants into C 57 BL/ 6 mice significantly increased production of several cytokines over that observed after infection with the parent strain or an EF-deficient mutant. Bacteria producing one or both of the toxins were capable of inducing significant apoptosis of cells present in spleens, whereas apoptosis was greatly reduced in mice infected with nontoxigenic mutants. Mice infected with toxin-producing strains also showed increased splenic neutrophil recruitment compared to mice infected with nontoxigenic strains and neutrophil depletion prior to infection with toxin-producing strains, leading to decreased levels of apoptosis. Together, these studies indicate that anthrax LT suppresses cytokine secretion during infection, but both EF and LF play roles in inducing neutrophil recruitment and enhancing apoptosis. Interestingly, in the absence of LF the effect of EF-induced cell recruitment is further enhanced, perhaps because LF so effectively suppresses the secretion of chemokines...|$|E

We have recently shown that B. anthracis Sterne is capable of penetrating the BBB in vitro and in vivo, establishing the classic signs of meningitis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) tropism are not known. Here, we show that attachment to and invasion of human BMEC by B. anthracis Sterne is mediated by the pXO 1 plasmid and an encoded envelope factor, BslA. The results of studies using complementation analysis, recombinant BslA protein, and heterologous expression demonstrate that BslA is both necessary and sufficient to promote adherence to brain endothelium. Furthermore, mice injected with the BslA-deficient strain exhibited a signif-icant decrease in the frequency of brain infection compared to mice injected with the parental strain. In addition, BslA contributed to BBB breakdown by disrupting tight junction protein ZO- 1. Our results identify the pXO 1 -encoded BslA adhesin as a critical mediator of CNS entry and offer new insights into the patho...|$|R
40|$|The bipartite anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) {{consisting}} of protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF) {{is a major}} virulence factor contributing to death from systemic <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection.</b> The current vaccine elicits antibodies directed primarily to PA; however, in experimental settings serologic responses to LF can neutralize LeTx and contribute to protection against infection. The goals {{of the present study}} were to identify sequential B-cell epitopes of LF and to determine the capacity of these determinants to bind neutralizing antibodies. Sera of recombinant LF-immunized A/J mice exhibited high titers of immunoglobulin G anti-LF reactivity that neutralized LeTx in vitro 78 days after the final booster immunization and protected the mice from in vivo challenge with 3 50 % lethal doses of LeTx. These sera bound multiple discontinuous epitopes, and there were major clusters of reactivity on native LF. Strikingly, all three neutralizing, LF-specific monoclonal antibodies tested bound specific peptide sequences that coincided with sequential epitopes identified in polyclonal antisera from recombinant LF-immunized mice. This study confirms that LF induces high-titer protective antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the binding of short LF peptides by LF-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies suggests that generation of protective antibodies by peptide vaccination may be feasible for this antigen. This study paves the way for a more effective anthrax vaccine by identifying discontinuous peptide epitopes of LF...|$|E

To elucidate the mechanism of macrophage cell death induced by LeTx, we performed a genetic screen to search for genes associated with LeTx-induced macrophage cell death. RAW 264. 7 cells, a macrophage-like cell line sensitive to LeTx-induced death, were randomly mutated and LeTx-resistant mutant clones were selected. AMP deaminase 3 (AMPD 3), an enzyme that converts AMP to IMP, was identified to be mutated in one of the resistant clones. The requirement of AMPD 3 in LeTx-induced cell death of RAW 264. 7 cells was confirmed by the restoration of LeTx sensitivity with ectopic reconstitution of AMPD 3 expression. AMPD 3 deficiency does not affect LeTx entering cells and the cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) by lethal factor inside cells, but does impair an unknown downstream event that is linked to cell death. Our data provides new information regarding LeTx-induced macrophage death and suggests that there is a key regulatory site downstream of or parallel to MKK cleavage that controls the cell death in LeTx-treated macrophages...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the passive transfer of protective antigen (PA) -neutralizing antibodies can protect animals against <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection.</b> The standard protocol for the isolation of PA-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is based upon a primary selection of the highest PA-binders by ELISA, and usually yields only few candidates antibodies. We demonstrated that by applying a PA-neutralization functionality-based screen as the primary criterion for positive clones, it was possible to isolate more than 100 PA-neutralizing antibodies, some of which exhibited no measurable anti-PA titers in ELISA. Among the large panel of neutralizing antibodies identified, mAb 29 demonstrated the most potent activity, and was therefore chimerized. The variable region genes of the mAb 29 were fused to human constant region genes, to form the chimeric 29 antibody (cAb 29). Guinea pigs were fully protected against infection by 40 LD 50 B. anthracis spores following two separate administrations with 10 mg/kg of cAb 29 : the first administration was given before the challenge, and a second dose was administered on day 4 following exposure. Moreover, animals that survived the challenge and developed endogenous PA-neutralizing antibodies with neutralizing titers above 100 were fully protected against repeat challenges with 40 LD 50 of B. anthracis spores. The data presented here emphasize the importance of toxin neutralization-based screens for the efficient isolation of protective antibodies that were probably overlooked in the standard screening protocol. The protective activity of the chimeric cAb 29 demonstrated in this study suggest that it may serve as an effectiv...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> has a {{potential}} for biological weapon or bioterorism. Attack of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> is very fatal, and the distribution is very easy and cheap through the spores. The aim of this was study to detect the spores of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis.</b> Methods: <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> isolates were grown on serum agar and then sheep blood medium, to stimulate capsule formation. Spores which formed painted using the method of Schaefer and Fultton. The methods of precipitation and immuno-chromatography were used to spores detection of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis.</b> Results: Painting with Schaeffer and Fulton method showed that spores of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> are green. Precipitation reaction between spores of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> with goat antibody anti anthrosa was resulting in a silver white color. Anthrosa of <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis</b> spores was detected by means of immuno-chromatography using goat antibody anti anthrosa. The molecular weight of anthrosa is ± 148 kDa.

40|$|International audienceAnthrax is {{an acute}} disease caused by <b>Bacillus</b> <b>anthracis.</b> Some animal species are {{relatively}} resistant to anthrax infection. This trait has been correlated {{to the extent}} of the local inflammatory reaction, suggesting innate immunity to be {{the first line of defense}} against B. <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection</b> in nonimmunized hosts. Group IIA secreted phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 -IIA) is produced in particular by macrophages and possesses potent antibacterial activity especially against Gram-positive bacteria. We have previously shown in vitro that sPLA 2 -IIA kills both germinated B. anthracis spores and encapsulated bacilli. Here we show that sPLA 2 -IIA plays in vivo a protective role against experimental anthrax. Transgenic mice expressing human sPLA 2 -IIA are resistant to B. <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection.</b> In addition, in vivo administration of recombinant human sPLA 2 -IIA protects mice against B. <b>anthracis</b> <b>infection.</b> The protective effect was observed both with a highly virulent encapsulated nontoxinogenic strain and a wild-type encapsulated toxinogenic strain, showing that toxemia did not hinder the sPLA 2 -IIA-afforded protection. sPLA 2 -IIA, a natural component of the immune system, may thus be considered a novel therapeutic agent to be used in adjunct with current therapy for treating anthrax. Its anthracidal activity would be effective even against strains resistant to multiple antibiotics...|$|R

A recombinant Protective Antigen (rPA) mutant and a trivalent vaccine (TV) composed by the rPA, a inactive mutant of Lethal Factor (mLF-Y 728 A; E 735 A) and a inactive mutant of Edema Factor (mEF-K 346 R), both emulsified with mineral oils, were evaluated for their immunogenicity and protective activity in New Zealand white rabbits. Rabbits vaccinated subcutaneously with rPA and TV rapidly produced high level of anti-PA, anti-LF and anti-EF antibodies, which were still present 6 months later. In {{the efficacy}} test, these vaccines protected 100 % of rabbits challenged with B. anthracis virulent strain 0843 {{one week after the}} vaccination.
