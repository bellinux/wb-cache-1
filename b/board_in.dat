Their closure coincided with that {{of a large number of}} coal mines in the North East of England, just after the privatisation of both the electricity industry and the National Coal <b>Board</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s.|$|E

Issues about <b>boards</b> <b>in</b> venture capital-backed technology based industrials are explored, and various research designs are used to meet different research questions. Empirical results indicate that venture capital firms purposefully use <b>boards</b> <b>in</b> the portfolio firm, and <b>boards</b> <b>in</b> venture capital-backed firms are more active than <b>boards</b> <b>in</b> other firms. The venture capitalist and the entrepreneur/owner-manager of the portfolio firm may have diverging expectations to <b>board</b> roles. <b>In</b> this setting the board becomes an interesting meeting place for studying the processes and the dynamics between external and internal stakeholders. Future research in this area should integrate board role theories and board process theories...|$|R
