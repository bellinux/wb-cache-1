By 1508 Leonardo was back in Milan, living in his own house in Porta Orientale in the parish of Santa Babila.|$|E

During this early period, he published a journal article in Nouvelles annales de mathématiques, discussing properties of the triangle.|$|E
5|$|Bozon {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> Philippe Bozon, was playing hockey with the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League.

Buffon later said {{that there had been}} an initial possibility for him to join Roma, but they signed Ivan Pelizzoli instead, and although negotiations were ongoing with Barcelona, he chose Juventus <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> convinced him he would be likely to achieve his ambition of winning the Scudetto. This transfer fee made Buffon Juventus's most expensive purchase ever, a record which was only broken in 2016 by the acquisition of Gonzalo Higuaín.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is}} likely that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and building his literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, {{lasted only a}} few nights, it {{was the start of}} his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E
5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal chemical warfare facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This {{had a profound effect on}} Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E

5|$|The {{remainder}} of Night describes Eliezer's efforts {{not to be}} parted from <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> not even {{to lose sight of}} him; his grief and shame at witnessing <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> existence threatens <b>his</b> own.

5|$|George Alan Vasey {{was born}} in Malvern East, Victoria on 29 March 1895, the third of six {{children}} of George Brinsden Vasey, a barrister and solicitor, and his wife Alice Isabel, née McCutcheon. <b>Because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was also George Vasey, George Alan Vasey's family always called him Alan. He was educated at Camberwell Grammar School and Wesley College, Melbourne, where his schoolmates included Robert Menzies and Edward James Milford. At Wesley, Vasey served in the Australian Army Cadets, in which he became a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|When Stephen {{attained}} the age {{of majority}} in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania. Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> transferred him to Styria in 1258. Styria had been annexed in 1254, but the local lords rose up in rebellion and expelled Béla IV's governor, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's appointment. Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels. In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring countiesVas and Zalain Hungary from his father. He launched a plundering raid in Carinthia {{in the spring of}} 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's support of the Styrian rebels.|$|E
5|$|Martin began curling {{when he was}} {{six years}} old. He took up the sport <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was the vice {{president}} of his local curling club. Martin first came on the curling scene in 1985 when his Alberta team of Richard Feeney, Dan Petryk and Michael Berger won the Canadian Junior Championships in their first year together as a team. The rink (a group of players) finished the round robin in second place, with a win-loss record of 7–4, behind Prince Edward Island's Kent Scales. This forced them into a semifinal against the third place Quebec rink, skipped by Steve Gagnon. They beat Quebec 5–4, earning a spot in the final against Prince Edward Island which they won with a score of 6–3. After winning the championship, he accompanied the Canadian team as an alternate at the 1985 World Junior Curling Championships.|$|E

5|$|Sánchez did {{not stay}} in the bullpen very long though. After Randy Johnson {{strained}} his shoulder, Sánchez was chosen to start against the San Diego Padres on July 10. In that game, Sánchez not only threw the first complete game and the first shutout of his career; he threw a no-hitter, becoming the first Giants' pitcher to do so since John Montefusco no-hit the Atlanta Braves in 1976. In the process, Sánchez struck out a new career high of eleven batters. Sánchez had a perfect game going into the eighth inning, but an error by Juan Uribe allowed the only baserunner of the night. Sánchez almost lost the no-hitter during the ninth inning when Edgar Gonzalez hit a ball deep to centerfield. However, Aaron Rowand made a spectacular catch, and Sánchez got his no-hitter. Sánchez's no-hitter was also special <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> Sigfredo, who had never seen his son start a major league game, was in attendance.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{internal}} {{tensions and}} economic deprivation in Russia continued to mount and revolutionary sympathies grew. After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside. On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, Tikhon of Zadonsk. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> was a commoner.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they could be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E
50|$|Bruno Pontecorvo, {{after he}} {{emigrated to the}} USSR, was known as Бруно Максимович Понтекорво (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian {{scientific}} community, <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> given name was Massimo (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). Pontecorvo's sons have been known by names Джиль Брунович Понтекорво (Jil' Brunovich Pontecorvo), Антонио Брунович Понтекорво (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and Тито Брунович Понтекорво (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).|$|R

However, {{he is the only}} son by <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> dynastic second wife, Baroness Vera Schäffer von Bernstein (1914-1994). Although he is his fathers's second son, Prince Konrad was heir to the headship of the House of Saxe-Meiningen <b>because</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> first {{marriage}} to commoner Margot Grössler was morganatic; and as such, his older half-brother, Prince Friedrich Ernst (1935-2004), did not have dynastic rights.|$|R
