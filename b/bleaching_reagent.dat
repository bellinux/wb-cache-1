40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{is widely}} used as an industrial bleaching agent, particularly for the bleaching of mechanical pulps. Under the alkaline conditions required for effective bleaching a number of transition metal ions, including iron, copper and manganese, catalytically decompose peroxide resulting in a loss in the concentration of active <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagent,</b> with a subsequent reduction in the bleaching efficiency. In this {{study the effects of}} transition metal ions on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide have been studied, both in the presence and absence of pulp. The influence of various additives, including sodium silicate and magnesium, on the rates of metal catalysed peroxide decomposition have also been studied. The results of studies of the stability of alkaline hydrogen peroxide solutions in the absence of pulp have demonstrated that the behaviour of transition metal ions towards decomposition depends on the hydrolysis species of the metal present. Changes in the rate of decomposition {{over the course of the}} reaction can be attributed to changes in the catalytically active species present. The addition of a number of additives to peroxide solutions containing added transition metal ions can also lead to changes in the observed catalytic activity, either accelerating the rate of decomposition or stabilizing the systems. In the presence of these additives a correlation was observed between the catalytic activity of the transition metals and the formation of transition metal-additive complexes, which could be monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy. This implies that a direct interaction between the metal ions and additives is responsible for the observed changes in the catalytic activity. It is proposed that the mechanism by which the additives operate is by the formation mixed hydrolysis species with the transition metal ions, with the resulting species having altered catalytic properties. Studies of the effects of metal catalysed decomposition in the presence of pulp were conducted using a P. radiata TMP. The addition of the desired metal ions to prechelated pulp enabled their catalytic activities to be determined individually. The effects of sodium silicate and magnesium on the rates of metal catalysed decomposition were also determined in the presence of pulp. Comparison of the behaviour of these systems in the presence and absence of pulp reveals that the inclusion of pulp can have a significant influence on the catalytic activities. These results demonstrate that it is not possible to predict the peroxide decomposition behaviour during bleaching from studies conducted in the absence of pulp...|$|E
30|$|Hexenuronic acid (HexA) is {{considered}} to cause the brightness reversion (yellowing) of pulp and increases the consumption of <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> [7 – 9]. HexA is an unsaturated molecule {{that contributes to the}} consumption of permanganate during the determination of the kappa number, which is proportional to the lignin content, and results in higher values during lignin determinations. It has been reported that the removal of HexA from TCF pulp affects the pulp properties [10].|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 a {{agreed with}} {{previous}} results for LOKP [8, 21] in which Psa was an effective reagent for reducing HexA. Next, the HexA contents of oxygen-bleached Ph-kraft pulps treated with Psa after ozone bleaching were examined. After ozone bleaching, the HexA {{content of the}} Psa-treated pulp was further reduced (Fig.  1 a, symbol filled triangle). HexA increases the consumption of <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> [7, 8]. Therefore, the reduction of HexA content would imply that Psa treatment {{has the potential to}} reduce ozone consumption in the next stage.|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of lignin with oxidants {{is of great}} importance in the bleaching of wood pulps, a process at present based largely on empirical rules. These <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> must be sufficiently mild to prevent degradation of the cellulose. Oxidants, like chlorine dioxide or alkaline hypochlorite, which have been found suitable for this purpose, offer a promising method of approach to problems concerning the structure of lignin in wood, since a limit {{to the amount of}} information obtainable by drastic oxidation appears to have been reached...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of totally chlorine-free (TCF) <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> to a heterogeneous wastepaper mixture consisting of unbleached krait pulp, with similar to 12 % mechanical pulp, (incoming Kappa number 63) was studied. The TCF bleaching sequence stages were: acid treatment, low consistency (LC) oxygen delignification, high consistency (HC) oxygen delignification and ozone bleaching, {{as well as}} in situ produced dimethyldioxirane and hydrogen peroxide bleaching. Ozone consumption was limited to less than 1. 3 % to achieve as high as possible brightness improvement without fibre damage. Results presented in this paper suggest that a selected TCF bleaching sequence applied to the LC oxygen pulped wastepaper furnish, without wash-deinking, can produce a colour stripped, high brightness pulp (82. 7 % ISO at an overall yield of 75 %), and showing only moderate colour reversion and tear index decrease...|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{delignification}} with laccase from Trametes villosa used {{in combination}} with chemical mediators (acetosyringone, acetovanillone and 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole) to improve the totally chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching of kenaf pulp was studied. The best final pulp properties were obtained by using an L-HBT-QPo sequence developed by incorporating a laccase-mediator stage into an industrial bleaching sequence involving chelation and peroxide stages. The new sequence resulted in increased kenaf pulp delignification (90. 4 %) and brightness (77. 2 %ISO) relative to a conventional TCF chemical sequence (74. 5 % delignification and 74. 5 % brightness). Also, the sequence provided bleached kenaf fibers with high cellulose content (pulp viscosity of 890 g. mL (1) vs 660 g. mL (1)). Scanning electron micrographs revealed that xylanase altered fiber surfaces and facilitated reagent access as a result. However, the LHBTX (xylanase) stage removed 21 % of hexenuronic acids in kenaf pulp. These recalcitrant compounds spent additional <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> and affected pulp properties after peroxide stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|In {{the oxygen}} {{delignification}} lignin {{is removed from}} the pulp by applying high pressure oxygen, under alkaline conditions, resulting in a lower demand for chemicals in bleaching. The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of washing (conventional and acid) between two stages of O 2 on the amount of residual lignin and transition metal present in samples of Pine Kraft pulp with 48. 5 initial kappa. The reduction of kappa number and pulp degradation after two stages of O 2 treatment with increase of final brightness on sheet produced were observed. The metal content of pulp during oxygen delignification was influenced by washing process, and the acid wash removed more percentage of metallic ions than conventional wash. The best results were obtained with the removal of the element manganese. The acid wash between two stages of delignification contributed to the control of transition metals, which optimize the use of <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> in the following steps. We concluded that the intermediate washing improves the performance of the oxygen delignification of high kappa number pulps performed in two stages...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the effect of treating eucalyptus pulp with various commercial xylanases to identify the most effective enzyme for use under the industrial bleaching conditions used at the Jacareí mill of the Brazilian firm Fibria, which include a high pH and temperature. Based on the results, the use {{of two of the}} nine enzymes studied reduced the kappa number by 1. 5 units, increased brightness by 2. 5 % ISO, and decreased hexenuronic acids (HexA) content by more than 10 μmol/g relative to a control treatment in the absence of enzyme. The most marked changes in brightness were observed on application of an oxidative D stage to enzyme-treated pulp samples. Finally, the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), color, and turbidity of the effluents obtained {{at the end of the}} processes involving the enzymes were all higher than in the control process. Application: The use of xylanases can raise productivity in mills with limited ability to produce chlorine dioxide, can potentially reduce <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> cost, and can increase the flexibility of the bleaching sequencePostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|In {{integrated}} factories of {{pulp and}} paper, the bleaching control {{is made by}} kappa number and/or brightness. However, the product paper is evaluated and valued for its whiteness. The level of final brightness of pulp certainly affects the demand for optical brighteners in paper manufacturing, nevertheless, {{there is not a}} direct correlation between consump tion of optical brightener and final brightness, being the method of bleaching pulp, especially from the final stage of bleaching, also important in relation to this demand. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of using the parameter whiteness as a tool to control bleaching pulp, instead of the traditional brightness and evaluate the impacts of different methods of bleaching and the pulp final brightness level in action of optical brighteners, to improve their per formance. It was observed that the whiteness and brightness of the pulp are highly correlated and that the control of the bleaching plant can be done by any one of these two parameters. It was also concluded that, considering current prices of <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> and of optical brighteners, it is better to bleach the pulp up to lower brightness values (e. g. 88 % ISO) and use larger amounts of optical brighteners to brighten the mass until the whiteness of 130 CIE. This conclusion is valid for whiteness measured before the size press. Further studies are needed to validate this conclusion considering the finished product. </p...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar a quantidade de finos gerada por diferentes reagentes de branqueamento e seu efeito nas propriedades físicas e mecânicas da celulose kraft de eucalipto. A polpa foi branqueada por quatro sequências diferentes. Parte das amostras foi classificada em equipamento Bauer-McNett, sendo a parte não classificada (global) refinada para 40 ºSR, em moinho laboratorial PFI. As duas maiores porções de cada amostra proveniente da classificação foram também refinadas com o mesmo número de revoluções que a sua amostra global. Realizaram-se ensaios físicos e mecânicos das amostras refinadas, e suas fibras foram analisadas em equipamento FQA (Fiber Quality Analyser), antes e depois do refino. A maior quantidade de finos foi observada nas polpas refinadas e na sequência-referência. Os resultados de tração foram mais elevados e significativos nas amostras globais; as polpas classificadas não apresentaram diferença entre si, sendo atribuída a maior resistência à tração na presença de finos. A resistência ao rasgo foi afetada pelo comprimento das fibras e não pelo teor de finos. Os maiores valores de ascensão capilar Klemm ocorreram nas amostras classificadas em razão da ausência de finos e do maior comprimento de fibras. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the generation of fines by different <b>bleaching</b> <b>reagents</b> {{and its effect on}} physical and mechanical properties of eucalyptus kraft pulp. The pulp was bleached by four different sequences. Some of these samples was classified in Bauer-McNett equipment. The unclassified part of the pulp (global) was refined to 40 ºSR in a laboratory PFI mill. The two major classified portions of each sample were also refined at the same revolutions as its global sample. Physical and mechanical tests were performed for both classified and unclassified samples, and their fibers were analyzed in FQA (Fiber Quality Analyzer), before and after refining. The greater amount of fines was observed for the refined pulp and the reference sequence. The tensile results were more significant for the global sample, classified pulps showed no difference between them being given the highest tensile strength to the presence of fines. The tear resistance was affected by the length of the fibers and not by the content of fines. The highest values of capillarity for the Klemm samples were classified due to the absence of fines and fibers of greater length...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the behavior of eucalyptus kraft pulp bleaching on paper physical and mechanical properties. Pulp was bleached by four similar sequences, each containing one of the reagents analyzed: D(E+P) DD (reference), AHTD(E+P) DD, D(E+P) D(PO), and PX(E+P) DD. Each of the sequences contained one of the studied reagents: chlorine dioxide, sulfuric acid, pressurized hydrogen peroxide, and peracid (Caro's acid). One part of the samples was refined to 40 ºSR, whereas the other part was classified in a Bauer-McNett. Subsequently, the part retained in 50 mesh sieve, was refined to the same number of revolutions as the global sample. Pulp bleached in AHT, PO, and PX exhibited reduced mechanical strength and during fractionating increased the concentration of fibers in finer sieves because these reagents are less selective. The results show that pulp <b>bleached</b> in <b>reagents</b> such as pressurized hydrogen peroxide and peracid indicated reduced strength and produced greater fiber concentrations. However, despite the low selectivity of acid hydrolysis, it was found that this sequence had very high tear and tensile strength comparable to classified and global pulp, concluding that regardless of classification, pulp fractions may have high mechanical strength...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} novel synthetic methodologies for the incorporation of sulfur dioxide into organic molecules employing the amine-sulfur dioxide complex DABSO (vide infra). These developed processes serve to access a range of sulfonyl-containing (-SO 2 -) compounds including sulfones and sulfonamides, via sulfinic acid precursors. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the synthesis and applications of sulfonyl-containing compounds and the organic chemistry of sulfur dioxide. A comprehensive introduction to the developed uses of sulfur dioxide surrogates in organic chemistry is given. The synthetic utility of metal sulfinates towards accessing sulfonyl-containing compounds is also discussed. Chapter 2 details the development of a one-pot sulfone synthesis via metal sulfinates generated from organometallic reagents and DABSO. Alkyl, alkenyl and (hetero) aryl sulfinates prepared from organolithium and Grignard reagents can be efficiently coupled with a range of electrophiles to access a range of products including diaryl, aryl-heteroaryl and β-hydroxy sulfones. Chapter 3 describes an array-compatible, one-pot sulfonamide synthesis employing metal sulfinates and N -chloroamines as in situ -generated intermediates. This employs DABSO and sodium hypochlorite (<b>bleach)</b> as simple <b>reagents</b> and organolithium, organozinc and Grignard reagents along with amines as readily-accessible building blocks. The robust nature of this methodology and its potential application in discovery chemistry is demonstrated with a 65 -compound array synthesis. Chapter 4 {{documents the}} development of a palladium-catalysed sulfination reaction of boronic acids to access a range of sulfonyl-containing compounds. This involved the establishment of a one-pot/one step synthesis of sulfones leading to the discovery of a redox-neutral, ligand-free sulfination procedure using DABSO and palladium(II) catalysis. Sulfinic acid derivatives can be generated and subsequently trapped in situ with a variety of electrophiles to furnish sulfones and sulfonamides. Chapter 5 summarises the research and the potential future work. Chapter 6 provides experimental details and data. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R
40|$|In {{medieval times}} it was common prac­tise to reuse old books by erasing the writing and {{preparing}} the parchment to be written upon again. In these cases the previously written text was often erased chemically by means of <b>bleach</b> or other <b>reagents,</b> thus just removing the organic compound of the ink, but leaving the metallic part at its place. Since Late Antiquity, scribes used iron gall ink when writing on parchment since such ink was fairly easy to manufacture and produced durable writing on this material. The historic vitriols used for iron gall ink always contained several metallic impurities, varying in kind and amount on the vitriols origin. The metallic fingerprint of the respective vitriol incorporated in the ink can nowadays be used to correlate texts from one author to different times or help when trying to recover script in iron gall ink hidden or erased. In many cases, the removed writing was, is or could be {{of great interest to}} modern textual scholar­ship. In order to re-access this writing non destructively acceptable standard modern techniques include photographic imaging, in particular with multi-spectral and ul­tra­violet light. The use of X-rays, in particular X-ray fluorescence (XRF), allows an element specific probing of the writing, even if this is covered, hidden or erased. By using a small X-ray spot and scanning the writing, one can measure the elemental distribution on the parchment and after deconvolution of the different writings (making use of their different metallic fingerprints), allows to access the hidden or erased text or texts. On the Archimedes Palimpsest, the technique of hard X-ray fluorescence element mapping was first used in 2006 to make the hidden iron gall ink script visible. In this successful recovery of a hid­den script, it was also shown that scanning with high flux X-ray light to measure the local X-ray fluor­escence one minimizes possible damage or wear on the parchment to acceptable levels...|$|R
