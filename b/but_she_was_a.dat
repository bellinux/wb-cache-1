25|$|Anne {{was barely}} {{a year old}} when her mother became ill of what is {{believed}} to have been uterine cancer. Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success. Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children. She did it from a sense of duty, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> stern woman who expected respect, rather than love. There was little affection between her and the older children, but Anne, according to tradition, was her favourite.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, Langtry was {{in need of}} money. Her {{close friend}} Oscar Wilde {{suggested}} she try the stage, and Langtry embarked upon a theatre career. She first tried out for an amateur production in the Twickenham Town Hall on 19 November 1881. It was a comedy two-hander called A Fair Encounter, with Henrietta Labouchère taking the other role and coaching Langtry in her acting. Labouchère had been a professional actress (Henrietta Hodson) before she met and married Liberal MP Henry Labouchère. Following favorable reviews of this first attempt at the stage, and with further coaching, Langtry made her debut before the London public, playing Kate Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer at the Haymarket Theatre in December 1881. Critical opinion was mixed, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> success with the public. She next performed in Ours at the same theatre. Although her affair with the Prince of Wales was over, he supported her new venture by attending several of her performances and helping attract an audience.|$|E

Everybody had seen my {{daughter}} dead. And that's all she became to them. She was a symbol. She was the girl in the fireman's arms. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real person that got left behind.".|$|E
500|$|Mimi {{was portrayed}} on film in Birth of The Beatles (1979), [...] (1985), [...] (2000), and by actress Kristin Scott Thomas in Nowhere Boy (2010). McCartney {{disagreed}} with the director of Nowhere Boy, Sam Taylor-Wood, about the original script portrayal of Mimi, saying: [...] "Aunt Mimi was not cruel. She was mock strict, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good heart who loved John madly." [...] Taking McCartney's advice, Taylor-Wood agreed to change the script.|$|E
500|$|Some tales {{raised the}} {{question}} of whether mermaids had immortal souls, answering in the negative. [...] The figure of Lí Ban appears as a sanctified mermaid, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> human being transformed into a mermaid. After three centuries, when Christianity had come to Ireland, she was baptized. The Irish mermaid is called merrow in tales such as [...] "Lady of Gollerus" [...] published in the 19th century. In Scottish mythology, a ceasg is a fresh-water mermaid, though little beside the term has been preserved in folklore.|$|E

Walton has said that she wants to see Jill's business side incorporate into the storyline more, stating: [...] "That's what Jill has always done, and she does it well. She was a really successful businesswoman. Jill did a lot of foolish things, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> savvy businesswoman." [...] Additionally, Walton described Jill's business as the [...] "core of the whole character", stating: [...] "Jill is really a part of me – this is a unique job in that part of me does live as Jill, and I know Jill is a very savvy businesswoman." ...|$|E
500|$|Kīnaʻu {{was born}} December 21/27, 1842, Honolulu, {{on the island}} of Oahu. His father was High Chief William Pitt Leleiohoku I (1821–1848) and his mother was High Ruth Keʻelikōlani (1826–1883). Through his mother he was Kamehameha I's great-great grandchild. His mother's {{parentage}} was disputed, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the House of Kamehameha through her own mother Pauahi. His recognized maternal grandmother was Kekūanāoʻa, who was the Governor of Oahu. Through his father, he descended from King Kekaulike of Maui. His father was the biological son of Prime Minister Kalanimoku, who was called The Iron Cable of Hawaii because of his political savvy and military prowess. His name [...] "William Pitt", shared by his father and grandfather, was originally chosen by Kalanimoku in honor of Prime Minister William Pitt of England.|$|E
500|$|Hindley {{began to}} change her {{appearance}} further, wearing clothing considered risqué such as high boots, short skirts and leather jackets, and the two became less sociable to their colleagues. The couple were regulars at the library, borrowing books on philosophy, as well as crime and torture. They also read works by the Marquis de Sade, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Although Hindley was not a qualified driver (she passed her test on the third attempt, late in 1963), she often hired a van, {{in which the two}} planned bank robberies. Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a [...]22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a Webley [...]45 and a Smith & Wesson [...]38 from other members of the club. Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a Box Brownie, which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and darkroom equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit. For Hindley, this demonstrated a marked change from her earlier, more shy and prudish nature.|$|E

2500|$|After her husband's execution, Lady Rochford {{was absent}} from court for several months. She spent this time {{securing}} her financial position by negotiations with her father-in-law, Sir Thomas Boleyn, but mainly with Thomas Cromwell, the king's chief minister. The Boleyns eventually allocated her the sizable annual pension of £100, precisely {{what they had}} given their eldest daughter Mary, {{when she had been}} widowed eight years earlier. It was much less than her previous income as sister-in-law to the queen-consort, but it was enough to keep her as a noblewoman, which was essential for her return to Court, something Jane worked doggedly for in 1536 and 1537. It is unknown when she returned to court, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lady-in-waiting to Queen Jane Seymour, so she probably returned within a year of her husband's death. (Jane Seymour died soon after childbirth, within eighteen months of becoming Henry's wife.) As a viscountess, she was allowed to bring a number of her own servants with her, lodge in the palace, and be addressed as [...] "Lady Rochford". Fine meals were provided for her every day from the budget of the queen's household.|$|E
2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I know those sort of women. They ring the bell and tell you to put a lump of coal on the fire." ...|$|E
