5000|$|Anthracite {{derives from}} the Greek anthrakítēs (...) , {{literally}} [...] "coal-like". Other terms which refer to anthracite are black coal, hard coal, stone coal, dark coal, coffee coal, <b>blind</b> <b>coal</b> (in Scotland), Kilkenny coal (in Ireland), crow coal or craw coal, and black diamond. [...] "Blue Coal" [...] is the term for a once-popular and trademarked brand of anthracite, mined by the Glen Alden Coal Company in Pennsylvania, and sprayed with a blue dye at the mine before shipping to its northeastern U.S. markets to distinguish it from its competitors.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} and compare the activities/selectivities of fine-particle size catalysts being developed in the DOE/PETC Advanced Research (AR) Liquefaction Program by using standard coal liquefaction activity test procedures. Since bituminous and subbituminous coals have significantly different properties, it is feasible that catalysts may perform differently with these coal types. Because all previous testing has been done with the DECS- 17 <b>Blind</b> Canyon bituminous <b>coal,</b> {{it is important to}} develop the capability of evaluating catalysts using a subbituminous coal. Initial efforts towards developing a subbituminous coal test are aimed at comparing the reactivities of the Wyodak subbituminous <b>coal</b> and the <b>Blind</b> Canyon bituminous <b>coal.</b> Therefore, the same factorial experimental design was used with the Wyodak coal as was used previously with the <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal.</b> In addition, PNL`s 6 -line ferrihydrite catalyst precursor was used {{in the development of the}} Wyodak coal test procedure because this catalyst is the best powder catalyst found to date in Sandia`s tests with <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal.</b> Results show that <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal</b> yields higher DHP amounts in the reaction products and higher tetrahydrofuran conversions at the higher severity conditions. Wyodak coal gives higher heptane conversions and higher gas yields for all conditions tested...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of Sandia`s fine particle size catalyst testing project, it was not feasible to compare {{the activities of the}} many direct coal liquefaction catalysts developed in various laboratories. This was due to the wide variety of testing methods used by the different catalyst developers. Sandia developed a procedure that uses a bituminous <b>coal</b> (DECS- 17 <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal),</b> phenathrene as the reaction solvent, and a factorial experimental design with three variables: temperature, time, and catalyst loading. Numerous catalysts have been evaluated. Pacific Northwest National Laboratories` (PNNL) 6 -line ferrihydrite catalyst is the most active among the particulate catalysts. West Virginia University`s (WVU) iron catalyst impregnated on <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal</b> is the best iron catalyst evaluated to date. Because this catalyst was prepared by impregnation, which involves several preparation steps, it cannot be directly compared to particulate catalysts. In an effort to enable this comparison, WVU produced a particulate iron catalyst that has been tested at Sandia. In addition, Sandia has also evaluated several of Argonne National Laboratory`s molybdenum and iron catalysts that were impregnated on Wyodak subbituminous coal from the Argonne Premium Coal Sample Program. Current activities are focused on developing capabilities for performing coprocessing experiments to support FETC`s coprocessing thrust and a new project aimed at helping Puerto Rico solve its waste disposal problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{to evaluate}} and compare the activities/selectivities of fine-particle size catalysts being developed in the DOE/PETC Advanced Research (AR) Coal Liquefaction program by using standard coal liquefaction activity test procedures. Previously reported results have described the standard test procedure developed at Sandia to evaluate fine-particle size iron catalysts being developed in DOE/PETC`s AR Coal Liquefaction Program and described the evaluation of several catalysts (commercially available pyrite, University of Pittsburgh`s catalyst, Pacific Northwest Laboratories` catalyst) using these procedures. The test uses DECS- 17 <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>Coal,</b> phenanthrene as the reaction solvent, and a factorial experimental design that enables evaluation of a catalyst over ranges of temperature (350 to 400 {degree}C), time (20 to 60 minutes), and catalyst loading (0 to 1 wt % on an as-received coal basis). Recent work {{has focused on the}} evaluation of West Virginia University`s iron catalyst that WVU impregnated on DECS- 17 <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal.</b> Results showed good activity for this catalyst including the highest amount of 9, 10 -dihydrophenanthrene (13. 2 %) observed in a reaction product and a small but significant catalytic effect for heptane conversion (0. 5 %). Additional experiments are being performed to enable comparison with previously tested catalysts. Tetrahydrofuran insolubles from selected reactions have been sent to the University of Kentucky for Mossbauer characterization of the iron phases present...|$|R
40|$|Moessbauer {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to determine the iron-bearing phases in the coal, catalysts, and IOM products used and generated in the Direct Coal Liquefaction (DCL) catalyst testing program at Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico. DCL experiments were conducted with a <b>Blind</b> Canyon, Utah, <b>coal</b> both thermally and with three different iron-based catalysts: (1) a sulfated hematite catalyst (Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }/SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 {minus}}), (2) a 6 -line ferrihydrite catalyst, and (3) iron-oxide impregnated directly into coal. The catalysts were added to the coal at both a 0. 5 and a 1. 0 wt% level and sufficient sulfur was added to ensure complete sulfidation of the iron. The Moessbauer spectrum of the <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal</b> revealed that the major iron-bearing mineral present was ankerite, Ca(Fe,Mg) (CO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }, which converts firs to {gamma}-Fe (austenitic iron) before undergoing partial sulfidation to pyrrhotite in the thermal runs. The percentages of pyrrhotite formed in the catalytic runs were higher than those in the thermal runs indicating that sulfidation of the added iron occurs more rapidly than with the ankerite. Moessbauer data on the amount of pyrrhotite present does not correlate well with THF and heptane conversion percentages, indicating that other parameters like catalyst dispersion must also be considered...|$|R

The objective of the proposed work is to test the application of steam pretreatment to coal liquefaction. A 300 ml stirred autoclave for liquefaction tests is being installed. A nonflow steam pretreatment procedure has been established for work with model compounds. Pretreatment tests with <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal,</b> a coal similar to Illinois No. 6 but containing no sulfur, have been started. These initial tests show only {{a slight increase in}} yield resulting from pretreatment. A method for purifying {alpha}napthylmethyl phenyl ether has been found which avoids its acid catalyzed rearrangement.

40|$|Steam {{pretreatment}} is {{the reaction}} of coal with steam at temperatures well below those usually used for solubilization. The objective of the proposed work is to test the application of steam pretreatment to coal liquefaction. A 300 ml stirred autoclave for liquefaction tests is being installed. Pretreatment and extraction tests were made with <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal</b> alone, mixed with Illinois No. 6 coal, impregnated with iron, and impregnated with iron and sulfided using phenyl disulfide. Measurements show an increase in volatiles yield {{and a decrease in}} extraction yield with catalyst addition. These results are not yet definitive, because both yields may be artificially decreased by insoluble residue from phenyl disulfide. About one ram of purified {alpha}-naphthylmethyl phenyl ether was prepared and an additional 0. 8 gram were synthesized. Steam pretreatment of the model compound {alpha}-benzylnaphthyl ether was repeated with a Pyrex liner for the reactor tube. No differences have yet appeared as a result of using this liner (compared to bare stainless steel), evidence against any catalytic wall effect...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{pretreatment}} is {{the reaction}} of coal with steam at temperatures well below those usually used for solubilization. The objective of the proposed work is to test the application of steam pretreatment to coal liquefaction. Installation of the stirred autoclave for conventional slurry liquefaction (slow heating) was completed and preliminary testing carried out. Two liquefaction tests with untreated Illinois No. 6 coal gave satisfactory results. An additional pretreatment test of <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coal</b> was conducted this quarter which confirms the tentative conclusions previously reached: volatiles yields are increased {{by the addition of}} sulfided iron catalyst; {{it is not possible to}} ascertain (by the procedure used) whether extraction yield decreases or remains constant. Chromatographic separation and analysis of the products from treated {alpha}-benzylnaphthyl ether has been continued. A transformation of the product over several weeks has been noted. The {sup 1 }H nmr spectrum of this product obtained in a glass lined reactor is found to be different from that obtained previously in a stainless steel reactor. The model compound {alpha}-naphthylmethyl phenyl ether has been steam pretreated and the analysis of its liquid product started. Three major components have been identified...|$|R
40|$|The mixed iron/alumina {{pillared}} clay catalysts and clay-supported iron catalysts {{have been}} shown in previous reports of this project to significantly improve yields of heptane-soluble products obtained in the liquefaction of both as received and acid-exchanged Wyodak subbituminous <b>coal</b> and <b>Blind</b> Canyon bituminous <b>coal.</b> In this quarter, the soluble product (LSW) obtained from the noncatalytic low-severity liquefaction of Wyodak coal {{was used as a}} feed to determine the activity of iron based catalysts for the hydrogenation and depolymerization steps. Comparison data for liquefaction of the soluble LSW with other catalysts were desired, and these data were obtained for a dispersed form of iron sulfide, prepared via iron hydroxyoxide (PETC method). The iron oxyhydroxide catalyst was directly precipitated on LSW product using either water or ethanol as the solvent. An insight into the functioning of the mixed iron/alumina pillared clay in coal liquefaction was investigated by preparing and studying an iron oxoaluminate structure. An investigation of new methods for the production of tetralin soluble iron oxometallate catalysts and the determination of their catalytic activities was continued in this quarter. The hydrogenation activity of iron oxoaluminate was investigated using pyrene and 1 -methylnaphthalene as the test compounds, and results were compared with thermal reactions. In order to determine the loss of activity, recovered catalyst was recycled a second time for the hydrotreating of pyrene. Reaction of 1 -methylnaphthalene with iron oxoaluminate also gave very high conversion to 1 - and 5 -methyltetralins and small amount of 2 - and 6 -methyltetralins. Liquefaction of Wyodak subbituminous and <b>Blind</b> Canyon bituminous <b>coal</b> was investigated using an in situ sulfided soluble iron oxoaluminate catalyst...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this progress report describes the continuation of coal-resid coprocessing reactions that were discussed in the January to March 1995 Quarterly Report. During previous quarters, Maya and FHC- 623 resids were evaluated in non-catalytic and catalytic reactions at 400 {degrees}C with Pittsburgh No. 8 and DECS- 17 <b>Blind</b> Canyon <b>coals.</b> From the complete reaction matrix containing the two coals and two resids, {{it was found that}} the influence of resids on coprocessing depended on the type of coal used; for example, under catalytic reaction conditions, the hexane solubles of Maya resid increased coal conversion of Pittsburgh No. 8 coal but decreased that of DECS- 17. In order to observe the intrinsic behavior of resids during coprocessing, another resid, Manjii, and another coal, Illinois No. 6, are being tested. These reactions were begun this quarter. The results are reported herein. In order to evaluate the role of the different components in resids, the resids were separated into hexane soluble materials and hexane insoluble materials. The hexane solubles, which should contain the naphthenes present in the resid, and the untreated whole resids were reacted with coal at equivalent liquefaction conditions and at the same conditions as when the resids were reacted individually...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that low rank coal such as {{leonardite}} can be solubilized by strong base (>pH 12). Recent discoveries have also shown that leonardite is solubilized by Lewis bases at considerably lower pH values and by fungi that secrete certain Lewis bases (i. e., oxalate ion). During the current reporting period we have studied the ability of a strong base (sodium hydroxide, pH 12), and two fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor, to solubilize Argonne Premium Coals. In general, Argonne Premium Coals were relatively resistant to base mediated solubilization. However, when these coals were preoxidized (150 {degrees}C for seven days), substantial amounts of several coals were solubilized. Most affected were the Lewiston-Stockton bituminous coal, the Beulah-Zap lignite, the Wyodak-Anderson subbituminous <b>coal</b> and the <b>Blind</b> Canyon bituminous <b>coal.</b> Argonne Premium Coals were previously shown by us to be relatively resistant to solubilization by sodium oxalate. When preoxidized coals were treated with sodium oxalate, only the Beulah-Zap lignite was substantially solubilized. Although very small amounts of the other preoxidized coals were solubilized by treatment with oxalate, the small amount of solubilization that did take place was generally increased relative to that observed for coals that were not preoxidized. None of the Argonne Premium Coals were solubilized by P. chrysosporium or T. versicolor. Of considerable interest, however, is the observation that P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor mediated extensive solubilization of Lewiston-Stockton bituminous coal, the Beulah-Zap lignite and the Wyodak-Anderson subbituminous coal...|$|R
