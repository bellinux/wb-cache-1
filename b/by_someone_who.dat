5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, {{there is no}} cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{had been}} {{governed by a}} three-man National Commission, {{consisting}} of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann left office {{at the request of}} other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, preferred a single commissioner to rule over the game, but were willing to see the National Commission continue if Herrmann was replaced <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> would provide strong leadership. Landis's name was mentioned in the press for this role, and the influential baseball newspaper The Sporting News sought his appointment.|$|E

Unfortunately, private eyes can't always spot the victims as easily as lifeguards. Mitch Buchannon ...|$|R

5|$|Hillcourt {{worked at}} a BSA camp at Bear Mountain in Harriman State Park, New York, in 1926 where he became an {{instructor}} in American Indian dance. He then worked for the BSA Supply Division where he broke his leg when a crate fell on him. He met James West while working at the national office. West solicited Hillcourt's thoughts on Scouting in the U.S. Hillcourt later sent West an 18-page memo detailing issues {{with the lack of}} patrol structure and leadership. He recommended that the BSA write a handbook for patrol leaders, and that it needed to be written <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had been both a patrol leader and a Scoutmaster. West hired Hillcourt as a writer and editor and was later persuaded to commission Hillcourt to write the first Handbook for Patrol Leaders which was published in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid was an {{advocate}} {{for the use of}} music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in antiphons and responses. Bede says that this singing master was named Æddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified Æddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, which has led to the assumption that the Vita was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the Vita was not authored by the singing master, but <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> joined Wilfrid {{in the last years of}} Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E

Rhian Daly of NME called the song [...] "polished minimalism" [...] while mentioning its commentary on consumer culture, saying [...] "It oozes dissatisfaction, a desolate critique {{of a world}} where we're becoming zombies to materialism and technology <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> yet to succumb to it like those around him." [...] In another review, Paste Magazine's Molly Morgan states that the song [...] "encompasses all that we love already about TDCC: it’s dance-y, light and fun" [...] while the darker lyrics [...] "hold greater meaning to the band".|$|R

5000|$|The title {{song was}} written from a woman’s perspective, {{based on his}} own {{feelings}} and experiences, like the death of close friends Kami and Ken Ogata, but also inspired by stories and movies like If Only, the Japanese drama Ima Ai Ni Yukimasu (a.k.a. Be With You), and the film Watashi No Atama No Naka No Keshigomu (a.k.a. A Movement to Remember). Gackt recalls that the [...] "single {{is meant to be}} like a letter left to a loved one <b>by</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> gone from this world", yet [...] "the purpose of my song is not to evoke sadness, but happiness.
