5|$|Eye {{problems}} are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. Dogs which {{are intended to}} be bred should <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.|$|E
5|$|Specialized {{training}} in venous ultrasonography is not undertaken in some countries, which undermines best practice, mainly when varicose veins need to <b>be</b> <b>examined.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{collocation}} {{method for}} solving the occluded radiosity equation <b>is</b> <b>examined,</b> theoretically and empirically. Theoretical results <b>are</b> <b>examined,</b> including questions of superconvergence of the collocation solution. The use of “discontinuity meshing ” <b>is</b> <b>examined</b> for both piecewise constant and piecewise linear collocation. Also, numerical {{integration of the}} collocation integrals <b>is</b> <b>examined,</b> and a near-analytic evaluation method is given...|$|R
30|$|The {{results are}} divided into three primary sections. In the first section, results from the diaries <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> in detail. In the second section, {{relations}} among the diary responses, cognitive ability measures, and the motivation and interest questionnaire <b>were</b> <b>examined.</b> In the final section, relations with academic performance <b>were</b> <b>examined.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|Assessment of {{intellectual}} functioning including memory testing can further characterise {{the state of}} the disease. Medical organisations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practising physicians. The diagnosis can be confirmed with very high accuracy post-mortem when brain material is available and can <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> histologically.|$|E

5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He was adamant {{that she was not}} to know she was being sent to France to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the {{government}} increased restrictions on private travel and immigrants, which meant anybody arriving in Mongalla and wishing to go north from the Uganda or the Belgian Congo could <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> for sleeping sickness by a medical officer. The maximum punishment for any {{breach of the}} new regulations was a £10 fine or a 6-month prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Quest's {{rules are}} {{intended}} to ensure the health of dogs in hazardous conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{suggest that}} {{forecasts}} of health detriment for such long periods should <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> critically. Practical studies only consider up to 100 years {{as far as}} effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned. Long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research. Management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are described below.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the anatomy of the brain is neuroanatomy, while the study of its {{function}} is neuroscience. A number of techniques are used to study the brain. Specimens from other animals, which may <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> microscopically, have traditionally provided much information. Medical imaging technologies such as functional neuroimaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are important in studying the brain. The medical history of people with brain injury has provided insight into the function of {{each part of the}} brain.|$|E

5|$|Women's {{health in}} India can <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> {{in terms of}} {{multiple}} indicators, which vary by geography, socioeconomic standing and culture. To adequately improve the health of women in India multiple dimensions of wellbeing must be analysed in relation to global health averages and also in comparison to men in India.

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal that can <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal {{were destroyed by}} phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E

5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged for him to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of}} the Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to <b>be</b> <b>examined</b> by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
