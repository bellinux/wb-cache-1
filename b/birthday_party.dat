5|$|Eeyore's <b>Birthday</b> <b>Party</b> {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, believes his friends have forgotten his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to May Day). For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual <b>Birthday</b> <b>Party</b> became a tradition in Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E
40|$|Mothering in the {{contemporary}} United States is positioned uneasily {{at the intersection of}} gendered cultural expectations of child rearing and consumerism. Contemporary expectations of “motherhood ” require extensive time and financial resources. Poor mothers face a complex negotiation of cultural expectations and consumerism as they mother with limited time and financial resources. Using children’s <b>birthday</b> <b>parties</b> as a site of exploration, this study seeks to examine the construction of the cultural expectations of “good ” mothering. How do mothers with greatly limited resources understand the cultural expectations of children’s <b>birthday</b> <b>parties?</b> How do mothers organize the resources to host successful children’s <b>birthday</b> <b>parties?</b> What do they believe are the most important elements and outcomes? Twenty mothers who receive government assistance were interviewed about their experiences of organiz-ing children’s <b>birthday</b> <b>parties.</b> Results from this analysis indicate that managing children and activities on greatly limited resources creates greater difficulty in meet-ing the expectations of conspicuous consumption. Mothers orchestrating children’s <b>birthday</b> <b>parties</b> with meager financial resources may judge their parties successful...|$|R
