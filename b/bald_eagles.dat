5|$|<b>Bald</b> <b>eagles,</b> ospreys, kingfishers, brook trout, and {{freshwater}} molluscs {{have all}} been observed on the tributaries Hammersley Fork and Trout Run. <b>Bald</b> <b>eagles,</b> ospreys, Canada geese, herons, and mallard ducks have visited Kettle Creek Lake. Various birds of prey have also temporarily visited the watershed. Ring-necked pheasants and ruffed grouse live in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|While wintering, <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> {{tend to be}} less {{habitat and}} {{disturbance}} sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering <b>bald</b> <b>eagles,</b> particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> or Woapalanee was a Lenape chief whose {{village at}} modern Milesburg, Pennsylvania {{was known as}} <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle's</b> Nest or Wapalanewachschiechey. The {{identity}} of <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> is unclear though. One chief with that name, who was [...] "friendly and respected" [...] was murdered on the Monongahela River in 1773. Another <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle,</b> for whom the historic record is less clear, is traditionally {{supposed to have been}} the leader of raiding parties against white settlers on the West Branch Susquehanna River during the American Revolutionary War. He killed a brother of Samuel Brady near Williamsport in 1778 and Brady killed him on the Allegheny River in what is now Clarion County the next year. In any case, <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> gave his name directly or indirectly to <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Mountain, two <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Creeks, the <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Creek Path, <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> State Park, the Nittany and <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Railroad, and <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township.|$|R

500|$|... a. <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township {{was formed}} in 1772 {{as one of the}} seven {{original}} townships in Northumberland County (Muncy Township is the only other of the seven which is now part of Lycoming County). In August 1785, Washington Township was formed from <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle,</b> and in November 1785 parts of <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township were added to the newly formed Lycoming and Pine Creek townships (the bulk of their territory had been purchased from the Iroquois in 1784). In May 1786, <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township was split into three new townships: Nippenose, Upper <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle,</b> and Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle.</b> In 1789, Mifflin County was formed from Upper <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township and half of Potter Township (itself formed partly from the original <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township in May 1774). When Lycoming County {{was formed in}} 1795, Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> was one of the original seven townships. Centre County was formed in 1800 from parts of Huntingdon, Lycoming, Mifflin, and Northumberland counties. Centre County originally had eight townships, with two (Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> and Upper <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle),</b> taken from Lycoming County. It is not clear if this Upper <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> was a newly formed township, or some portion of the original not taken when Mifflin County was formed.|| Some territory from Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township remained in Lycoming County. In 1801, Centre County renamed [...] "Upper <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township" [...] as [...] "Spring Township" [...] and [...] "Lower <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township" [...] as [...] "Bald Eagle Township". In 1839 Clinton County was formed from Centre and Lycoming counties, with <b>Bald</b> <b>Eagle</b> Township as one of three taken from Centre County. Today neither Centre nor Lycoming counties have a township named [...] "Bald Eagle".|$|R
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bald</b> <b>eagles</b> {{will also}} congregate in certain {{locations}} in winter. From November until February, {{one to two}} thousand birds winter in Squamish, British Columbia, about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler. The birds primarily gather along the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers, attracted by the salmon spawning in the area.|$|E
5|$|When {{competing}} for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes (Canis latrans) and foxes, and birds such as corvids, gulls, vultures and other raptors. Occasionally, coyotes, bobcats (Lynx rufus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, {{as has been}} recorded in Maine. <b>Bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species {{is known to be}} dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in New Jersey during winter, a golden eagle and numerous <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict. Many <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys, herons and even otters. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles. When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.|$|E

5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E

Golden eagles and greater sage-grouse can be found over sagebrush steppe, whereas <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> can be seen along rivers. The Forest Service has listed northern goshawks, flammulated owls, and white-headed woodpeckers as a sensitive species in the forest.|$|E
5|$|Predation of sea otters does occur, {{although}} it is not common. Many predators find the otter, with their pungent scent glands, distasteful. Young predators may kill an otter and not eat it. Leading mammalian predators of this species include orcas and sea lions; <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> also prey on pups by snatching them from the water surface.|$|E
5|$|Behind fish, {{the next}} most {{significant}} prey base for <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Exceptionally, in the Greater Yellowstone area, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake. Preferred avian prey includes grebes, alcids, ducks, gulls, coots, herons, egrets, and geese. Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis), mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (Larus smithsonianus) are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering emperor geese (Chen canagica) and snow geese (C. caerulescens), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> have included common loons (Gavis immer), great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus), sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), Canada geese (Branta canadensis), brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and fledging American white pelicans (P. erythrorhynchos). Colony nesting seabirds, such as alcids, storm petrels, cormorants, northern gannets (Morus bassanus), terns and gulls, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, <b>bald</b> <b>eagles</b> are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.|$|E

5|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls {{were originally}} {{listed as a}} species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls {{in most of the}} western counties in the Bay Area, leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. <b>Bald</b> <b>eagles</b> were once common in the Bay Area, but habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. <b>Bald</b> <b>eagles</b> disappeared from the Bay Area in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and eggs from Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that have returned to the Bay Area include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey.|$|E
