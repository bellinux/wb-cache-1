40|$|Development of numeric {{criteria}} for water quality management to ensure ecosystem health {{is one of}} the goals of coastal resource managers. US EPA guidance for these criteria promotes maintaining eelgrass habitat with minimum water clarity based on a conceptual model of phytoplankton shading eelgrass. Eelgrass is critical habitat in Great Bay, New Hampshire USA, and its protection is central to NH Department of Environmental Services nutrient criteria development. However, data collected during a multi-year boat sampling effort shows little correlation between water clarity and phytoplankton abundance. The UNH Coastal Observing center established the Great Bay Coastal Buoy in 2005 as part of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) to provide a comprehensive suite of observations. <b>Buoy</b> <b>light</b> attenuation measurements suggest that factors unrelated to nutrient enrichment may be responsible for the majority of the eelgrass shading (e. g., sediment resuspension and CDOM). Here we discuss how airborne hyperspectral remotely sensed information collected during 2007 has been used to expand on the temporally rich buoy data to provide spatially rich information relevant to the goals of regional coastal managers...|$|E
40|$|From 15 to 28 August in 2007, a Chaetoceros socialis bloom was {{detected}} in the Pearl River Estuary water with chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) up to 30 mg m(- 3) and cell density up to 10 (6) cells L- 1. Time series of bio-optical measurements was obtained at a single site (114. 29 degrees E, 22. 06 degrees N) with the mooring of marine optical <b>buoy.</b> <b>Light</b> absorption properties of seawater experienced large variability throughout the algal bloom. Absorption by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) {{was one of the}} dominant optical components of the light absorption (30 - 70 %) especially for pre- and post-bloom waters, and it tended to decrease with Chl a during the algal bloom. Absorption by phytoplankton was another dominant optical component (18 - 50 %) and increased rapidly with Chl a. Phytoplankton and accompanying material played dominant roles in light absorption as indicated by the relationship between absorption coefficient and Chl a. At high pigment concentrations, water samples showed significantly lower specific phytoplankton absorption, compared with pre- and post-bloom conditions, with the specific phytoplankton concentration at 443 nm varied between 0. 011 and 0. 022 m(2) mg(- 1) and that at 676 nm between 0. 007 and 0. 018 m(2) mg(- 1); small values of blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton were also observed. These lower values were associated with variations in phytoplankton size structure. Spectral variability of phytoplankton absorption and total absorption (not including the fixed background absorption by pure water itself) could be expressed as simple linear functions linking absorption at one wavelength to the absorption at the other wavelengths, with the slope of the relationship changing with wavelength. The absorption coefficients by non-algal particles and CDOM follow the general exponential functions with remarkably limited variability in the exponent with means of 0. 0105 and 0. 0166 nm(- 1), respectively. These spectral dependencies of absorption coefficients provide useful information for retrieving inherent optical properties from reflectance data in a remote-sensing context. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
