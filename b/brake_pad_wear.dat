50|$|In disc brakes, {{there are}} usually two <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> per disc rotor. These are held in place and {{actuated}} by a caliper affixed to the wheel hub or suspension upright. Most vehicles have two <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> per caliper. However racing calipers can utilize up to six pads, with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.Depending on {{the properties of the}} material, disc wear rates may vary. The <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material) to prevent brake fade. Most <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> are equipped with a method of alerting the driver when this needs to be done. A common technique is manufacturing a small central groove whose eventual disappearance by wear indicates the end of a pad's service life. Others methods include placing a thin strip of soft metal in a groove, such that when exposed (due to wear) the brakes squeal audibly and embedding a soft metal tab in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a dashboard warning light when the <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> <b>wears</b> thin.|$|R

25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. <b>Brake</b> <b>pads</b> <b>wear</b> {{down and}} have to be replaced.

Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they <b>wear,</b> causing the <b>pads</b> to <b>wear</b> unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|R

40|$|The {{brake wear}} {{contribution}} to the environmental pollution has been extensively discussed, with major focus on asbestos and heavy metals released to the environment. Only limited {{attention was paid to}} released organic compounds generated during friction processes, although the organic and carbonaceous components are not the minor part in brake lining formulations. Friction processes in brakes are associated with relatively high temperatures and high pressures on the friction surfaces which relates to the thermal decomposition of the organic components in friction materials and to brake lining thermal fade. Thus, this study focuses on the identification of organic compounds released from a model low metallic brake material.

25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> for <b>wear.</b> A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the <b>brake</b> <b>pads.</b> Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking.

The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly.

40|$|During vehicle {{maintenance}} some components, such as {{motor oil}} and filters are replaced when {{certain period of}} time has passed or mileage reached. Braking system components which are subject to friction and wearout have to replaced when certain minimal thickness is reached. Manufacturer of vehicle provides information about initial and minimal size of braking components. It is a rare situation if the <b>brake</b> <b>pads</b> or discs are found at minimal thickness during inspection at scheduled maintenance.

Dynamics of wear of brake components on vehicle differ from front or rear axle and inner or outer pad. Correct prediction of service life can reduce maintenance costs and probability of unexpected vehicle breakdown.

One area that has been examined for weight reduction is vehicle with regenerative braking system (RBS).

Regenerative braking is an effective method to extend brake disc life, minimise disc rotor weight, minimise <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> <b>wear</b> and to extend the working range of an EV or HEV. Regenerative braking would extend the working range of an EV or HEV provided that any extra energy consumption e. g. from increased vehicle mass and system losses did not outweigh the saving from energy recuperation, also reduce duty levels on the brakes themselves, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life, but more importantly reduced brake mass, minimise <b>brake</b> <b>pad</b> <b>wear.</b> The objective of this research is to define thermal performance on lightweight disc brake models.
