40|$|A good {{understanding}} of the mechanical properties carbon nanotubes is essential to their applications. In this paper finite element analysis is carried out to simulate the axial buckling of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs) and triple-walled nanotubes (TWNTs). A commercial finite element (FE) software - ABAQUS is employed in the simulation and a buckling analysis is conducted to determine the eigenvalue of the first buckling mode for each nanotube subjected to axial loading. The effect of van de Waals force on the critical axial strain and the first <b>bucklling</b> mode of both the DWNTs and the TWNTs is discussed. The buckling modes of DWNTs and TWNTs are {{different from that of}} the SWNTs due to the van de Waals force involved. Inserting inner tubes does not lower the dritical axial strain of a SWNT. The post buckling behaviour of a SWNT and DWNT is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The actual {{buckling}} streas acr can {{be calculated}} from the first author’s exact theory as well. as by his method of split rigidities. Both methods yield practically identical results. By the latter method simple formulas are obtained which express the actual buckling stress ~cr directly {{in terms of the}} columh and local or plate buckling stresses. Columns with box, I-, H-, and T-sections and angles are considered separately. Interaction of practically significant magnitude occurs only in cases of flexural and torsional buckling. In these cases the addi-tional effect of distortion of the cross section is also taken into account. The theory ticludes buckling in the plastic range. No post-buckling phenomena are considered in the theoretical part of the paper. Tests were carried out for a considerable range of ratios of cor-rected free length to radius of gyration on two sections,’for one of which the local <b>buckl</b> ~ stress was in the plastic domain, and for the other, b the elastic domain. The experimental buckling stresses are in excellent agreement with those predicted by I“NTRODUCTIO It is customarv to consider that a column the theofi.

30|$|When an {{enterprise}} model {{is used to}} analyze the enterprise, analysis results can be used to support decision making processes, such as planning future states of the enterprise (<b>Buckl</b> et al. 2009); as a result, analysis has become a critical task because it contributes to the improvement of the business and IT elements. Analysis is a complex human activity that involves the formulation of hypotheses and the discovery of insights in order to get assessments. Typically, one analyst manipulates the enterprise model in order to extract information that is useful, for evaluating the state of the enterprise. Nevertheless, the quality of the analysis results depends on three factors: (1) the experience, knowledge, and skills of the analyst; (2) the quality of the models; and (3) the granularity, completeness and level of detail of the information contained in the models. The implementation of automated analysis methods contributes to reduce the risk associated with the first factor.|$|E
40|$|Western {{portions}} of the Edwards Plateau are dominated by a grass mosaic which consists of a rhizomatous midgrass, tobosagrass [Hilaria mutica (<b>Buckl.)</b> Benth. ], and two stoloniferous short grasses, common curlymesquite [Hilaria belangeri (Steud.) Nash] and buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm. ]. Permanent 0. 3 m x 6 m belt transects were established on three major soil series (Tobosa, Ozona. Valera) across several grazing treatments on the Texas Range Station near Barnhart, Texas, {{and the distribution of}} perennial grasses was mapped in 1951 (pre-drought), 1953 (drought), 1957 (post-drought), and 1987. Cover showed no consistent trends in relation to grazing. Total grass cover and composition within each soil series was found to be similar in 1951 and 1987, but cover was reduced by 20 to 56 % during the drought period due primarily to a decrease in short-grass cover.

40|$|Potential US castor {{production}} is limited due {{to only one}} labeled herbicide (trifluralin). Field studies were conducted at two Texas locations during 2008 and 2009 to evaluate postemergence herbicides for castor tolerance and weed control efficacy. Clethodim and fluazifop-P-butyl caused no castor stunting while acifluorfen, bentazon, imazethapyr, and lactofen caused stunting which ranged from 5 to 46 %. Imazapic and 2, 4 -DB caused the greatest stunting (44 to 99 %) and resulted in castor yields of 0 to 45 % of the untreated check. Acifluorfen, imazapic, imazethapyr, lactofen, and 2, 4 -DB controlled at least 80 % smellmelon (Cucumis melo L. var. Dudaim Naud.) while clethodim and fluazifop-P-butyl controlled at least 98 % Texas millet [Urochloa texana (<b>Buckl.)</b> R. Webster]. Imazapic and imazethapyr provided 57 to 75 % Texas millet control. Results suggest that castor tolerance to the graminicides, clethodim, and fluazifop-P-butyl is high; however, castor injury and yield reductions with the postemergence applications of broadleaf herbicides suggest that these herbicides {{should not be used}} in castor production...|$|E
40|$|Age {{accounted}} for over 70 % {{of the variation}} in tree height of 1 O- to 44 - year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and slash (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations established on deep sands, moderate sands, and nonsandy soils in the Northern Post-Oak Belt of Texas. Climatic and edaphic factors, relating either directly or indirectly to the amount of moisture available for tree use, explained up to 17 % of height growth variation. Height growth of the plantations was comparable to that of plantations growing in the pine-mixed hardwood forest cover type of East Texas. The Northern Post-Oak Belt of Texas is an area approximately 50 to 100 miles wide located between the pine-mixed hardwood forest type to the east and the blackland prairie to the west. Soils within the belt belong primarily to the Alfisol or Ultisol soil orders. The western-most areas of the belt receive up to 20 % less annual rain fall than the pine-mixed hardwood type of East Texas (U. S. Environmental Data and Information Service 1949 - 1982). The present forest of this area is dominated by post oak (Quercus stellate Wang.), blackjack oak (Quercus Marilandica Muench.), blue jack oak (Quercus incana Bartr.), and black hickory (Carya texana <b>Buckl.)</b> (Ward 1984).

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{effect of}} seedbed {{preparation}} on the emergence and survival of winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata (Gueldenstaedt)) and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides (Raf.) Swezey)) seedlings was determined, while quantifying nutritional changes through the dormant season for four range species. In November of 2004 twenty 9 m x 8 m plots were randomly prepared {{with one of}} four treatments (rip, harrow, till, or control) for both winterfat and squirreltail. Seed was hand broadcasted and chain harrowed to complete the seeding. Seedling counts were taken in June, July, August, and September 2005, and again in June of 2006. Mature perennial species, annual frequency, and soil moisture were also monitored in each plot. Concurrently, forage samples of winterfat, squirreltail, creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides (<b>Buckl.),</b> and Nuttall’s saltbush (Atriplex nuttallii (S. Wats.)) were collected for the months of November through April. Above ground biomass and fecal samples were also collected. Winterfat seedling emergence and survival was highest in the tilled treatments. Tilling treatments had the highest amount of soil moisture and reduced mature perennials and annual frequency better than the ripping, tilling, and control treatments. Squirreltail seedling emergence and survival did not differ between the treatments. However, surface roughness not provided by the tilled treatment may play {{a large role in}} capturing and providing microsite conditions necessary for natural recruitment. Analysis of the forage sampling showed crude protein to be the limiting factor for cattle to maintain fat reserves during the dormant season grazing period.

40|$|Local {{and overall}} instabilities {{of the steel}} beam occur in the hogging-moment region in a {{continuous}} composite beam (Figure 1) and these forms of buckling have been recognised to be highly interactive. The overall mode of <b>buckl</b> ing in composite steel-concrete tee-beams in regions of negative bending is what is herein te rmed restrained-distortio nal buckling (RDB). In negative bending the slab restrains the tension re gion of the steel and the neutral axis is not located at the mid-height of the web. The neutra l axis is shifted towards the top/tension flange, and in negative bending the steel region is subjected to predominantly compressive loading. In addition, the web usually carries proportionally higher shear loads than in ordinary steel beams. The lateral-distortional buckling resistance of th e steel portion in continuous composite beams is therefore dependent {{on the extent to}} which the web can provide a restraining action to the unstable compression flange. Although buckling of plain steel beams in both the elastic and inelastic ranges of structural response has been studied extensively and a great deal of research work has been devoted to the understanding of their buckling modes, and codes of practice for the design of structural steelwork contain relevant clauses that presently are considered to be quite accurate, buckling of the steel component in composite beams still repr esents a grey area in structural engineering research and is much less well documented. The bubble augmented spline finite strip method of analysis, developed by the authors, is thus employed herein to study extensively the issue of RDB in composite tee-beams in hogging bending regions...|$|E
40|$|Summary Individual {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) {{seedlings}} were grown in mesocosms with three densities of blue wild-rye grass (Elymus glaucus <b>Buckl.)</b> (equivalent to 0, 32 or 88 plants m– 2) {{to determine if}} the pres-ence of a natural competitor alters the response of ponderosa pine seedlings to ozone. After 3 years of ozone exposure, grass presence reduced total ponderosa pine dry mass by nearly 50 %, whereas ozone alone had no significant effect on ponder-osa pine growth. The combination of ozone and grass further reduced needle, stem and branch dry mass significantly below that induced by grass competition alone. Root:shoot ratios in-creased in response to the combined grass and ozone treat-ments. Grass competition significantly reduced soluble sugar concentrations in all ponderosa pine tissue components exam-ined. Starch concentrations were highly variable but did not differ significantly between treatments. Ozone significantly reduced soluble sugar concentrations in fine roots and stems. In the absence of grass, ozone-treated seedlings tended to have higher tissue N concentrations than controls. In the presence of grass, ozone-treated seedlings had lower N concentrations than controls, resulting in a significant interaction between these two stresses in 1 - and 2 -year-old needles. Needle C:N ratios de-creased in response to grass competition, as a result of in-creased N concentration and no change in C concentration. The opposite response was observed in ozone-treated seedlings as a result of decreased N concentrations, indicating that ozone-treated seedlings were unable to take up or retain as much ni-trogen when grown in the presence of grass. We conclude that ponderosa pine seedlings are more susceptible to ozone when grown in competition with blue wild-rye grass...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{reaction}} of solutions of the leuco dyes crystal violet lactone and N-benzoyl leuco methylene blue with acid-treated montmarillonite (as occurs with carbonless copying papers), most of the offered ye is intercalated within the interlayers of the montmorillonite structure remaining after acid attack. This phenomenon was demonstrated by XRD and also by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. During acid treatment, octahedral cations are dissolved from exposed edges of the montmorillonite lamellae and amorphous ilica builds up in these areas. As a result, the BET(N 2) specific surface area increases from ~ 60 mZ/g to ~ 300 mZ/g and, consequently, the theoretical reactivity towards leuco dyes. Nevertheless, only small quantities of the dye molecules are adsorbed onto the amorphous ilica. The excellent colour intensity and, in particular, the resistance to fading {{in the light of}} the montmorillonite dye complexes may be explained by the protected position of the dye molecules within the interlayers of the montmorillonite. Montmoril lonite is capable of intercalating organic molecules between its unit layers (Fahn, 1963) and such compounds with long-chain quaternary alkyl ammonium ions have attained much importance in the paint industry as thixotropic and thickening agents (Fahn & <b>Buckl,</b> 1968). Reactions of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite are also becoming important in their capacity as colour developers in the acceptor sheet of carbonless copying papers (von Raven & Fended, 1980; Fenderl &von Raven, 1982). The present paper describes the results of an investigation into {{the reaction}}s of dye molecules with acid-activated montmoril lonite to form light-resistant stable complexes. Particular aspects examined were the amount of dye uptake as a function of time, and the physical and chemical changes occurring in the acid-activated montmoril lonite as a result of dye adsorption...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources, Rangeland Resources and Wildland Soils, 2006 The {{effects of}} soil {{compaction}} on plant productivity have frequently {{been studied in}} the context of agriculture, but less information exists about this relationship {{in the context of}} rangeland resources. Domestic livestock grazing has been cited as contributing to soil compaction and loss of native species on rangelands. This study used a greenhouse experiment to identify the effects of soil compaction on the productivity of seedlings of Elymus glaucus <b>Buckl.</b> (blue wildrye), a native perennial grass. Compaction was characterized by bulk density and by soil strength as a function of bulk density and water content. Plants were grown in three levels of bulk density (1. 00, 1. 25, and 1. 55 g cm- 3) at three water potentials (- 33, - 500, and - 1500 kPa). Shoot production increased significantly at high water potential and moderate bulk density (ANOVA, p< 0. 05). Root production decreased significantly at high bulk density and low water potential (ANOVA, p< 0. 05). Soil strengths exceeding 3 MPa and 6 MPa were present in treatments producing the greatest shoot and root biomass, respectively. Similar, intermediate levels of production occurred across the range of bulk densities in this study and across a wide range of soil strength, suggesting that no threshold bulk density or soil strength exists that limits E. glaucus production. Biomass production was greatest when water was readily available. Negative effects of highly compacted soils were often less severe when water was available. This suggests the importance of water in biomass production {{as well as in the}} ability of plants to tolerate compacted soil. In field settings, where water availability may be highly variable, soil compaction as it affects water availability to plants may be more important in influencing E. glaucus establishment than physical impedance itself...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of cow age on botanical composition of diets in mountain riparian areas. Treatments consisted of 30 first-calf heifers, and 30 mature cows randomly assigned to four pastures (2 pastures/treatment, average 21. 5 ha) in a 2 -year study with a cross-over design. Botanical composition of diets was determined in fecal samples obtained from 10 animals in each treatment (5 per pasture) on the fourth week of 35 to 42 -days grazing periods using the microhistological technique. Crude protein (CP) content and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were determined, and correction factors were calculated for 22 major plant species. In digested samples, grasses were overestimated, whereas, all forbs but northern bedstraw (Galium boreale L.), were underestimated, and all shrub species were overestimated except common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus L.). Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) was highly overestimated after digestion. There was no difference between cattle age class in the total number of plant species found in the diets (p > 0. 10) averaging in 41 species. Most individual grass and grasslike species made up more than 5 % of the diets, while all individual forb, shrub, and tree species were minor components, not exceeding 5 %, except ponderosa pine. Western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rybd.) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespitosa (L.) Beauv.) accounted for over 10 % of the diets. Heifers consumed more (p p Juncus balticus Willd.), and pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens <b>Buckl.)</b> (p Poa pratensis L.) (p p < 0. 10), than in the diet of first calf heifers. In summary, mature cows appeared to have selected a diet that contained less grasses and more shrubs and trees compared to younger cows. </p...|$|E

Prescribed fire is used in Missouri to achieve various silvicultural goals, but the use of burning in upland Ozark forests raises many questions that research has yet to answer. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effects of prescribed burning on fire scars, overstory tree vigor, and ground flora vegetation. Data were collected from 22 burn units in five counties in the Missouri Ozark. Fire scar data were collected for Quercus alba L., Quercus coccinea Muench., Quercus shumardii <b>Buckl.,</b> Quercus stellata Waengh., Quercus velutina Lam., Carya spp. Nutt., and Pinus echinata Mill. Pinus echinata was the most resistant to fire scarring, and Quercus coccinea and Quercus shumardii were the least resistant. Regression analysis reveals that stem bark char height, a proxy for fire intensity, is the most effective postfire predictor of percentage of trees scarred and extent of scarring. Landscape features such as aspect, fetch, and slope steepness were also important predictors of extent of scarring for some species. Tree vigor in Quercus coccinea was negatively correlated with fire injury, but there was no difference in tree vigor in burned and unburned stands. Tree vigor of Quercus velutina was higher in burned stands, although the difference may not be biologically significant. Grass cover was highest in burned stands, and tree seedling cover was highest in stands burned one year before sampling. Models developed from this study can aid managers in assessment of potential injury to trees based on landscape features and fire intensity...|$|E
40|$|Urban landscapes require {{irrigation}} {{during periods}} of insufficient rainfall. Significant water use savings may be achieved if landscape irrigation is based on reference evapotranspiration (RET). The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine 1.) landscape crop coefficients (K[subscript L]) for landscapes comprised of different vegetation types, 2.) if regional climatic differences affect K[subscript L], and 3.) examine differences in leachate nutrient concentrations from the plant treatments. The K[subscript L] was determined from the ratio of actual evapotranspiration and a modified Penman equation reference. Irrigation quantity was based on 100 % replacement of RET. The K[subscript L] were determined for St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kutze. ] alone, Red Oak [Quercus shumardii <b>Buckl.</b> ] alone, St. Augustinegrass plus Red Oak, native grasses [Muhlenbergia capillaries (Lam.) Trin. and Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash], and native grasses plus Red Oak in College Station (CS) and San Antonio (SA) Texas, on a Rader fine sandy loam (mixed, semiactive, thermic Aquic Paleustalfs). Soil was systematically placed into lysimeters containing a drainage system and soil moisture probes. Lysimeters (1136 L) were placed in-ground in a randomized complete block design with three blocks. Soil moisture measurements were made at 0 to 20, 20 to 40, and 40 to 60 cm depths. The K[subscript L] was determined after a rainfall or irrigation event for periods of two to five days. Leachate was analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), ammonium, nitrate-N, orthophosphate-P, and alkalinity. During the growing seasons of 2007 and 2008, K[subscript L] in San Antonio increased from early-, to mid-, to late-season while in CS the K[subscript L] decreased from early-, to mid-, to late-season. Treatments with nativegrasses in SA had K[subscript L]'s as large as 0. 91 in late-season. In CS, soil sodium accumulation caused a decreasing seasonal K[subscript L]. Mean DOC concentration was not different between sites except for tree only treatment which was larger in SA. For mean DON concentrations between sites, only the St. Augustinegrass treatment was larger in CS than in SA. Orthophosphate-P concentrations were larger at SA under the tree alone, nativegrass, and St Augustine plus tree treatments than in CS. Ammonium concentration was similar by site for vegetative treatments...|$|E
