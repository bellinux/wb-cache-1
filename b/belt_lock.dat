5000|$|The {{purpose of}} locking {{retractors}} {{is to provide}} the seated occupant the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement {{in the event of}} a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called [...] "retractors" [...] equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat <b>belt</b> <b>lock.</b> A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.|$|E

40|$|When {{a vehicle}} is braking, the {{occupants}} {{are subjected to}} longitudinal forces which may influence their positions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to quantify the driver and passenger kinematics during medium harsh braking while driving in real traffic and to identify the influencing parameters. The overall motions were relatively small during braking and the effect of seat <b>belt</b> <b>locking</b> was obvious. Mean forward motions were 55 ± 26 mm for the chest and 97 ± 47 mm for the head. This study indicates that several properties influence forward motion. Taller volunteers had a larger forward motion; females had a larger forward motion than males of the same sitting height. Passengers exhibited larger motions than drivers for most of the volunteers. The result provides a deeper understanding of pre-impact conditions and adds knowledge to further improve the interaction of active and passive safety systems. It also provides valuable validation data for low-g occupant models, which can be used in studies of the effect of pre-impact braking on restraint interaction...|$|R

50|$|The {{practice}} of total sexual denial usually includes total avoidance of genital stimulation. This often {{involves the use}} of a physical barrier or device such as a chastity belt.

Depending on the situation, sexual arousal may still be possible regardless of physical barriers to genital stimulation. This, however, depends on the belt used.|$|R
50|$|The third safety {{advancement}} was {{the introduction}} of dual front lap-and-shoulder safety <b>belts</b> with emergency <b>locking</b> retractors for outboard occupants in 1975 for the 1976 model year. These replaced the outdated and inadequate lap belts previously used. A center lap safety belt with slack adjustment was provided for the center occupant. Ford and Dodge would follow one model year later adding lap-and-shoulder safety belts to their pickups.|$|R
50|$|A {{chastity}} <b>belt</b> is a <b>locking</b> item {{of clothing}} {{designed to prevent}} sexual intercourse or masturbation. Such belts were historically designed for women, ostensibly {{for the purpose of}} chastity, to protect women from rape or to dissuade women and their potential sexual partners from sexual temptation. Modern versions of the chastity belt are predominantly, but not exclusively, used in the BDSM community, and chastity belts are now designed for male wearers in addition to female wearers.|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} slab {{dynamics}} and intraplate stresses in postcollisional times creates large near-surface deformation, particularly in highly bent orogens with significant lateral variations in mechanical properties. This deformation is expressed through abnormal foredeep geometries and contrasting patterns of vertical movements. Intraplate folding {{is often the}} controlling mechanism, particularly when the orogenic <b>belt</b> is <b>locked.</b> The study of these tectonic processes in the SE Carpathians indicates a generalized subsidence period during latest Miocene-Pliocene times driven by the slab-pull and an intraplate folding due to an overall Quaternary inversion. The latter accommodates - 5 km ESE-ward movement of this area {{with respect to the}} neighboring units, which creates complicated three-dimensional deformation patterns potentially driven at a larger scale by the interaction between the Adriatic indentor and the entire Carpathians system. The lithospheric anisotropy inherited from the subduction times concentrates strain and induces large-scale deformation far away from the active plate margins. This anisotropy is dynamic because of deep mantle processes related to the subducted slab during postcollisional times, such as thermal reequilibration or increase in slab dip.

5000|$|You Stand Still! No, You Stand Still! (くらくら鍵パッカン) - Two players, one - a male {{dressed in}} comedic drag as a bride {{and the other}} as a groom - start out {{spinning}} in chairs to get dizzy. After the chairs stop spinning, the players must cross a narrow balance beam over a pool of flour {{and a pair of}} spinning floor tiles. They cross to the opposite chair where one player gets a set of keys while the other gets a heart-shaped <b>belt</b> with a <b>lock.</b> The latter player puts the belt on and the two return to the center spinning tiles. While standing on the spinning tiles, the player with the keys must find the correct one to unlock the belt, and then both must return to their original chairs. The team to complete the game in the fastest time wins the game and a big prize.|$|R
50|$|The eight-man {{main event}} {{was the result}} of several {{interlinking}} feuds. As winner of the Royal Rumble, Stone Cold Steve Austin earned the right to a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XIV against incumbent Shawn Michaels. Following the Montreal Screwjob, Owen Hart disappeared from WWF programming only to reappear at In Your House: D-Generation X attacking Michaels. He then went on to attack Triple H, demanding a European Championship match, which Hunter declined on the grounds of a fractured kneecap injury. Hunter eventually agreed to the match on January 26's Raw is War; he sent down the Artist Formerly Known as Goldust (who was dressing up in various disguises each week) with the belt and Luna Vachon as Chyna. After Hart won the match, WWF Commissioner Slaughter declared the disguise so convincing, that he upheld the decision and Owen won the belt. After tormenting the New Age Outlaws, the hardcore tag team of Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie opened Raw with a match to display the king of hardcore wrestling but after Jack elbow dropped Charlie inside a dumpster the Outlaws appeared, locked the dumpster shut and wheeled it off the stage, resulting in the pair being hospitalized. The two reappeared later in the night after Austin's match with Road Dogg ended in disqualification by virtue of interference from D-Generation X, who tied Austin up in the rings until Jack and Charlie came to his aid. The week before the event Austin stole the championship <b>belt</b> and <b>locked</b> up Los Boricuas, who were employed to help retrieve it. Following a stand off the ring between Austin and DX with the Outlaws, Chainsaw Charlie chainsawed his way from below the ring, appearing with Cactus Jack and Hart ran in through the crowd.|$|R
5000|$|Batman's {{utility belt}} is his most {{characteristic}} prop, much like Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth, or Green Lantern's ring. The exact contents of this belt {{are not known}} because Batman usually changes it to suit his needs. His uncanny ability to carry unusually appropriate tools is legendary. Batman's enemies are especially interested in the utility belt as they believe it will give them an advantage over him, but the <b>belt's</b> compartments are <b>locked</b> and only Batman knows how to open them. There {{have been a few}} instances where the security has been bypassed: In the Justice League episode [...] "Injustice for All", Lex Luthor managed to open the belt by subjecting it to intense electrical shocks and in an episode of The Batman [...] "The Cat and the Bat" [...] Catwoman stole Batman's utility belt and managed to open the capsules. The utility belt is depicted as having defense mechanisms such as electric shock, locks, marker paint, or stun gas in order to prevent tampering. The belt is almost always yellow in color, and the look of the belt is usually depicted as having either capsule-like cylinders or military style pouches to store his equipment in.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} Mk2 Golf, Volkswagen {{did not make}} a {{convertible}} version of the Mk4 Golf. Instead, they face-lifted the front bumper, fenders, grille, and hood to resemble Mk4 Golf styling but to fit a Mk3 chassis. VW managed to incorporate some non-structural Mk4 parts as well such as fender repeaters, headlights, side mirror caps, rear license tag lights, 3-spoke steering wheel airbag, etc. The rear also received a redesigned bumper with the number plate tub moved from the hatch and a Mk4 handle with a larger VW emblem above it to resemble the rear of a Mk4 Golf. The interior largely remained the same as a Mk3 interior save for a Mk4 style 3-spoke leather steering wheel, a textured dashboard (also known as [...] "dimpled dash" [...] or [...] "shark skin dash"), heavily bolstered front seats with incorporated side airbags, and the hazard switch relocated from the steering column to the instrument panel. The interior lighting in the cabin was switched to the blue and red hue found in the Mk4 and some of the more familiar Mk3 parts were chromed such as the inner door handles, emergency brake button, door strikers, front seat <b>belt</b> anchors, key <b>lock</b> cylinders, and shifter button in automatic transmission equipped cars. There are some technical carryovers, as well, the main one being the immobilizer and engine computer from the Mk4 Golf being used with the older Mk3 engine mechanicals.|$|R
50|$|Dhruva's {{utility belt}} {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} and defining characteristic of the character's appearance as well the character's most useful and important tool in his crime fighting sojourn. Dhruva's belt has evolved over the years from a simple leather belt to a leather utility belt with pouches to a metallic utility belt. In its current version, Dhruva's utility belt is a metallic <b>belt</b> with inbuilt <b>locking</b> system to make sure that no one can easily pull it off or cut it as against his older leather belt. The star shaped buckle has an inbuilt transmitter which enables Dhruva to stay in contact with commando headquarters, police force and even some of his allies including Chandika. Dhruva is known to carry a lot of utility items in his belt pockets. The various items that he has been shown to carry in his utility belt at various times include, but are not limited to, spare cartridges for star-blades and star-lines, acid capsules, signal flares, star cuffs (star shaped handcuffs), a make-up kit and many more items. Dhruva also carries a special transmitter fixed at 'Brahmand Rakshak' frequency which enables him to stay in contact with the Brahmand Rakshak headquarters as well as the other members of Brahmand Rakshak team. On some occasions he has been shown to carry a separate Brahmand Rakshak transmitter while on the other occasions it has been shown to be integrated with Dhruva's personal star-transmitter. Dhruva also carries a radiation sensor which is either fitted in his collar button or sometimes in his belt and blinks whenever there is threat of hazardous level of radiation exposure.|$|R

The surveys are, therefore, very specific in nature and the subjects covered diverse. The Data Archive holds 19 such surveys. Readers are asked to note that, {{with the exception of the}} surveys on the Telephone Service - 69004, 69016, respondents surveyed are self selected from subscribers to the Association's magazine Which? and so the surveys cannot singly be used in descriptive accounts of the British public. Surveys 69005 - 69012 cover various aspects of the housing experiences of Which? readers who moved house in 1967 and 1968. It is here particularly important to remember that the choice strategies and the resources of Which? readers are unlikely to be typical. Main Topics : Data include: make of seat belt; year purchased; type of harness (3 categories); method of fastening (5 categories); method of unfastening (5 categories); how and where in the car the reel is mounted; location of belts in car; who fitted belts; why respondent decided to fit belts and why he chose automatic seat belts as opposed to ordinary belts. Use of belt: how often respondent wears seat belt on a journey of up to/more than 20 miles; whether respondent makes a special point of wearing belt on a particular type of journey (e. g. motorway) whether there is any type of journey on which respondent has hardly ever worn belt. A section is included on performance of the <b>belt</b> (i. e. <b>locking</b> performance, performance of belt in accident, where possible, comfort for wearer, ease of fastening and unfastening buckles, record of any faults that have occurred etc.). Background Variables Details of car (i. e. make, model, year, number of doors, number of people who often drive car, type of front seats), physical details of respondent (i. e. height, sex, build, age cohort) and driving details (i. e. approximate number of miles driven per year, number of journeys of over 20 miles and respondent's previous experience of ordinary seat belts) ...|$|R
