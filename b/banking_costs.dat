The first strand is related to <b>bank</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency; the other is related to earnings management. Employing the findings reported in bank earnings management literature, this study argues that <b>bank</b> observed total <b>cost</b> ("accounting cost") may be the biased estimator of the true total cost.

We propose a method to modify accounting cost, which is referred to as "economic cost", to be consistent with the economic theory; that is, one that is free of cost management. Both accounting and economic costs are then adopted to analyze the efficiency of 29 commercial banks in Taiwan banking industry.

We find that loans and holdings of reserves affect <b>banking</b> <b>costs</b> to a small but significant extent. Furthermore, shocks to reserve holdings are found to contribute more to variations in the policy rate, inflation and output than shocks to the feedback rule for the policy rate. Hence, holdings of central bank money, which is typically neglected in the literature, plays a substantial role for macroeconomics dynamics.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a fast-paced dynamic environment {{in the business world}} in general, and in the financial services sector in particular, has highlighted the significance of competition and efficiency. The need for deregulation has become a touchstone of success in fostering both competition and efficiency especially in the economies, which are exposed to structural reforms. In addition to that, intense competition both among domestic and foreign banks, rapid speed of innovations and introduction of new financial instruments, changing consumer’s demands and desire for product augmentation have changed the way a bank conducts business and services its customers. Larger the degree of competition, it is perceived that the firms would become more efficient. However, when the structure of an industry is product of the government regulations, the degree of competition is impaired markedly implying that the efficiency suffers negatively. Banking industry acts as life-blood of modern trade and commerce acting as a bridge to provide a major source of financial intermediation. Thus, appraisal of its efficiency is vital in context of an efficient and competitive financial system. Study of x-efficiency is believed to be important in particular as Berger, et al. (1993) found that x-inefficiencies account for around 20 percent or more of <b>banking</b> <b>costs.</b> Similarly, recent drive among banks towards downsizing, rightsizing and rationalisation of <b>banking</b> <b>costs</b> also implicates for the assessment of x-efficiency analysis of banks.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the quality of property rights institutions (PRIs) and bank financial performance in an empirical study of 136 countries over the period 1999 to 2006. Design/methodology/approach – The quality of property rights institutions (PRIs) and financial accounting based measures of bank performance are obtained from the Economic Freedom of the World Project (Gwartney et al., 2006), the Polity IV Project, the World Bank data indicators database and the International Monetary Fund. Several multiple regression analyses are conducted to test the study hypotheses. Findings – Our results reveal that the quality of legal structure and security of property rights institutions positively (negatively) affects both <b>bank</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency (inefficiency) and profitability. The presence of a quality political structure negatively (positively) affects <b>bank</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency (inefficiency). The quality of political structure has no direct impact on bank profitability. The impact of PRIs on <b>bank</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency is more evident in the upper middle and high income group of countries than in the low and lower middle income group of countries. An appropriate level of PRI quality is essential to achieve both competition and development. Practical implications – The paper highlights policy implications for international policy makers, regulators and the management of banks who are interested in banking sector development across countries.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{credit risk}} transfer in banking. Specifically, we model loan sales and loan insurance (e. g. credit default swaps) {{as the two}} instruments of risk transfer. Recent empirical {{evidence suggests that the}} adverse selection problem is as relevant in loan insurance as it is in loan sales. Contrary to previous literature, this paper allows for informational asymmetries in both markets. We show how credit risk transfer can achieve optimal investment and minimize the social costs associated with excess risk taking by a bank. Furthermore, we find that no separation of loan types can occur in equilibrium. Our results show that a well capitalized bank will tend to use loan insurance regardless of loan quality in the presence of moral hazard and relationship <b>banking</b> <b>costs</b> of loan sales. Finally, we show that a poorly capitalized bank may be forced into the loan sales market, even in the presence of possibly significant relationship and moral hazard costs that can depress the selling price. credit risk transfer, banking, loan sales, loan insurance, credit derivatives...|$|E
