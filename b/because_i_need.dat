500|$|On November 24, 2014, Sandoval [...] {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the Boston Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out. The deal was officially announced on November 25. Sandoval said, [...] "It was a tough decision for me. It {{took me a long time}} to be sure that I was going to make the right decision... But I want a new challenge. I made that choice to be here in Boston <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> a new challenge." [...] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval batted [...]245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first full season in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Creep" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in the key of C minor with Watkins and Thomas' vocals ranging from the chords of C4 to F5. [...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only cause I need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just keep it on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook as if she is [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} release under Pipe Records, Far From Silent, Joseph {{explored}} {{the complications of}} fame and fortune, in the second track [...] "Celebrity". The eighth track, entitled [...] "The Good in Me is Dead", written in {{the perspective of a}} Kosovo refugee in light of the Balkan atrocities, reflects Joseph's penchant for writing about social tragedies and injustice. [...] "The prime motive in the instant that I pick up the guitar is a selfish one," [...] Joseph says. [...] "It's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to deal with the world. I'm in the world and it's horrible, and what can I do? I'm just getting this stuff out of my system as it were." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{separate}} interview, Jackson stated that {{while on the}} surface Lucky may not want the child to be his, deep down he thinks {{a part of the}} character does. Elizabeth hopes Lucky is the father, thinking {{it is the only way}} she can salvage their relationship, and has a difficult time coming to terms with Lucky not wanting her anymore. After Lucky finds her suffering from hypothermia in the church where they said their vows as teenagers, and later has to talk her down off the roof of the hospital, she is sent to Shadybrook sanitarium. This prompts Lucky to be gentler about his anger, and to stop drinking before suffering a serious relapse. Jackson explained: [...] "The crisis that's going on with Elizabeth, the fact that Cam and Jake don't have a mother right now, I think that sort of wakes Lucky up to say, 'I need to get my stuff together <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> to be present for those kids.'" [...] Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, and they believe Nikolas to be the father due to Helena tampering with the DNA test. Aiden is kidnapped by Franco, forcing Lucky to work together with Nikolas, which starts to repair their relationship. Still feeling lost, Lucky accepts an undercover assignment to pose as an Irish hitman named Ronan O'Reilly, coincidentally his doppelgänger. Lucky works to take down [...] "The Balkan", and meets Siobhan McKenna (Chambers), who initially puts an end to his romantic bad luck streak. They face trouble when Siobhan is blackmailed by The Balkan and hides it from Lucky, who is sensitive to betrayal after Elizabeth's affair. They eventually plan a green card marriage so that she can stay in the country with him. During their first ceremony, Lucky learns his son Jake has been in a hit-and-run accident, that eventually renders him braindead. Jake's death sets another string of tragic events in motion. Lucky finds out his father was the driver, and accuses Luke of driving drunk. Lucky is adamant that his father is an alcoholic, but Luke refutes that Lucky wants to blame the alcohol so that he does not have to blame him. Lucky eventually stages an intervention, which only angers Luke. Lucky tracks Luke down to the brothel where Luke grew up, but when Luke tells Lucky that it liberated him to kill Jake, Lucky leaves. Distraught, he burns down his childhood home, accidentally injuring Siobhan. Elizabeth finds Lucky and tells him that he is Aiden's father, stopping Lucky from drinking. In May 2011, Jackson spoke of the unending turmoil in Lucky's life: ...|$|E

She was careful to record, however, that she did not perform the usual duties of a priest, [...] "because I was a foreigner, a woman, untrained in temple procedures, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> the years left me to carry on the work of spreading Zen to the west." ...|$|R

500|$|All of {{the many}} {{elements}} in the dream sequences have meaning, {{with the exception of}} the Cheese Man. Whedon explains: [...] "...the Cheese Man—meaningless.

In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning.

6000|$|Dear Mary Louise: How {{good you}} are! I {{positively}} need {{a change of}} scene and a rest, so I'm coming. To-morrow--by the train to Chargrove.

I haven't an idea what your [...] "mystery" [...] is, of course, but if it enables me to test {{any one of the}} O'Gorman theories (a theory is merely a stepping-stone to positive information) I shall bless you forever. And that reminds me: I'm coming as a sewing girl, to help you fix over some summer gowns. You're anxious to give me the work, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> it, but as we're rather chummy I'm half servant and half companion. (I hate sewing and make the longest stitches you ever saw!) Moreover, I'm Josie Jessup. I'm never an O'Gorman while I'm working on a mystery; it wouldn't do at all. Explain this to dear old Gran'pa Jim.|$|E
6000|$|She scornfully withdrew. In {{her absence}} I began {{to beg for}} Zillah's place at the Heights, {{offering}} to resign mine to her; but he would suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time, allowed himself a glance round the room {{and a look at}} the pictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton's, he said--'I shall have that home. Not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> it, but--' He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued, with what, {{for lack of a better}} word, I must call a smile--'I'll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again--it is hers yet!--he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton's side, damn him! I wish he'd been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine out too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us he'll not know which is which!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{to hasten}} to add however that, happy stopgaps as the minor scale had thus yielded, the {{instance}} in hand should enjoy {{the advantage of}} the full range of the major; since most immediately to the point was the question of that SUPPLEMENT of situation logically involved in our gentleman's impulse to deliver himself in the Paris garden on the Sunday afternoon--or if not involved by strict logic then all ideally and enchantingly implied in it. (I say [...] "ideally," [...] <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> scarce mention that for development, for expression of its maximum, my glimmering story was, at the earliest stage, to have nipped the thread of connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker. HE remains but the happiest of accidents; his actualities, all too definite, precluded any range of possibilities; it had only been his charming office to project upon that wide field of the artist's vision--which hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended for the figures of a child's magic-lantern--a more fantastic and more moveable shadow.) No privilege of the teller of tales and the handler of puppets is more delightful, or has more of the suspense and the thrill of a game of difficulty breathlessly played, than just this business of looking for the unseen and the occult, in a scheme half-grasped, by the light or, so to speak, by the clinging scent, of the gage already in hand. No dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave with bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever, for [...] "excitement," [...] I judge, have bettered it at its best. For the dramatist always, by the very law of his genius, believes not only in a possible right issue from the rightly-conceived tight place; he does much more than this--he believes, irresistibly, in the necessary, the precious [...] "tightness" [...] of the place (whatever the issue) on the strength of any respectable hint. It being thus the respectable hint that I had with such avidity picked up, what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the centre? It is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the [...] "story," [...] with the omens true, as I say, puts on from this stage the authenticity of concrete existence. It then is, essentially--it begins to be, though it may more or less obscurely lurk, so that the point is not in the least what to make of it, but only, very delightfully and very damnably, where to put one's hand on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay! I was not {{thinking}} of betraying Your Eminence, nor the trap which you set for me, into which I was full willing to fall.

It worked all the way to a Grammy, which was kind of surprising. It was a lot of fun. I stopped singing it for awhile, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> a little perspective on it. But now I sing it again, and it’s kinda fun." ...|$|R

She wrote: Bob was charismatic: he was a beacon, a lighthouse, he was also a black hole.
