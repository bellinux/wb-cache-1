However, its origin had not yet <b>been</b> <b>understood.</b> In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America.|$|E

5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has <b>been</b> <b>understood</b> by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{specific}} ancestry of Heraclius the Elder, but this has not prevented modern historians from speculating on the matter. Cyril Mango has supported a theory which suggests {{that he was a}} namesake descendant of Heraclius of Edessa, a 5th-century Roman general. A passage from Sebeos's History has <b>been</b> <b>understood</b> to suggest an Arsacid origin of Heraclius the Elder. This theory was strongly supported by Cyril Toumanoff, while considered likely by Alexander Vasiliev and Irfan Shahîd. John of Nikiû and Constantine Manasses seem to consider his son, Heraclius the Younger, to be a Cappadocian, which might indicate his place of birth rather than actual ancestry.|$|E

The usage of the hieroglyphic script had become increasingly specialised even in the later Pharaonic period; by the 4th century CE, few Egyptians were capable of reading them. Monumental use of hieroglyphs ceased after the closing of all non-Christian temples in 391 by Roman Emperor TheodosiusI; the last known inscription is dated to , found at Philae and known as the Graffito of Esmet-Akhom.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, {{four-horned antelope}}s may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not <b>been</b> <b>understood</b> well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently <b>been</b> <b>understood</b> by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E
