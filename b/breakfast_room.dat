5|$|Beginning in 1747, Fownes Luttrell made {{numerous}} and significant alterations to Dunster Castle, redecorating and redesigning {{it in the}} Rococo style. He renovated the Great Parlour, converted a bedroom over it into a Drawing Room in 1758, created a <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Room</b> over the Hall in 1772, remodelled {{the southern part of}} the castle, and altered the Great Staircase in 1773. His changes to the décor of the castle are also noteworthy, particularly for his use of newly-fashionable wallpaper.|$|E
5|$|With its oak {{panels and}} other decor recalling an earlier time, {{the heyday of}} cabaret, the Oak Room was small, intimate, and {{expensive}} (at least $100 per person, more if one had dinner, except for matinees), and was not a big moneymaker for the Algonquin. Part of the space occupied by the former Oak Room was used to enlarge the Blue Bar, the rest was converted into a private <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> for Marriott Reward Elite customers.|$|E
5|$|The three story rectory {{took three}} years to complete. On the first floor, there is a dining room, a <b>breakfast</b> <b>room,</b> a kitchen, a pantry, space for archives, a laundry room, and a three car garage. There are four {{separate}} stairways that lead {{up to the second}} floor. The second floor has three offices, a community room, a large library, and a spacious veranda. In the hallway, there is a large stained glass window made in Germany, but repurposed from the Mellon Mansion. The third floor can be reached from either of two stairwells. The floor has ten rooms divided into four apartments and two guestrooms. This floor also has an open veranda.|$|E
50|$|Accommodation can {{be found}} at {{traditionally}} built hotels, as well as at many bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> in traditional homes.|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} between the two world wars, there was a {{delicatessen}} shop and a coffee shop with <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> on the ground floor.|$|R
5000|$|The village pub, the Coach & Horses, {{dates back}} to 1762. The pub was {{recently}} refurbished and converted the former thatched village Fire station into bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> - see http://www.activehotels.com/1/1/1260076-coach-horses-sutton-scotney.html ...|$|R
25|$|Above Taylor's vaulted kitchen, {{between the}} Pillared Room and the State Dining room, Soane created a Smaller Dining Room (sometimes called the <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Room)</b> that still exists. To build it, Soane removed the chimney {{from the kitchen}} to put a door in the room. He then moved the chimney to the east side, running a Y-shaped split flue inside the walls up either side {{of one of the}} windows above. The room {{therefore}} has a unique architectural feature: over the fireplace there is a window instead of the usual chimney breast.|$|E
25|$|The Green Drawing Room {{is between}} the Octagon Drawing room and the new kitchen. It had always {{previously}} {{been used as a}} <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> or small dining room, less formal than the Dining Room itself. When the National Trust took over management of the house, the room was refurnished and displayed as a drawing room. The room has a moulded plaster neoclassical ceiling and is hung with green silk which was formerly curtains at Englefield House, Berkshire. The white marble fireplace in this room {{is one of the few}} original to the house.|$|E
25|$|The Breakfast Room: A private small low-ceilinged room on {{the rustic}} floor of the south front. In the 18th century this was the house's only bathroom; more of an indoor {{swimming}} pool, the sunken plunge pool was heated and the room decorated in the Pompeian style complete with Corinthian columns. Converted by the Russian Countess of Pembroke to a <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> circa 1815, it is today wallpapered in a Chinese design, the paper being an exact copy of that used in the original 1815 decoration of the room. The 18th century furniture of a simulated-bamboo, Gothic style gives this private dining room a distinct oriental atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|A general store, {{built in}} 1915, overlooks the river. The store is restored, and open weekends. Bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> are upstairs. Riverboats of past decades were {{dependable}} local transportation, and would stop for passengers or freight if hailed from the shore.|$|R
50|$|Daily {{needs are}} ensured by three grocery markets, one {{clothing}} discounter, one hairdresser, one florist’s shop, two bakeries with cafés, eleven winemakers, one hotel with a restaurant, two inns, many bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> and flats, four medical practices and one veterinary clinic.|$|R
25|$|Jane and Louise Wilson then studied {{together}} on the MA course at Goldsmiths College, London (1990-1992). When they left art school, they lived in King's Cross and made films of small living spaces, such as bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms.</b> Another early film showed them taking LSD for the first time.|$|R
25|$|The more {{domestic}} {{rooms of}} No. 13 {{are at the}} front of the house, many of them highly unusual, but often in subtle ways. The domed ceiling of the <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Room,</b> inset with convex mirrors, has influenced architects from around the world. The Library-Dining Room reflects the influence of Etruscan tombs and perhaps even gothic design in its repertoire of small pendants like those in fan vaulting. It is decorated in a rich 'Pompeian' red. The Study contains a collection of Roman architectural fragments and the two external courtyards, the Monument Court and Monk's Yard contain an array of architectural fragments, Classical in the Monument Court with its central column or 'pasticcio' representing Architecture and Gothic in the Monk's Yard, filled with medieval stonework from the Palace of Westminster.|$|E
25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a <b>breakfast</b> <b>room.</b> A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E
500|$|After Smith's death, Lennon {{insisted on}} wearing a large {{overcoat}} {{that had belonged}} to Smith, and even though it became worn and threadbare, Lennon wore it throughout his art college years. [...] Mimi never used the downstairs sitting rooms again after Smith's death (only using the <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> and the kitchen) and never replaced the furniture, which became old and faded. Lennon continued to live at Mendips (and also for a time with his first wife Cynthia Lennon) until his early 20s, before moving to London.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} {{reachable}} via the scenic A477 road. The village was famously {{the home of}} Griffith Jones, the 18th century Christian educator who was funded by Bridget Bevan. Among the local attractions are the ruins of St Clears castle. Some rental cottages are available in Llanddowror, as are some Bed & <b>Breakfast</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Trereife House (pronounced Treave) is a grade II listed {{manor house}} located {{west of the}} town of Penzance in Cornwall, England, UK. The house was built in the 18th century and has two storeys and a hipped roof with dormer windows. Today the house is open for day {{visitors}} and also offers bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When it {{was built}} in 1869, it {{replaced}} the earlier 1838 lighthouse. Its Coast Guard service was ended in 1954. [...] It is currently managed by the non-profit Saugerties Lighthouse Conservancy which purchased the lighthouse in 1986 and has restored it. The conservancy manages the nature trail leading to the lighthouse, offers two bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> and public tours. A small museum displays artifacts of the original lighthouse and the restoration efforts, as well as the history of the Saugerties waterfront.|$|R
500|$|The {{dining room}} {{had a high}} {{wainscot}} of mahogany, paneled in rectangles, above which is a broad tapestry frieze. The ceiling is beamed with closely set beams, and the cornice is mahogany like the other woodwork. The room is lighted by the cluster of lights applied to the wainscot. The house's pantry was [...] "as large as many New York apartments", had a counter and wash bowls and large rows of glazed closets around other walls. The kitchen and serving room had a refrigerator and were well stocked and equipped. The <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> was green and white, with woodwork painted white and walls covered in Nile green cloth; it had a wood mantel with facings of mottled white marble, also imported from Italy. Adjoining is the morning-room, finished in quartered oak, with walls papered in red stripes of two shades, has a quartered oak wainscot and white cornice, curtains and furniture are red and gold.|$|E
2500|$|With its flat unadorned ceiling, simple {{mouldings}} {{and deep}} window seats, the Small Dining Room is intimate and comfortable. Usually furnished with a mahogany table seating only eight, Prime Ministers have often used this room when dining with family or when entertaining special guests on more personal state occasions. (See the Small Dining or <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Room</b> c1927. The double doors behind the table {{lead to the}} State Dining Room.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The park Naturalist's Residence {{is located}} between the Superintendent's Residence {{and the other}} {{employee}} houses near {{the north end of}} the historic district. The building’s footprint is the same as the Superintendent's Residence; however, the floor plan is slightly different. This first floor contained a living room with stone fireplace, a kitchen, <b>breakfast</b> <b>room,</b> bedroom, and bathroom. There are three additional bedrooms and a bath room upstairs. [...] Today, the building houses part of the park’s Science and Learning Center.|$|E
50|$|Valley Wing {{also has}} its own private {{entrance}} and driveway, reception area, function room - the State Room - and private <b>breakfast</b> dining <b>room</b> - the Summit Room - for guests staying at the wing.|$|R
50|$|A.W. Sanders went on {{to build}} many of the {{neighborhood}} homes in the craftsman and Tudor styles, with small garages standing behind them. The picturesque wood-sided and brick and stone cottages had a charming, storybook quality about them. Even today, fine examples of stained glass {{can be seen in}} many windows, as well as unique brick and stone work. Many interiors boast archways, hardwood flooring, cheerful bathrooms and galley kitchens with quaint <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> and built-in cabinetry sparkling with beveled mirrors and stained glass. Some fireplace mantels display multiple types of wood and are flanked by built-in bookcases, which were favorite gestures of the builder.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} as the Big Yellow House and is the most {{prominent}} historic house on Absarokee's main avenue, Woodward St. [...] In 2013 it is operated much like a bed & <b>breakfast,</b> with <b>rooms</b> and a cottage available for rent.|$|R
2500|$|Cosway {{also showed}} an {{interest}} in French politics. In 1797, then living on Oxford Street in London, she commissioned artist Francesco Cossia to create {{what was to be}} the first portrait of Napoleon seen in England. Cosway may have been the first person in Britain to see the face of Napoleon. Her commission of the portrait would later be called the [...] "earliest recorded evidence of British admiration for Napoleon." [...] Later acquired by Sir John Soane, the painting is displayed in the <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Room</b> of Sir John Soane's Museum.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin Latrobe's 1803 {{drawing of}} the White House's first floor {{indicates}} that the Red Room served as [...] "the President's Antichamber" [...] (sic) for the president's [...] "Library & Cabinet" [...] next door in {{the location of the}} present State Dining Room. During the administration of John Adams, it served as a <b>breakfast</b> <b>room.</b> Jefferson kept a caged magpie in the room. During the James Madison administration, the antechamber became the [...] "Yellow Drawing Room" [...] and the scene of Dolley Madison's fashionable Wednesday night receptions. [...] Dolley ordered a piano she particularly wanted, along with red velvet curtains for the room.|$|E
2500|$|The three {{upper floors}} are used {{exclusively}} by the club. The first of them contains a large hall which opens both {{into the front}} and rear reception rooms and parlors, which, in turn, communicate. From each of these rooms a door leads to the library, which extends through from the front to the rear. [...] On the second floor, in addition to a room over the library, there is a billiard hall in the front and a <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> in the rear with the kitchen over the main hall of the floor beneath. [...] Nearly the whole of the top floor is taken up by a large banquet hall, vaulted by handsome rafters.|$|E
50|$|One {{real-estate}} writer {{explains the}} successful formula for McMansions: symmetrical structures on clear-cut lots with Palladian windows centered over the main entry and brick or stone enhancing the driveway entrance, plus multiple chimneys, dormers, pilasters, and columns - and inside, the master suite with dressing rooms and bath-spa, great <b>rooms,</b> <b>breakfast</b> and dining <b>rooms,</b> showplace kitchen, and extra high and wide garages for multiple cars and SUVs.|$|R
50|$|Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke of Warwick married Doddington's granddaughter. His brother {{inherited}} the property upon {{his death in}} 1676. Francis Greville, great-grandson of the brother, was Earl of Warwick and 8th Baron Brook. The manor was held by the Grevilles, visited only occasionally, made only minor modifications, and sold to the Franklen family in the 18th century. Between 1806 and 1808, Sir John Nicholl resided at the manor while his manor was built. Candleston Castle was sold by Richard Franklen to Nichol in 1830, when it {{was said to have}} included a drawing <b>room,</b> dining <b>room,</b> <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms,</b> four bedrooms, a coach house. It was evacuated in the 19th century, after having operated as a farm house.|$|R
60|$|We {{drove through}} the cold grey {{twilight}} to the Rue de St. Antoine, where Feurgéres' apartments were. To my surprise servants were at hand expecting us, and I was shown at once into a suite of rooms, in {{one of which was}} a great marble bath all ready for use. Some coffee and a change of clothes were brought me. All my wants seemed to have been anticipated and provided for. I had always imagined Feurgéres to be a man of very simple and homely tastes, but there were no traces of it in his home. He showed me some of the rooms while we waited for <b>breakfast,</b> <b>rooms</b> handsomely furnished and decorated, full of art treasures and curios of many sorts collected from many countries.|$|R
2500|$|The corps de logis (central block) {{is built}} on the three floors. In the 18th century, such floors (known, because of their outer brickwork, as [...] "the Rustic") would {{have been used by}} both the owners and their servants. The Rustic {{contained}} the wine cellars, Servants' Hall, estate offices, and secondary reception rooms. This is very much the case at Basildon where the former Servants' Hall is now the ground floor visitors' tea room and the former Summer <b>Breakfast</b> <b>Room</b> (beneath the Octagon Drawing Room) which later saw service as a billiard room, is now a lecture room for the mansion's paying visitors. The lower hall, beneath the first floor hall, was the everyday entrance to the mansion for the family.|$|E
2500|$|Surviving {{parts of}} the former Hotel Esplanade have been {{incorporated}} into {{the north side of}} the Sony development, including the Kaisersaal which, in a complex and costly operation in March 1996, was moved in one piece (all 1,300 tonnes of it), some 75 metres from its former location, to the spot that it occupies today (it even had to make two right-angled turns during the journey, while maintaining its own orientation). Nearby is a new Café Josty, opened early in 2001, while between the two is [...] "Josty's Bar," [...] which is housed in the Esplanade's former <b>breakfast</b> <b>room.</b> This, like the Kaisersaal, had to be relocated, but here the room was dismantled into some 500 pieces to be reassembled where it stands now.|$|E
2500|$|Following a {{neighborhood}} fundraiser in May 1976, Mr. and Mrs. DeCaro resumed their extensive reconstruction. [...] The restoration returned the front elevation to its 1906 design yet retained most alterations {{made by the}} Hills towards the rear, including the enclosed porches and enlarged kitchen wing. [...] In cases where blueprints differed from historic photographs, the owners chose to follow Wright's plans. [...] For instance, the main chimney was known to have always been exposed brick, yet was stuccoed in the reconstruction per Wright's original plans. [...] Inside, some changes were made to accommodate the DeCaro's modern lifestyle. [...] On the main level, an updated kitchen replaced the <b>breakfast</b> <b>room</b> and pantry. [...] On the second floor, several walls were moved to widen the hallway {{and to create a}} master suite in place of two front bedrooms (see post-reconstruction plans at right). [...] On the third floor tight servants quarters were exchanged for a single bedroom suite. For their part in the restoration, the Oak Park Landmarks Commission voted in 1977 to rename the completed structure as the Hills-DeCaro House.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hot springs}} {{are one of}} the major attractions in Benton, as well as fine bed and <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> and {{overnight}} soaking tubs. With the abandonment of travelers' services at nearby Montgomery Pass, it offers the only lodging, restaurant and gas station services within a 30-mile (50 km) radius. There are several old mines in the surrounding hills that have also been a source of interest to tourists as well as the hiking and mountain biking trails in the area. Many of the original buildings from the old mine town still exist and are open to exploration, including the cemetery. [...] Benton is a departure point for hiking to Nevada high point Boundary Peak via a (rough) 2WD road to Queen Mine at 9,200 ft (2,800m) or a 4WD extension to Kennedy Saddle at 9,900 ft (3,020m).|$|R
60|$|Quest {{slept for}} a couple of hours, had a bath and made a leisurely toilet. At a quarter to nine he sat down to <b>breakfast</b> in his <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|An air of sumptuous splendor and easeful comfort strikes us {{immediately}} as {{we enter}} the doors, as being characteristics of the house. Newly built, only a portion of the intended edifice completed, and the grand staircase not yet opened, the Occidental is but an incomplete sample of that which it is intended to be. The interior fittings are those of a first-class hotel; the bedrooms are airy, the beds soft and large; the salle-a-manger is a spacious hall, with elaborate embellishments and columns of noble proportions. There are <b>breakfast</b> <b>rooms</b> and supper rooms, hot and cold baths for everybody, well-carpeted stairs, elegant drawing rooms {{for the use of the}} ladies, pianos of the best manufacture, and lounges and rocking chairs of the most luxurious construction. The attendance is far better than in most English hotels, with none of that bowing and scraping servility among the waiters which constitutes the most offensive form of attention. Our two dollars and a half per day includes attendance.|$|R
