40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{consider}} the selection method employed for <b>baton</b> <b>passing</b> during sprint relays in high school physical education classes. Down sweep passing and up sweep passing were compared in terms of learning effect. The results obtained after dividing the students into 3 groups according to sprint capability, and examining the learning effect, were as follows. 1.   The group with a high sprint capability tended to use up-sweep passing because this allowed the baton to be passed while maintaining sprint speed. 2.   The groups with low and medium sprint capability low tended to use down-sweep passing over a free distance, because these groups found it difficult to maintain speed in the takeover zone.   These observations suggest that physical education classes can be made more productive by choosing a suitable baton pass method according to sprint ability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} two results on influence in collective decision games. The first part deals with general perfect information coin-flipping ames {{as defined in}} [3]. <b>Baton</b> <b>passing</b> (see [8]), an n-p layer game from this,class is shown to have the following property: If S is a coalition of size at most n then the influence of S on the game is only 0 (nl~t) This complements a result 3 o-]-d" ~ ' from [3] that for every k there is a coalition of size k with influence f~(k/n). Thus the best possible bounds on influences of coalitions of size up to this threshold are known, and there need not be coalitions up to this size whose influence asymptot ical ly exceeds their fraction of the population. This result {{may be expected to}} play a role in resolving the most outstanding problem in this area: Does every n-p layer perfect information coin flipping game have a coalition of o(n) players with influence 1 -o (1) ? (Recently Alon and Naor [1] gave a negative answer to this question.) In a recent paper Kahn, Kalai and Linial [7] showed that for every n-var iab le boolean function of r nw(n) variables whose influence is expectat ion bounded away from zero and one, there is a set o log 1 -o (1), where w(n) is any function tending to infinity with n. They raised the analogous question where 1 - o(1) is replaced by any positive constant and speculated that a constant influence may be always achievable by significantly smaller sets of variables.

40|$|Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) {{has been}} a {{controversial}} topic with extreme opinions on its merits. While there are many reports of dramatic improvements in many project contexts, {{there have also been}} claims that it does not apply to all projects. This paper sets out to articulate where and why CCPM is applicable by carefully examining its assumptions and reconstructing its underpinning model of reality. Such examination required an in-depth analysis of both the theoretical assumptions of CCPM and the empirical reality of projects. This research used an abductive process adopting an iterative learning loop between theory and practice. Theoretical data was drawn from analysis of a comprehensive database comprising 600 scholarly publications on CCPM. Empirical data was obtained from a total of 10 projects from a diverse range of industries using semi-structured interviews and project documents. CCPM literature describes a project’s goal as predefined output with fixed value. Not all projects conformed to this characteristic and some projects were found to be constrained by various aspects of scope formulation. The CCPM solution also requires agreed priorities for the project and elimination of deterministic start dates. These imply unity of purpose and a global definition of efficiency. CCPM portrays project work as a <b>baton</b> <b>passing</b> sequentially between project actors. While this was observable in some projects, in others a dedicated team shared carrying the baton throughout the project. When a project is executed by a non-dedicated team, the constraint is the longest chain of dependent activities. However, in a dedicated team, the system ‘is’ the team and therefore its weakest link is the most constrained resource. CCPM literature also implies a high level of urgency which was not observed in all case projects. These characteristics can guide practitioners both in choosing and/or tailoring CCPM for their particular projects...|$|E
40|$|From {{fieldwork}} conducted {{ahead of}} the London Olympic Games, we develop new understanding of how organizations hand over digital data from the project to operations. Prior research explains how practitioners negotiate meaning across boundaries in ongoing work. However, it gives little attention to hand-over, where one group disengages as another engages. We use the analogy of the <b>baton</b> <b>pass</b> in a relay race to articulate how hand-over requires attention to sequence, timing, passing technique and communication within a time-constrained window of opportunity. In our case study, the project delivery team transfer responsibility for sports venues and other facilities, and their associated digital data, to Games operators. We show how delivery professionals both project the nature of future work; and probe how meanings will be interpreted. They seek to extend the window to discuss and negotiate meaning with operators. Our study contributes to research on engineering projects and on the coordination of knowledge work by articulating the <b>baton</b> <b>pass,</b> window of opportunity and projection and probing activities involved in hand-over. Understanding and improving the hand-over of digital data from the project to operations is important to enable owners and operators to better manage built infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|In this research, running {{action of}} "down sweep pass" （Down） in the 4 × 100 -meter relay was {{compared}} with that of "up sweep pass" （Up）in order to verify malfunctions of "Down".

40|$|The Radio Baton is a {{sequencer}} system {{developed by}} co-author MVM. It allows real-time control of tempo and sound level via radio transmitters {{mounted in the}} conductor’s batons.

Sound level can be controlled by the position of other baton along the y-axis of the pad. The system has recently been complemented by processing the music programmed into the sequencer by the KTH Director Musices grammar for music performance. This program induces variations of tone duration and loudness and inserts micropauses and accents depending on the musical context.
