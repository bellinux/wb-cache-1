To cite Bruno Latour, <b>blackboxing</b> is [...] "the way scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, when a matter of fact is settled, one need focus only on its inputs and outputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become." ...|$|R

25|$|Tools {{have been}} created to strip files of Windows Media DRM, {{enabling}} them to be played on non-Janus platforms. These tools typically were developed with one specific Individualized <b>Blackbox</b> Component (IBX) version in mind and rarely work on a version they were not explicitly designed for. Microsoft in addition to upgrading the IBX whenever it was cracked, also pursued legal action against those who developed and hosted these tools, driving the development and distribution even further underground and fragmenting it. These tools can be split into three categories: decrypter, key-finder, and all-in-one (finds the keys and then decrypts). Microsoft has been more successful in squashing the development and distribution of the tools capable of key finding than those that decrypt encoding, as is apparent by the continual existence of the SourceForge project FreeMe2.|$|E

We argue that self-forensics, with the forensics {{taken out of the}} cybercrime domain, is applicable to "self-dissection" of intelligent vehicles and hardware systems for automated incident and anomaly analysis and event reconstruction by the software with or without the aid of the engineering teams in a variety of forensic scenarios. We propose a formal design, requirements, and specification of the self-forensic enabled units (similar to <b>blackboxes)</b> in vehicles that will help investigation of incidents and also automated reasoning and verification of theories along with the events reconstruction in a formal model. We argue such an analysis is beneficial to improve the safety of the passengers and their vehicles, like the airline industry does for planes. Comment: 10 pages; preliminary version for CMRS...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to comprehensively concentrate and critically reflect upon the theoretical and methodological conception of sociological reflexivity. It thus concisely presents some relevant debates on reflexivity’s most influential sociological and epistemological definitions, {{as well as}} on its varied and complex relationship with the contentious notions of the self and spokespersonship. The conceptual elaboration on both notions emphatically highlights the crucial importance of the relational dimension over against the ubiquitous risks and dangers of subjectivism/objectivism, reification (<b>blackboxing)</b> and essentialism. In addition, it is described and demonstrated the particular significance of the apophatic dimension of reflexivity over against its eurocentric (or western-centric) and over-activistic (or cataphatic) dimension, which inevitably leads to an excessive analytic emphasis upon a highly ordering, instrumental, and chronically monitoring approach to the inherently dynamic and fluid processes of self-awareness, self-experience, self-definition and self-identity...|$|R

40|$|AI {{planning}} systems have traditionally operated as stand-alone <b>blackboxes,</b> taking {{a description of}} a domain and a set of goals, and automatically synthesizing a plan for achieving those goals. Such designs severely restrict the influence that users can have on the resultant plans. This paper describes an Advisable Planner framework that marries an advice-taking interface to AI planning technology. The framework is designed to enable users to interact with {{planning systems}} at high levels of abstraction in order to influence the plan generation process in terms that are meaningful to them. Advice consists of taskspecific constraints on both the desired solution and the refinement decisions that underlie the planning process. The paper emphasizes strategic advice, which expresses recommendations on how goals and actions are to be accomplished. The main contributions are a formal language and semantics for strategic advice, and a sound and complete HTNstyle algorithm for generating plans [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|A black-box fuzzer {{treats the}} program as a black box and is unaware of {{internal}} program structure. For instance, a random testing tool that generates inputs at random is considered a <b>blackbox</b> fuzzer.

However, <b>blackbox</b> fuzzers may only scratch the surface and expose [...] "shallow" [...] bugs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{communication}} benchmark suite: BTU(Bits To the User). In the BTU benchmarking process, the vendor supplies a workstation running a UNIX 2 operating system, we install our benchmark program and connect the workstation to a testbed, consisting of <b>blackboxes,</b> which emulates a LAN/WAN environment. The benchmark run will submit the workstation to a carefully designed combination of tests. The result is a predictor of what the user, at the application level, can expect in terms of bits sent to or received from a remote host. Our benchmark takes into account concurrent activities such as CPU and I/O activities which compete for resources on the test machine. The combination of these activities and concurrent activities on the network will interfere with the test machine's communication performance. This methodology is in contrast to existing benchmark suites that measure just the compute performance of a given workstation or the maximum network throughput [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of testing {{concurrent}} systems considered as <b>blackboxes</b> and specified using asynchronous Communicating Finite State Machines. We present an approach to derive test cases for concurrent systems in a succinct and formal way. The approach addresses the state space explosion problem by introducing a causality relation model {{and the concept of}} logical time to express true concurrency and describe timing constraints on events. The conformance relation between test cases and trace observed from the real system is defined, and a new test architecture as well as a test case application is presented according to the conformance relation defined. To improve verdict capability of test cases, the approach is enhanced by relaxing the unit-time assumption to any natural number. And a computationally efficient algorithm for the enhanced approach is presented and the algorithm is evaluated in terms of computational efficiency and verdict capability. Finally the approach is generalized to describe timing constraints by any real numbers...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} whether TEK 10 has an effect on creativity in the engineering design. This thesis also targets to determine which among the six strategies; <b>blackboxing,</b> removing, revision, introduction, abstraction and crucial constraints is the most used in a handling a constraint in engineering design when implementing building code 2010. Sources and constraints to creative thinking between building regulation code (TEK 10) are critically analysed in the thesis. The study was carried out in Norway, Oslo. A sample size of 10 respondents from Oslo participated in this study. 5 of the respondents were consulting engineers while 5 were architects. The study also involved 10 more respondents from distant cities. This was done in order to ascertain whether the same results would be obtained. The main data techniques used in this research study were semi-structured interviews, and secondary sources from previous researchers. Personal interviews constituted one of the most important and valuable sources of information. The interviewees were selected on the basis of their closeness to the topics of the study project and their levels of experience in the building project. The data collected was analyzed critically and the different views of the respondents were taken into consideration. The constraints in the building industry are discussed in details. The discussion part of the thesis discusses the findings and the different theories that are employed often times. The research found out that TEK 10 limits the creativity of the architects, but has no effect on the creativity of the consulting engineers. This has been attributed to the nature of the work performed by these two parties. The consulting engineers are expected to countercheck the standards of designs that the architects have drawn. The drawing of the new designs requires creativity and innovation, which is limited by TEK 10. The thesis concludes that, the <b>blackboxing</b> strategy was the most preferred by the architects and the consulting engineers. In addition to this strategy, the thesis also concludes that the architects mostly solve their constraints using removing strategy while the consultant engineers use revision strategy. The recommendations and limitations of the discussed theory are also discussed. The thesis concludes with a reflection of the written theory...|$|R
