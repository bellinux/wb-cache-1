5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and {{spends much of}} the day buried in the substrate. It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely deep enough to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the <b>blood</b> <b>worm</b> Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E
5|$|The roughtail {{stingray}} is reportedly not highly active, spending much time {{buried in the}} sediment. It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment. It mainly captures prey off the bottom, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. A variety of invertebrates, as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and scup, {{are known to be}} consumed. Off Massachusetts, the main prey are crabs (Cancer), bivalves (Mya), gastropods (Polinices), squid (Loligo) and annelid worms. In Delaware Bay, most of its diet consists of the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the <b>blood</b> <b>worm</b> Glycera dibranchiata; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays (D. say) that share the bay. The shrimp Upogebia affinis is a major food source off Virginia. Off Florida, crustaceans (Rananoides, Ovalipes, Sicyonia brevirostris, and Portunus) and polychaete worms are the most important prey.|$|E

50|$|The New Zealand midge Chironomidae, has 4 {{stages in}} its life cycle. This ranges from egg, larva, pupa and adult. The midge often breeds in swarms {{in areas of}} lakes and stagnent water which suits pupae and larvae to breed. Eggs are often laid in numbers up to 3000 and are {{contained}} in a gelatanous susbstance which helps it to attach to objects in the water such as sticks or to river or lake banks. The eggs which are not attached to any material sink to the bottom {{but this does not}} stop the eggs ability to hatch instead it hatches on the bottom. The first stage (the egg) usually has a 2 to 7 days in which it hatches and then feed on the gelatanous material {{for a couple of days}} then burrowing into the substrate or the material available for it to make its home. Most of the larval state is spent in tube constructed from the silt, they take on a red colour which is where they get the name <b>blood</b> <b>worm</b> from. They spend 2-7 weeks in this form which can be faster or slower due to current water temperatures caused by season weather. After they reach the end of this cycle they pupate which and the pupa atge lasts for up to 3 days where they emerge to the surface by actively swimming and stay on the surface for several hours until the adult form emerges. They then spend a maximum of 5 days as an adult as a result of not eatting at this stage, where they breed in swarms at night and then die. In the right conditions with regards to water temp and season in perfect condition the full life cycle can be completed within 2 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Breeding can be {{achieved}} with very little effort and no specific requirements are needed for breeding purposes.As long as water conditions are maintained at a desirable high quality, a breeding pair of such fish will readily spawn. To enhance the likelihood of acquiring a breeding pair, purchase several healthy and active juveniles {{at a young age}} (between 6 -10) and grow these specimens until sexual maturity. Generally, you should be left with a breeding pair or two. These fish will noticeably become more aggressive and territorial, Remove all other fish at this point and keep the newly formed breeding pair separate.When a breeding pair had been successfully established,The male will begin to court the female by displaying his erect finnage to the female as he tries to impress her in an attempt for her to accept his mating invitation.The pair will begin to clean a flat surface if the female is responsive of the male's previous courting behavior.The female will then lay approximately 1000 - 2000 orange coloured eggs which will then be fertilized by the male. The eggs will be ferociously guarded by both parents and a high degree of parental care is show to the eggs and fry.When the eggs 'hatch' after approximately 5 -7 days, the offspring (known as wrigglers at this stage in development) are defenseless and are unable to swim. They are often transported to pre dug pits by both parents, and are guarded. The fry will begin to swim in approximately 7 days and should be fed with baby brine shrimp or alike. If you would like to rear these fry, they should be removed at this point as they will later be consumed by both parents as the female becomes due to spawn once more. Feed the fry baby brine shrimp until the stage where they are large enough to consume <b>blood</b> <b>worm,</b> daphnia and other live foods.When purchasing fish in an attempt to acquire a breeding pair, try to buy fish from different sources. There is a high probability that when buying fish from the same source, Fish will be from the same parents (Siblings). This should be avoided, as breeding fish in this manner may form offspring with genetic disease usually associated with interbreeding.Also, buy fish of a similar size, the chances of acquiring a breeding pair with fish of a similar size is significant to that of attempting to breed fish of different age and size.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bloodworm}} (kessen-chu) is an unexplained little worm-like creature, which {{lives in}} the bloodstream and tissue in a symbiotic way. It heals all wounds acquired by its host, replacing the missing tissue and organs with their own bodies as well as reattaching limbs. Many of the [...] "scars" [...] on Manji's body are actually worm flesh, holding Manji together like living sutures. However, {{it is noted that}} the bloodworms can only heal wounds acquired during infestation and not ones that were acquired prior (such as Manji's eye). They also do nothing to prevent pain. The only way to kill a bearer of the bloodworms is to use a bloodworm poison, although it has been implied that cutting off their head may suffice if it is not reattached quickly. During his battle with Makie, Manji said the only way to stop him would be to cut off his head. But whether this would kill him or just leave him unable to function is debatable, because in his battle with Eiku Shizuma, Manji cuts off his head after poisoning him with his own sword, and he does not die until after the kessen-satsu (<b>blood</b> <b>worm</b> killer) takes effect. Further adding to the debate were statements in Wizard magazine that Manji could survive a severed head, but it would take at least a year for the blood-worms to regenerate that much tissue. While not yet covered in the English version of Blade of the Immortal, another immortal is partially beheaded (to the point where only a flap of skin is keeping its head attached) only for the wound to heal within a few seconds. This essentially confirms that Manji's regenerative abilities would allow him to survive a beheading. The time in which it takes for regeneration varies: Manji can reattach a limb within seconds and can partially recover from a bullet or stab wound to the brain. However the wounds to his head did have a negative effect (incapable of moving his lower body or weaker vision). Apparently, the kessen-chu give immortality to its host and everlasting youth (the host retaining the age they had at the time they were fed the kessen-chu). It is unknown how to infect a person with the kessen-chu, but Shizuma indicates it takes a lot more than blood to blood contact with someone who's infected. In later chapters the question how to transfer them becomes {{a major part of the}} story.|$|E
