40|$|AbstractAs {{one of the}} chipless {{machining}} processes, <b>burnishing</b> has been performed on manufactured components as the final operation to improve the surface integrity, including reduced surface roughness and increased surface and subsurface hardness. Refined surface layers with ultra-fine grains or nano-grains could be generated during the <b>burnishing</b> process due to imposed severe plastic deformation and the associated dynamic recrystallization (DRX). These harder layers with compressive residual stresses induced by the <b>burnishing</b> process also provide added benefits by enhancing wear/corrosion resistance and increasing the fatigue life of the components. The research findings {{presented in this paper}} show the effects of cryogenic <b>burnishing</b> with roller <b>burnishing</b> tool on Al 7050 -T 7451 alloy, using liquid nitrogen as the coolant. <b>Burnishing</b> forces and temperatures are measured to compare the differences between dry and cryogenic <b>burnishing.</b> Higher tangential forces and lower temperatures are observed from cryogenic <b>burnishing</b> due to the work-hardening and the rapid cooling effects introduced by cryogenic <b>burnishing.</b> Also, refined layers with nano-grains (grain size of approximately 40 nm) are formed in the cryogenicallyburnished surface, in which an average hardness increase of 9. 5 %, 17. 5 % and 24. 8 % within the 200 μm depth are achieved in comparison with the hardness values obtained from dry <b>burnishing,</b> at the corresponding <b>burnishing</b> speeds of 25, 50 and 100 m/min. A finite element model (FEM) is developed to simulate the <b>burnishing</b> forces and temperatures for validation of the experimental results, based on the modified Johnson-Cook flow stress model combined with the constitutive equations concerning DRX.

50|$|<b>Burnishing</b> also {{occurs to}} some extent in {{machining}} processes. In turning, <b>burnishing</b> occurs if the cutting tool is not sharp, if a large negative rake angle is used, if a very small depth of cut is used, or if the workpiece material is gummy. As a cutting tool wears, it becomes more blunt and the <b>burnishing</b> effect becomes more pronounced. In grinding, since the abrasive grains are randomly oriented and some are not sharp, there is always some amount of <b>burnishing.</b> This is one reason the grinding is less efficient and generates more heat than turning. In drilling, <b>burnishing</b> occurs with drills that have lands to <b>burnish</b> the material as it drills into it. Regular twist drills or straight fluted drills have 2 lands to guide them through the hole. On <b>burnishing</b> drills there are 4 or more lands, similar to reamers.|$|R

The relations between VAB depth, VAB force and VAB time and their maximum values are derived, and the required maximum power of the vibration generator is then obtained.
