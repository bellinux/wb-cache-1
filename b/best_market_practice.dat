Using the U.

We show the benefits and need for a supplementary data source. We then develop robust investability filters to ensure statistical results from cross-sectional analysis are economically meaningful, an issue overlooked by most studies on cross-sectional risk pricing...|$|E

The projects have several aims: these are to identify the fundamental drivers of the pricing of different lease terms in the UK property sector; to identify current and <b>best</b> <b>market</b> <b>practice</b> and uncover the main variations in lease terms; to identify key issues in pricing lease terms; and to develop a model for the pricing of rent under a variety of lease variations. From the landlord’s perspective, the main factors driving the required ‘compensation’ for a lease term amendment include expected rental volatility, expected probability of tenant vacation, and the expected costs of tenant vacation. These data are used in conjunction with simulation technology to reflect the options inherent in certain lease types to explore the required rent adjustment. The resulting cash flows have interesting qualities which illustrate the potential importance of option pricing in a non-complex and practical way. ...|$|E

We present results from a large-scale experiment in a MNO in Asia where we use machine learning to segment customers for text-based marketing. This leads to conversion rates far superior to the current <b>best</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> within MNOs. Using metadata and social network analysis, we created new metrics to identify customers that {{are the most likely}} to convert into mobile internet users. These metrics falls into three categories: discretionary income, timing, and social learning. Using historical data, a machine learning prediction model is then trained, validated, and used to select a treatment group. Experimental results with 250 000 customers show a 13 times better conversion-rate compared to the control group. The control group is selected using the current <b>best</b> <b>practice</b> <b>marketing.</b> The model also shows very good properties in the longer term, as 98 % of the converted customers in the treatment group renew their mobile internet packages after the campaign, compared to 37 % in the control group.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} and identify the marketing strategies and specific promotional tools used by film commissions to attract the production of films and television. Design/methodology/approach – This study involved in-depth interviews with film commissions worldwide and a content analysis of their promotional materials. Findings –Film commissions employ three key strategic marketing approaches when promoting their locations to film producers- product differentiation, service differentiation and cost advantages. They use six main specific promotional tactics – advertising, sales promotions, joint promotions, public relations, online marketing, and direct marketing and personal selling. A model explaining the relationship between film commissions and film producers involving these strategies and promotional tools is suggested. Research limitations/implications – The marketing of film locations is under-researched and has to be further addressed in the marketing literature. Future research can seek to identify the specific marketing activities that will lead to success for the marketing of film locations. Practical Implications- Examples of the <b>best</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> amongst film commissions are highlighted.

This study seeks to determine if strategic orientation can help improve firm performance of Malaysian SMEs. Although, many types of strategic orientations have been discussed in the literature, this study chose three most comprehensive constructs that encompass significant actions targeting main areas in the operation of any business. These include; entrepreneurial orientation relating to the proactive leadership skills of the entrepreneur, market orientation directed to winning over and retaining customers with <b>best</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> and interaction orientation focussed on customer relationship and management. This study applied quantitative method and used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). As there has been some criticism that direct correlation of one particular strategic orientation to firm performance is prone to simplification, this study adopts a combination of these strategic orientations to present a holistic picture of the effect of strategic orientation on firm performance. This study also employs innovation success as mediating variable of the strategic orientation/ firm performance to present a more nuanced picture of this relationship by arguing that strategic orientation is able to deliver superior firm performance directly or indirectly by affecting innovation success. In addition, market turbulence (instability of customer preference) and competitive intensity (presence of aggressive competitors) are employed as antecedent variables on strategic orientation to reflect factors of external environment that can intervene in the actions of a firm...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the last}} decade of the twentieth century, the {{healthcare}} industry is paying attention to the environmental impact of their buildings and therefore new regulations, policy goals and Buildings Sustainability Assessment (HBSA) methods are being developed and implemented. At the present, healthcare is one of the most regulated industries and it is also one of the largest consumers of energy per net floor area. To assess the sustainability of healthcare buildings it is necessary to establish a set of benchmarks related with their life-cycle performance. They are both essential to rate the sustainability of a project and to support designers and other stakeholders in the process of designing and operating a sustainable building, by allowing the comparison to be made between a project and the conventional and <b>best</b> <b>market</b> <b>practices.</b> This research is focused on the methodology to set the benchmarks for resources consumption, waste production, operation costs and potential environmental impacts related to the operational phase of healthcare buildings.
