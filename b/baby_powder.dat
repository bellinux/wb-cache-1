Rector Joyce, who served the parish from 1883 to 1916, baptised the young Kilmer, who remained an Episcopalian until his 1913 conversion to Catholicism.

40|$|Studies {{of mothers}} {{with high levels}} of arsenic {{exposure}} indicate the toxic element does not pass easily into human milk. 1, 2, 3 In this issue of EHP, researchers test the hypothesis that breastfed infants have lower exposures than infants fed powdered formula mixed with private well water. 4 Early life is a time of heightened vulnerability to arsenic, a natu-rally occurring element in bedrock and a widespread contaminant of groundwater linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other adverse health effects. 5, 6 Municipal water in the United States is subject to a federal standard of 10 ppb for arsenic. But arsenic in private wells is unregulated, and home-owners are not required to test for it. “The take-home message is that if you’re feeding your <b>baby</b> <b>powdered</b> formula and making the formula with well water, then you should test your water for arsenic, ” says Kathryn Cottingham, a professor at Dartmouth College and the study’s lead investigator. These new findings add to mounting evi-dence that inorganic arsenic does not pass easily into breast milk. In a 2008 study conducted in Bangladesh, for instance, even women exposed to high levels of arsenic in groundwater had relatively little inorganic arsenic in their milk. 1 That study also found that infants of women who reported exclusive breastfeeding had much lower arsenic levels in their urine at 3 months of age compared with 3 -month-old infants who were not exclusively breastfed. According to Cottingham, the current study set out to confirm these and similar findings in a cohort from the United States.
