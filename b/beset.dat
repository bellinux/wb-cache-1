40|$|The {{risks of}} ship <b>besetting</b> under ice {{pressure}} are examined. Hindcasts of ice dynamics examine {{the conditions that}} led to the <b>besetting</b> of two vessels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on 9 March 2005. The analysis examines the distributions of potentially significant variables such as pressure (mean normal stress), ridge thickness and strain rates. A criterion for assessing the risk of <b>besetting</b> was then proposed. A preliminary parametric study was also done in order to illustrate a method for predicting the risk of <b>besetting</b> under different ice and environmental forcing conditions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the build up of ice pressure in Frobisher Bay. Ice conditions {{during the summer}} of 2012 were particularly severe and resulted in a relatively large number of <b>besetting</b> events. Observations were collected from four vessels and describe the conditions, which correspond to 10 <b>besetting</b> events. The salient factors that influenced the <b>besetting</b> events are examined. A summary of the observations is given, including estimates of ice cover coverage and thickness, ridge sail heights, wind conditions and level of pressure severity. For all events there was full ice coverage (95 to 100 %). Reported ridge sail heights were consistently 1. 2 m, with widespread rafting. A hindcast of ice stresses and deformation examined in detail a <b>besetting</b> incident of the Umiavut on 10 July 2012. The distributions of ice thickness, concentration, pressures and ridge thickness are presented. Critical values of the pressure and ridge thickness, which correspond to the <b>besetting,</b> are also given. The present work additionally addresses some of the environmental forcing patterns that give rise to ice pressure and pose risk for vessels in Frobisher Bay.

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{compression}} of ice covers to shipping {{has been the}} subject of several recent studies. Research projects in Europe and Canada have examined factors that trigger ice convergence and approaches for predicting the risk of <b>besetting</b> of vessels, among other aspects of the problem. This paper examines incidents of vessel <b>besetting</b> due to ice compression which took place over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Strait of Belle Isle. The paper lists reported <b>besetting</b> incidents over these locations during the ice season of 2013 - 2014. The information includes the date, time, location, prevailing wind, and observations of ambient ice conditions. The distance to the nearest shoreline was also given. Analysis of certain incidents was done by hindcasting ice drift and deformation. The results give estimates of ice pressures (ice compression) and ridge ice thickness at <b>besetting.</b> For incidents that were apparently triggered by onshore wind and took place over the eastern Gulf of St. Lawrence, ice pressures ranged from 24. 0 kN/m to 25. 7 kN/m and the ridge thickness values were from 8. 2 m to 10. 5 m. These values are in agreement with previous estimates obtained for <b>besetting</b> incidents over other parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Frobisher Bay. An analysis of incidents that corresponded to wind acting nearly parallel to the shoreline in the Strait of Belle Isle produced lower values of ice pressures and ridge thickness. However, the strain rates were particularly high, which evidently caused convergence of the ice cover and prompted the <b>besetting</b> incidents. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
