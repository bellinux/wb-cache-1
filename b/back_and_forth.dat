50|$|The games Semai {{children}} play are non-competitive. These games include forms of sports that encourage {{physical activity and}} exertions so that the body becomes tired and are therefore made ready for sleep and the subsequent dreaming. One game involves hitting at other children with sticks; the sticks, however, always stop short {{a few inches from}} their target so that no one actually gets struck. Modern games are also played but with significant modifications. A game of badminton for example uses no partition nets and keeps no score. The shuttlecock is deliberately hit so that it could be easily intercepted by the other player <b>and</b> passed <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> so <b>forth.</b> The objective seems to be purely for exercise.|$|R

5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> {{as shown by the}} arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
5|$|After {{pitching}} out of {{the bullpen}} while bouncing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> between Texas and its Triple-A affiliate in 2005–07, Feldman converted to a starter in 2008.

5|$|Another World is a {{platform}} game, featuring a control scheme where the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad {{to make the}} protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation-specific actions, such as rocking a cage <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth.</b> In the initial part of the game, the player's character Lester is unarmed. He is able to kick at small creatures, but is otherwise defenseless.|$|E
60|$|He sat <b>back</b> <b>and</b> drew <b>forth</b> a pipe. He {{looked into}} it with sharp scrutiny, and tapped it emptily on his open palm. He turned the hair-seal tobacco pouch inside out and dusted the lining, treasuring {{carefully}} each flake and mite of tobacco that his efforts gleaned. The result was scarce a thimbleful. He searched in his pockets, and brought forward, between thumb and forefinger, tiny pinches of rubbish. Here and there in this rubbish were crumbs of tobacco. These he segregated with microscopic care, though he occasionally permitted small particles of foreign substance to accompany the crumbs to the hoard in his palm. He even deliberately added small, semi-hard woolly fluffs, that had come originally from the coat lining, and that had lain for long months in the bottoms of the pockets.|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{interpretation of}} the late Paleozoic structural and geochronological record of the Iberian Massif is presented and discussed under {{the perspective of a}} Gondwana-Laurussia collision giving way to the Variscan orogen. Compressional and extensional structures developed during the building of the Variscan orogenic crust of Iberia are linked together into major tectonic events operating at lithosphere scale. A review of the tectonometamorphic and magmatic evolution of the Iberian Massif reveals <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> <b>forths</b> in the overall convergence between Gondwana and Laurussia during the amalgamation of Pangea in late Paleozoic times. Stages dominated by lithosphere compression are characterized by subduction, both oceanic and continental, development of magmatic arcs, (over- and under-) thrusting of continental lithosphere, and folding. Variscan convergence resulted in the eventual transference of a large allochthonous set of peri-Gondwanan terranes, the Iberian Allochthon, onto the Gondwana mainland. The Iberian Allochthon bears the imprint of previous interaction between Gondwana and Laurussia, including their juxtaposition after the closure of the Rheic Ocean in Lower Devonian times. Stages governed by lithosphere extension are featured by the opening of two short-lived oceanic basins that dissected previous Variscan orogenic crust, first in the Lower-Middle Devonian, following the closure of the Rheic Ocean, and then in the early Carboniferous, following the emplacement of the peri-Gondwanan allochthon. An additional, major intra-orogenic extensional event in the early-middle Carboniferous dismembered the Iberian Allochthon into individual thrust stacks separated by extensional faults and domes. Lateral tectonics played an important role through the Variscan orogenesis, especially during the creation of new tectonic blocks separated by intracontinental strike-slip shear zones in the late stages of continental convergence.

The player inserts money or tokens into the machine, which then allows the player to manipulate a joystick that controls the claw for a variable amount of time, (controlled by the operator) usually 30 seconds, and rarely, even a minute. The player is able to move the claw <b>back,</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>and</b> sideways. Some machines allow the user to move the claw after it has partially descended.|$|R

Hatless, but defended by her sunshade, she excited the admiration of the few connoisseurs as yet abroad, strolling in blue blouses to their labours; and this simple admiration gave her pleasure. For once she was really conscious of the grace in her own limbs, actually felt the gentle vividness of her own face, with its nearly black hair and eyes, and creamy skin--strange sensation, and very comforting! ...|$|R
