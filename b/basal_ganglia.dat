5|$|Dopamine-related {{activity}} in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> can be directly measured with PET and SPECT scans. A finding of reduced dopamine-related {{activity in}} the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> dopamine-related activity is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> are a {{group of}} {{interconnected}} structures in the forebrain. The primary function of the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to {{all parts of the}} brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{learning}} {{is the ability}} for rewards and punishments to modify behavior. It is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{studied to}} date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their {{behavior}} to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a {{specific set of}} brain structures, at the heart of which lie the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> a set of interconnected areas {{at the base of the}} forebrain. The <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> are the central site at which decisions are made: the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Pathology in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> may be {{indicated}} by rigidity {{and resistance to}} movement of the limbs, and {{by the presence of}} characteristic involuntary movements.|$|E
5|$|The neuroacanthocytosis syndromes {{are caused}} by a range of genetic {{mutations}} and produce a variety of clinical features but primarily produce neurodegeneration of the brain, specifically the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and especially the cerebellum, which functions as a large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{plays a role}} in pain {{processing}} {{in multiple}} levels of the central nervous system including the spinal cord, periaqueductal gray, thalamus, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and cingulate cortex. Decreased levels of dopamine have been associated with painful symptoms that frequently occur in Parkinson's disease. Abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission also occur in several painful clinical conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, fibromyalgia, and restless legs syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine secreting neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor {{symptoms of}} PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The peripheral nervous system is rarely involved.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} major {{pathways}} {{in the brain}} connecting other brain areas with the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> These are known as the motor, oculo-motor, associative, limbic and orbitofrontal circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit. All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits {{are involved in a}} wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning. Scientifically, the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the fourth}} week the cephalic part bends sharply forward in a cephalic flexure. This flexed part becomes the {{forebrain}} (prosencephalon); the adjoining curving part becomes the midbrain (mesencephalon) and the part caudal to the flexure becomes the hindbrain (rhombencephalon). In the fifth week of developmement five brain vesicles have formed. The forebrain separates into two vesicles an anterior telencephalon and a posterior diencephalon. The telencephalon {{gives rise to the}} cerebral cortex, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and related structures. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalamus and hypothalamus. The hindbrain also splits into two areas – the metencephalon and the mylencephalon. The metencephalon gives rise to the cerebellum and pons. The myelencephalon gives rise to the medulla oblongata. Also during the fifth week, the brain divides into repeating segments called neuromeres. These are known as rhombomeres seen in the hindbrain.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes an abnormal increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{are not well}} understood, but numerous abnormalities of brain structure have been reported. The most thoroughly investigated alterations involve the cerebral cortex, but effects on the hippocampus have also been described. Many reports have found reductions {{in the size of}} the hippocampus in schizophrenic subjects. The left hippocampus seems to be affected more than the right. The changes noted have largely been accepted to be the result of abnormal development. It is unclear whether hippocampal alterations play any role in causing the psychotic symptoms that are the most important feature of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that on the basis of experimental work using animals, hippocampal dysfunction might produce an alteration of dopamine release in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> thereby indirectly affecting the integration of information in the prefrontal cortex. It has also been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction might account for the disturbances in long-term memory frequently observed.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> frontal cortex, and thalamus (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E
5|$|For vertebrates, {{the early}} stages of neural {{development}} are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of ectoderm running along the midline of the back is induced to become the neural plate, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the neural groove, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the neural tube, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the telencephalon (which will contain the cerebral cortex, <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and related structures) and the diencephalon (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the metencephalon (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the myelencephalon (which will contain the medulla oblongata). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E
25|$|The International <b>Basal</b> <b>Ganglia</b> Society (IBAGS) informally {{considers}} the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> {{to be made}} up of the striatum, the pallidum (with two nuclei), the substantia nigra (with its two distinct parts), and the subthalamic nucleus, whereas Terminologia anatomica excludes the last two. Some neurologists have included the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus as part of the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> and some have also included the pedunculopontine nucleus.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} the {{majority}} of the above hyperkinetic movements can be traced to improper modulation of the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> by the subthalamic nucleus. In many cases, the excitatory output of the subthalamic nucleus is reduced, leading to a reduced inhibitory outflow of the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> Without the normal restraining influence of the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> upper motor neurons of the circuit tend to become more readily activated by inappropriate signals, resulting in the characteristic abnormal movements.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} development, the human {{central nervous system}} is often {{classified}} based on the original three primitive vesicles from which it develops: These primary vesicles form in the normal development of the neural tube of the embryo and initially include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, in rostral to caudal (from head to tail) orientation. Later in development {{of the nervous system}} each section itself turns into smaller components. During development, the cells that migrate tangentially to form the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> are directed by the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences. The following table demonstrates this developmental classification and traces it to the anatomic structures found in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> The structures relevant to the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> are shown in bold.|$|E
25|$|Glucose: The {{expectation}} of an intravenous injection of glucose increases {{the release of}} dopamine in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> of men (but not women).|$|E
25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a hyperkinetic {{movement}} <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> disease caused by lack of normal inhibitory inputs from medium spiny neurons of the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> This poses the opposite effects of those associated with Parkinson's disease, including inappropriate activation of upper motor neurons. As with the GABAergic mechanisms observed in relation to Parkinson's disease, a GABA agonist injected into the substantia nigra pars reticulata decreases inhibition of upper motor neurons, resulting in ballistic involuntary motor movements, similar to symptoms of Huntington's disease.|$|E
25|$|Asphyxia {{directly}} causes <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> damage {{due to lack}} {{of oxygen}} and therefore, insufficient nutrient supply. The lesions caused by asphyxia are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the putamen. However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b> Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scientists argued that the birds had hyper-developed <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia,</b> with tiny mammalian-like telencephalon structures. Modern studies have refuted this view. The <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia</b> only occupy {{a small part of the}} avian brain. Instead, it seems that birds use a different part of their brain, the medio-rostral neostriatum/hyperstriatum ventrale (see also nidopallium), as the seat of their intelligence, and the brain-to-body size ratio of psittacines (parrots) and corvines (birds of the crow family) is actually comparable to that of higher primates.|$|E
25|$|Subcortical aphasias {{characteristics}} and symptoms {{depend upon the}} site and size of subcortical lesion. Possible sites of lesions include the thalamus, internal capsule, and <b>basal</b> <b>ganglia.</b>|$|E
