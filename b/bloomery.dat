5|$|Steel (with smaller {{carbon content}} than pig iron {{but more than}} wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity by using a <b>bloomery.</b> Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Persia were making good steel by 1000BC. Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed around 300BC and AD500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The <b>bloomery</b> was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E

5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in <b>bloomery</b> furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel. With {{the invention of the}} Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, a new era of mass-produced steel began. This was followed by the Siemens-Martin process and then the Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, mild steel replaced wrought iron.|$|E
5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a <b>bloomery,</b> and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E
5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the <b>bloomery</b> ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from <b>bloomery</b> to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into liquid iron and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier <b>bloomery</b> furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E
5|$|Wrought iron: During the Han dynasty, new iron {{smelting}} processes led to {{the manufacture}} of new wrought iron implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube seed drill and iron plough. In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo.

25|$|In operation, the <b>bloomery</b> is {{preheated}} {{by burning}} charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced through the top, in a roughly one-to-one ratio. Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of the charcoal reduces the iron oxides in the ore to metallic iron, without melting the ore; {{this allows the}} <b>bloomery</b> to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a <b>bloomery</b> is easily forgeable, nearly pure iron, with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also {{be added to the}} <b>bloomery,</b> about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bloomery</b> is {{basically}} an enlarged blacksmith's hearth. It {{consists of a}} pit or chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. (Sandstone was used at Cornwall.) Near the bottom, one or more clay pipes enter through the side walls. These pipes, called tuyeres, allow air to enter the furnace, either by natural draft or by forced with a bellows. An opening {{at the bottom of}} the <b>bloomery</b> may be used to remove the bloom, or the <b>bloomery</b> can be tipped over and the bloom removed from the bottom.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} taken before the <b>bloomery</b> {{can be used}} is the {{preparation}} of the charcoal and the iron ore. The charcoal is produced by heating wood to produce the nearly pure carbon fuel needed for the refining process. The ore is broken into small pieces and roasted in a fire to remove any moisture in the ore. Any large impurities in the ore can be crushed and removed. Since slag from previous blooms may have a high iron content, slag from previous blooms can be broken up and recycled into the <b>bloomery</b> with the new ore.|$|E

25|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{were used}} to produce liquid iron. The blast furnace was operated at higher temperatures and at a greater reducing condition than the <b>bloomery</b> furnace.

Also, the slag produced was less rich in iron.|$|E
25|$|Water-powered and {{mechanised}} trip hammers reappeared {{in medieval}} Europe by the 12th century. Their use {{was described in}} medieval written sources of Styria (in modern-day Austria), written in 1135 and another in 1175 AD. Medieval French sources of the years 1116 and 1249 both record the use of mechanised trip hammers used in the forging of wrought iron. Medieval European trip hammers by the 15th century were most often {{in the shape of}} the vertical pestle stamp-mill, although they employed more frequent use of the vertical waterwheel than earlier Chinese versions (which often used the horizontal waterwheel). The well-known Renaissance artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci often sketched trip hammers for use in forges and even file-cutting machinery, those of the vertical pestle stamp-mill type. The oldest depicted European illustration of a martinet forge-hammer is perhaps the Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus of Olaus Magnus, dated to 1565 AD. In this woodcut image, there is the scene of three martinets and a waterwheel working wood and leather bellows of the Osmund <b>Bloomery</b> furnace.
