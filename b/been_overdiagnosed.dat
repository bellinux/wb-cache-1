5000|$|The central harm of mammographic {{breast cancer}} {{screening}} is overdiagnosis; {{the detection of}} abnormalities that meet the pathologic definition of cancer but will never progress to cause symptoms or death during a patient's lifetime. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a researcher at Dartmouth College, states that [...] "in screen-detected breast and prostate cancer survivors {{are more likely to}} have <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed</b> than actually helped by the test." [...] Estimates of overdiagnosis associated with mammography have ranged from 1% to 54%. In 2009, Peter C. Gotzsche and Karsten Juhl Jørgensen, reviewed the literature and found that one in three cases of breast cancer detected in a population offered mammographic screening is overdiagnosed. In contrast, a 2012 panel convened by the national cancer director for England and Cancer Research UK concluded one in five cases of breast cancer diagnosed among women who have undergone breast cancer screening are overdiagnosed. This means an overdiagnosis rate of 129 women per 10,000 invited to screening.|$|E
40|$|Background: Over{{diagnosis}} is {{the diagnosis}} of ‘illnesses’ that would never have caused patients harm but potentially exposes them to treat-ments where the risks outweigh the benefits. The problem of overdiagnosis is affecting an increasing proportion of the population. Objective: Overdiagnosis is occurring in several different ways: by changes in the definition or threshold of disease, labelling of risk factors as diseases, early detection from both deliberate screening programs and incidental detection (‘incidentalomas’), and the medicalisation of life, particularly in psychiatry. Discussion : General practitioners often carry the burden of care for patients who have <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed.</b> It is important that general practitioners {{are aware of the}} potential harm of overdiagnosis, particularly through early detection and aggressive management of early diseas...|$|E

40|$|When {{blood glucose}} {{decreases}} below a given threshold, symptoms of cerebral dysfunction and/or adrenergic hyperactivity appear. If this occurs postprandially in otherwise normal subjects, {{a diagnosis of}} reactive or functional hypoglycemia may be proposed. However, these symptoms are not specific, and they should coincide with low blood glucose values and be rapidly relieved by glucose ingestion before a diagnosis of hypoglycemia is confirmed. The oral glucose tolerance test, often used {{in the evaluation of}} such patients, also may give misleading results, because many normal subjects have glucose values below the `normal' range during the test. This may explain why functional hypoglycemia has probably <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed</b> during the last several years, giving rise to a description of the syndrome of non-hypoglycemia, in which the patient's symptoms are falsely attributed to hypoglycemia, either by himself or by his physician.

The uncommon frequency of this pathology is difficult to state precisely. This can be due to the limited possibilities of the diagnosis. These are inherent to the lack of statement of ectopic pregnancy, a nonsystematic histological test [9].

40|$|Knowledge of the {{likelihood}} that a screening-detected case of cancer has <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed</b> is vitally important to make treat-ment decisions and develop screening policy. An overdiagnosed case is an excess case detected by screening. Estimates of the frequency of overdiagnosis in breast and prostate cancer screening vary greatly across studies. This article identifies features of overdi-agnosis studies that influence results and shows their effect by using published research. First, different ways to define and mea-sure overdiagnosis are considered. Second, contextual features and how they affect overdiagnosis estimates are examined. Third, the effect of estimation approach is discussed. Many studies use excess incidence under screening as a proxy for overdiagnosis. Others use statistical models to make inferences about lead time or natural history and then derive the corresponding fraction of cases that are overdiagnosed. This article concludes with questions that readers of overdiagnosis studies can use to evaluate the validity and relevance of published estimates and recommends that authors of studies quantifying overdiagnosis provide information about these features.

40|$|Overdiagnosis is an {{emerging}} problem in health policy and practice: we address its definition and ethical implications. We {{argue that the}} definition of overdiagnosis should be expressed {{at the level of}} populations. Consider a condition prevalent in a population, customarily labelled with diagnosis A. We propose that overdiagnosis is occurring in respect of that condition in that population when (1) the condition is being identified and labelled with diagnosis A in that population (consequent interventions may also be offered); (2) this identification and labelling would be accepted as correct in a relevant professional community; but (3) the resulting label and/or intervention carries an unfavourable balance between benefits and harms. We identify challenges in determining and weighting relevant harms, then propose three central ethical considerations in overdiagnosis: the extent of harm done, whether harm is avoidable and whether the primary goal of the actor/s concerned is to benefit themselves or the patient, citizen or society. This distinguishes predatory (avoidable, self-benefiting), misdirected (avoidable, other-benefiting) and tragic (unavoidable, other-benefiting) overdiagnosis; the degree of harm moderates the justifiability of each type. We end with four normative challenges: (1) methods for adjudicating between professional standards and identifying relevant harms and benefits should be procedurally just; (2) individuals, organisations and states are differently responsible for addressing overdiagnosis; (3) overdiagnosis is a matter for distributive justice: the burdens of both overdiagnosis and its prevention could fall on the least-well-off; and (4) communicating about overdiagnosis risks harming those unaware that they may have <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed.</b> These challenges will need to be addressed as the field develops...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the recent {{literature}} on the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia suggests that schizophrenia has <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed</b> in relation to affective disorders. This tendency to inadequately define schizophrenia in clinical and research endeavors has been due to emphasis on 2 ̆ 2 schizophrenic symptoms 2 ̆ 2 to justify the diagnosis. Evidence suggests that the MMPI has never been successful in the differential diagnosis of schizophrenics. A study by Davies (1984) hypothesized that an unknown, and significant, number of criterion 2 ̆ 2 schizophrenics 2 ̆ 2 used {{in the construction of}} Scale 8 were really subjects with affective disorders who had been misdiagnosed as schizophrenic. The Davies study developed three new MMPI subscales to: (a) differentiate schizophrenics from controls, (b) differentiate bipolar manics from controls, and (c) differentiate manics from schizophrenics. The study did not attempt to separate schizophrenics from depressives and it is assumed that the resultant subscale (SCZ-T) remains contaminated with items more indicative of depression than schizophrenia. Just as problems exist in the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, there are similar problems in diagnosing affective disorders. The ICD- 9 and the DSM-III may be of questionable utility in the differential diagnosis of affective disorders. George Winokur (1981) has proposed a new classification schema of primary affective disorders. He makes a major distinction between bipolar and unipolar depression. Unipolar depressions display no history of mania and can be divided into two major groups according to family psychiatric history. Patients with familial pure depressive disease (FPDD) have first degree relatives who suffer from depression but have no significant history of mania, alcoholism or sociopathy. Clients with depressive spectrum disease (DSD) have an excess of psychiatric illness (including depression, alcoholism, or antisocial behavior) in first degree relatives. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to build upon the work of Winokur and Davies to develop new MMPI subscales capable of differentially diagnosing: 1) Schizophrenic disorders, 2) Primary depression (unipolar and bipolar), and 3) major subtypes of Primary Unipolar Depression...|$|E
40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were twofold: (1) to examine preadoptive health {{expectations}} of parents prior to their child coming into the U. S. and compare these to the diagnoses given to the children by their U. S. healthcare physician 6 months after the adoption; and (2) to examine both the types of health care parents anticipated seeking for their adopted children prior to adoption, and which services they actually utilized 6 months after the children were home. One hundred and forty-three adoptive mothers and their children (86 girls, 56 boys; age range = 3 to 129 months; M = 16. 44 months, SD = 18. 36), for whom both preadoptive and 6 -months post-adoption data were available, participated in this study. Based on pre-adoption information, 49 (34. 27 %) children were identified with at least one medical problem (as identified by the country of origin), and of those 15 (30. 61 %) had two or more health issues. The 6 -months post-adoption survey indicated that 68 (47. 55 %) children were identified with at least one medical problem, and of those 28 (41. 17 %) had two or more health issues. There was a significant increase from pre- to 6 -months post-adoption in the mean number of parent-reported medical conditions, t (142) = - 3. 32, p =. 001. Adoptive mothers reported significantly more visual problems; recurrent ear/sinus infections and hearing problems; and intestinal parasites, lice, or scabies 6 -months post-adoption relative to their reports at pre-adoption, suggesting that these conditions were unexpected. Other conditions, such as cleft lip/palate, were consistently reported across both time points. There was a trend for over reporting of heart defects and hepatitis B at pre-adoption relative to the information provided 6 -months post-adoption, suggesting that these conditions might have <b>been</b> <b>overdiagnosed</b> by the country of origin. Regarding service utilization patterns, nearly 60 % of mothers planned on having their child’s healthcare provided solely by their primary care physician. Very few parents (2. 7 - 5. 0 %) utilized services of an “adoption medical specialist. ”As anticipated, pediatric subspecialty care became more commonly used as the number of health issues increased. Overall, our data suggested that parents were generally well informed. Health conditions, such as heart birth defects, cleft palate, and infectious diseases were anticipated. On the other hand, undiagnosed eye and ear related issues emerged 6 months post-adoption. A lack of a constant caregiver in recognizing health nuances in these children, or a lower index of suspicion and surveillance for these conditions may explain this finding. Similarly, adequate time is needed to confirm failure of the Eustachian tube apparatus, which may explain {{the increase in the number}} of recurrent ear infections. Also, while the average age at adoption was about 15 months, the health information available for each child may not have been entirely up to date at the time the parents received the referral. Our data suggest that referral of the child for a hearing evaluation, and pediatric eye exam, as well as counseling of prospective adoptive parents regarding the possibility of undiagnosed medical conditions (i. e., eye and ear problems) may be warranted...|$|E

Secondly, endometriosis is frequently diagnosed in its early stage by the presence of variable or scarred peritoneal endometriosis, while adenomyosis is rarely diagnosed during the early reproductive life, its identification being made only after the appearance, in older women, of symptoms of abnormal menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea, severe enough to necessitate hysterectomy.
