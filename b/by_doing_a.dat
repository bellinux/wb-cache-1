He was given a 30-day jail sentence, however a plea bargain was made whereby the judge ordered him to arrange to give a {{performance}} at Indiana University with the proceeds {{to be given to}} charity. Bissell was also given a $100 fine. After being fired by the ABT (along with Gelsey Kirkland), they were re-hired and celebrated <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> stash of cocaine they had smuggled in the lining of a ballet slipper.|$|E
5|$|Mario Bros. also {{introduced}} Mario's brother, Luigi, who {{was created for}} the multiplayer mode <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> palette swap of Mario. The two-player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by Joust. To date, Mario Bros. has been released {{for more than a}} dozen platforms. The first movement from Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik is used {{at the start of the}} game. This song has been used in later video games, including Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix and Super Smash Bros. Brawl.|$|E
5|$|After {{a long-running}} legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium {{freehold}} {{with the club}} in 1992 <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> deal with {{the banks of the}} property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash. Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final with Glenn Hoddle. It was not until the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top international players to the side, as the club won the FA Cup in 1997 and established themselves as one of England's top sides again. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, who led the team to victory in the League Cup Final, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, the FA Cup in 2000 and their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.|$|E

5|$|Gröning {{worked as}} a {{bookkeeper}} for a year until 1942, when the SS ordered that desk jobs would be reserved for injured veterans, and that fit members in administrative roles were {{to be subjected to}} more challenging duties. Gröning and about 22 of his colleagues travelled to Berlin where they reported to one of the SS economic offices. They were then given a lecture by several high-ranking officers who reminded them of the oath of loyalty they took, which they could prove <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> difficult task. The task was top secret – Gröning and his comrades had to sign a declaration that they would not disclose it to family or friends, or people not in their unit. Once this had concluded, they were split into smaller groups and taken to various Berlin stations where they boarded a train in the direction of Katowice with orders to report to the commandant of Auschwitz, a place Gröning had not heard of before.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not fitting with the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E

Mercedes is devastated and later goes to find Joe for support but is left further heartbroken when his half-brother, Jason Roscoe (Alfie Browne-Sykes), tells her that he has left the village following their argument. She is left to face giving birth alone, but is relieved when her family arrive to support her. After giving birth to her son who she decides to name Gabriel, Mercedes is left overwhelmed with grief and the funeral costs. Theresa decides to help raise money for the funeral <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> naked photo shoot. However, even after the money for the funeral had been gathered, Mercedes is still left heartbroken and distraught. Theresa then decides to make a phonecall to Myra, informing her of the situation and begs her to come home. At Gabriel's funeral, Myra finds Mercedes sitting on the outside bench, and comforts her as she apologize to her for faking her death last year. Mercedes is delighted to see her and they make amends. Her family arrange a mini memorial service for Gabriel at their home where she says goodbye to him. When Joe finds out that Gabriel has died, he finds Mercedes and reveals he is still in love with her and they decide to go on holiday together.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} in Mega Man & Bass {{is similar}} to earlier games in the series. The player is tasked with completing a series of action-platform stages while overcoming obstacles, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies. Destroying the [...] "Robot Master" [...] boss {{at the end of}} a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon. In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega Man. In this game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed. Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground. Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained. Bass is also able to double-jump (jump a second time in mid-air) and dash along the ground. Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> dash-jump.|$|E
500|$|Johnson said {{he found}} SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an SFTP connection, from an IP address that {{resolved}} to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks.

The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video. Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook.

500|$|Johnson's wing was {{the first}} to be {{stationed}} on French soil following the invasion. [...] With their radius of action now far extended compared to the squadrons still in Britain, the wing scored heavily through the summer. On 21 August 1944, Johnson was leading No. 443 Squadron on a patrol over the Seine, near Paris. Johnson bounced a formation of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, shooting down two, which were recorded on the cine camera. Climbing back to his starting point at 8,000ft, Johnson attempted to join a formation of six aircraft, he thought were Spitfires. The fighters were actually Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Johnson escaped <b>by</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> series of steep climbs, during which he nearly stalled and blacked out. He eventually evaded the Messerschmitts, which had been trying to flank him on either side, while two more stuck to his tail. Johnson's Spitfire IX was hit by enemy aircraft fire for the only time, taking cannon shells in the rudder and elevators. Johnson had now equalled and surpassed Sailor Malan's record score of 32, shooting down two Fw 190s for his 32—33 air victories. However Johnson considered Malan's exploits to be better. Johnson points out, when Malan fought (during 1940—41), he did so outnumbered, and had matched the enemy even then. Johnson said: ...|$|E
