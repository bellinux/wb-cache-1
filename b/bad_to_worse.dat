5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an {{inspirational}} performance from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were undone last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints pulled off a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for the striker. This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice {{were joined by}} a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed in principle to finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

However, with the tenth ball of the fourth day Chapple dismissed Kabir Ali to end with five for 32, and Warwickshire were all out for 113.|$|E
5000|$|Lily and Jim (1997) is a 16mm {{animated}} {{short film}} by Don Hertzfeldt. It is Hertzfeldt's third student film from UC Santa Barbara, {{for which he}} single-handedly animated over 10,000 drawings.

5000|$|In {{an address}} to the Tasmanian Writers' and Readers' festival in August 1999, Porter stated: [...] "This is a verse novel in the voice of a male psychiatrist, Doctor Peter Cyren, working in Sydney's Callan Park Mental Hospital in the late 60s, who goes from pretty <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> heinous <b>worse.</b> My model here was Shakespeare with his black-hearted but full blooded creations such as Macbeth and Iago. The {{challenge}} is <b>to</b> make <b>bad</b> men good company. And Shakespeare takes that hurdle with magnificent ease." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Buchanan {{seems to}} have thought, that, if to govern little was to govern well, then to do nothing was the {{perfection}} of policy. But there is a vast difference between letting well alone and allowing <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> become <b>worse</b> by a want of firmness at the outset. If Mr. Buchanan, instead of admitting the right of secession, had declared it to be, as it plainly is, rebellion, he would not only have received the unanimous support of the Free States, but would have given confidence to the loyal, reclaimed the wavering, and disconcerted the plotters of treason in the South.|$|R

All are restored to their original characters, Aloysius embraces Clarissa, and Sir Trevor embraces Lady Angela.|$|E

25|$|The {{relations}} of the royal couple went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse.</b> Alexandra used her son {{to put pressure on}} her husband and the child witnessed very violent scenes between his parents. Thanks to the intervention of his maternal grandmother, the 4-year-old Crown Prince Alexander was sent to Italy with the Count and Countess of Robilant, friends of the royal couple. The child then grew up in an atmosphere much more stable and loving, with only few visits from his parents.|$|E

25|$|Another {{art form}} has a wider range: the illness {{narrative}} {{has become a}} staple of breast cancer literature and is prominent in women's magazines. This may {{take the form of}} a restitution or cure narrative (the protagonist seeks a physical or spiritual return to a pre-diagnosis life), a quest narrative (the protagonist must meet a goal before dying), or a chaos narrative (the situation inexorably goes from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse).</b> The cure and quest narratives fit neatly with the breast cancer culture. Chaos narratives, which are rarer in stories about breast cancer, oppose it.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{positive}} developments, {{the situation}} of Alexandra and her mother didn't improve. Indeed, Greece experiencing a series of military defeats against Turkey and a coup d'état soon forced King Constantine I to abdicate again, this time in favor of Diadochos George, on 27 September 1922. Things went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> for the country; a further coup forced the new ruler, {{his wife and his}} brother to leave the country on 19 December 1923.

5000|$|There are {{two general}} {{schools of thought}} {{regarding}} poverty. One says the poor act rationally but have deviant values leading to a [...] "culture of the poor". The second holds that because of faulty attitudes and psychological problems, the poor make poor choices. Shafir and his colleagues proposed a third view: {{that there is no}} difference in methods of calculating outcomes between the poor and other people. The poor make the same errors in decision making as everyone else, but because the margin of error is much smaller for the poor, their <b>bad</b> decisions lead <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> consequences.|$|R
60|$|Seeing how matters stood, and {{how easily}} <b>bad</b> might pass <b>to</b> <b>worse,</b> I {{proposed}} the proceeding whereby a man lived to fight another day.

25|$|After {{a disappointing}} NAB Cup campaign, which {{included}} a loss to the newly formed GWS Giants, the Suns were woeful in their first round loss to the Adelaide Crows. Losses continued to pile as the Gold Cost fell to St Kilda and Essendon before suffering another loss in QClash3. The season went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> when Gary Ablett went down injured in the clash with Brisbane. In the absence of Ablett, a silvering lining was discovered by the club during their next two losses as Harley Bennell's talent was unearthed.

25|$|Enrico Mattei {{was born}} in Acqualagna, in the {{province}} of Pesaro and Urbino, Marche, as the second of five children of Antonio Mattei (a carabiniere – a member of the Italian national gendarmerie) and Angela Galvani. In 1923, he became an apprentice in the tannery industry in Matelica. His career was rapid; from factory hand he quickly moved on to become a chemical assistant and then to laboratory chief at the age of 21. After his military service he became the tannery owner’s chief assistant. However, the economic crisis {{at the end of the}} 1920s made business going from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> until the tannery closed.|$|E

Neither could contain the Sri Lankans, though, as the captain Marvan Atapattu and wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara took Sri Lanka past 200 with 11 overs to go. Sangakkara eventually fell to Rafique, {{and in the next}} over Syed Rasel got rid of pinch hitter Dilhara Lokuhettige for 2, only to see Mahela Jayawardene, the man of the last match, come in to partner Atapattu.

5000|$|Many {{academic}} disciplines {{lay claim to}} the study of jokes (and other forms of humour) as within their purview. Fortunately there are enough jokes, good, <b>bad</b> and <b>worse,</b> <b>to</b> go around. Unfortunately the studies of jokes from each of the interested disciplines brings to mind the tale of the blind men and an elephant where the observations, although accurate reflections of their own competent methodological inquiry, frequently fail to grasp the beast in its entirety. This attests to the joke as a traditional narrative form which is indeed complex, concise and complete in and of itself. It requires a [...] "multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary field of inquiry" [...] to truly appreciate these nuggets of cultural insight.|$|R
25|$|In 1827, {{his mother}} Frances Trollope moved to America with Trollope's three younger siblings, to Nashoba Commune.

Thomas Trollope joined them {{for a short time}} before {{returning}} to the farm at Harrow, but Anthony stayed in England throughout. His mother returned in 1831 and rapidly made a name for herself as a writer, soon earning a good income. His father's affairs, however, went from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse.</b> He gave up his legal practice entirely and failed to make enough income from farming to pay rents to his landlord, Lord Northwick.

Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became becalmed in the Java Sea for three days. In desperation as matters moved from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse,</b> he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared. He was replaced as Master by William Bruce, who {{proved to be a}} drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions, resulting in the crew starving. An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore, previously of Blackadder.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing a}} Honda engine {{partnership}} deal to the BAR team in 2002 and numerous difficulties within the team (including {{a very public}} row and the sacking of Frentzen before his home GP in 2001), Jordan was forced to switch to expensive Cosworth engines. The added burden of this plus DHL withdrawing their sponsorship and Benson & Hedges toning down their sponsorship soon added up {{and the lack of}} funds made his team go from <b>bad</b> <b>to</b> <b>worse</b> in 2003. However, despite this, Jordan delivered an improbable race win in Brazil 2003 courtesy of Giancarlo Fisichella, the first for Fisichella and the last Formula One victory for the Ford Motor Company and the Jordan team.
