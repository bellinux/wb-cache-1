5|$|In {{the days}} {{preceding}} the storm's formation, a tropical wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean. The wave was initially weak as it tracked toward Cuba, but on August10, there were indications of a closed circulation center over the eastern {{portion of the}} island. The low deepened a <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> it moved northward to a position near Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas on August11, at which time the disturbance organized into a tropical storm. The storm intensified throughout the day, and {{on the morning of}} August12, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of about 75mph (120km/h) in the northeastern section of the circulation, although the southwestern portion was still weak and disorganized. It is estimated that Barbara became a hurricane at around 1200UTC.|$|E

25|$|With the ministerial scandals neutralised and the State Plan launched, one of Labor's few {{remaining}} worries {{for the election}} was {{the completion of the}} new Lane Cove Tunnel. Labor feared that the tunnel could prove every <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> problematic as the controversial Cross City Tunnel. At issue in both projects were changes to existing surface roads designed to funnel traffic into the new motorways.|$|E

The interior decoration was by the court's master stonemason Jacob Fortling. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.|$|E

25|$|CP/M {{used the}} 7-bit ASCII set. The other 128 {{characters}} {{made possible by}} the 8-bit byte were not standardized. For example, one Kaypro used them for Greek characters, and Osborne machines used the 8th bit set to indicate an underlined character. WordStar used the 8th <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> an end-of-word marker. International CP/M systems most commonly used the ISO 646 norm for localized character sets, replacing certain ASCII characters with localized characters rather than adding them beyond the 7-bit boundary.|$|E
25|$|Most modern solid-carbide bits {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with a spot drill bit or a center drill <b>bit,</b> <b>as</b> solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.|$|E
25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center drill bits, it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a spotting drill bit (or a spot drill <b>bit,</b> <b>as</b> they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from the}} Marines, {{there was a}} small {{civilian}} caretaker presence on the island consisting of Kuwaiti citizens, as well as a few shop owners, which surprised the Marines a little <b>bit</b> <b>as</b> they were under the impression that the island was deserted. Nevertheless, the Marines felt very safe and secure on the island as Kuwait was an ostensibly U.S.-allied country, the Kuwaiti government told them it was safe, and {{there was a small}} contingent of Kuwaiti police there as well. In addition, the Kuwaiti civilians with whom the Marines interacted with were friendly and were ostensibly glad to have U.S. military forces in their country.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the VGC {{started to}} {{concentrate}} its efforts on bilingual families, though {{the improvement of}} the Flemish schools had an unexpected effect; monolingual French-speaking families also began {{to send their children to}} Flemish schools. This effect increased bit by <b>bit,</b> <b>as</b> bilingualism began to be thought of as normal. Even today, the Flemish educational system continues to attract those with a first language other than Dutch; in 2005, 20% of students go to Dutch-speaking high schools, and for daycares, that figure reaches 23%. In fact, it has got to the point where those with Dutch as a first language are now a minority in the Flemish schools, and as a result, measures have needed to be taken to sustain the quality of education.|$|E
25|$|Center drill bits, {{occasionally}} {{known as}} Slocombe drill bits, {{are used in}} metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation {{in the end of}} a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the center of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe center. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a spotting drill <b>bit</b> (<b>as</b> explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits combined-drill-and-countersinks {{in order to make it}} unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).|$|E
