Some dive sites can only be dived safely at slack water when the tidal cycle reverses and the current slows. Strong currents can cause problems for divers. Buoyancy control can be difficult when a strong current meets a vertical surface. Divers consume more breathing gas when swimming against currents. Divers on the surface can be separated from their <b>boat</b> <b>cover</b> by currents. On the other hand, drift diving is only possible {{when there is a}} reasonable current.|$|E

The club formerly organised safety <b>boat</b> <b>cover</b> for sailing and windsurfing every Saturday and Sunday throughout the year. The purpose-built water sports club house was leased by Bewl Valley Sailing Club and its facilities are shared with Bewl Bridge Rowing Club and Bewl Canoe Club.

During the month of August, the club house was open every day and safety <b>boat</b> <b>cover</b> was provided, except during Youth Week during which there was no club sailing for ordinary members. Members also organised Away Cruises on tidal waters such as to Bradwell in Essex. The Midweekers, an informal group of members met each Wednesday to sail or take part in another outdoor activity.|$|E

Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research is to assess the hazard of unloading and loading workers at Teluk Nibung Port Tanjung Balai, Asahan. The research was a descriptive survey. The data of work accident and health problems hazard in workers were gathered by HIRA method. The Object of the research was to identify the process in stevedoring, cargoding, and delivery. The result of research in unloading and loading workers at stevedoring showed that the highest hazard were found at worker who opened the <b>boat</b> <b>cover</b> and moved goods from boat to darmaga. In cargoding, the highest hazard were found in low back pain risk at worker and hit when workers bring and stack goods in warehouse. In delivery, the highest hazard was found in worker work in truck machine. The results show the value of the highest risk from the analysis of risk is high with the potential for accidents such as drowning, was hit and fell. The recommended that the cooperative workers unloading create safety signs and provide personal protective equipment to minimize risks...|$|E

50|$|The baidarka (small skin boat) {{was a small}} <b>boat</b> <b>covered</b> in {{sea lion}} skin. It was {{developed}} and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability. The Aleut baidarka resembles that of a Yup'ik kayak, but it is hydrodynamically sleeker and faster. They made the baidarka {{for one or two}} persons only. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man baidarkas were about 16 ft feet long and 20 in wide, whereas a two-man was on average about 20 ft long and 24 in wide. It was from the baidarka that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.|$|R
