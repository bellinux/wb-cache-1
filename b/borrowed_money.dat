They were discouraged by the school's finances and sold it to Wood and Gregory, who <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> for the purchase. In 1857 Wood married Henry Shimer, a mason who was a creditor of the seminary. In 1864, the overcrowded school began accepting female students only.|$|E
5|$|Balzac <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> {{from his}} family and friends, and tried to build a {{printing}} business, then a typefounder enterprise. His inexperience and lack of capital caused his ruin in these trades. He gave the businesses to a friend (who made them successful) but carried the debts for many years. As of April 1828 Balzac owed 50,000 francs to his mother.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.|$|E

To bet with a marker, all players still active in the pot must agree to accept the marker. Some clubs and house rules forbid IOUs altogether. If the marker is not acceptable, the bettor may bet with cash out-of-pocket or go all-in.A player may also <b>borrow</b> <b>money</b> from a player not {{involved}} in the pot, giving them a personal marker in exchange for cash or chips, which the players in the pot are then compelled to accept.A player may <b>borrow</b> <b>money</b> to call a bet during a hand, and later in the same hand go all-in due to further betting; but if a player <b>borrows</b> <b>money</b> to raise, they forfeit the right to go all-in later in that same hand - if they are re-raised, they must <b>borrow</b> <b>money</b> to call, or fold. A player may also buy more chips or be bought back in by any other player for any given amount at any given time.|$|R

5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} years, the congregation's {{financial}} situation was precarious. The building was located ten blocks from {{where most of}} the congregants and potential congregants lived (on Grand Street, near the ferry docks), and attendance was low. Even on the High Holy Days, the sanctuary was rarely more than half full. The synagogue employed a rabbi, gabbai, and cantor, and annual expenses often exceeded the congregation's income (which came primarily from the sale of seats). To remain solvent, the congregation <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> against the equity in the building: $2,000 (today $) in 1888, and another $2,000 in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's four {{infantry}} regiments and two cavalry {{units that}} {{served in the}} Spanish–American War were beset by poor sanitation and disease in the army camps where they were stationed. The units saw little action in the war, but 84men {{died as a result}} of the poor conditions. When the time came for the troops to return home, Bradley found that the state had no money to pay for the hospital trains needed for their trip. Bradley personally <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> from a bank to secure their passage, and trusted that the General Assembly would reimburse him.|$|E
5|$|There was at {{the time}} a boom in shares in South American mining companies. Spain was losing its South American colonies in the face of rebellions. At the urging of George Canning the British {{government}} recognised the new independent governments of Argentina (1824), Colombia and Mexico (both 1825). With no money of his own, Disraeli <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> to invest. He became involved with the financier J. D. Powles, who was prominent among those encouraging the mining boom. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies. The pamphlets were published by John Murray, who invested heavily in the boom.|$|E

5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 to 1934, Spedding {{worked for}} Lewis as a {{chemistry}} instructor. Around this time, he {{became interested in}} the chemistry of the rare earths. These were expensive and hard to find, and generally available only in minute amounts. In 1933 he won the Irving Langmuir Award for most outstanding young chemist. The award came with a cash prize of $1,000. He <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> to travel to Chicago to collect it. While he was there, he was approached by a man offering several pounds of Europium and Samarium. His benefactor was Herbert Newby McCoy, a retired chemistry professor from the University of Chicago, who had obtained a supply of these elements from the Lindsey Light and Chemical Company, where they were a byproduct of thorium production. A few weeks later, Spedding received a package in the mail containing jars of the metals.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with <b>borrowed</b> <b>money,</b> Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry and his advisers at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, MacLaren {{and his family}} struggled financially. His wife's family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one occasion, when paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, and threw a dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> from friends. He supplemented his wife's income through working as a journalist and a coach. Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Gasketball was {{developed}} and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa-based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo {{did not have a}} following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 Honoré de Balzac {{had only}} begun to achieve {{recognition}} as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 {{that he wanted to}} become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his gross income from any published work. After moving into a tiny room near the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington <b>borrowed</b> <b>money</b> to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
