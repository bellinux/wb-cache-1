2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the <b>backer</b> <b>rod,</b> the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|E
50|$|Ordinary {{open-cell}} foam is used up to 500 F {{and ordinary}} closed-cell can withstand temperatures up to 160 F. Some <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> may be applied with special tools {{to make it}} easier to set the <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> at the correct and consistent depth. If a joint is too shallow to receive a <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> bond breaker tapes are available to keep the sealant from adhering to the back of the joint.|$|E
50|$|<b>Backer</b> <b>rod</b> {{is often}} round and rope-like in shape but many special types and shaped such as square, {{rectangular}} and D-shapes are available. High temperature backer rods are available.

50|$|Air barrier {{accessories}} - Products designated {{to maintain}} air tightness between air barrier materials, assemblies and components, to fasten {{them to the}} structure of the building, or both (e.g., sealants, tapes, <b>backer</b> <b>rods,</b> transition membranes, nails/washers, ties, clips, staples, strapping, primers) and which has an air permeance rate no greater than 0.02 L/(s•m²) at a pressure difference of 75 Pa when tested in accordance with ASTM E 2178. Air barrier components are used to connect and seal air barrier materials and/or air barrier assemblies together.|$|R
50|$|Concerns {{of using}} double tees in bridge constructions include bridge deck {{longitudinal}} cracks. As the connection points between the double tee beams are longitudinally along the traffic flow, any lateral movements of double tees {{can cause the}} road surface to crack longitudinally. These include differential rotation of double-tee flanges that can cause asphalt surface to raise or crack. A separation of the flanges can cause asphalt to sag into the gap forming a reflective crack. To reduce these problems, many methods {{have been developed to}} manage the lateral connections of the double tees. The materials used in the connections are <b>backer</b> <b>rods,</b> steel bars, welded plates, and grouts.|$|R

50|$|Closed-cell foam {{does not}} absorb water and is impermeable. Closed-cell rods are less {{compressible}} {{and should not}} be compressed more than 25%. Closed-cell rod will also lose firmness and out-gas if damaged during installation or overcompressed or at sharp bends. The gasses cannot pass through this <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> and can deform, weaken, and even cause holes (leaks) in the sealant as it escapes. Out-gassing is the reason open-cell <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> was developed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backer</b> <b>rod,</b> {{also called}} backer {{material}} or back-up rod, is a flexible foam product used behind caulking to increase elasticity, reduce consumption, force the caulking {{into contact with}} the sides of the joint creating a better bond, determine the thickness of the caulking, and define the cross-section hour-glass shape of the caulk. The <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> also acts as a bond breaker to keep the caulking from sticking {{to the bottom of the}} opening called a three-sided bond; with the caulking only adhering to the sides of the opening in an hour-glass shape it can flex more easily and is less likely to tear. Backer rods can also be used to reduce consumption of the caulking by filling part of the joints.|$|E
5000|$|Retrofit {{installations}} {{are possible}} with electric systems by cutting grooves 1" [...] to 1" [...] deep and between 1/4" [...] and 3/8" [...] wide into the asphalt or concrete, inserting the cables and sealing the grooves with <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> {{and a special}} caulking or sealant at {{the surface of the}} groove.|$|E
50|$|Open-cell foam is porous so it {{will let}} gasses through which could {{otherwise}} cause blistering of the sealant. Also, open-cell <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> allows air {{to get to the}} back side of the sealant which accelerates curing when used with air-cured sealants such as silicone. Open-cell rod is more compressible than closed-cell foam and should be 25% larger diameter than the joint.|$|E
50|$|Packing with {{inherently}} fire-resistive materials, such as rockwool or {{ceramic fibre}} {{is intended to}} protect sealants that would, on their own, be consumed by the fire. Lesser packing, such as foam <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> or fibreglass are used simply to hold up materials that can survive fire testing on their own. In both cases, the packing is placed {{in such a way}} as to control the exact depth of the materials that top off the seal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hour-glass}} {{shape and}} {{thickness of the}} sealant are important. The hour-glass shape provides the appropriate adhesive strength to the object {{at the sides of}} the joint in relation to the cohesive strength of the sealant itself. The depth of the sealant affects these strengths, {{too much or too little}} sealant can result in failure. The standard recommendation is to place the <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> one-half the width of the joint (a 2:1 ratio) below the surface, but not more than [...]5 in (depending on the manufacturer).|$|E
40|$|INDOT (as well {{as several}} {{surrounding}} states) have observed that certain concrete pavements may show a susceptibility to joint deterioration. Unfortunately, {{by the time that}} this joint deterioration is observed it is often too late and costly partial depth repairs are needed. The deterioration is generally occurring in the joint behind the <b>backer</b> <b>rod</b> and joint sealant; as such, it is difficult to detect even if one is standing directly above the joint. This project investigated the use of electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar as two techniques to detect premature joint deterioration. The thought process was that if the joint deterioration is determined at an early stage, low cost corrective actions can be taken to extend the life of the concrete. The electrical response was measured for mortars subjected to a temperature cycle from 23 °C to - 35 °C, with varying degrees of saturation, and varying salt concentrations. The resistivity increased as the degree of saturation was reduced due to the reduction in the volume of the conductive medium and increase in tortuosity. Changes in resistivity were detected when cracking occurred in the sample. The magnitude of these changes was similar to that detected using changes in the ultrasonic wave speed. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used effectively to detect fluid accumulation in the saw-cut joint behind the joint sealant. The typical GPR waveforms are however difficult and time consuming to interpret. A signal processing approach called, referred to as the CID, was used to obtain a single number that reflects the potential for fluid in the joint. Scalar waveform features and the computed CID can be used to estimate which joints may contain fluid thereby providing insights into which joint sealant sections may need to be repaired or when a sufficient number of joints may contain fluid suggesting a larger joint maintenance effort be performed to seal the joints or the concrete...|$|E
40|$|Soy {{methyl ester}} {{polystyrene}} (SME-PS) {{is an alternative}} sealer that has been put {{through a variety of}} tests in the lab. The goal of this research is to quantify the sealer’s effectiveness at protecting concrete in the field. SME-PS is comprised of a renewable resource and a waste product; soybeans and waste styrofoam respectively. SME-PS is hydrophobic and absorbs into the surface of the concrete therefore, it reduces the ingress of water and other materials contained in the water such as deicers. Moreover, it has proven to have similar performance compared to other sealing techniques in shorter, more aggressive tests. ^ However, a need exists to understand the performance of SME-PS over longer periods of time. Approximately 4 years ago, two field locations located in Indiana - one on US 231 in Lafayette and another on 126 th Street in Fishers - were sealed with SME-PS to address this need. ^ This work revisits these sites to identify if any new damage has occurred since the time of SME-PS application. Cores were taken from the two test sections. A new test method was developed to test sealer performance in concrete pavements. This test uses a titration technique to determine chloride ingress {{from the surface of the}} concrete pavement saw cut. SME-PS shows similar performance in some locations while in others the chloride content is 20 % higher when compared to the filler and <b>backer</b> <b>rod.</b> Compared to the unsealed pavement joints, both SME-PS and filler/backer rod sealant show a reduction in chlorides of about 40 - 50 %. One observation made while preparing some of the cores for titration was that the depth of the saw cut varied greatly which start to influence results since deicers come in from the top surface. Another important caveat of the titration test is that it does not distinguish between free chlorides and bound chlorides. It is important to account for these discrepancies when interpreting the results of the test and subsequently determining sealer performance. ^ This work encompasses the first results obtained from the field. It is important to continue sampling in order to determine how long the SME-PS compares with current sealants over a longer duration of time. In addition to the two locations on Indiana roads, 60 concrete slabs made according to Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) specifications were cast at the Center for Aging Infrastructure (CAI). These slabs are exposed to the environment and deicers are sprayed on the surface to accelerate chloride ingress. Continuing data acquisition from these two experiments will help users understand how long their concrete remains sealed and when reapplication is recommended. ^ The second portion of the work highlights the mixture of SME-PS with a luminescent powder for use as a glow in the dark (GITD) concrete sealer. The luminescent powder, strontium aluminate, luminesces in the dark after being excited by light. The luminescent sealer could be used to increase concrete service life, supplement streetlights, and increase the travelling public’s safety at night. A test procedure was developed to quantify the sealer luminance and duration. Quantification of the sealer’s luminescent properties is key to evaluating the performance. The results of the tests indicate the sealed luminescent surface emits light (i. e., glows) for approximately 1 to 50 hours in a dark space after excitation depending on application rate, particle size, exposure time and orientation in the field. ...|$|E
