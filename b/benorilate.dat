50|$|<b>Benorilate</b> (INN), or benorylate, is an ester-linked codrug {{of aspirin}} with paracetamol. It {{is used as}} an {{anti-inflammatory}} and antipyretic medication. In the treatment of childhood fever, {{it has been shown}} to be inferior to paracetamol and aspirin taken separately. In addition, because it is converted to aspirin, benorylate is not recommended in children due to concerns about Reye syndrome.|$|E
40|$|National High Technology Research and Development Program (863) of China [2007 AA 091503]The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{validate}} a high-performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method for analysis of the deacetyl mycoepoxydiene in rat plasma. The analyte and internal standard (IS.), <b>benorilate,</b> were extracted from rat plasma by precipitation protein and separated on a C(18) column using acetonitrile- 0. 5 % formic acid as mobile phase. Detection was performed using a turbo-spray ionization source and mass spectrometric positive multi-reaction-monitoring-mode (+MRM) at an ion voltage of + 4800 V. The assay was linear over the concentration range 5 - 5000 ng/mL with the lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 5 ng/mL. The method also afforded satisfactory results in terms of the sensitivity, specificity, precision (Ultra- and inter-day, RSD < 5. 8 %), accuracy, recovery as well as the stability of the analyte under various conditions. The method was successfully applied to a preclinical pharmacokinetic study in rats after a single intravenous administration of deacetyl mycoepoxydiene 10 mg/kg. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.
