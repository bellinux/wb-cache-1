Using a unique and comprehensive sample of 37 locally listed IPO firm’s from acrossWest Africa, I find evidence of a considerable reduction in underpricing and costs of equity in firms listing on civil code as opposed to common law markets. Furthermore, I find evidence that firms employing their existing bank as <b>lead</b> <b>manager</b> have higher costs of equity while the employment of a foreign as opposed to domestic <b>lead</b> <b>manager</b> imparts a reduction in underpricing and cost of equity...|$|R

We find that security analysts increase their bank's chance of comanaging an IPO when they issue generous recommendations to recent IPOs {{managed by the}} IPO's <b>lead</b> <b>manager.</b> However, this result holds only for prestigious banks. Less prestigious banks, whose recommendations are less influential, do not obtain such rewards from <b>lead</b> <b>managers.</b> We also find that security analysts increase their bank's chance of managing future IPOs when they issue generous recommendations to recent IPOs managed by their own bank. This result, however, holds only for non-prestigious banks.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the fees charged by underwriters for conducting IPOs in China. By examining {{a sample of}} 1, 171 Chinese IPOs conducted during 2001 - 2011, I obtain the first evidence from China on the direct issue cost, the gross spreads, and identify its determinants, including issue proceeds, number of <b>lead</b> <b>managers,</b> and <b>lead</b> <b>manager</b> reputation. The results show a pattern of over-time increase of the spreads, which is at 0. 16 percentage points per year for state-owned enterprise (SOE) offerings and 0. 73 percentage points per year for non-SOE ones. The gross spreads do not exhibit clustering, but are largely consistent with increased demand for underwriting services from non-SOEs that, together with increased complexity of underwriting, has pushed underwriting fees up. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

We compare the distortions that arise from share-price maximization with those due to herd behavior among profit-maximizing firms, and show that the former results in strictly less efficient use of information. ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a sample of 1605 Initial Public Offerings made on German, French and British stock markets, we try to {{understand}} the constitution of underwriting syndicate taking into consideration two hypotheses made on IPO placement risk and <b>lead</b> <b>manager</b> reputation. We show that the situations are highly contrasted between these three stock markets. The first fundamental result is the existence of various forms of syndication in German, British and French markets. German issues are characterized by large syndicates where the <b>lead</b> <b>manager</b> is joined by other banks. Conversely, British issues are strongly concentrated on syndicates with single bank. French IPOs present an intermediate situation with syndicate size composed of more than two banks. Our second result shows that the hypothesis of an increase in syndicate size, in the presence of great uncertainty seems well-founded on German and French markets. We noted that these two markets were on average more risky for share placement and that the mechanisms of the syndicate size increase worked to diversify the risk for syndicate members. On the other hand, the British market did not respond to the influences of risk variables. It is a market where initial return volatility, proportion of “paper return ” and underpricing of previou...|$|R
