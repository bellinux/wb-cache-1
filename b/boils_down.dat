25|$|Furthermore, morphisms that {{preserve}} all joins are equivalently {{characterized as}} the lower adjoint {{part of a}} unique Galois connection. Each of these determines a unique upper adjoint in the inverse direction that preserves all meets. Hence, considering complete lattices with complete semilattice morphisms <b>boils</b> <b>down</b> to considering Galois connections as morphisms. This also yields the insight that the introduced morphisms do basically describe just two different categories of complete lattices: one with complete homomorphisms and one with meet-preserving functions (upper adjoints), dual to the one with join-preserving mappings (lower adjoints).|$|E
25|$|While {{dialogue}} {{can involve}} {{two or more}} people having conversations about opposing view points, it is not dialectical {{because there is no}} thesis or antithesis. In dialetical debates, all parties engaged are trying to prove the other wrong (which is what modern day psychotherapy <b>boils</b> <b>down</b> to). Rather, dialogue is more of a fusion of horizons, to use Gadamer’s term. When Dasein engages in dialogue with others, his horizon effectively fuses with the horizons of others. These horizons are polyphonic (multi-voiced) and fuse {{for the sole purpose of}} achieving higher truth and understanding. Put differently, the horizons of two polyphonic individuals are fused together during dialogue in such a way that both horizons are influenced and edified as opposed to one winning out over the other, and as opposed to one horizon remaining the same while the other that is judged to be wrong, or could be, is changed. Hermeneutics states that fusing horizons with others involves memory and imagination. It is through dialogue that memory and imagination enables therapists to empathically envision (intropathy) the horizon of their clients and further fuse it with their own.|$|E

Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying: [...] "I think, truthfully, it <b>boils</b> <b>down</b> to the economic interest of manufacturers and [...] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} song's intro and {{extended}} ending (or coda), the composition is structured into three patterns of verse and chorus, {{with the second}} and third patterns separated by an instrumental section. The song originally contained a fourth verse–chorus combination, but this would be omitted from the officially released recording. Among musicologists discussing [...] "It's All Too Much", Walter Everett describes it as a two-chord composition, whereas Alan Pollack contends that the song's sole chord is G major, although he concedes that transcribers may well list fleeting changes to C major over the choruses. In Pollack's opinion, these sections appear to employ IV (C major) and ii (A minor) chords yet, rather than formal changes, [...] "it all <b>boils</b> <b>down</b> to neighbor tone motion in the inner voices superimposed on to the pedal tone of G in the bass." ...|$|E
50|$|By the mid-1860s, {{drought and}} {{recession}} {{had led to}} a collapse in the pastoral industry in north Queensland. In order to salvage some profit, squatters turned to the <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> of sheep and cattle for tallow (for candles and soap). Hoofs and horns were utilised for oil, and hides for leather. In 1864 a number of small-scale <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works were established on pastoral properties in the Kennedy and gulf districts, but the <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> industry became more professional in 1866, when Towns & Co. opened a <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> plant at Cleveland Bay, and Morehead & Young, partners in the Scottish Australian Pastoral Company, opened a similar operation on the Albert River where the settlement of Burketown had been established in 1865. Neither of these establishments survived {{for any length of}} time. At Cleveland Bay, the Queensland Meat Export Company established a meatworks south of Townsville on Alligator Creek in 1879, using some of the equipment from Towns' factory.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Boiling</b> <b>down</b> {{works have}} been an {{important}} industry throughout Queensland during a number of periods. The establishment of such works usually coincided with drought and low prices for wool and beef. Boiling-down factories were started in Brisbane in 1843 by John [...] "Tinker" [...] Campbell and in Ipswich in 1847. By 1851, two works were located in Ipswich. Other <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works being established on the Darling Downs during the 1860s, included Campbell's operation on Westbrook Homestead, the depression of the time being the predominant reason behind the establishment of such industries. Consequently, reasons behind {{the establishment of the}} <b>boiling</b> <b>down</b> works at St Lawrence may also have been due to the effects of the depression.|$|R

500|$|At the 2002 {{conference for}} Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy, Dr. Nancy Tuana {{asserted}} that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction; she states {{that it has been}} ignored because of [...] "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear." [...] She reasoned that this fear causes ignorance, which veils female sexuality. O'Connell states, [...] "It <b>boils</b> <b>down</b> to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive." [...] She reiterates that the vestibular bulbs appear {{to be part of the}} clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the location of female sexual function and orgasm.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer and}} critic Kim Newman went further, {{explaining}} in a 2003 television documentary on Nigel Kneale's career {{that he believed}} Quatermass {{to be not only}} a representation of science but of humanity itself. Referring to the conclusion of The Quatermass Experiment, he commented that: [...] "It almost <b>boils</b> <b>down</b> to an editorial speech by Quatermass representing humanity, or the humane aspects of humanity. He talks to the monster, and so the monster is defeated by an intellectual argument or an emotional appeal." [...] Like Kneale, he contrasted this to American science-fiction productions, where the alien adversary would be defeated by [...] "it being blown up or electrocuted, or having the entire firepower of the army turned against it." [...] Hammer had altered their film version of the story so that the creature is in fact killed by being electrocuted.|$|E

In March 2014, Rolling Stone reported that the NFL had added $15 million to its arbitration claim {{for a total of}} $16.6 million.
