25|$|In 1926, Dr P. Vadarajulu Naidu, who was {{conducting}} a Tamil news-cum-views weekly ‘Tamil Nadu’ started a daily {{with the same}} name. Its forceful and colluqial style gained it a wide readership but after the paper failed to take sides with the 1930 Civil Disobedience Movement, the Congress Party decided to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> new Tamil daily- India, edited by renowned poet Subramania Bharati. India showed great promise but could not establish itself financially, and folded up soon after Bharati was exiled to Pondicherry. All these papers were published from Madras.|$|E

At Dover, Busch {{finished}} 21st, three laps down, after he had to pit for a loose wheel. At Kansas, Busch was forced {{to start at the}} rear of the field when he crashed in practice and had to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> backup car. He managed to work his way through the field to finish second. This brought Busch up to ten top-five and fifteen top-ten finishes over 30 races. Busch would go on to finish tenth in the final standings.|$|E
25|$|The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth {{colors in}} various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the {{original}} colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain {{is applied to the}} ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of the stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1809, the Emperor recalled his Guard to central Germany for the War of the Fifth Coalition. They were present {{at the battle of}} Aspern-Essling, under the intense fire of the numerous Austrian artillery, and saw the struggle of their army to contain a vastly superior opponent. When Napoleon himself had his boot torn by a canister ball, general Frédéric Henri Walther, commander of the Guard cavalry, threatened the Emperor that he would have his grenadiers take him behind the lines by force if he refused to do so willingly. The latter complied but had to order a general retreat of the army to the Danube island of Lobau. Six weeks later, Napoleon crossed the Danube again, this time managing to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> considerable force, attacking the Austrians on the Marchfeld plain. The ensuing battle of Wagram would see the Grenadiers à Cheval in reserve during the first day of battle.|$|E
25|$|At {{a second}} interview, Mr. Cooke told Wheatstone of his {{intention}} to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> working telegraph, and explained his method. Wheatstone, according to his own statement, remarked to Cooke that the method would not act, and produced his own experimental telegraph. Finally, Cooke proposed that they should enter into a partnership, but Wheatstone was at first reluctant to comply. He was a well-known man of science, and had meant to publish his results without seeking to make capital of them. Cooke, on the other hand, declared that his sole object {{was to make a}} fortune from the scheme. In May they agreed to join their forces, Wheatstone contributing the scientific, and Cooke the administrative talent. The deed of partnership was dated 19 November 1837. A joint patent was taken out for their inventions, including the five-needle telegraph of Wheatstone, and an alarm worked by a relay, in which the current, by dipping a needle into mercury, completed a local circuit, and released the detent of a clockwork.|$|E
25|$|Towards 500 a Scythian monk, {{known as}} Dionysius Exiguus, {{who had come}} to Rome after the death of Pope Gelasius (496), and who was well skilled in both Latin and Greek, {{undertook}} to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> more exact translation of the canons of the Greek councils. In a second effort he collected papal decretals from Siricius (384-89) to Anastasius II (496-98), inclusive, anterior therefore, to Pope Symmachus (514-23). By order of Pope Hormisdas (514-23), Dionysius made a third collection, in which he included the original text of all the canons of the Greek councils, together with a Latin version of the same; but the preface alone has survived. Finally, he combined the first and second in one collection, which thus united the canons of the councils and the papal decretals; it is in this shape that the work of Dionysius has reached us. This collection opens with a table or list of titles, each of which is afterwards repeated before the respective canons; then come the first fifty canons of the Apostles, the canons of the Greek councils, the canons of Carthage (419), and the canons of preceding African synods under Aurelius, which had been read and inserted in the Council of Carthage. This first part of the collection is closed by a letter of Pope Boniface I, read at the same council, letters of Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople to the African Fathers, and a letter of Pope Celestine I. The second part of the collection opens likewise with a preface, {{in the shape of a}} letter to the priest Julian, and a table of titles; then follow one decretal of Siricius, twenty-one of Innocent I, one of Zozimus, four of Boniface I, three of Celestine I, seven of pope Leo I, one of Gelasius I and one of Anastasius II. The additions met with in Voel and Justel are taken from inferior manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|The first World Series {{game was}} a highly {{anticipated}} matchup between 2-time National League Cy Young Award winner (2008,2009) Tim Lincecum, against the 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner and heretofore undefeated in postseason play Cliff Lee. The pitching matchup {{turned out to be}} a sideline, as the Giants won the first game of the World Series by 11–7 over the Rangers, backed by Freddy Sanchez's three doubles, setting a World Series record for being the first player to hit three consecutive doubles in their first three at bats. The game also saw the Giants set the record for the most runs (6) scored in a single half-inning in a World Series since 1933. The next day, the Giants won game 2 of the World Series, crushing the Rangers 9–0 after the Rangers walked 4 in a row and allowed 7 runs to the Giants in the 8th inning. Matt Cain also had a dominant game, pitching 7 innings without giving up a run. The Giants went on to lose Game 3 in Arlington, Texas 4–2 after a 3-run home run from Ranger's rookie Mitch Moreland in the second inning, and a solo home run by Josh Hamilton in the fifth. Game 4 belonged to the Giants, as rookie left-handed starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner shut out the Rangers over eight innings with home runs by Aubrey Huff and Buster Posey propelling the team to a 4–0 victory. The Giants, along with Tim Lincecum, won Game 5 by a score of 3–1. Lincecum outdueled Cliff Lee in an every-pitch-matters matchup that was scoreless until Édgar Rentería hit a stunning three-run homer with two outs in the seventh inning. Nelson Cruz homered in the bottom half, but Lincecum returned to his wicked self and preserved the lead. Brian Wilson was brought in to pitch the 9th and produced a scoreless inning, allowing San Francisco to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> series of firsts, not just for the Giants, but also for the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Bay Area. Édgar Rentería was named World Series Most Valuable Player.|$|E

500|$|John Ford {{reportedly}} once commented in {{a letter}} that O'Hara was the finest actress in Hollywood, but he rarely praised her in person. Bertrand Tavernier, on the contrary, professed that O'Hara {{was one of the}} actresses he most detested. [...] Though she was quite proud of her own versatility as an actress, saying [...] "I played every kind of role. I was never petite or cute so there was never anything about me which would go out of style", critics found fault with her range. Malone wrote that she [...] "seemed to struggle in comedic roles but proved her mettle in films that called on her to take charge of situations or find courage in the face of adversity". One critic remarked that it took a director like John Ford to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> good performance from her. [...] The Irish critic Philip Moloy thought the opposite, saying [...] "It is not something that she would accept herself, but Maureen O'Hara's career probably suffered from its long-term association with John Ford. John Ford's view of Ireland, and things Irish, tended to be broad, sentimental and sociologically distorted, and his characters were often cliched representatives of their nationality". In the 1960s, O'Hara ventured into maturer roles as she aged.|$|E

500|$|Eccleston {{stated in}} April 2004 {{that he did}} not believe his Doctor would be [...] "as {{eccentric}} and as foppish as he was in some of his incarnations". Russell T Davies characterised the character as a [...] "stripped down" [...] version of previous Doctors. Regarding the Ninth Doctor's less eccentric character, Davies stated: [...] "He travels in time and space, he's got two hearts, he's a Time Lord— that's eccentric enough to be getting on with". In contrast with previous Doctors, the Ninth Doctor speaks with a distinct Northern accent. Remarking on this aspect of his characterisation Eccleston states that the character [...] "is a scientist and an intellectual, {{and a lot of people}} seem to think you can only be those things if you speak with received pronunciation which, of course, is rubbish." [...] In regards to the Doctor's costume, consisting of simply a black leather coat and dark trousers, Eccleston stated, [...] "I didn't want the costume to be my performance" [...] and that [...] "I wanted any flamboyance and colour to come out of my acting." [...] Eccleston thought that as the Doctor he should show a [...] "slight dark side" [...] but also <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> lighter side. Executive producer Julie Gardner observed that the Ninth Doctor gave Eccleston the chance to be [...] "very intense but also frivolous as well." ...|$|E

[...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said.

In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although some people would say [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character."

500|$|Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp, The Mad Hatter. Wasikowska {{said that}} the characters, [...] "both feel like outsiders and feel alone in their {{separate}} worlds, and have a special bond and friendship." [...] Burton explained that Depp [...] "tried to find a grounding to the character ... {{as opposed to just}} being mad." [...] Burton also said that, [...] "In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [...] goal was to try and <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> human side to the strangeness of the character." [...] The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character [...] "was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes". Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions. In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to [...] "a mood ring, [...] his emotions are very close to the surface". The [...] Hatter is [...] "made up of different people and their extreme sides", with a gentle voice much like the character's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent (which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher's Rab C. Nesbitt character) reflecting a darker, more dangerous personality. Illusionary dancer David [...] "Elsewhere" [...] Bernal doubled for Depp during the [...] "Futterwacken" [...] sequence {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E
