25|$|The DOE {{recognized}} the developing shortage of both tritium and helium-3. and began producing tritium by lithium irradiation at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station in 2010. In this process tritium-producing <b>burnable</b> absorber rods (TPBARs) containing lithium in a ceramic form are {{inserted into the}} reactor {{in place of the}} normal boron control rods Periodically the TPBARs are replaced and the tritium extracted.|$|E
25|$|Inherently safe design (safety by passive {{components}} {{and the strong}} negative temperature coefficient of reactivity of some designs). In some designs, the fuel and the coolant are the same fluid, so a loss of coolant removes the reactor's fuel. Unlike steam, fluoride salts dissolve poorly in water, and do not form <b>burnable</b> hydrogen. Unlike steel and solid uranium oxide, molten salts are not damaged by the core's neutron bombardment.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} basics of fuel combustion, no matter what type of fuel system is used on a given engine, the carburetor's sole job is to provide exactly the correct amount of finely {{atomized}} fuel into a given amount of air that is entering the engine. To be <b>burnable,</b> the {{air to fuel ratio}} must be within the flammability limits of between nine and sixteen pounds of air to one pound of fuel (for gasoline engines). Above or below this ratio, the fuel will not burn.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} types of heat pumps are {{compression}} and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while {{absorption heat pump}}s may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or <b>burnable</b> fuels). An absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or LP gas, for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is {{the ratio of the}} energy supplied to the energy consumed, may average only 1.5, that is better than a natural gas or LP gas furnace, which can only approach 1.|$|E
25|$|During the Enlightenment era, the {{economic}} situation of Valenciennes was in decline until the discovery of coal. The first pit was dug in Fresnes in 1718 and the discovery of <b>burnable</b> coal in 1734 at the porte d'Anzin {{led to the formation}} of the Compagnie des mines d'Anzin. In the eighteenth century, the city was equally renowned for its porcelain — indeed, it was the porcelain furnaces' demand for coal that led to the mining enterprises. Despite their quality of production, the company failed to be sustainable. Valenciennes, rich in artistic talent, became known as the Athens of the North (i.e. North of France), underlining its artistic influence.|$|E
25|$|Reactors used {{in nuclear}} marine {{propulsion}} (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot be run at continuous power {{around the clock}} {{in the same way}} that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate <b>burnable</b> neutron poison in the fuel rods. This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.|$|E
2500|$|Reactivity is {{controlled}} {{almost entirely by}} control rods and <b>burnable</b> poisons. [...] This {{eliminates the need for}} Boron in the primary water, which is a plus for plant chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|In QUADRISO {{particles}} a <b>burnable</b> neutron poison (europium oxide or {{erbium oxide}} or carbide) layer surrounds the fuel kernel of ordinary TRISO particles to better manage the excess of reactivity. If the core is equipped both with TRISO and QUADRISO fuels, at beginning of life neutrons do {{not reach the}} fuel of the QUADRISO particles because they are stopped by the <b>burnable</b> poison. After irradiation, the poison depletes and neutrons stream into the fuel kernel of QUADRISO particles inducing fission reactions. This mechanism compensates fuel depletion of ordinary TRISO fuel. In the generalized QUADRISO fuel concept the poison can eventually be mixed with the fuel kernel or the outer pyrocarbon. The QUADRISO [...] concept has been conceived at Argonne National Laboratory.|$|E

2500|$|Little Inferno is a sandbox-oriented puzzle {{video game}} {{primarily}} viewed from a first-person perspective. The player assumes {{the role of}} a small, largely unseen character who possesses the fictional [...] "Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace," [...] which he uses to incinerate various objects, such as toys and appliances, to keep warm (necessary due to a seemingly unending drop in the game world's temperature). The objects release money when they are burned, which is used to purchase more <b>burnable</b> objects from mail order catalogs. There is no scoring system, nor are there any penalties or time limits imposed on the player, allowing him or her to freely experiment with burning any combination of objects. The game uses a drag and drop interface to position and ignite the objects. The PC versions are controlled using a mouse, while the Wii U version can be controlled with the Wii Remote pointer or with the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen, which also allows for Off TV Play.|$|E
2500|$|On August 19, {{the fire}} {{remained}} out of control, {{running along the}} ground and igniting crown fires in some areas as it moved forward. [...] As a result, residents of several subdivisions south and west of Sisters were ordered to evacuate their homes. During the day, firefighters continued to work fire lines on {{the north and east}} flanks of the blaze, trying to protect private property and the Whychus Creek watershed. [...] Crews cleared away ground fuels using heavy equipment and burn-out operations widened fire breaks. [...] They also suppressed numerous spot fires caused by flying embers carried on gusty winds. [...] In addition, air tankers made numerous retardant drops along the front line of the fire. [...] By the end of the day, firefighters had completed fire lines on the northeast and southeast corners. By August 20, the fire had grown to , but the 487 firefighters on scene had checked the fire's progress toward Sisters. [...] Cooler temperatures and higher humidity slowed the fire, allowing firefighters to close gaps in the north side fire line. [...] Crews cleared heavy fuels along the fire line using bulldozers and other heavy equipment while ground crews continue to burnout areas within the fire line to strengthen containment. During the day, four large air tankers and several helicopters were dedicated to the Milli Fire, supporting fire crews on the ground. [...] Reinforcements consisting of eight fire engines and two water tenders from the Oregon State Fire Marshal's office arrived and began clearing <b>burnable</b> materials from around evacuated homes south of Sisters. [...] During the day, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the Deschutes County Public Health Department issued an air quality warning, advising people in the Sisters area who are sensitive to smoke to stay indoor if possible.|$|E
2500|$|In {{accordance}} with Sturdee's plans, Kent, her sister ship, , {{and the light}} cruiser [...] immediately set off in pursuit while the battlecruisers and the slow armoured cruiser [...] dealt with the German armoured cruisers. At 14:45 Glasgow, the fastest of the British cruisers, {{was close enough to}} Leipzig to open fire and the two ships exchanged salvos and scoring the occasional hit.

The British shells battered Nürnburg severely; she was dead in the water by 18:25 with only two guns able to fire. Ten minutes later not a gun could shoot and the cruiser was aflame. She did not strike her colours until 18:57 and then lowered a boat filled with some of her wounded men. It promptly sank and Kent had to repair the splinter holes in her own boats before they could be launched. Nürnburg capsized half an hour later and Kent continued to search until 21:00, but only rescued a dozen men, five of whom later died. She had been hit 37 times, but none of them penetrated her armour; four crewmen were killed and twelve wounded during the battle. Kent was critically short of coal and had to steam slowly enough that she did not arrive at Port Stanley until the following afternoon.|$|E
50|$|To control {{large amounts}} of excess fuel {{reactivity}} without control rods, <b>burnable</b> poisons are loaded into the core. <b>Burnable</b> poisons are materials that have a high neutron absorption cross section that are converted into materials of relatively low absorption cross section {{as the result of}} neutron absorption. Due to the burn-up of the poison material, the negative reactivity of the <b>burnable</b> poison decreases over core life. Ideally, these poisons should decrease their negative reactivity at the same rate that the fuel's excess positive reactivity is depleted. Fixed <b>burnable</b> poisons are generally used in the form of compounds of boron or gadolinium that are shaped into separate lattice pins or plates, or introduced as additives to the fuel. Since they can usually be distributed more uniformly than control rods, these poisons are less disruptive to the core's power distribution. Fixed <b>burnable</b> poisons may also be discretely loaded in specific locations in the core in order to shape or control flux profiles to prevent excessive flux and power peaking near certain regions of the reactor. Current practice however is to use fixed non-burnable poisons in this service.|$|E

50|$|Holmium has {{the highest}} {{magnetic}} strength of any element, and therefore is used to create the strongest artificially generated magnetic fields, when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece (also called a magnetic flux concentrator). Since it can absorb nuclear fission-bred neutrons, it is also used as a <b>burnable</b> poison to regulate nuclear reactors.|$|E
50|$|Because 157Gd {{has a high}} neutron cross-section, it is used {{to target}} tumors in neutron therapy.
