5|$|On Java and Sumatra, the Dutch found {{military}} {{success in}} cities and major towns, but {{they were unable to}} subdue the villages and countryside. On the outer islands (including Bali), Republican sentiment was not as strong, at least among the elite.

5|$|After the war, it was {{estimated}} that only 5,000 of the 107,000 Jews deported from the Netherlands between 1942 and 1944 survived.

5|$|At {{first the}} Dutch were winning the action, but after {{they put in}} {{disorder}} two or three Spanish squadrons, Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron, which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack, this time with success. Despite the stubborn resistance offered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> troops, they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion, attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river. Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up, and they found {{that some of the}} Dutch soldiers, having been unable to find a good place to ford the river, had drowned. The Spanish captives were freed, and the spoils taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> recovered.|$|E
5|$|Despite denials and rumor-spreading, Germany {{nevertheless}} offered compensation in {{the amount}} of £300,000, Tubantias original cost.

2500|$|Unlike in Asia, <b>Dutch</b> successes against <b>the</b> Portuguese in Brazil and Africa were short-lived.

[...] In 1645, the Portuguese community at Pernambuco rebelled against their Dutch masters, and <b>by</b> 1654, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> had been ousted from Brazil. [...] In the intervening years, a Portuguese expedition had been sent from Brazil to recapture Luanda in Angola, <b>by</b> 1648 <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> were expelled from there also.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, another {{investigation}} was {{undertaken by the}} States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be genuine Vermeers, including the Emmaus and the Last Supper.

50|$|Cycling {{became popular}} in the Netherlands a little later {{than it did in}} the United States and Britain who {{experienced}} their bike booms in <b>the</b> 1880s, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1890s <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> were already building dedicated paths for cyclists. <b>By</b> 1911, <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> owned more bicycles per capita than any other country in Europe. After World War II, however, much like it had in other developed nations, the privately owned motor car became more affordable and therefore more ubiquitous and the bicycle started to be squeezed out. Even so, <b>the</b> number of <b>Dutch</b> people cycling was very high compared to other European nations.|$|R

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> government supported this argument.|$|E
5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and thus have King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former Netherlands Antilles again split as three areas in 2010. The monarch is represented in each region by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Curaçao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of Sint Maarten, Eugene Holiday.|$|E
