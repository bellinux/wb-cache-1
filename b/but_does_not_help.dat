Physical evidence was incompatible with geologic evidence: Himmelsbach observed that free-floating bundles would have had to wash up on the bank [...] "within a couple of years" [...] of the hijacking; otherwise the rubber bands would have long since deteriorated, an observation confirmed experimentally by the Cooper Research Team (see Ongoing investigation below). Geological evidence suggested that the bills arrived at Tina Bar well after 1974, the year of a Corps of Engineers dredging operation on that stretch of the river. Geologist Leonard Palmer of Portland State University found two distinct layers of sand and sediment between the clay deposited on the river bank by the dredge and the sand layer in which the bills were buried, indicating that the bills arrived long after dredging had been completed. The Cooper Research Team later challenged Palmer's conclusion, citing evidence that the clay layer was a natural deposit. That finding, if true, favors an arrival time of less than one year after the event (based on the rubber band experiment), <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> to explain how the bundles got to Tina Bar, nor from where they came.|$|E

50|$|The last {{perspective}} {{is a mix}} of the latter two. This perspective acknowledges Africa’s current condition, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> due to personal potential cost or the belief that aiding Africa is not their responsibility. This is the attitude most people carry. To most people the poverty and corruption in Africa is prevalent, yet the thought of personal sacrifice in order to help is often enough to turn us away. The other reason people are turned away is because with organizations such as Oxfam and the United Nations, it feels like there are already institutions created solely for the purpose of aiding others, so the responsibility is upon these institutions. Leaders such as the United States “had vowed never to return to a conflict it couldn't understand, between clans and tribes it didn't know, {{in a country where the}} US had no national interests.” Unfortunately it is this perspective that challenges perspective number two. Often people want to help but are faced with many costs if they are to help.|$|E
5000|$|Pinker {{agrees that}} {{syntactic}} categories {{are in fact}} used by children to learn semantics and accepts syntactic bootstrapping, but argues that Gleitman applies the hypothesis too broadly, and that is insufficient evidence to account for all of Gleitman's claims. Pinker argues that while children can use syntax to learn certain semantic properties within a single frame, like the number of arguments a verb takes or the types of arguments such as agent and patient, there are serious problems with the argument that children pick up on these semantic properties from the syntax when a verb is found {{in a wide range}} of syntactic frames. Pinker uses the verb [...] "sew" [...] as an example:Pinker argues that the syntax provides information about possible verb frames, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> a learner [...] "zoom in" [...] on a verb's meaning after hearing it in multiple frames.

Furthermore, Pinker disagrees with Gleitman's claim that the ambiguities in the situations where a word is used could only be solved by using information about how the word behaves syntactically.|$|E

50|$|PD is less {{efficient}} at removing wastes {{from the body}} than hemodialysis, {{and the presence of}} the tube presents a risk of peritonitis due to the potential to introduce bacteria to the abdomen. There is not sufficient evidence to be clear about the best treatment for PD-associated peritonitis, although direct infusion of antibiotics into the peritoneum appears to offer slight advantage over the intravenous route of administration; there is no clear advantage for other frequently used treatments such as routine peritoneal lavage or use of urokinase. The tube site can also become infected; the use of prophylactic nasal mupirocin can reduce the number of tube site infections, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> with peritonitis. Infections can be as frequent as once every 15 months (0.8 episodes per patient year). Compared to hemodialysis, PD allows greater patient mobility, produces fewer swings in symptoms due to its continuous nature, and phosphate compounds are better removed, but large amounts of albumin are removed which requires constant monitoring of nutritional status. The costs of PD are generally lower than that of HD {{in most parts of the}} world, this cost advantage is most apparent in developed economies. There is insufficient research to adequately compare the risks and benefits between CAPD and APD; a Cochrane Review of three small clinical trials found no difference in clinically important outcomes (i.e. morbidity or mortality) for patients with end stage renal disease, nor was there any advantage in preserving the functionality of the kidneys. The results suggested APD may have psychosocial advantages for younger patients and those who are employed or pursuing an education.|$|E

Meanwhile, Kate looks on from a distance clearly feeling the outsider in Jeremy's life.The four come together to discuss the situation.

The doctor indicates his knowledge of the family matters, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>help</b> Jeremy as he has no clue to them.The plan finally concocted becomes placing Jeremy as bait at the iron-grate covered spa, away from the loch while the wardstone is freed by Kate. Kate is warned not to provoke the monster by touching the skip, but the wardstone is trapped under it. Moving the skip enrages the Loch Snuff Monster and it leaves Jeremy to go after the girls. Nils is standing onshore in Jeremy's hat, and so the monster throws the freed skip at her knocking her out. As the monster moves in for the kill, Jeremy grabs the hat and jumps into the lake buying Kate and the rest time to re-position the wardstone.The monster is placated again, and Nils regains consciousness only for the group to realise Jeremy is lost in the lake and has not resurfaced.The doctor is ahead of the group, and manages to get Jeremy out.
