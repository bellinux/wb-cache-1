40|$|Float {{glass is}} widely used in {{architecture}} and in the automotive industry. During the float process tin diffuses into and reacts with the glass melt. The presence of tin in the glass surface region causes mismatch in thermoelastic properties between the bulk and the surface. This, in turn, can lead to wrinkling of the surface after the glass is subject to a toughening heat treatment. This project involves {{trying to understand the}} diffusion and reaction mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. A set of partial differential equations describing the important reaction-diffusion mechanisms has been proposed. This mathematical model is based on 3 redox reactions in the glass melt. 6 diffusing and reacting species have been considered, which comprise 3 redox couples, namely stannous and stannic tin, ferrous and ferric iron, and hydrogen atoms and ions. Using guessed parameters, the computer simulation shows the most striking feature of the tin depth profile - the tin hump, which is observed experimentally by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA). It can be observed from the simulations that stannous tin diffusing into the glass is oxidised to stannic tin by ferric iron. The tin hump is due to the immobile stannic tin. The shape and location of the hump can be influenced by the float <b>bath</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and the oxidising species in the glass. These features are in agreement with experimental findings. The simulation also reveals that the tin hump forming process is a dynamic process. The Sn(IV) forms and converts back to Sn(II) simultaneously as the hump moves in the glass melt. However, an inverse method has not been found to recover the parameters of the mathematical model from SIMS data. This is due to SIMS's data being only qualitative, as well as the complexity of the model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The {{color of}} hot-dip {{galvanized}} steel sheet was adjusted in a reproducible way using a liquid Zn-Ti metallic <b>bath,</b> air <b>atmosphere,</b> and controlling the bath temperature as the only experimental parameter. Coloring was found only for sample s cooled in air and dipped into Ti-containing liquid Zn. For samples dipped into a 0. 15 wt pct Ti-containing Zn bath, the color remained metallic (gray) below a 792 K (519 C) bath temperature; it was yellow at 814 K, violet at 847 K, and blue at 873 K. With the increasing bath temperature, {{the thickness of the}} adhered Zn-Ti layer gradually decreased from 52 to 32 micrometers, while the thickness of the outer TiO 2 layer gradually increased from 24 to 69 nm. Due to small Al contamination of the Zn bath, a thin (around 2 nm) alumina-rich layer is found between the outer TiO 2 layer and the inner macroscopic Zn layer. It is proven that the color change was governed by the formation of thin outer TiO 2 layer; different colors appear depending on the thickness of this layer, mostly due to the destructive interference of visible light on this transparent nano-layer. A complex model was built to explain the results using known relationships of chemical thermodynamics, adhesion, heat flow, kinetics of chemical reactions, diffusion, and optics...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} Balatta with swift questioning; {{but the voice}} of the Red One he had evoked had flung her face {{downward}} and moaning among the bones. He returned to contemplation of the prodigy. Hollow it was, and of no metal known on earth, was his conclusion. It was right-named by the ones of old-time as the Star-Born. Only from the stars could it have come, and no thing of chance was it. It was a creation of artifice and mind. Such perfection of form, such hollowness that it certainly possessed, could not be the result of mere fortuitousness. A child of intelligences, remote and unguessable, working corporally in metals, it indubitably was. He stared at it in amaze, his brain a racing wild-fire of hypotheses to account for this far-journeyer who had adventured the night of space, threaded the stars, and now rose before him and above him, exhumed by patient anthropophagi, pitted and lacquered by its fiery <b>bath</b> in two <b>atmospheres.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} dimensionally stable ceramic anode for production of magnesium metal in electrolytic cells, replacing the graphite anodes currently used by The Dow Chemical Company magnesium business. The work is based on compositional and design technology for a ceramic anode developed in the former Central Research Inorganic Laboratory. The approach selected is to use a ceramic semiconductor tube as the material to interface with the <b>bath</b> and gaseous <b>atmosphere</b> in the cell. The testing goal was to demonstrate six anodes surviving a 30 day test lifetime with acceptable wear rates and electrical performance in a laboratory scale magnesium cell test. State of the art slip casting techniques were used and advanced in the pursuit of a virtually flaw free ceramic anode shell. Novel core materials were also invented to allow for the complete, crack free fabrication of the laboratory scale anode. Two successive anodes were tested and exceeded the 30 day cell lifetime goal with excellent wear characteristics. More aggressive testing of the ceramic anode revealed that the anode had a rather narrow operating region...|$|R
40|$|We {{recall the}} {{existing}} string theory understanding of black hole entropy and argue it is incomplete but we {{put forward a}} modified version, based on the author's 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis', which, we claim, gives a more satisfactory understanding and also a resolution to the Information Loss Puzzle. This hypothesis pictures a black hole equilibrium as an, overall pure, state, with given energy, consisting {{of a black hole}} with its (mostly matter) atmosphere in a box and identifies the black hole's entropy with the pure state's matter-gravity entanglement entropy. We assume this equilibrium goes over, at weak string-coupling, to a pure state with similar energy consisting of a long string with a stringy atmosphere and that the matter-gravity entanglement entropy goes over to the entanglement entropy between (approximately) the long string and the stringy atmosphere. We also recall recent work (in a non-gravitational context) towards modern foundations for thermodynamics, where, in place of a total microcanonical ensemble, one assumes that a total system, consisting of a small (sub) system and an energy bath, is in a (random) pure state with energy in a given narrow range and shows that the small subsystem will then find itself in a thermal state. We present a new set of formulae, obtained in a companion paper, which generalize the setting of that work to cases where the system and energy bath are of comparable size. We apply these formulae to a model for our string equilibrium where the densities of states of the long string (replacing our energy <b>bath)</b> and stringy <b>atmosphere</b> (replacing our system) both grow exponentially. We find, for our picture of black hole equilibrium, a temperature of the order of the Hawking temperature and an entropy of the order of the Hawking entropy thus adding to the evidence for the viablity of our matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the dynamic {{behaviour}} of the freeze lining and slag bath, and the interactions between these components in an ilmenite-smelting furnace process. The purpose of the work was {{to gain a better}} understanding of these issues and to ultimately contribute to an improved understanding of the ilmenite-smelting process in its entirety, and to future improvements in the design, operation and control of these processes. A mathematical model of the freeze lining and furnace sidewall was developed. This model was used in isolation for focused characterisation of the dynamic behaviour and interactions of the freeze lining and slag bath. The influences of net power input and slag composition were studied and various aspects of the freeze lining and slag bath were considered. These aspects included freeze lining thickness, temperature distribution through the freeze lining and furnace sidewall, composition distribution through the freeze lining, slag bath temperature and slag bath composition. The thermal response of thermocouples installed in the furnace sidewall to changing conditions on the inside of the furnace was also investigated. A mathematical model of the crust that forms on the slag bath surface was developed. This model was not used in isolation, and was only incorporated into a complete model of the process. A mathematical model of the entire ilmenite-smelting furnace process was constructed. This model incorporated the two models mentioned above and was able to describe the metal bath, slag <b>bath,</b> furnace <b>atmosphere,</b> freeze lining, furnace sidewall and the crust that is sometimes present on top of the slag bath. The model was used to study the influence of changes in operational parameters on the slag bath and freeze lining. The operational parameters that were studied included electrical power and reductant feed rate, both relative to ilmenite feed rate. The influence of severe operational errors and furnace down time were also investigated. Operational errors included loss of all feed while maintain electrical power input, and loss of reductant feed while maintaining power input and ilmenite feed. The above-mentioned studies were conducted by executing numerous experiments with two of the mathematical models. The experimental results were processed into sets of graphs displaying variations in the aspects that were considered. Many valuable insights resulted from the interpretation of these results. One specific aspect that formed part of the scope of this work was the origin of the compositional invariance of the slag close to the stoichiometric M 3 O 5 composition. This invariance was studied and a mechanism was proposed that explains the observed behaviour. The proposed mechanism created some questions about other mechanisms in the process. These mechanisms were also considered and elaborated on. The models and results produced in this study provide valuable insights into the behaviour of the ilmenite-smelting process. It also represents a useful foundation for future modelling work, and finally, it presents numerous opportunities for organisations operating ilmenite-smelting furnaces to improve their understanding and even the performance of their processes.
