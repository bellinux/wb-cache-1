40|$|Native plants {{attractive}} to <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> may improve {{the value of}} buffer strips by increasing biodiversity and enhancing the delivery of insect-derived ecosystem services. In a 2 -yr field experiment, we measured the response of insect communities across nine buffers that varied in plant diversity. We constructed buffers with plants commonly found in buffers of USDA-certified organic farms in Iowa (typically a single species), recommended for prairie reconstruction, or recommended for attracting <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects.</b> We hypothesized that the diversity and abundance of <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> will be 1) greatest in buffers composed of diverse plant communities with continuous availability of floral resources, 2) intermediate in buffers with reduced species richness and availability of floral resources, and 3) lowest in buffers composed of a single species. We observed a significant positive relationship between the diversity and abundance of <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> with plant community diversity {{and the number of}} flowers. More <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> were collected in buffers composed of species selected for their attractiveness to <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> than a community recommended for prairie restoration. These differences suggest 1) plant communities that dominate existing buffers are not optimal for attracting <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects,</b> 2) adding flowering perennial species could improve buffers as habitat for <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects,</b> 3) buffers can be optimized by intentionally combining the most attractive native species even at modest levels of plant diversity, and 4) plant communities recommended for prairie reconstruction may not contain the optimal species or density of the most attractive species necessary to support <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> from multiple guilds...|$|R
40|$|The {{annual value}} of crop {{pollination}} and biological control of plant pests provided by <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> {{is estimated to}} be worth at least 22 billion to United States crop production. <b>Beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> that supply these services to agricultural lands are threatened by limited or suboptimal resources due to the loss of biodiversity in agroecosystems, which is a growing concern in agricultural states like Iowa. Conservation practices are recommended to address a multitude of conservation concerns related to Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s declining natural resources; however, guidelines for best practices that conserve <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> are not well defined. Due to the valuable relationship of <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> and successful crop production, {{there is a need for}} developing best practices that conserve <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> within Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural landscape. The first objective was to design mixtures of native perennial plants that range in diversity and resource availability and evaluate these different plant communities as candidates for buffer strips that attract and conserve <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects.</b> The second objective was to evaluate the insect community in non-crop buffer strips already established on organic farms and in the adjacent organic crops and conventional row crops. This research seeks to identify mixtures of native perennial plants optimized with resources attractive to pollinators and natural enemies and to determine if these mixtures can enhance Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s buffer strips to conserve <b>beneficial</b> <b>insects</b> and protect their services.

40|$|There are {{hundreds}} of thousands of species of insects (there are more known species of beetles than there are known species of flowering plants!) and insects play many roles in the world’s diverse ecosystems. In agriculture, there are small number of species that can cause damage and are therefore unwanted (called pest insects) and a much larger number of species that are valuable and therefore wanted (called beneficial insects). In a given crop, a pest species might have the potential to cause catastrophic losses, while a <b>beneficial</b> <b>insect</b> species may be able to feed on the pest species and keep its population so low that it causes no discernable damage. Another beneficial species may be essential to the crop’s pollination and thus its productivity. The goal of this activity is to introduce the idea that in many cases pests can be managed effectively by employing ecological processes that occur commonly in nature and on the farm. However, farmers need to monitor their crops for pest and <b>beneficial</b> <b>insect</b> activity to make efficient use of these processes.

Milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) are currently the focus of restoration programs in the USA aimed at reversing a decline in populations of the milkweed-dependent monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus); however, little is known {{of the benefits of}} these plants to other beneficial insects. Beneficial insects (predators, parasitoids, pollinators) attracted to two milkweed species (Asclepias speciosa, Asclepias fascicularis) in central Washington State, WA, USA were identified and counted on transparent sticky traps attached to blooms over five seasons. Combining all categories of beneficial insects, means of 128 and 126 insects per trap were recorded for A. speciosa and A. fascicularis, respectively. Predatory and parasitic flies dominated trap catches for A. speciosa while parasitic wasps were the most commonly trapped beneficial insects on A. fascicularis. Bees were trapped commonly on both species, especially A. speciosa with native bees trapped in significantly greater numbers than honey bees. <b>Beneficial</b> <b>insect</b> attraction to A. speciosa and A. fascicularis was substantial.

Insect community structures in agroecosystem may always change. Agroecosystem management techniques affect insect community structure. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the diversity and composition of insects on soybean plants under different pest management systems and varieties. The experiment design was split plot with varieties (Anjasmoro and Wilis) as the main plots and pest management systems (Integrated Pest Management (IPM), Non-Chemical Management (P-NK), Chemical Management (P-K), and Control) as the sub plots. There were ten insect sampling sessions for each plot. Samplings were done in June until September 2013 using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep net, and yellow pan traps. Statistically the results of experiment showed that varieties and pest management had no significant differences to the insects diversity. Herbivore and <b>beneficial</b> <b>insect</b> in soybean crop had differences composition between varieties Anjasmoro and Wilis. In both soybean Anjasmoro and Wilis varieties, herbivore populations tend to be higher in the control plots compared to the IPM plots.
