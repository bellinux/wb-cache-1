In seventeenth and eighteenth century almost every church has its dome that stands out on the surrounding urban texture and marks it. For instance, in Naples the domes of the Spirito Santo, Santa Maria della Sanità, Annunziata, etc and also smaller domes that have a particular value by having place in landscapes that have stayed upright {{in more than two}} centuries. Moreover, domes in Campania mark many sites of great landscape value such as Sorrento and Amalfi coast, where in particular majolica surfaces assume important figurative values bound to the strict relation between architecture and nature. We developed topics about <b>building</b> <b>technics</b> of domes and especially about majolica (riggiole) facings derived from the Spanish Arabic tradition...|$|E

40|$|The paper proposes the {{integration}} of structural monitoring with Building Management Systems for electricity and gas distributions. To assess the state of damage of existing <b>buildings</b> the <b>technics</b> of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is adopted. SHM {{as well as to}} record the occurrence of sudden structural damage resulting from exceptional events (earthquakes, explosions, shocks and collisions with vehicles, etc.), allows the monitoring of the progressive damage and structural performance under operating conditions through the extraction of the modal parameters of the structure. This approach requires time to process acquired data that, {{depending on the size of}} the building and the number of monitored points, varies from minutes to hours. In this paper, an intelligent system is proposed to immediately communicate during an earthquake the overrun of a certain ground shaking threshold so that gas delivery and selected power loads are interrupted, as suggested by current national regulations on structures. The use of low-cost and reduced size accelerometric sensors integrated with Energy Monitoring Systems is proposed in both highrisk earthquake centers and in all “strategic” buildings that must ensure their operation use immediately after the earthquake. The procedure for calibrating the horizontal and vertical acceleration threshold is also sketched...|$|R

To identify {{the existence of this}} problem a questionnaire was gone among the library managers of 22 state and private universities in Istanbul. According to the result of the questionnaire it is noticed that during the use stage of those library buildings some problems occur due to the design and construction stages of the buildings, {{and it is difficult to}} solve those problems in later stages. It is also realized that those problems affect the use efficiency of those library <b>buildings.</b> Search <b>technic,</b> questionnaire and observation are the examination methods which are used in the research. First, the steps of design and construction stages of a building and are examined in terms of building biology, then these steps are applied for library buildings. It is shown that the requirements of librarians should be well defined by architects. The negative conditions caused by the building, their effects on users health and remedies are identified according to the steps of a building biology model which is previously developed and proposed. The adopted examination model is applicable on any kind of library buildings. If the design and construction of a library building is conducted according to the steps of this model, the requirements of the library users will be met, and health problems caused by the building during the use period will be reduced. The permanent and temporary users of a library building will be using the building when their requirements are met. Therefore the use efficiency of the library will be increased...|$|R

New approaches need to be, {{on the one hand}} more effective in terms of conservation of exhaustible resources of our planet, have minimal impact on the environment {{and on the other hand}} to ensure a higher quality of the final product. Construction is not exception. One of the new promising technology is the technology of 3 D -printing of individual structures and buildings in general. 3 Dprinting - is the process of real object recreating on the model of 3 D. Unlike conventional printer which prints information on a sheet of paper, 3 D-printer allows you to display three-dimensional information, i. e. creates certain physical objects. Currently, 3 D-printer finds its application in many areas of production: machine building elements, a variety of layouts, interior elements, various items. But due to the fact that this technology is fairly new, it requires the creation of detailed and accurate technologies, efficient equipment and materials, and development of common vocabulary and regulatory framework in this field. Research Aim. The analysis of existing methods of creating physical objects using 3 D-printing and the improvement of technology and equipment for the printing of buildings and structures. Conclusion. 3 D-printers building is a new generation of equipment for the construction of buildings, structures, and structural elements. A variety of <b>building</b> printing <b>technics</b> opens up wide range of opportunities in the construction industry. At this stage, printers design allows to create low-rise buildings of different configurations with different mortars.

Developed in this work equipment and materials allows in the nearest future to move from theory to practice and implement such effective method of construction as the technology 3 D-printing...|$|R
40|$|A história das mulheres mostra que a identidade feminina foi construída em torno dos papéis sociais de mãe, de esposa e de dona de casa, sendo elas as principais responsáveis pela manutenção da casa, pela sobrevivência e pelo bem estar dos membros da família. Dessa forma, o trabalho doméstico é comumente percebido como atividade inerente a esses papéis femininos e socialmente naturalizado como uma “obrigação” da mulher, fato que contribui para a sua desvalorização e invisibilidade econômica e social. No Brasil, na década de 70, com a queda dos rendimentos reais dos trabalhadores juntamente com a urbanização acelerada e a industrialização houve a inserção da mulher no mercado de trabalho, tanto de mulheres pobres quanto de mulheres de classe média/ alta e instruídas. Essa inserção feminina impulsionou os movimentos migratórios de mulheres pobres que viviam no campo e que vislumbraram na mudança para cidade a oportunidade de emprego e de emancipação social. Diante dessa realidade, objetivou-se estudar o processo de construção das identidades das mulheres migrantes, bem como a existência de relação entre a representação sobre o que é ser “mulher” e a relação destas com o trabalho doméstico. Este estudo de cunho qualitativo foi realizado na cidade de Viçosa-MG, especificamente, com três mulheres migrantes e residentes do bairro Santo Antônio. Para a sua consecução, utilizou-se a observação direta da realidade cotidiana, a história de vida e as entrevistas abertas como técnicas para a construção dos dados. Estas técnicas evidenciaram que as vivências cotidianas dessas mulheres encontram-se estabelecidas em torno do trabalho doméstico para suas famílias e do trabalho fora de casa. Apesar da sua aparente rotina, o cotidiano revelou seu caráter dinâmico e relacional no qual os indivíduos se constroem como sujeitos sociais, realizam suas atividades e suas interações sociais. Sendo assim, a construção social do “ser mulher” está associada à imagem da “boa mãe”, da “esposa cuidadosa” e da “dona de casa dedicada”. Para essas mulheres o trabalho doméstico ainda é percebido como parte constituinte do “ser mulher”, ou seja, parte da identidade feminina. A realização do trabalho doméstico confere às mulheres poderes dentro do ambiente familiar, contradizendo a hegemonia do poder masculino. Além disso, elas contrariaram, ao longo de suas vidas, o paradigma de mulher “submissa e restrita ao lar”, uma vez que as suas forças de trabalho foram imprescindíveis para a sobrevivência da família. Contudo, apesar de não se “enquadrarem” na imagem de fragilidade feminina, constatou-se que a reposição das suas identidades femininas ocorre por meio da pertença aos grupos sociais (Família e Religião) e pela ação dessas instituições sociais e das ideologias que as “aprisionam” aos papéis socialmente naturalizado femininos. As suas percepções sobre o trabalho doméstico encontram-se fortemente relacionadas ao tempo e ao espaço vivido, onde as temporalidades e as espacialidades do cotidiano alteraram o “saber-fazer” feminino. No entanto, essas percepções não foram capazes de liberá-las de seus “trabalhos de mulher”. Conclui-se que a mudança sócio espacial campo/cidade e da transição da condição social de meeiras para de assalariadas urbanas não foram capazes de romper a relação que elas construíram ao longo das suas vidas com o trabalho doméstico. Para elas, “ser mulher”, ainda hoje, representa ser “boa esposa”, “mãe/avó cuidadosa”, “cuidadora”, “dona de casa” e também “trabalhadora remunerada”. The women’s {{history shows}} that the female {{identity}} was built around the social roles of mother, of wife and of housewife, being these the main responsible for the home maintenance, by the survival and welfare of the family members. Thereby, the housework is commonly perceived as an inherent activity to these female roles and socially naturalized as a “women’s obligation”, fact that contributes to your devaluation and social and economical invisibility. In Brazil, during the 70 ’s, with the falling real incomes of workers, along with the rapid urbanization and the industrialization, there was the women entering the labor both poor women and middle-class women / high and educated. This woman’s insertion boosted the migration of poor women {{who lived in the}} countryside and who glimpsed in moving to the city the opportunity of employment and social emancipation. Given this reality, aimed to study the process of construction of identities of migrant women, as well as the existence of relationship between the representation of what is to be "woman" and the relationship of these with the housework. This qualitative approach study was conducted in the city of Viçosa-MG, specifically, with three migrate women living in the Santo Antonio district. For its achievement we used direct observation of everyday reality, the story of life and open interviews as techniques for <b>building</b> data. These <b>technics</b> showed that the daily experiences of these women are set out around the household work for their families and work outside home. Despite their apparent routine, everyday unveiled its dynamic and relational character in which individuals are constructed as social subjects, carry out their activities and their social interactions. Then the social construction of "being a woman" is associated to the image of the "good mother", the "caring wife" and "mistress of dedicated home". For these women the housework is still perceived as a constituent part of "being a woman", ie part of female identity. The realization of housework gives women power within family environment, contradicting the hegemony of male’s power. Moreover, they countered, throughout their lives, the woman paradigm "submissive and restricted to home," since their workforces were essential to family survival. However, despite not "fit" in the female fragility image, {{it was found that the}} replacement of their female identities occurs by belonging to social groups (Family and Religion) and the action of these social institutions and ideologies that "imprison" the social roles naturalized female. Their perceptions of domestic work, it was noticed that are strongly related to the time and lived space, where the temporality and everyday spatiality altered the "know-how" feminine. However, these perceptions were not able to release them their "women's work". It is concluded that changing social space rural / urban and social transition condition meeiras for urban salaried were not able to break the relationship they have built throughout their lives with the housework. For them, "being a woman" yet today, it is to be "good wife", "mother / grandmother careful", "caring", "housewife" and also "paid worker"...|$|R
