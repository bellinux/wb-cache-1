50|$|Although {{the most}} common fur color is black and white, some skunks are brown or grey and a few are cream-colored. All skunks are striped, even from birth.

50|$|Morrison bred {{and raced}} Rachel Alexandra's dam, Lotta Kim (foaled 2001, Kentucky), a {{moderately}} successful racehorse whose biggest win {{came in the}} Tiffany Lass Stakes at Fair Grounds Race Course. Soon after that race, she was injured in a training accident and retired. Rachel Alexandra was Lotta Kim's first and only surviving foal until 2011; Lotta Kim's 2007 colt by Empire Maker succumbed to a neurological disorder known as Wobbler disease, while her 2008 foal was born prematurely and died. Morrison did not breed Lotta Kim in 2009, but returned her to Medaglia d'Oro in 2010, having declined numerous offers to sell the mare {{in the wake of}} Rachel Alexandra's success. Lotta Kim produced a bay filly by Medaglia d'Oro on February 27, 2011 at Heaven Trees Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. The foal, named Samantha Nicole, sported a star and <b>broken</b> <b>stripe</b> very similar to that of her full sister, Rachel Alexandra. As a yearling, Samantha Nicole was purchased at the 2012 Keeneland November breeding stock sale for $700,000 by Stonestreet Stable, which had also purchased Rachel Alexandra after her win in the 2009 Kentucky Oaks. Lotta Kim produced a chestnut colt named Dolphus in 2013, sired by 2010 Preakness Stakes winner Lookin At Lucky.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} Dirac fermions in partially filled N= 3 Landau level (LL) in graphene. At half-filling, the equal-time density-density correlation function displays sharp peaks at nonzero wave vectors ??q*. Finite-size scaling shows that the peak value grows with electron number and diverges in the thermodynamic limit, which suggests an instability toward a charge density wave. A symmetry <b>broken</b> <b>stripe</b> phase is formed at large system size limit, which is robust against perturbation from disorder scattering. Such a quantum phase is experimentally observable through transport measurements.

5000|$|Morelia viridis is oviparous, laying 1-25 viable eggs per clutch. Breeding {{has never}} been {{reported}} from the wild, however in captivity eggs are incubated and protected by the female. Hatchlings are lemon-yellow with <b>broken</b> <b>stripes</b> and spots of purple and brown, or golden or orange-red. For yellow individuals at Iron Range National Park, Australia, the color change occurred over 5-10 days when individuals were 58 - 60 cm long, which corresponds to about a year old.

5000|$|P. cepediana {{belongs to}} the middle-sized day geckos. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about 15 cm. There always is a dorso-lateral stripe present, which may be <b>broken.</b> A red <b>stripe</b> extends from the nostril to the shoulder. The male body colour is light green or bluish green. The backs of males have a bright blue colour and are covered with dark red spots and dashes. The males have deep blue tails. Females lack the {{brilliant}} blue colour of the males. They have a bright green back and rust-coloured spots.|$|R
50|$|F. pulvereus {{displays}} sexual dimorphism, {{which is}} a physical difference {{between males and females}} of the same species of animal. Sexual Dimorphism usually occurs in many species for various biological reasons pertaining to the species. Many animals use sexual dimorphism as a means of self-defense, or simply to attract mates or food sources. In Bayou Killifish, males usually tend to have a much more elongated body than females, as well as more characteristic markings. Males display an olive-green coloration on {{the top half of the}} body near the dorsal fin, with gold sides and a silvery bottom. Sometimes, the males will have a dark spot on or near the rear dorsal fin, just above dark vertical stripes that line the gold sides. Female bayou killifish, however, are usually somewhat smaller than the males, and display dark spots all over their body—a characteristic unique to the females. Accompanying these spots are faint, often <b>broken</b> vertical <b>stripes</b> along the dorsum of the fish.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{estimate}} {{suggests that}} the Scottish wildcat may be critically endangered. Nevertheless, {{there is still no}} uncontroversial method for diagnosing the Scottish wildcat. We analysed morphological differences between wild-living cats in Scotland on the basis of 20 pelage characters, scoring from 1 (domestic cat) to 3 (wildcat), in combination with 40 skull parameters and intestinal length. A cluster analysis, bases on Principal Components derived from the score for pelage characters, showed that the wild-living cats fell into three main groups without any a priori classification. Each group corresponds well to the traditional characteristics of wildcats, hybrids and domestic cats, respectively, and the former two each show higher levels of morphological homogeneity compared with the third group. The three groups are most significantly differentiated by seven pelage characters: (1) extent of dorsal stripe, (2) shape of tail tip, (3) distinctness of tail bands, (4) presence/absence of <b>broken</b> <b>stripes</b> and (5) spots, on flanks and hindquarters, (6) shape and number of stripes on nape and (7) on the shoulders. Most Group- 1 cats (75. 6 %, n = 74), but none of the other two groups, score more than 2 for all seven characters. All Group- 3 cats (n = 35) and some Group- 2 cats (19. 2 %, n = 26), but no Group- 1 cats, scored 1 for {{one or more of the}} seven characters. We propose that Group- 1, which is the furthest from the domestic cat in all criteria, should be used to define the Scottish wildcat. However, in practice, if a wild-living cat does not score 1 for any of the seven characters it should be treated as a wildcat in the field. These definitions provide a simple way of diagnosing a Scottish wildcat scientifically, as well as practically, which will effectively facilitate conservation action and the enforcement of protective legislation.
