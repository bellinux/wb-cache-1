50|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tinamou</b> (Crypturellus strigulosus) {{is a type}} of tinamou {{found in}} lowland moist forest in {{subtropical}} and tropical regions of Amazonian South America.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tinamou</b> {{lives in}} {{tropical}} or sub-tropical lowland moist forest up to 500 m. This species {{is native to}} northwestern Bolivia, southern Amazonian Brazil and eastern Peru.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tinamou</b> is {{approximately}} 28 cm in length. It has reddish-brown upper parts, rufous throat, grey breast, whitish belly, and brown legs. The female {{has a distinct}} black barring and is ochraceous on its upper parts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tinamou</b> is a {{monotypic}} species. All tinamou {{are from}} the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.|$|E
50|$|Like other tinamous, the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tinamou</b> eats fruit off {{the ground}} or low-lying bushes. They also eat small amounts of invertebrates, flower buds, tender leaves, seeds, and roots. The male incubates the eggs which may come from as many as 4 {{different}} females, and then will raise them until {{they are ready to}} be on their own, usually 2-3 weeks. The nest is located on the ground in dense brush or between raised root buttresses.|$|E
50|$|Once {{copulation}} {{has taken}} place, the female will choose a nest site that is typically a depression covered with leaves {{next to a}} tree trunk, usually between a couple of buttresses. Members of the genus that are savanna style birds such as the small-billed tinamou will instead lay their eggs in a cavity near a clump of grass. The eggs are oval or elliptical on the smaller birds and near spherical in the larger birds, such as the undulated tinamou and the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>tinamou.</b> The colorings of the eggs are varied, but in general are brightly colored with no splotches or spots; the colors fade over time and usually will change to a less overt color midway through the incubation period. The predominate colors are chocolate or red wine with the eggs of yellow-legged tinamou, undulated tinamou, little tinamou, and red-legged tinamou using different color schemes.|$|E
