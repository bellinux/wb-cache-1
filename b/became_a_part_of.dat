5|$|After Indian Independence in 1947, all the non-princely {{states were}} subject to a test of {{religious}} majority in which the Muslim majority areas formed the Dominion of Pakistan, while the other regions formed the Dominion of India. Murshidabad (the capital city for both, the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nawabs of Murshidabad) <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. However, it <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> India on 17 August 1947. The Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace. The Nawabs, after the takeover by the British had no actual power and after merging with India too, they had yielded power, as the Government of India took over control of all the areas that merged with India. Furthermore, with the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, the Dominion of India was transformed into the Republic of India, and the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution (which {{is a part of}} the Right to Equality, a fundamental right in India), titles were abolished. The Article prevents the state from confirming any title except those titles given by the Government to those who have made their mark in military and academic fields. Such titles and awards include the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan (the Supreme Court of India, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards). Thus, with the promulgation of the Constitution, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad was abolished. And although, the Nawab Waris Ali Meerza held titles such as Raes ud-Daulah, they were not officially or legally recognised.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{leaves of}} the codex were {{scattered}} in several places of the monastery, from where they were collected on several occasions by people from France, Russia, and Italy. The first was Pierre Séguier (1588–1672), who bought 14 leaves which, known later as Fragmenta Coisliniana, and <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Fonds Coislin. They were held in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In 1715 Bernard de Montfaucon published text of these 14 leaves. He made a few mistakes corrected by Tischendorf (in 1865). Tischendorf observed in Paris additional passage. Montfaucon used the manuscript for his palaeographical studies.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies that <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. From {{the time of}} Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E

5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue <b>became</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire {{towards the end of}} its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was then working on a large {{consumer}} budget survey.

Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, {{a major component of}} the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
