40|$|The {{effects of}} {{compressor}} aerodynamic parameters, such as pitch-chord ratio, aspect ratio, and fillet, on the cascade performance {{have been studied}} in this paper. Slot configuration {{at the root of}} the blade has been proved to be an efficient passive control method for the corner separation control in compressor cascade. The combined effects of the pitch-chord ratio, aspect ratio, and <b>blade</b> <b>fillet</b> with a slot configuration on the blade, have also been studied. Larger corner separation caused by the high pitch-chord ratio can be eliminated by the slot, which leads to fewer blades with almost the same or even better cascade performance. Various aspect ratios, together with the slot configuration, have been investigated and all of them have a positive effect on the cascade performance. For the blade with the <b>blade</b> <b>fillet,</b> the slot still has a positive effect on the control of the corner separation, while cascade performance with just a slot configuration is better than the slot configuration under the influence of the <b>blade</b> <b>fillet...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{is based}} on the {{analysis}} of a fan blade attachment whereby a complete 3 D model is presented by a partner company. The acceptability of a new design regarding the mechanical loads consisting of dividing the hub into two parts instead of using a solid hub is studied. From the model some critical parameters for the attachment of the blade with respect to the stresses are chosen such as the rotational speed, fillet size of the blade and the neck size of the blade. Parametric studies of these parameters are carried out in order to suggest the new design. Bearing in mind that a safety factor of 2 is the prerequisite, based on the analysis performed on ANSYS Workbench, it is suggested from the preliminary design that the axial fan can operate in two specific scenarios consisting of a rotational speed of 1771 rpm and a rotational speed of 1594 rpm. Using this set of parameters, a suggestion is drawn up on the <b>blade</b> <b>fillet</b> which will give lower stress. <b>Blade</b> <b>fillet</b> size of 30 to 35 mm is recommended while a size of 45 mm is recommended on the neck of the blade. A modal analysis is performed in order to find at what frequency will the model be vibrating and a lowest and critical frequency of 16. 8 Hz is obtained. Finally, a fatigue analysis of some interesting areas is performed {{in order to determine the}} numbers of cycles before fatigue failure occur. It is recommended to use the rotational speed since these speeds have offered a High Cycle Fatigue results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the study of}} endwall flow modification due {{to the presence of}} fillet radius in axial compressor blades. A fillet is commonly used at the intersection between the blade and the endwall in axial turbomachinery blade-rows to improve the mechanical integrity by reducing the local stresses. Since the endwall region is affected by secondary flow, separation and vortices the presence of the fillet can potentially modify the flow mechanism that results, especially, in the endwall blade corner region. In this paper an experimental study into the effects of the fillet, namely, the modification of the secondary flows and the generation of the losses under a low Reynolds number condition is discussed. It has been shown that, for the range of cases tested, employment of a uniform <b>blade</b> <b>fillet</b> reduces the overturning secondary flow. The measurements reported in the paper show no detrimental effects due to the presence of the fillet but on the contrary finds that the endwall and mass averaged losses are marginally lower compared to when no fillets are employed...|$|E
40|$|In {{most cases}} of {{aerodynamic}} design of centrifugal compressors, {{the effects of}} impeller <b>blade</b> <b>fillets</b> on performance are not considered in the process, but could be estimated later from some limited studies. As one of numerical investigations for the effects in centrifugal compressors, the Krain backswept impeller was modeled with and without <b>blade</b> <b>fillets</b> on the hub. A vaneless diffuser and impeller tip clearances {{were included in the}} steady state analysis using a commercial CFD code. Over the range of flows at design speed, the case with <b>blade</b> <b>fillets</b> showed a slight drop in the pressure ratio, the efficiency, the choke flow and the range of operation, relative to the case of clean blades. A more detailed look into three-dimensional flow structure inside the impeller shows that a small scraping vortex, developed in the case of clean blades {{at the corner of the}} hub pressure surface, disappears in the case with <b>blade</b> <b>fillets</b> due to a local flow acceleration produced by the fillet. As a result of balancing forces acting in the impeller passage, it was observed that the shroud passage vortex in the case with <b>blade</b> <b>fillets</b> grows toward the impeller exit with a higher vortex core than that in the case of clean blades, which means that there are more wake flows with <b>blade</b> <b>fillets,</b> leading to aerodynamic performance drops...|$|R

40|$|Important {{problems}} involving three-dimensional {{boundary layer}} occur {{in almost all}} internal and external aerodynamic configurations. For many of these, the flow outside the boundary layer may be resolved into a large principal component and a small crosswise velocity. In this paper, three-dimensional laminar boundary-layer flows over flat and curved surfaces are treated under such a simplification. For flat surfaces, the solutions demonstrate {{the effect of the}} free stream turning on the velocity profiles in the crosswise and primary flow directions. When the surface curvature is large and varies so as to resemble a corner, the computed examples show {{the manner in which the}} asymmetric behavior of the boundary layer results from the cross-flow. The detailed examples are chosen to illustrate flows occurring on the casing and in the <b>blade</b> <b>fillets</b> of turbomachinery...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work {{procedural}} fundamentals are {{developed for the}} laser remelting of single crystal turbine blades made from the nickel-base superalloy PWA 1483. Such a process aims to remove cracks in the surface layer by maintaining the single crystal structure. Single crystal repair using laser remelting requires controlled solidification conditions {{in order to prevent}} nucleation and growth of spurious grains ahead of the columnar dendritic front, i. e. to ensure epitaxial growth and to prevent the columnar to equiaxed transition. The development of the procedural fundamentals is subdivided into three steps. A laser remelting process is first developed on flat sample geometries. A process window is determined by varying all relevant process parameters. By maintaining the single crystal structure, a remelted depth up to 1. 2 mm is reached in the surface layer. The development of an overlapping strategy is used to remelt whole areas and to achieve a homogeneous remelted depth. In addition investigations are carried out to measure the emitted temperature radiation on the surface in the melt pool. In comparison to the experimental process development, heat conduction calculations based on the finite element method are carried out to determine the solidification conditions (temperature gradient, solidification velocity) and the temperature field within the melt pool. The experimental and calculated results are compared with results from previous literature. The first step is completed by remelting artificial cracks and maintaining the single crystal structure. In the second step, the developed process is transferred to complex samples with changing material thickness and curved surfaces. The measurement of the emitted temperature radiation of the surface of the melt pool is used to implement a temperature control. By using this control a nearly constant remelted depth of zm = 1 mm  0. 1 mm is achieved along the remelted track. This means that the deviation in remelted depth is decreased in comparison to laser remelting with a constant laser power. In the third step, the process is successfully applied to remelt different areas on turbine blades (platform, <b>blade,</b> <b>fillet)</b> without cracking...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{failure of}} the first stage blade in a steam turbine of 55 MW was investigated. The blade was made of 17 - 4 PH {{stainless}} steel and {{has been used for}} 12 years before failure. The current work aims to find out the main cause of the first stage blade failure. The methods for investigation were metallurgical analysis, chemical composition test, and hardness measurement. The result showed that there was no evidence the blade failure was due to material. The damage found on the blade namely crack on the blade root. Two locations of the crack observed at the blade root, which was at the tang and the fillet, with different failure modes. In general, the damage of the blade was started by the corrosion occurred on the blade root. The crack at the blade root tang was due to corrosion fatigue and the crack occurred at the <b>blade</b> root <b>fillet</b> owing to stress corrosion cracking...|$|R
40|$|Parametic {{investigations}} are performed using several two dimensional finite element formulations {{to determine their}} suitability for use in predicting extremum stresses in marine propellers. Comparisons are made of two NASTRAN elements (CTRIM 6 and CTRAIA 2) wherein elasticity properties have been modified to yield plane strain results. The accuracy of the elements is investigated by comparing finite element stress predictions with experimentally determined stresses in two classical cases: (1) tension in a flat plate with a circular hole; and (2) a filleted flat bar subjected to in-plane bending. The CTRIA 2 element is found to provide good results. The displacement field from a three dimensional finite element model of a representative marine propeller is used as the boundary condition for the two dimensional plane strain investigations of stresses in the propeller <b>blade</b> and <b>fillet.</b> Stress predictions from the three dimensional analysis are compared with those from the two dimensional models. The validity of the plane strain modifications to the NASTRAN element is checked by comparing the modified CTRIA 2 element stress predictions {{with those of the}} ABAQUS plane strain element, CPE 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} effects of fillet size {{in a low}} speed compressor cascade were experimentally studied. Two blade profiles were used during the experiment, namely a controlled diffusion blade and a double circular arc blade. Cascades were tested with three fillet radii and two boundary layer thicknesses over a large range of incidence angles. The cascade performance was determined by extensive downstream flow measurements using a two head, 5 hole pressure probe. Results differ significantly between {{the two types of}} <b>blades</b> tested. As <b>fillet</b> radius increases secondary flows and total pressure losses were found to increase for the controlled diffusion blades; whereas, for the double circular arc blades the losses decrease, particularly at high incidence angles...|$|R
40|$|It is a known {{fact that}} {{machined}} impellers result in improved compressor performance compared to cast impellers {{of the same}} design. The performance improvements {{can be attributed to}} better surface finish, more accurate geometric definition (tighter dimensional tolerances), well-defined edges, and the lack of <b>blade</b> tip <b>fillet</b> on shrouded impellers. In addition, it has been observed through experimental investigations that the construction method of the impellers has an impact on performance. This paper presents computational fluid dynamic investigations of two types of impellers, with blade surfaces generated using straight-line elements (SLEs) and CAD arbitrary definitions. Because there are many different mathematical definitions that CAD tools employ for curves, the resulting arbitrary blade surface is not unique. The numerical results will help understand the causes of the performance differences as well as the effects of SLE blades on the flow through the impeller. Input conditions for computational dynamic simulations are based on experimental results. All references to experimental data in the present paper are for cast impellers. Therefore, the differences in performance are attributed to blade definition (SLE versus other) and not to differences resulting from manufacturing methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of roughness elements with an impingement cooling systems offers an attractive means of achieving high heat transfer. Considerable {{care must be}} taken to choose the shape, size and the position of the roughness elements to maximise heat transfer and minimise pressure loss. In the last decade, many studies have been investigated the effect of changes in many of the geometric features, but little {{attention has been paid to}} the effect of the inevitable <b>fillet.</b> <b>Blades</b> and vanes are normally manufactured by casting so the fillet radius is unavoidable. The present paper investigates the effect of roughness element fillet radii on heat transfer enhancement in an impingement cooling system. Three configurations with streamwise ribs were studied. The streamwise ribs are all trapezoidal in cross section. In the three configurations the fillet radii are (1) 0 mm (sharp-edged), (2) 3 mm, and (3) 5 mm. The extra heat transfer area of the sharp-edged, 3 mm fillet and the 5 mm fillet rib configurations are reported. Two-staggered arrays (a uniform and non-uniform hole diameter array) of impingement plates are used. The jets from odd numbered rows impinge between the ribs while the jets from even numbered rows impinge onto the ribs. Tests were conducted at three different mass flow rates for each configuration. The average and local jet Reynolds numbers varied between 21500 and 31500, and 17000 and 41000 respectively. The transient liquid crystal technique was used to produce detailed Nusselt number distributions and row resolved average Nusselt number levels. The heat transfer enhancement and pressure loss due to the streamwise ribs are also compared to the smooth surface impingement cooling channel. The research showed that the streamwise ribs with fillet radii produced lower Nusselt number levels than both sharp-edged ribs and impingement onto a smooth surface. Copyright © 2005 by ASME...|$|R
