5|$|Each new victory {{gave the}} Mongols {{the chance to}} {{incorporate}} new peoples, especially foreign engineers and labourers, into their society. Each new conquest also acquired new trade routes {{and the opportunity to}} control taxation and tribute.

5|$|The Alsos Mission was an {{organized}} effort {{by a team}} of United States military, scientific, and intelligence personnel to discover enemy scientific developments during World War II.

5|$|Another {{factor in}} making the Zephyr lighter than {{conventional}} trains was that the individual carbodies in the train share their trucks with adjacent cars. In this design by Budd engineer Walter B. Dean, the train was three articulated compartments. On conventional passenger cars, each carbody rode upon a pair of trucks (pivot-mounted wheel-axle assembly), with one truck at each end. The articulation not only {{reduced the number of}} trucks under the train, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> dispensed with the need for couplers between each of the carbodies, further reducing the train's weight. It did, however, mean that train lengths could not be easily changed by switching out cars.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated a surge of membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Curium-244 decays into 240Pu by {{emission}} of alpha particle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> absorbs neutrons {{resulting in a}} small amount of heavier curium isotopes. Among those, 247Cm and 248Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of 247Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons. Synthesis of 250Cm via neutron absorption is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product 249Cm (64 min), which converts by β− decay to the berkelium isotope 249Bk.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Slump {{is mainly}} a comedy series, filled with puns, toilet humor and sexual innuendos. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> {{contained}} many science fiction elements; aliens, anthropomorphic characters, time travel, and parodies of {{works such as}} Godzilla, Star Wars and Star Trek. Toriyama also included many real-life people in the series, such as his assistants, wife and colleagues (such as Masakazu Katsura), but most notably his editor Kazuhiko Torishima as the series' main antagonist, Dr. Mashirito.|$|E

In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> {{has been shown to}} be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|Former Financial Times {{journalist}} Duff McDonald, said McKinsey's confidentiality policy often {{prevents the}} public from becoming informed about the firm's work, except after it is exposed through lawsuits or investigations. 13,000 McKinsey documents were released {{as part of a}} lawsuit against Allstate, which showed that McKinsey recommended the company reduce payouts to insurance claimants by offering low settlements, delaying processing to wear out claimants through attrition, and fighting customers that protest in court. Allstate's profits doubled over ten years after adopting McKinsey's strategy, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> led to lawsuits alleging they were cheating claimants out of legitimate insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} {{an early version}} of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, Garran {{was made}} the first Solicitor-General of Australia (the office was then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister. The {{creation}} {{of the office and}} Garran's appointment to it was to some degree recognition of his existing role as Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, in which Garran gave legal advice to several successive governments, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> represented a formal delegation of many of the powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General.|$|E
5|$|In September 1956, the RAF {{received}} its first Vulcan B.1, XA897, which immediately embarked upon a round-the-world tour. The tour {{was to be}} an important demonstration of the range and capabilities of the aircraft, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> had other benefits in the form of conducting goodwill visits in various countries; in later life Vulcans routinely visited various nations and distant parts of the former British Empire as a show of support and military protection. This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E
