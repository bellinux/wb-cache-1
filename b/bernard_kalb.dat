5000|$|In 2000, Jacoby was {{suspended}} by the Globe {{for four months}} without pay for what the paper called his [...] "serious journalistic misconduct" [...] in failing to provide sources for a Fourth of July column {{on the fate of}} the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

The Globe [...] "avoided calling the column a work of plagiarism but stated that Jacoby should have alerted readers to similar accounts published elsewhere over the years." [...] On CNN's Reliable Sources, veteran journalists <b>Bernard</b> <b>Kalb</b> and Howard Kurtz concluded that [...] "Jeff Jacoby got shafted by the Boston Globe." [...] Time magazine's Lance Morrow wrote that [...] "Jacoby's offense was no offense."

The Boston Phoenix, often at odds with Jacoby's views, also rose to Jacoby's defense.|$|E

He refused to be intimidated by either officials or the news media. 'He talked back,' said George McArthur, who covered the Vietnam war for The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times later was AP Cairo bureau chief.... 'Barry's door was always open and although he never shared a classified thought, he left you feeling that he had,' said former New York Times and CBS reporter <b>Bernard</b> <b>Kalb.</b> 'Even when he told you nothing, he was always persuasive.' 'In postwar years, Barry Zorthian remained steadfast to his conviction about the significant role the media must play in a democratic society,' said Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning war reporter for the AP in Vietnam and later a CNN foreign correspondent. ... Arnett recalled that when he Arnett complained about an American military policeman threatening to shoot him during a 1965 Buddhist street demonstration in Saigon, `Zorthian {{shook his head in}} mock concern, and said `D--- it, Peter, you threatened him and he was just responding.' 'What?' I replied. 'Yes,' Barry said, `you were aiming your pencil at him and that's more dangerous around here than a [...]45.'" ...|$|E
