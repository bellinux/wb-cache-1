5|$|Precisely because Prince Yelü Bei {{exemplified}} both Chinese and Khitan values, Empress Shulü Ping {{objected to}} Bei assuming {{the role of}} Emperor. The Empress believed that Bei's openness to Chinese culture detracted from his leadership ability as a Khitan, and she instead favored Emperor Taizu's more traditionalist second son, Yelü Deguang. Deguang enjoyed not only {{the support of his}} mother, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Khitan nobility. Realizing that he could not assume the throne, {{and that it would be}} dangerous to try, Bei campaigned in favor of allowing his younger brother to assume the throne, and by the end of 927, formally stated to his mother that Deguang's qualifications were superior to his own, functionally ending his ability to challenge Deguang's ascension to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{drafting}} a new charter for Manila in June 1901, the Americans made official what {{had long been}} tacit: that the city of Manila consisted not of Intramuros alone <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding areas. The new charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts: presumably Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Paco, Pandacan, Sampaloc, San Miguel, Santa Ana, Santa Cruz and Tondo. In addition, the Catholic Church recognized five parishes—Gagalangin, Trozo, Balic-Balic, Santa Mesa and Singalong—as part of Manila. Later, two more would be added: Balut and San Andres.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism and conspicuous intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of the 1st Marine Raider Battalion, with Parachute Battalion attached, during action against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands on the night of 13–14 September 1942. After the airfield on Guadalcanal had been seized from the enemy on August 8, Col. Edson, with a force of 800 men, was assigned to the occupation and defense of a ridge dominating the jungle on either side of the airport. Facing a formidable Japanese attack which, augmented by infiltration, had crashed through our front lines, he, by skillful handling of his troops, successfully withdrew his forward units to a reserve line with minimum casualties. When the enemy, in a subsequent series of violent assaults, engaged our force in desperate hand-to-hand combat with bayonets, rifles, pistols, grenades, and knives, Col. Edson, although continuously exposed to hostile fire throughout the night, personally directed defense of the reserve position against a fanatical foe of greatly superior numbers. By his astute leadership and gallant devotion to duty, he enabled his men, despite severe losses, to cling tenaciously to their position on the vital ridge, thereby retaining command not only of the Guadalcanal airfield, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st Division's entire offensive installations in the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|When Archduke Charles {{withdrew from}} the Rhine valley, he left about 30,000 troops in garrisons along the river. There were 15,000 foot and 1,200 horse in Mainz, 3,000 {{infantry}} in Ehrenbreitstein, 8,800 infantry and 300 cavalry in Mannheim and 2,500 foot soldiers in Philippsburg. To contain the first two, Jourdan left 28,545 troops under François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers while Moreau only detailed 2,800 infantry and 240 cavalry to watch the last two places. For the most part, the Austrian garrisons remained quiescent. But the Austrians in Mannheim caused mischief by attacking Kehl on 18 September. More might have been accomplished in that assault, but the Austrian soldiers paused to pillage the French camp and were driven off by their enemies. Even so, Charles not only lost the services of the 30,000 men in the fortresses <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swabians, Saxons and other German allies when he retreated from the Rhine. These auxiliary forces began {{to negotiate with the}} French when their territories were occupied.|$|E

25|$|As pope, Pius XII {{received}} Muench {{in several}} audiences, and after their second audience on July 12, 1946, the two always conversed in German. Muench also wrote many {{reports on the}} events in Germany directly to Pius XII between 1946 and 1958, {{and there is some}} evidence that Pius XII read many of them personally, even in 1953 when his health began to deteriorate. The reports spoke not only of the immediate, material needs of German Catholics, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spread of communism, a fear shared by Muench and Pius XII, and the subject of another 1954 audience between the two.|$|E
25|$|If atheism {{is defined}} as disbelief in {{existence}} of a God, then Jainism cannot be labeled as atheistic, as it not only believes in existence of gods <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul which can attain godhood. As Paul Dundas puts it – “while Jainism is, as we have seen, atheist in a limited sense of rejection of both {{the existence of a}} creator God and the possibility of intervention of such a being in human affairs, it nonetheless must be regarded as a theist religion in the more profound sense that it accepts the existence of divine principle, the paramātmā i.e. God, existing in potential state within all beings”.|$|E

They had with them horse and foot not only of the Army, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> militia of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and were heavily outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 20,000 of Hamilton's command. But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale's corps having thus become the left flank guard instead of the advanced guard.|$|E
25|$|The VOC had {{two types}} of shareholders: the participanten, who {{could be seen as}} non-{{managing}} members, and the 76 bewindhebbers (later reduced to 60) who acted as managing directors. This was the usual set-up for Dutch joint-stock companies at the time. The innovation {{in the case of the}} VOC was that the liability of not just the participanten <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bewindhebbers was limited to the paid-in capital (usually, bewindhebbers had unlimited liability). The VOC therefore was a limited liability company. Also, the capital would be permanent during the lifetime of the company. As a consequence, investors that wished to liquidate their interest in the interim could only do this by selling their share to others on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.|$|E
25|$|The {{activities}} of Augustus II {{were aimed at}} strengthening his royal power in the Commonwealth. Nobility's opposition to the stationing of Saxon troops in Poland, its cost and internally threatening role, led to military resistance, first attempted in 1714 {{and then in a}} more definitive way pursued in 1715, when the action unified the pro-Swedish and pro-Russian camps and Peter I's support was secured. In the fall the Crown army became organized in an anti-Saxon capacity and fighting commenced, with large scale participation not only of szlachta, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oppressed by military contributions peasants. In November, the Tarnogród Confederation, with Stanisław Ledóchowski as its marshal was formed, having the goal of removing the Saxons from the Commonwealth.|$|E
