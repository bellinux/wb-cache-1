5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – just to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract {{until the end of the}} season.|$|E

People who genuinely believe that the court is partial and corrupt and have a rational basis for this belief should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so without fear of being held in contempt.

500|$|The {{holder of}} a mere power is {{therefore}} {{free to do}} what he wants with the property he holds; if he fails to consider his exercise of the power, the courts may force him to do so. The leading test for mere powers is the [...] "any given postulant" [...] test, laid down in Re Gulbenkian. This states that the trustees must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with certainty, when a potential beneficiary comes before them, that he either is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, {{ill health}} {{prevented}} Ferens from attending the company’s Annual Meeting. It {{was the first}} he had missed in 50 years. He had not fulfilled any public engagements for some weeks; nevertheless, he wrote out his speech and it was presented by Sir Harold Reckitt. In the speech Ferens was again able to present the board with pleasing figures. The net profit was £1,277,683, an increase of £33,108 over 1928, which was itself a record year. It {{was a source of}} great gratification for him [...] "to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the most cordial relations exist between the workers, the management and the board".|$|E
500|$|Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, [...] "I don't {{know how}} to put into words how {{fortunate}} I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody...

500|$|According to Sestero and Greg Ellery, Wiseau {{came to the}} Birns and Sawyer film lot, {{rented a}} studio, and bought a [...] "complete Beginning Director package," [...] which {{included}} the purchase of two brand new film and HD cameras. Wiseau, confused {{about the differences between}} 35 mm film and high-definition video, decided to shoot the entire film in both formats simultaneously, using a custom-built apparatus that housed both cameras side-by-side and required two crews to operate. Commenting on his decision to shoot the film in this way, Wiseau said that he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he was the first director to film an entire movie simultaneously in two formats, although ultimately only the 35mm footage was used in the final edit.|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Sarah Champion {{pointed out}} (prior to the million pound fire) that, [...] "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely {{go out and buy a}} submarine....Just to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{received}} {{a salary of}} $4,000 a week, but had no contract. He said in 1986, [...] "I wanted Kirk to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Get lost, Jim,' without obligation if it didn't work." [...] Like {{most of the big}} studios in the 1960s, MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory. Instead, Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the MGM Grand Hotel he was building. [...] "We've been using old-fashioned methods here," [...] Aubrey said at the time. In 1986, he said the company was [...] "total disarray. Until you were in a position to lift up the rug, {{there was no way to}} know how much disarray. The crown jewel of studios had become a shambles." ...|$|E

500|$|Around 5:00 pm {{the wind}} began to shift, to British disadvantage. De Grasse gave signals for the van to move further ahead {{so that more}} of the French fleet might engage, but Bougainville, fully engaged with the British van at musket range, {{did not want to}} risk [...] "severe {{handling}} had the French presented the stern." [...] When he did finally begin pulling away, British leaders interpreted it as a retreat: [...] "the French van suffered most, because it was obliged to bear away." [...] Rather than follow, the British hung back, continuing to fire at long range; this prompted one French officer to write that the British [...] "only engaged from far off and simply in order to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they had fought." [...] Sunset brought an end to the firefight, with both fleets continuing on a roughly southeast tack, away from the bay.|$|E
500|$|Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop was {{positive}} towards the episode, calling it [...] "a tense week for Section D" [...] and added [...] "our guys did {{a pretty good}} job." [...] Gimmers also thought Ben [...] "did well on his first undercover mission too, didn't you think? Apart from verging on sympathy for the young brainwashed bombers. Still, he's young. He'll get over it." [...] On Ros' role in the episode, Gimmers said [...] "I don't think I'll ever <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I'm [...] "warming" [...] to such an ice queen as Ros, but I will admit to a growing admiration." [...] Scott Matthewman of The Stage stated [...] "the seventh series of the spy show continues apace," [...] and praised the episode for [...] "the superb performance of Hermione Norris as Ros Myers, fast becoming the twisted moral centre of the show. Both she and Peter Firth's Harry Pearce get some great dialogue every week, so it's a shame {{that the rest of the}} cast aren’t afforded the same luxury." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{an express}} trust to be valid, the trust {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means {{that it must be}} clear that the settlor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the settlor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

500|$|When {{the tour}} was announced, U2 guitarist The Edge {{said of the}} show's design: [...] "It's hard {{to come up with}} {{something}} that's fundamentally different, but we have, I think, on this tour. Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill." [...] Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: [...] "We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object." [...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: [...] "The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures in different parts of the globe and turn them into permanent concert venues. An auction of the stages was planned following the last concert.|$|E
500|$|... "First Flight" [...] also {{provided}} {{the stage for}} an exchange with the United States Navy aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN-65). Three crew members of the real-life Enterprise had been voted as [...] "Sailors of the Year" [...] by the U.S. Navy, and so were given the roles of extras in this episode. This {{was not the first}} time such an exchange had occurred; previous winners had appeared as crew members on board the fictional Enterprise in the episode [...] "Desert Crossing". However, this time around they were given roles at the NX Command Center instead. Aviation Maintenance Administrationman 2nd Class James D. Frey portrayed a technician, Navy Counselor 1st Class Kathleen J. Grant played a Senator and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Thomas P. Hunt was the Senator's assistant. All three were pleased to be appearing on the show, with Grant saying that [...] "My nephew told all of the kids at his school his aunt was going to be on Star Trek. That makes the experience even more of a thrill for me", and Hunt saying [...] "This will be on reruns for years to come, when I'm 60, I'll <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Hey, that's me on Enterprise.'". In return, the three sailors presented the cast and crew of Star Trek: Enterprise with a flag that had been flying on the aircraft carrier earlier in the month.|$|E
500|$|TV Week {{described}} Donna as [...] "beautiful and a {{free spirit}} {{who is also a}} little loud and obnoxious", while the Metro called her [...] "kooky." [...] The teens of Ramsay Street warm to her eventually and with their help, Donna changes her ways and becomes accepted. The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration into the street and the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl. You can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week. It's fun to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and do these things you normally wouldn't".|$|E

500|$|The {{three certainties}} {{refer to a}} rule within English trusts law on the {{creation}} of express trusts that, to be valid, the trust instrument must show certainty of intention, subject matter and object. [...] "Certainty of intention" [...] means that it must be clear that the donor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the donor knowing he is creating a trust.

500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose {{the reason you}} put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so {{that no matter what}} they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was a great big question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E
