Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets.|$|E

5|$|Tommy was {{originally}} released as a two-LP set with artwork designed by McInnerney, {{which included a}} booklet including lyrics and images to illustrate parts of the story. The cover is presented {{as part of a}} triptych-style fold-out cover, and the booklet contained abstract artwork that outlined the story. Although the album included lyrics to all the songs, indicating individual characters, it did not outline the plot, which led to a concert programme <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> shows, that carried a detailed synopsis.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} when Monteverdi {{received}} the libretto from Badoaro, but this was presumably during or before 1639 since the work was <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> performance in the 1639–40 carnival. In keeping with the general character of Venetian opera, the work was written for a small band—around five string players and various continuo instruments. This reflected the financial motives of the merchant princes who were sponsoring the opera houses—they demanded commercial as well as artistic success, and wanted to minimise costs. As was common at the time, precise instrumentation is not indicated in the score, which exists in a single handwritten manuscript discovered in the Vienna National Library in the 19th century.|$|E

Splinter Cell: Blacklist was released in North America on August 20 and in Europe three days later for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that there was too much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E

5|$|A {{music video}} was issued in November 2003 {{to promote the}} single. The video shows Sebastian on a TV set as it is <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a show. He is dressed casually in jeans and windcheater. He sits on boxes as he begins to sing with a camera crew {{starting}} to film him. An image {{of a young woman}} is shown as he continues. Various personnel walk around him and adjust the set. Sebastian stands and the image of the female is seen again, she wears white feathers. Later, Sebastian is dressed more formally in a white suit as he performs the song. On this set are plasma screens depicting the same young woman. The video ends with Sebastian in his casual gear again, sitting on the boxes. The video was produced by Australian Idols Stephen Tate and directed by the show's musical director, John Foreman. On 22 November, the clip was premiered on Network Ten's Video Hits – which had Tate as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not.

He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E

During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept his mistakes, lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered.

5|$|Jerusalem {{had been}} well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured {{it from the}} Persians. After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius {{repaired}} its defenses. The Muslims had so far not attempted any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces {{had the potential to}} threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a state of siege since the Muslims captured the neighboring forts of Pella and Bosra. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> a siege that seemed inevitable. When the Muslim army reached Jericho, Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly sent them to the coast, to be taken to Constantinople. The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city, they decided to press on with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi.

He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|When {{tropical}} cyclones {{move over}} land, they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability {{required for the}} development of weak, embedded supercell thunderstorms, which can produce tornadoes. These tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived, but still capable of producing significant damage. While centered over the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern side of Hurricane Elena's circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central Florida. A tornado struck just east of Leesburg on September 1, destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes, and damaging another 118; seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Later that same day, another tornado touched down over downtown Leesburg, with much less damage. In nearby Marion County, tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes, compromised another 50 residences, and inflicted as much as $500,000 in total losses, though only minor injuries were reported. At Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Cape Canaveral, a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where Space Shuttle Atlantis was <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> its first flight. A tornado in New Port Richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees, and tornadic activity was also identified in Sumter County.|$|E
5|$|After being {{promoted}} to colonel, {{he served as}} Director of Military Intelligence between 1960 and 1964, and while the Australian Army was developing its own doctrine on counter-revolutionary warfare, Graham's ideas on counter-insurgency were influenced by a visit to South Vietnam in November 1961. Graham's understanding of {{the challenges of the}} prevailing Cold War environment allowed him to reform Australia's nascent military intelligence apparatus, encouraging developments in joint intelligence arrangements with Australia's allies and fostering liaison with his British and US counterparts, as well as establishing relationships with countries in South-East Asia. In recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1963. He then took up an appointment as commandant of the Jungle Training Centre (JTC) at Canungra, Queensland in 1964. The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) was <b>being</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> deployment during this time, and Army officers were learning new tactics, techniques and procedures. Promoted to brigadier in 1965 he then commanded the 6th Task Force in southern Queensland, supervising the training of 2 RAR and 6 RAR, both battalions which would later serve under his command in Vietnam. In 1966, Graham studied at the Imperial Defence College in London.|$|E
