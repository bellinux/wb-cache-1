5|$|The {{return of}} Andrew Flintoff {{following}} an injury would reignite the ongoing debate about which two of Cook, Bell and Collingwood {{should be included}} in the team, with many speculating that Collingwood would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to miss out. With the sudden departure of Marcus Trescothick from the tour just over a week before the First Test, the debate was settled for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922. It is considered the charcuterie of the connoisseurs. Despite the Greek economic crisis, Miran is expanding its {{business and}} has doubled in size to accommodate increased demand. The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, is thought to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in}} the European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has been in the same spot in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} Alfano reached {{as far as}} politics. Together with his {{right-hand}} men, the priest Ciro Vitozzi and his associate Giovanni Rapi, Alfano was said to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> behind the election in 1904 of the Count Vincenzo Ravaschieri Foschi to parliament {{to the detriment of}} the incumbent socialist deputy Ettore Ciccotti. The night before the election dissident voters were intimidated, assaulted, beaten, and sustained knife injuries by ruffians hired and encouraged by both the Camorra and the police, since the authorities equally disapproved of a socialist candidate. Alfano, Rapi and Vitozzi were seen and photographed while actively directing the vote in favour of Count Ravaschieri in the Camorra controlled district of Vicaria in which Ciccotti surprisingly had won in 1900. Ravaschieri won the 1904 election.|$|E

5|$|When Beria told Stalin {{about the}} Manhattan Project and its {{importance}} Stalin handpicked Molotov to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{in charge of}} the Soviet atomic bomb project. However, under Molotov's leadership the bomb, and the project itself, developed very slowly and Molotov was replaced by Beria in 1944 on the advice of Igor Kurchatov. When Harry S. Truman, the American president, told Stalin that the Americans had created a bomb never seen before, Stalin relayed the conversation to Molotov and told him to speed up development. On Stalin's orders the Soviet government substantially increased investment in the project.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War, Childers {{was said}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> behind the {{propaganda}} of the republican movement, and was hunted by National Army soldiers. The death in an ambush of Michael Collins intensified the desire of Free State authorities for retribution, and on 28 September 1922 the Dáil introduced the Army Emergency Powers Resolution, establishing martial law powers and listing carrying firearms without a licence a capital offence.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Baseball {{commissioner}} Bud Selig {{announced that}} Major League Baseball would appoint a representative {{to take over}} all business and day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. The move was likely instigated by media reports that owner Frank McCourt had to arrange a $30 million loan from Fox to cover the teams payroll as well as uncertainty over the teams ownership situation relating to the ongoing divorce litigation. On April 25, Selig appointed former Texas Rangers president Tom Schieffer to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{in charge of the}} Dodgers situation.|$|E

Shastri's only other score over fifty in the season was a particularly dull 125 against Pakistan in the Jaipur Test. He did well enough to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> of the one day series. In the first one-day match against Pakistan he captained India for the first time, scoring 50 and taking three wickets. He took four wickets at Calcutta and 69* at Hyderabad in two thrilling finishes. Later at Nagpur with India facing a big target, he scored 52 in 40 balls.|$|E

25|$|Realization {{begins to}} slowly dawn in Scene II {{of the play}} when Jocasta {{mentions}} out of hand that Laius was slain {{at a place where}} three roads meet. This stirs something in Oedipus' memory and he suddenly remembers the men that he fought and killed one day long ago at a place where three roads met. He realizes, horrified, that he might <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> he's seeking. One household servant survived the attack and now lives out his old age in a frontier district of Thebes. Oedipus sends immediately for the man to either confirm or deny his guilt. At the very worst, though, he expects to find himself to be the unsuspecting murderer of a man unknown to him. The truth has not yet been made clear.|$|E

Carton is revealed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who fell in the Tube station and dropped the note Anne found. Harry followed Carton to London and Nadina to the Mill House, but insists Nadina was already dead. He realised that the diamonds were probably still on the Kilmorden Castle. Anne confirms that they were, and were handed to Suzanne in her cabin {{on the night of}} the 22nd. Harry's island is attacked that night by a party led by the red-bearded Dutchman, but the two manage to escape, and Anne plans to return to Pedler's party where she can keep an eye on developments. They exchange codes to be used in future communications so that neither can be duped again. Reunited with Suzanne, Anne is told that the diamonds are with luggage sent on with Sir Eustace. She also receives a telegram from Harry telling her to meet him.|$|E

500|$|After {{successfully}} {{retaining the}} WWE United States Championship at the event, Chris Benoit started a [...] rivalry with Booker T. Booker defeated Benoit {{for the title}} on the edition of October 21 of SmackDown! to begin their feud. The following month, on the edition of November 24 of SmackDown!, a match between Benoit and Booker for the title ended in a no-contest after both men's shoulders were on the mat while pinning one another. Theodore Long then vacated the title and announced that the two would face off against {{one another in a}} [...] "Best of Seven series" [...] for the title, in which the winner would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who won four matches over the other first. Booker defeated Benoit in the first match at Survivor Series, and eventually won the vacant title after Randy Orton, Booker's replacement due to a legitimate injury to his ankle at a house show, defeated Benoit in the seventh and final match in January. Booker began his fourth reign as United States Champion.|$|E
500|$|On the July 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Booker T {{challenged}} John Cena for the WWE United States Championship. During the match, General Manager Kurt Angle and Luther Reigns interfered on Booker's behalf, and Booker inadvertently caused Cena to attack Angle.

On the July 29 episode of SmackDown!, Booker T won the vacant United States Championship after last eliminating Rob Van Dam in an elimination match. The following week, Cena defeated Van Dam to become the number-one contender to the title. Theodore Long, who proceeded Angle as General Manager after he was fired {{as part of the}} storyline, announced that Cena would be facing Booker in a [...] "Best of 5 series", in which the winner would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who earns three victories over the other first.

500|$|Luton's cup win was the club's {{first major}} piece of {{silverware}} in its history. A jubilant Harford {{described it as}} [...] "the greatest win in my time at Luton," [...] having thought his team had lost the match when Smith scored. He commended his goalkeeper, saying: [...] "Considering all the circumstances, I think Dibble had to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> of the match, {{and as for the}} young boy, [...] Black was sensational. He has so much talent." [...] The stand-in goalkeeper for Luton was delighted with his role in the final, but made it pertinent that he needed regular first-team football, or he would be tempted to leave the following season. Brian Stein spoke of his surprise of scoring the winner, and said: [...] "I asked the referee how long was left and he just blew the whistle." [...] Luton held a civic ceremony two days after the final, where the trophy was presented in front of the club's supporters. It was there the stem of the trophy had become noticeably damaged; Luton the following morning returned it to the competition's sponsors for repairs.|$|E
500|$|Documented {{cases of}} grave robbery for medical {{purposes}} {{can be found}} {{as far back as}} 1319. [...] The 15th-century polymath Leonardo da Vinci may have secretly dissected around 30corpses, although their provenance remains unknown. [...] In Britain, the practice appears to have been common early in the 17th century. [...] For example, William Shakespeare's epitaph reads [...] "Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, To dig the dust enclosed here. [...] Blessed <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones" [...] and in 1678, anatomists were suspected of being involved in the disappearance of an executed gypsy's body. [...] Contracts issued in 1721 by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons include a clause directing students not to become involved in exhumation, suggesting, according to historian Ruth Richardson, that students had already done the exact opposite. [...] Pupils accompanied professional body snatchers as observers, and were reported to have obtained and paid for their studies with human corpses, perhaps indicating that their tutors were complicit. [...] The unauthorised removal of bodies from London graveyards became commonplace and by the 1720s, probably {{as a direct result of}} the lack of legally available bodies for anatomical research, fresh corpses had likely undergone commodification.|$|E
500|$|The magnificence of the objects, {{both the}} {{personal}} possessions and those items designed to denote {{the authority of}} the dead individual, point to the death of a person connected with the royal court, according to Rupert Bruce-Mitford, who regards the burial as [...] "very likely the monument of the High King or bretwalda Raedwald". [...] Yorke suggests that the treasures buried with the ship reflect the size of the tribute paid to Rædwald by subject kings during his period as bretwalda. Bruce-Mitford has suggested that the inclusion of bowls and spoons amongst the treasures fits with Bede's account of Raedwald's conversion: the spoons may have been a present for a convert from paganism and the bowls had Christian significance. Coins found in the burial have been dated to the approximate date of Rædwald's death. The controversy surrounding the identity of the person for whom the mound was built are reflected in the comments in the article on Rædwald in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ("It has been argued, more strongly than convincingly, that Rædwald must <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> buried in Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo") and by McClure and Collins, who note that the evidence for Raedwald is [...] "almost non-existent".|$|E
