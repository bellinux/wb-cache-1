40|$|The {{effects of}} changes in rates of mortality, fertility, and {{migration}} depend {{not only on the}} age-specific patterns and levels of these rates, but on the age structure of the population. In order to remove the influences of the age structure and concentrate on the effects of the demographic rates themselves, a common practice is to analyze the influences of the rates for a standard age structure. This paper analyzes current and future population changes in Germany, using a stationary population equivalent model (SPE) that shows long-term effects of current fertility, mortality, and international migration patterns. Results indicate that the German population will eventually decline because of <b>below</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>fertility,</b> if net immigration does not counteract this decrease. This means, for instance, that the long-term stationary population levels for Germany will decrease by approximately 6. 5  million during a decade in which current fertility, mortality, and international migration levels prevail.

This regional average, however, masks a considerable difference in the total fertility rate (TFR) observed among subregions. The TFR has plummeted to below the replacement level (2. 1 births per woman) in East and North-East Asia (1. 6 births per woman) and North and Central Asia (1. 5 births per woman).

The {{results show that the}} regional fertility variation seen in Italy since World War II was well established in the 19 th century and that a lack of convergence of regional fertility rates during the years of the demographic transition in Italy (late 1800 s) helped emphasize regional differences. The impacts of experiences such as political unification, industrialization, the completion of the demographic transition, and mass emigration are cited as important clues to the change and persistence of regional fertility identities during this time period. This use of a rich historical data set placed in a geographic context not only helps illuminate the past, but also assists in the explanation of patterns of regional fertility seen in today?s Italy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{frequently}} assumed {{by the general}} public and also by some population experts that the value of replacement-level fertility is everywhere an average of 2. 1 lifetime births per woman. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The global variation in <b>replacement</b> <b>fertility</b> is substantial, ranging by almost 1. 4 live births from less than 2. 1 to nearly 3. 5. This range is due almost entirely to cross-country differences in mortality, concentrated in the less developed world. Policy makers need to be sensitive to own-country replacement rates. Failure to do so could result in fertility levels that are <b>below</b> <b>replacement</b> and lead to long-run population decline. For example, the current <b>replacement</b> total <b>fertility</b> rate for the East Africa region is 2. 94.
