25|$|Vasco {{is heavily}} reliant {{on the port}} {{for most of its}} {{economic}} activity. Manganese ore mined in interior regions is brought to Mormugao by barges navigating the rivers Mandovi and Zuari, and then either collected in the Mormugao Port to be loaded onto bulk carrier ships or directly loaded onto the ships using trans-shippers. Ore which is collected on the port is handled by machinery called MOHP (Mechanical Ore-Handling Plant). This includes massive <b>bucket</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders and miles of conveyor belts. The port has berthing facilities for large cruise liners as well as a floating dry dock. There are shipping and freight forwarding agents as well as offices of major mining companies based in the city.|$|E
25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, <b>bucket</b> <b>wheel</b> excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E

50|$|In shipyards, <b>bucket</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} for the {{continuous}} loading and unloading of ships, where they pick up material from the yard for transfer to the delivery system.

TAKRAF's continuous ship unloader is capable of removing up to 95% of the material from a ship's hold, owing to a flexibly-configured digging attachment.|$|R

50|$|A mill {{race has}} many {{geographically}} specific names, such as leat, lade, flume, goit, penstock. These words all have more precise definitions and meanings will differ elsewhere. The original undershot waterwheel, described by Vitruvius was {{a run of}} the river wheel placed so a fast flowing stream would press against and turn {{the bottom of a}} <b>bucketed</b> <b>wheel.</b> In the first meaning of the term, the millrace was the stream; {{in the sense of the}} word, there was no channel, so no race.|$|R

50|$|In 1866, California {{millwright}} Samuel Knight {{invented a}} machine that took the impulse system to a new level. Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields, Knight developed a <b>bucketed</b> <b>wheel</b> which captured the energy of a free jet, which had converted a high head (hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or penstock) of water to kinetic energy. This is called an impulse or tangential turbine. The water's velocity, roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery, does a u-turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity.|$|R

2500|$|Another type of team boat uses a [...] "horse whim," [...] a type {{of horse}} mill. It has a large {{revolving}} wheel in the middle, and a center post known as a [...] "whim" [...] (or horse capstan). The horses, which {{are attached to the}} horse whim, walk around in a circle, causing the wheel or capstan to revolve, which in turn rotates gears that rotate the paddles, or <b>bucket</b> <b>wheels.</b> The team boat of this style consisted of two complete hulls, united by a deck or bridge, but separated far enough apart to allow the paddle wheel to be set between them. They are sharp at both ends, and can be propelled backward or forward with equal ease.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Overburden soils {{from open}} pit mines {{of the company}} RWE Power AG are {{excavated}} with <b>bucket</b> <b>wheels</b> and transported with band conveyors to dump heaps. The deposition of the waste soils takes place within so-called regular sections. In order to perform stability computations one needs a geotechnical characterization of the involved soils, and in particular representative values of shear strength. Undrained shear strengths from laboratory and field testing are subjected to enormous scatter which makes {{the definition of the}} representative values difficult. Therefore, a concept for a reliable determination of the undrained shear strength of waste soils in mine heaps has been introduced. It is based on a hypoplastic constitutive model for fine-grained soils which takes into account the influence of soil state (in this case represented by consistency) on the undrained shear strength. The accompanying experimental investigations include extensive laboratory testing as well as large-scale field tests suitable for a statistical evaluation. The results of numerical calculations yield an experimentally justified statistical distribution of undrained shear strengths immediately after the soil deposition. A subsequent FE analysis of the consolidation behaviour provides the time-dependent values. 1...|$|R

50|$|The old Serbian mill, mudra Milica, is {{the latest}} and 15th mill in the mill museum. It was added in May 2005 and is around 100 years old. It is a vortex or {{horizontal}} water wheel (Löffelradmühle) from western Serbia. This type of mill was the forerunner of the Pelton turbine. Its <b>bucket</b> water <b>wheels</b> were especially useful where there were small amounts of water and steep gradients. This type was used especially in mountain regions, like the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Carpathians. The mill was a present from the Serbian-Orthodox bishop Lavrentije of the diocese of Šabac-Valjevo to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the mill museum.|$|R
