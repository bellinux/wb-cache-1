40|$|The {{management}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} in bakery exhaust gases {{was identified as a}} high priority problem by the American Bakers Association in conjunction with their member companies. <b>Biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology was evaluated among other approaches and was selected for a pilot study to control ethanol emissions from a bakery oven exhaust gas stream. Biofilters and biotrickling filters use microbial populations in biofilms that grow on support media to degrade or transform contaminants in the air. The <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> employed in the pilot study used a synthetic fibrous support media to immobilize the biofilm. A pilot study was conducted from September 1997 to February 1998, to assess the performance of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology in treating organic emissions from bakery ovens. Bench-scale studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the support media and develop initial estimates of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> performance. Pilot studies were performed with USEPA’s trailer mounted two-stage <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> system, at flowrates in the range of 1. 8 - 3. 0 standard cubic meters per minute (65 - 104 standard cubic feet per minute). Removal efficiencies in the range of 80 % to 100 % were measured experimentally, and averaged 91 % over the duration of the study. The pilot-scale biofilter produced removal efficiencies exceeding 80 % for about 99. 6 % of its operating time. The pressure drop across the bed was less than 6. 4 millimeters (0. 25 inches) of water. The test further revealed that the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> was quite robust; it responded quickly to changes in inlet concentration and exhibited a recovery time of less than 150 minutes after a nine day shutdown period. Preliminary economic analysis of the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> system, from a Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) perspective, showed that the tested <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology is cost-effective for treating ethanol emissions from a bakery oven...|$|E

The performance of 20 identically operated rotating <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> was reproducible with an average toluene elimination capacity of 79. 4 g m- 3 h- 1 (stand. dev. = 5. 7) at an empty bed residence time of 45 s and a toluene inlet gas phase concentration of 1. 6 g m- 3. At gas and liquid cocurrent operation, the toluene elimination capacity of rotating <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> was 20 % higher than at countercurrent operation. This was probably caused by greater mass transfer limitation resulting from increased wetting of the biofilm during countercurrent operation. Performance versus load curves of rotating and of conventional <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> were comparable with non-zero order removal at toluene inlet concentrations lower than 2 g m- 3. This multiple rotating <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> setup provides a new and inexpensive tool for comparative studies in biotrickling filtration for air pollution control...|$|R
40|$|In the {{industrial}} operation of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) removal, shock loads or starvation was common due to process variations or equipment malfunctions. In this study, effects of starvation and shock loads {{on the performance}} of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for H 2 S removal were investigated. Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the changes of biomass and viable bacteria numbers in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> during a 24 -d starvation. Compared to biomass, viable bacteria numbers decreased significantly during the starvation, especially when airflow was maintained in the absence of spray liquid. During the subsequent re-acclimation, all the bioreactors could resume high removal efficiencies within 4 d regardless of the previous starvation conditions. The results show that the re-acclimation time, in the case of <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> for H 2 S removal, is mainly controlled by viable H 2 S oxidizing bacteria numbers. On the other hand, the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> can protect against shock loads in inlet fluctuating H 2 S concentration after resuming normal operation.

The average toluene vapor elimination capacity at 1 g/m 3 toluene and 64 m 3 /(m 3 ? h) was 31. 1 g/(m 3 ? h) in the con-trol and 32. 2 g/(m 3 ? h) in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> enriched with protozoa. At higher toluene inlet concentrations, toluene degradation rates increased and were slightly higher in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> enriched with protozoa. The lower rate of biomass accumulation after the addi-tion of protozoa was due to an increase of carbon min-eralization (68 % as compared to 61 % in the control).

40|$|Biological {{treatment}} is an emerging {{technology for the}} treatment of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) off-gases. Most of POTWs off-gases contain H 2 S and a wide range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since co-treatment of odors and VOCs in biotrickling filters is a relatively unexplored area, the simultaneous biotreatment of H 2 S and toluene (as the model VOC) was investigated. The experimental setup included two identical biotrickling filters, one operated at pH 4. 5 and the other one was operated at pH 7. 0. High concentrations of H 2 S (up to 170 ppmv) and toluene (up to 2. 2 g m− 3) were supplied to determine the influence of the pH on the maximum performance. A rapid startup (a few days) was observed for both toluene and H 2 S removal in the neutral-pH <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> In the acidic <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter,</b> toluene degradation also started immediately but at a lower rate. However, after several weeks of operation, the toluene elimination capacity (EC) at low pH reached a steady value identical to this found in the neutral-pH <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> H 2 S did not affect toluene degradation at concentrations up to 170 ppmv at either pH.

In this research, a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> was designed and operated to remove this pollutant from an air stream using bacteria extracted from the sewage sludge of a municipal sewage-treatment plant. The bacteria were cultured and enriched by either petri dish’s cultivation or liquid cultivation. The adsorption capacity of the ceramic material, which was used as the packing material, was determined to be 34 g-NO/L under 37 ℃. However, the saturated adsorption capacity of the packing material with the recycling solution is 236 mg-NO/L under the operation temperature 37 ℃. The result suggested that the microporous structure of the ceramic material not the humidity is the main contributor to the ceramic material adsorption capacity. Both the ceramic material adsorption capacity and the removal capacity of the liquid were limited and saturated in 540 min and 2 min operation, respectively. To obtain the best operation conditions for the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter,</b> orthogonal experiments (L 9 (34)) were designed. The experimental data were analyzed by the signal to noise (S/N) ratio and ANOVA. The optimal conditions of the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> occurred at a temperature of 40 ℃, a pH of 8. 0  0. 05 and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 165 mg/L in the recycled water with no oxygen in the system. Inlet oxygen concentration was found to be the most significant factor of the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> that has a significant negative effect on the NO removal efficiency. The DNA sequencing of four clones of bacteria showed 93 - 98 % similarity to Pseudomonas mendocina strain. This strain has been analysed by full gene sequencing and proved to be a brand-new strain named as Pseudomonas mendocina DLHK. This strain can transfer nitrate to organic nitrogen. This result indicated the assimilation nitrogen process in this system and suggested that the main nitrogen removal capacity in this system was through biological function. Through the isotope experimental analysis, two intermediate products (15 NO and 15 N 2 O) have been found during the biological process of the system by using quantitative gas analysis (QGA). These results indicated the denitrification function in this <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> A model was developed to explain the biological process in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter.</b> The averaged error of the measured and modeled data is - 0. 047. The standard deviation of the error is 0. 039. The model prediction is in good agreement with the experimental data, particularly at small packing height.

In this paper, a systematic study was initiated to understand biodegradation of gaseous contaminant mixtures in <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> and develop theoretical models that would provide avenues for extending pure compound studies to compound mixtures. This understanding is very important since there are hundreds of gaseous contaminants which can constitute million sof gaseous contaminant mixtures, and it is impossible to experimentally determine the biotreatment kinetics of every possible mixture combination. Results of the theoretical and experimental studies have been presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Two Hyphomicrobium VS {{inoculation}} protocols {{were compared}} for start-up of a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> removing dimethyl sulfide (DMS). One <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> (HBF 1) {{was filled with}} rings that were submerged in a nutrient medium containing Hyphomicrobium VS fed with DMS, another <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> (HBF 2) was similarly filled with rings that were submerged in nutrient medium, but continuously supplied with actively growing Hyphomicrobium VS and fed with methanol. Initially, about 40 times more Hyphomicrobium VS cells were attached to the rings in HBF 2. During the experiment, {{two to three times}} more Hyphomicrobium VS cells were still found to be present on the rings in HBF 2 compared to HBF 1. The maximal DMS elimination capacity at 90 % removal efficiency of HBF 1 was 7. 2 g m− 3 h− 1 after 30 days of operation. The elimination capacity decreased, however, when the inlet loading rate exceeded 15 g m− 3 h− 1 (200 ppmv inlet concentration). The performance of HBF 2 was much better, with an elimination capacity of 8. 3 g m− 3 h− 1 (90 % removal efficiency) after 2 days of operation, increasing to a maximum of 57 g m− 3 h− 1 at 92 % removal efficiency. Microbial community analysis with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed very different microbial communities in both biotrickling filters (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0 %). Moreover, the decreased DMS elimination capacity of HBF 1 at higher influent loading rate corresponded with a drastic change of the microbial community on the rings. The latter observations suggest that the functional efficiency of the microbial community in a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> can be related to its composition...|$|E
40|$|Odour control, <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter,</b> {{scrubbers}} Odour nuisance {{has become}} a major environmental issue worldwide with increasing public demand for better control of odorous emissions from municipal wastewater treatment facilities, chicken farms, chemical plants and other industrial works. Odour annoyance affects the population directly and there is a trend that {{more and more people are}} becoming less tolerable with obnoxious odour emissions. Bad smell is often regarded as an indicator for possible health risks. In Singapore, much investment has been placed on the prevention of nuisance odour emissions from all the public-owned wastewater treatment plants and continuing research has been put into the development of better and more cost-effective odour control procedures. The local authorities have invested significantly in covering up their existing waste treatment process units and treating all captured sewage air by a variety of technologies such as chemical scrubbers and activated carbon towers. Recently, a new <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology was developed and trial tested at a local wastewater plant and results from the past 3 years of operation indicate an extremely cost-effective biological way of treating sewage odour. Singapore’s odour control experience from the use of the traditional chemical and activated carbon systems to this latest <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> technology is discussed and presented here...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> for treatment of concentrated waste gases was investigated. The macrokinetics of methylmethacrylate degradation in the <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filter</b> is studied by measuring the degradation product methacrylic acid in the drain of the filter. The drain was analysed using isotachophoresis (ITP) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). The CZE analyses were carried out in an I. D. 75 µm capillary at 20 kV (negative inlet polarity) using a 0. 01 M Tris–acetate buffer of pH 4. 45. The electroosmotic flow (EOF) was suppressed by addition of CTA and PVA to the buffer. Detection was at 214 nm. After filtration through a 0. 45 -µm filter, samples were directly injected. The calibration graph was linear between 10 and 800 mg/l methacrylic acid, with an analysis time under 2 min...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} {{dichloromethane}} (DCM) from polluted air was studied both in <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> and in continuous stirred tank bioreactors, using either a single-liquid aqueous phase {{or a combination}} of an aqueous–organic liquid phase. The presence of the organic phase, i. e. silicone oil, at a volume ratio of 10 % of the liquid phase, increased the maximum EC by about 25 % in the BTF, reaching 200 g m 3 /h, and by as much as 300 % in the CSTB, reaching 350 g m 3 /h. Based on data of chloride release in the aqueous phase and carbon dioxide production in the gas phase, complete dechlorination and mineralization of the pollutant could be confirmed. When applying shock loads, a more stable behaviour was observed {{in the presence of the}} organic phase. Generally, the completely mixed reactors were also more stable than the plug-flow <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters,</b> irrespective of the presence of the organic phase. The use of molecular techniques allowed showing that the originally inoculated DCM-degrading Hyphomicrobium strains remained present, although not dominant, after long-term bioreactor operation. Different new bacterial populations did also appear in the systems, some of which were unable to degrade DCM...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{provides}} an overview about the microbes selecting, types of bioreactors, the treatment condition, etc. which influence the odors abatement effect. In the recent past, many highly efficiency microorganisms on the actual governance of malodorous gases have been selected and trained. Among different bioreactor configurations, biofilters, <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> and bioscrubbers are most common ones. The membrane bioreactor and the three phase fluidised bed bioreactor as new bioreactors have broad development prospects. Finally, this review also provides how to insights into future R&D needs in this area...|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, {{packed-bed}} <b>biotrickling</b> <b>filters</b> {{and acid}} scrubbers for removal of ammonia from exhaust air of animal houses are off-the-shelf techniques for ammonia removal. At {{the moment a}} new generation of so-called "multi-pollutant scrubbers" is being developed and tested that also removes odour and particulate matter from the air. Air cleaning systems are unusual in Spanish farms. The study of these techniques and their adaptation to Spanish farms, can be an interesting issue in order to achieve the national gas emission reduction commitments, and also to reduce social nuisances...|$|R
