These plasmids can be transferred between cells through <b>bacterial</b> <b>conjugation.</b> Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|... ==DNA {{transfer}}== DNA transfer between prokaryotic cells {{occurs in}} bacteria and archaea, {{although it has}} been mainly studied in bacteria. In bacteria, gene transfer occurs by three processes. These are (1) bacterial virus (bacteriophage)-mediated transduction, (2) plasmid-mediated conjugation, and (3) natural transformation. Transduction of bacterial genes by bacteriophage appears to reflect an occasional error during intracellular assembly of virus particles, rather than an adaptation of the host bacteria. The transfer of bacterial DNA is {{under the control of the}} bacteriophage’s genes rather than <b>bacterial</b> genes. <b>Conjugation</b> in the well-studied E. coli system is controlled by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for distributing copies of a plasmid from one bacterial host to another. Infrequently during this process, a plasmid may integrate into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfer part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium. Plasmid mediated transfer of host <b>bacterial</b> DNA (<b>conjugation)</b> also appears to be an accidental process rather than a bacterial adaptation.Natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium. Unlike transduction and conjugation, transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer, because it depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. For a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state called competence. About 40 genes are required in Bacillus subtilis for the development of competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be as much as a third to the whole chromosome. [...] Transformation is a common mode of DNA transfer, and 67 prokaryotic species are thus far known to be naturally competent for transformation.|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli K- 12 Hfr and F- strains were {{successively}} {{implanted in}} axenic chicks. Conjugation with exchanges of chromosomal genes occurred with high frequencies {{in the gut}} of the chicks and could continue as long as fertile strains coexisted in this environment. Almost all of the expected recombinant types were recovered in the feces under these experimental conditions. Furthermore, these recombinants were analogous to those obtained after conjugations in vitro. Recombinants formed in the gut were more numerous when the F- strain was seeded before the Hfr strain. The recombinants showed no apparent selective advantage over the parental strains in the intestinal medium. They were maintained throughout the experimental period and represented more than 10 % of the total intestinal flora. The chick gut is usually rapidly colonized by other bacterial types under natural conditions.

In view of the sparse similarity between <b>bacterial</b> and archaeal <b>conjugation</b> and the lack of a practical genetic system for Sulfolobus, we compared the functions and sequences of these variants and the previously described archaeal conjugative plasmid pNOB 8 in order to identify open reading frames (ORFs) and DNA sequences that are involved in conjugative transfer and maintenance of these plasmids in Sulfolobus. The variants pING 4 and - 6 are reproducibly derived from pING 1 in vivo by successive transpositions of an element from the Sulfolobus genome. The small defective but mobile variants pING 2 and - 3, which both lack a cluster of highly conserved ORFs probably involved in plasmid transfer, were shown to be formed in vivo by recombinative deletion of the larger part of the genomes of pING 4 and pING 6, respectively. The efﬁcient occurrence of these recombination processes is further evidence for the striking plasticity of the Sulfolobus genome...|$|R

500|$|In <b>bacterial</b> <b>conjugation,</b> where DNA is {{transferred}} between bacteria through direct cell-to-cell contact, homologous recombination helps integrate foreign DNA into the host genome via the RecBCD pathway.

[...] The RecBCD pathway is also {{essential for the}} final phase of transduction, a type of horizontal gene transfer in which DNA {{is transferred}} from one bacterium to another by a virus. [...] Foreign, bacterial DNA is sometimes misincorporated in the capsid head of bacteriophage virus particles as DNA is packaged into new bacteriophages during viral replication.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Bartonella species cospeciate with {{mammals and}} live within erythrocytes. Even in these {{specific}} niches, {{it has been}} recently suggested by bioinformatic analysis of full genome sequences that Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT) may occur but this has never been demonstrated biologically. Here we describe the sequence of the B. rattaustraliani (AUST/NH 4 (T)) circular plasmid (pNH 4) that encodes the tra cluster of the Type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) and we eventually provide evidence that Bartonella species may conjugate and exchange this plasmid inside amoeba. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The T 4 SS of pNH 4 is critical for intracellular viability of bacterial pathogens, exhibits bioinformatic evidence of LGT among bacteria living in phagocytic protists. For instance, 3 out of 4 T 4 SS encoding genes from pNH 4 appear to be closely related to Rhizobiales, suggesting that gene exchange occurs between intracellular bacteria from mammals (bartonellae) and plants (Rhizobiales). We show that B. rattaustraliani and Rhizobium radiobacter both survived within the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga and can conjugate together. Our findings further {{support the hypothesis that}} tra genes might also move into and out of <b>bacterial</b> communities by <b>conjugation,</b> which might be the primary means of genomic evolution for intracellular adaptation by cross-talk of interchangeable genes between Bartonella species and plant pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this, we speculate that amoeba favor the transfer of genes as phagocytic protists, which allows for intraphagocytic survival and, as a consequence, promotes the creation of potential pathogenic organisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plasmids are {{extrachromosomal}} {{elements that}} replicate autonomously, and many {{can be transmitted}} between <b>bacterial</b> cells through <b>conjugation.</b> Although the transcription pattern of genes on a plasmid can be altered by a change in host background, the expression range of plasmid genes {{that will result in}} phenotypic variation has not been quantitatively investigated. Results Using a microarray with evenly tiled probes at a density of 9 bp, we mapped and quantified the transcripts of the carbazole catabolic plasmid pCAR 1 in its original host Pseudomonas resinovorans CA 10 and the transconjugant P. putida KT 2440 (pCAR 1) during growth on either carbazole or succinate as the sole carbon source. We identified the operons in pCAR 1, which consisted of nearly identical transcription units despite the difference in host background during growth on the same carbon source. In accordance with previous studies, the catabolic operons for carbazole degradation were upregulated during growth on carbazole in both hosts. However, our tiling array results also showed that several operons flanking the transfer gene cluster were transcribed at significantly higher levels in the transconjugant than in the original host. The number of transcripts and the positions of the transcription start sites agreed with our quantitative RT-PCR and primer extension results. Conclusion Our tiling array results indicate that the levels of transcription for the operons on a plasmid can vary by host background. High-resolution mapping using an unbiased tiling array is a valuable tool for the simultaneous identification and quantification of prokaryotic transcriptomes including polycistronic operons and non-coding RNAs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lysine {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{limiting}} amino acids in protein sources for chickens. Since lysine is also an essential amino acid for animals, it is an important component of animal dietary formulation. Therefore, an accurate pre-determination of bioavailable lysine in feedstuffs is important. An optical density (OD) based microbiological assay for lysine determination using E. coli lysine auxotroph has been previously developed. However, because the assay is based on bacterial growth response to extracellular lysine measured as OD, it can be relatively time consuming (10 - 12 h). Therefore, more rapid assays are needed if pre-formulation estimates are required. In this dissertation whole cell fluorescent biosensors for the quantification of bioavailable and total lysine in feed protein sources were developed. The biosensor for quantification of bioavailable lysine was based on the growth response of E. coli to an external source of lysine and lysinecontaining small peptides. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted in the genome of E. coli lysine auxotroph as a part of a mini-Tn 5 - transposon by <b>conjugation.</b> <b>Bacterial</b> growth response to external lysine and small peptides was monitored and recorded by measuring the fluorescence emitted by GFP. The second type biosensor developed was designed for the quantification of total lysine. It was based on the measurement of a promoter activity, which was induced and modulated by extracellular concentration of lysine. Cad promoter was amplified from E. coli K- 12 genome and was cloned into promoterless gfp plasmid. The construct was electroporated into electrocompetent E. coli cells. The promoter activity was induced under the conditions of low pH and graded concentrations of lysine. Lysine-dose response was measured by the fluorescence of GFP. Both methods were characterized as having a high potential for practical application...|$|R

40|$|Two Escherichia coli strains (B/M 369 and C- 35) {{belonging}} to enteropathogenic serogroup O 86 were isolated from patients with infantile diarrhea and studied {{with respect to}} their cellular adherence properties. Both strains exhibited adherence (Ad+) to HEp- 2 and HeLa cell monolayers in vitro and expressed mannose-resistant hemagglutinating (MRHA+) activity towards human, chicken, and sheep (but not mouse, rabbit, or guinea pig) erythrocytes. Cellular adherence properties of both strains could be substantially reduced by pronase treatment and by heat treatment (100 degrees C for 5 min) of bacteria. Electron microscopic examination failed to reveal fimbria- or pilus-like structures on the <b>bacterial</b> cell surface. <b>Conjugation</b> experiments conducted with these strains suggested that both MRHA and HEp- 2 and HeLa cell adherence factors were encoded by the same plasmid, with a size of 55 to 57 megadaltons (MDa). Further biochemical studies indicated that the cellular adherence factors were associated with cell surface structures of bacteria that were proteinaceous in nature. An antiserum, rendered specific for the 57 -MDa plasmid (pRP 201) products of B/M 369 by adsorption, reacted with both MRHA+ Ad+ strains, B/M 369 and C- 35, but not with their 57 - or 55 -MDa plasmidless MRHA- Ad- transconjugants or with other MRHA- Ad- E. coli strains. Immunological studies showed that the absorbed antiserum recognized two proteins with subunit molecular sizes of 18 and 14. 5 kDa that were present on the cell surfaces of both strains. Furthermore, the absorbed antiserum at subagglutinating dilutions did inhibit, although only partially, the MRHA and HEp- 2 and HeLa cell adherence activities of both E. coli strains. All these results would indicate that some of the E. coli strains {{belonging to}} enteropathogenic serogroups express their adherence potential through factors that were hitherto unrecognized...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{antibiotic}} resistance in environmental bacteria {{is a direct}} threat to public health. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the fate and transport {{of antibiotic}} and its resistant bacteria. This paper presents a mathematical model for spatial and temporal transport of fluoroquinolone and its resistant bacteria in the aquatic environment of the river. The model includes state variables for organic matter, fluoroquinolone, heavy metals, and susceptible and resistant bacteria in the water column and sediment bed. Resistant gene is the factor which makes bacteria resistant to a particular antibiotic and is majorly carried on plasmids. Plasmid-mediated resistance genes are transferable between different <b>bacterial</b> species through <b>conjugation</b> (horizontal resistance transfer). This model includes plasmid dynamics between susceptible and resistant bacteria by considering the rate of horizontal resistance gene transfer among bacteria and the rate of losing resistance (segregation). The model describes processes which comprise of advection, dispersion, degradation, adsorption, diffusion, settling, resuspension, microbial growth, segregation, and transfer of resistance genes. The mathematical equations were solved by using numerical methods (implicit-explicit scheme) with appropriate boundary conditions. The development of the present model was motivated {{by the fact that the}} Musi River is heavily impacted by antibiotic pollution which led to the development of antibiotic resistance in its aquatic environment. The model was simulated for hypothetical pollution scenarios to predict the future conditions under various pollution management alternatives. The simulation results of the model for different cases show that the concentration of antibiotic, the concentration of organic matter, segregation rate, and horizontal transfer rate are the governing factors in the variation of population density of resistant bacteria. The treatment of effluents for antibiotics might be costly for the bulk drug manufacturing industries, but the guidelines can be made to reduce the organic matter which can limit the growth rate of microbes and reduce the total microbial population in the river. The reduction in antibiotic concentration can reduce the selection pressure on bacteria and can limit the population of resistant culture and its influence zone in the river stretch; however, complete removal of antibiotics may not result in complete elimination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria...|$|R
