40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1992 Long term {{changes in}} the {{atmospheric}} and oceanic environment of the North Pacific were investigated for the period 1946 - 1991. A climatology of North Pacific wind stress curl was developed because of the relevance of changes in wind stress curl to both oceanic and atmospheric variability. The dominant scales of spatial and temporal wind stress curl variability were determined and examined {{within the context of}} observed changes in North Pacific air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), sea ice cover, oceanic mass transport and the occurrence of <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclones.</b> Relationships between these variables and indices of tropical Pacific variability were also determined on interannual time scales. During 1976 - 1988, phase relationships were very strong between long term mean anomalies of wind stress curl, SST, air temperature, sea ice cover, The Pacific North American index, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and tropical Pacific SST. Long term mean anomalies of these parameters did not change sign during 1976 - 88. These strong phase relationships did not occur amongst these variables during any other period of the record. The 1976 - 1988 period is characterized by intensified storminess, the decreased occurrence of <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> and decreased sea ice cover in the subarctic North Pacific. Intensified atmospheric circulation also occurred in the western Pacific subtropical anticyclone. Anomalously low SST occurred across the central and western North Pacific during this period while anomalously high SST was present in the eastern North Pacific adjacent to North America. Changes in the sign of the long term mean anomalies of wind stress curl, central North Pacific SST and the SOI suggest that this climate regime ended or relaxed after 1988. After 1975, long term changes in anomalies of the Southern Oscillation Index, tropical Atlantic wind stress, Sahel rainfall, and Greenland Sea ice cover have characteristics similar to those observed in the North Pacific. It is suggested that the climate anomalies observed in the North Pacific during 1976 - 1988 occurred as part of a hemispheric or global scale climate regime...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of a <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclone</b> over the North Atlantic has been examined over its entire life-cycle using the Zwack-Okossi (Z-O) equation as the diagnostic tool. This <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclone</b> occurred in late October and early November of 1985. The data used were provided by the NASA Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres on a global 2. 0 ° latitude by 2. 5 ° longitude grid. The horizontal distribution of the atmospheric forcing mechanisms that were important to 500 mb block formation, maintenance and decay were examined. A scale-partitioned form of the Z-O equation was then {{used to examine the}} relative importance of forcing on the planetary and synoptic scales, and their interactions. As seen in previous studies, the results presented here show that upper tropospheric anticyclonic vorticity advection was the most important contributor to block formation and maintenance. However, adiabatic warming, and vorticity tilting were also important at various times during the block lifetime. In association with precursor surface cyclogenesis, the 300 mb jet streak in the downstream (upstream) from a long-wave trough (ridge) amplified significantly. This strengthening of the jet streak enhanced the anticyclonic vorticity advection field that aided the amplification of a 500 mb short- wave ridge. The partitioned height tendency results demonstrate that the interactions between the planetary and synoptic-scale through vorticity advection was the most important contributor to block formation. Planetary-scale, synoptic-scale, and their interactions contributed weakly to the maintenance of the <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> with the advection of synoptic-scale vorticity by the planetary-scale flow playing a more important role.

Lakes peripheral to the Scandinavian ice sheet were lower than those today but lakes in the Mediterranean zone were high at the glacial maximum, reflecting the dominance of glacial anticyclonic conditions in northern Europe and a southward shift of the Westerlies. The influence of the glacial anticyclonic circulation attenuated through the late glacial period, and the Westerlies gradually shifted northward, such that drier conditions south of the ice sheet were confined to a progressively narrower zone and the Mediterranean became drier. The early Holocene shows a gradual shift to conditions wetter than present in central Asia, associated with the expanded Asian monsoon, and in the Mediterranean, in response to local, monsoon-type circulation.

We also analyze the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation atmospheric indices, whosebehavior is often associated with the transition between the two circulation regimes, and investigate analogies and differences with the bidimensional blocking indices. We find that the Arctic Oscillation index, which can be thought as a proxy for a hemispheric average of the Tibaldi-Molteni blocking index, keeps track of the presence of unstable fixed points.

During the development of this <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> vorticity advection, supported by temperature advection, forced 500 -hPa height rises at the block center. Vorticity advection and vorticity tilting were also consistent contributors to height rises during the entire life cycle. Boundary layer friction, vertical advection of vorticity, and ageostrophic vorticity tendencies (during decay) consistently opposed block development. Additionally, an analysis of this blocking event also showed that upstream precursor surface cyclones were not only important in block development but in block maintenance as well. In partitioning the basic data fields into their planetary-scale (P) and synoptic-scale (S) components, 500 -hPa height tendencies forced by processes on each scale, as well as by interactions (I) between each scale, were also calculated. Over the lifetime of this blocking event, the S and P processes were most prominent in the blocked region. During the formation of this block, the I component was the largest and most consistent contributor to height rises at the center point. It was also shown that the height- rise regions located on the anticyclonic side of the jet maxima associated with block development and intensification were primarily composed of the S and I components. Also, the precursor cyclones were associated with S or S and I height rises that contributed to the formation of this block. Finally, the results of this paper show that the forcing associated with summer-season blocking events are similar to that of their winter-season counterparts neglecting the natural case-to-case variability.

Local TCWV content from 28 July to 6 August 2010 reached 3. 35 [*]cm, a value that exceeded by 3. 3 times its content before the block. The surplus of WV was mainly conditioned by the advection of WV due to transfer of moist air from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea into northern EE and also due to increased evaporation from the surface enriched with water due to increased temperature and wind.

The block intensity (BI) calculation was modified successfully from a previous study in order to automate the procedure for use with large datasets, and it is applied {{for the first time to}} derive a long-term observational record of this quantity.

Blocking events in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere were the most persistent and strongest during the cold season and over the Atlantic (Pacific) region, as found using BI to measure intensity. The characteristics of blocking events derived in this study were compared to previous long-term climatological studies and across each hemisphere.

The interannual variability of blocking was also examined with respect to ENSO-related variability for the entire blocking year. It was found that Northern (Southern) Hemisphere blocking events were stronger and more frequent during La Nin˜a (El Nin˜o) years, a result that is consistent with cyclone variability in each hemisphere. Additionally, these results were compared with previously published studies of interannual variability in blocking occurrence...|$|R
40|$|With {{the planned}} European Programme for Ice Coring in Antarctica in Dronning Maud Land it is {{important}} to understand the processes leading to accumulation for successful interpretation of core data. Because it is impractical to obtain precipitation observations with a large spatial coverage and on a daily timescale in Antarctica, model-generated precipitation must be considered for a comprehensive study of the region. However, without observational data it is difficult to check the veracity of the model data. Precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis project shows that 89 % of days have low (under 0. 2 mm) precipitation resulting in 31 % of the annual total. At the other extreme, less than 1 % of days have high (over 1 mm) precipitation, which results in 20 % of the annual total. It is reasoned that the changes in the frequency of extreme precipitation events could alter the trace record in ice cores and lead to a bias in reconstructed paleotemperatures. Case studies reveal that high-precipitation days have amplified upper level planetary waves directing warm moist air to the region. Associated with this is the presence of a cyclone in or at the northeast extreme of the Weddell Sea. Commonly, the longwaves provide a <b>blocked</b> <b>anticyclone</b> in the South Atlantic to form a dipolar channeling of the air mass. The accumulation variability is linked to the variability in the intensity of these storms and their tracks. It is seen that this is related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and a semiannual cycle...|$|R
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that {{aircraft}} emissions might accumulate in stagnant anticyclones. Emissions like nitrogen oxide and chemical products of them (e. g. ozone) should have higher concentrations within such <b>blocking</b> <b>anticyclones.</b> In this context the occurrence of blocking is examined {{with the aid of}} different blocking indices and climatologies already available in the literature. For chosen example cases, in the North Atlantic region, ozone profiles from airborne field campaigns (POLINAT) and ozone sounding platforms (WOUDC) are examined to search for an aircraft emission induced production of ozone. An analysis of different airmasses and their origin is performed by the calculation of LAGRANTO backward trajectories based on ECMWF wind fields. Taking into account potential vorticity (PV) and pressure along the trajectories together with PV charts and satellite images (EUMETSAT) possible sources for the signal in the ozone measurements are searched. These possible sources are for example boundary layer emissions, that are transported along cold fronts or convectively lifted in thunderstorms, as well as stratospheric intrusions. Some ozone profiles reveal an ozone concentration elevated about 10 nmol/mol in 9 - 10 km altitude (mean altitude for the flight corridor) that could not {{be traced back to the}} sources just mentioned. For one of the examples calculations with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART) with a high resolution air traffic data base (AERO 2 K) are taken into account for further interpretation. Finally, recommendations for the planing of an airborne field campaign to measure the ozone production due to aircraft emissions are given...|$|R
