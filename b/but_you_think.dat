500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because I felt in my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know everything", Swift said.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make you look so distorted that you don’t recognize yourself and you ask yourself, ‘How did I get here? How do I get out of here?’ <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that {{you want to do it}} again. That is the same as love and life. It's a metaphor for being in love and for life." [...] This also shows in the title track [...] "Funhouse" [...] where she tells that it used to be fun. [...] "It's about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one." ...|$|E

60|$|THE NEGRESS [offended] <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it is {{not good}} enough. Very well [she raises her hand to take the peg out of her switchboard].|$|E
60|$|Pala. I confess I was {{thinking}} so, {{as fast as}} I could; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> so much before me, that you will let me think nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{do my best}} at any rate, if I don't have {{my money}} soon. You could pay Mr. Hart two {{thousand}} pounds, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm nobody." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I haven't. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> respect me--you always {{hand out}} some spiel about my being so 'useful.' <b>But</b> <b>you</b> never <b>think</b> {{of me as}} having ambitions, {{just as much as}} you have----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{pretend to}} {{misunderstand}} you, Mackenzie. You mean there's no danger with him, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{there may be}} from her. That's what you mean, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been at some {{funerals}} {{where it}} would have been a relief to laugh, and I've wanted to cry at some weddings. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it wouldn't do?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I kept Bonita {{up in the}} mountains, that I went {{secretly}} to meet her, {{that all}} the while I served you I was--Oh, I know what you think! I know now. I never knew till I made you look at me. Now, say it! Speak!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your way to {{play your}} game! Yes; and what has become of mine? You have {{destroyed}} mine, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> nothing of that.

6000|$|... "Nonsense, child! to be sure, I shouldn't. What do {{you talk}} so for? I would as soon have {{one of my own}} {{children}} sold.

60|$|Your {{not being}} {{in favor of it}} results from your belief that the lay element that would be useful to the Academy does not at present exist in this country; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> if it did exist, and if it could be made to grow out of our schools and {{universities}} by art teaching, it might, with advantage to the Academy and to artists, be introduced into the Academy?--Yes.|$|E

6000|$|... 80. What am I a beast for? If you had happened, says Fra Lippo, {{to catch}} Cosimo in a frolic like this, {{of course you}} would have said nothing; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a monk is a beast if he indulges in these nocturnal pleasures.
