Fans might be surprised at her references to 'the hell that we built' and the 'violent times,' but Mariah thinks this song is for 'anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship.' 'You know what? I’ve been through too much at this point,' she said. 'I want happiness and I want pure and real love, but the side effects of what other relationships have put me through cause me to <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> on the defensive a lot of the time. And if somebody isn’t mature or caring and loving and open-hearted enough to understand that, then it’s tough, but this is a song for people who need that.' Mariah hopes that this song helps people feel 'a little bit stronger.' ...|$|E

Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E

500|$|According to Dave Grossman, the {{objective}} for Telltale Games with Sam & Max Save the World {{was to create}} a game with a [...] "lot of story and character in it". Grossman explained that the Sam & Max franchise was therefore most ideally suited to the graphic adventure genre; while action was thought to be possible with the source material, it [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wrong". Still, designers decided to introduce action moments such as car chase scenes, wanting players to [...] "feel like [...] are these crazy Freelance Police officers" [...] and [...] "just be involved in all this sort of mayhem" [...] presented in the original comic strips. [...] Like in previous Sam & Max games, Sam & Max Save the World used a point-and-click gameplay system, itself a variation of the control scheme used by Telltale in their preceding adventure game series, the action sequences implemented in the game still maintained the point-and-click interface.|$|E
500|$|The series' co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto recalled, [...] "We were partway {{through the}} {{development}} process {{when one of the}} staff members said 'Hey, wouldn't that <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?'" [...] The developers voted on the concept, and it passed. The game's instruction manual refers to Samus as if she were male to obscure her real sex {{until the end of the}} game. Sakamoto noted that during the course of the Metroid series, developers constantly try to express Samus' femininity without sexually objectifying her. Samus' image was based on actress Sigourney Weaver in her role as Ellen Ripley from Aliens, and actress Kim Basinger from 9½ Weeks and My Stepmother Is an Alien. Sakamoto and Kiyotake said that the character's last name [...] "Aran" [...] was taken from Edson Arantes do Nascimento, the birth name of the famous soccer player Pelé.|$|E

[...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> great.

500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound.

500|$|In 1994 Richwood Pharmaceuticals {{acquired}} Rexar {{and began}} promoting Obetrol {{as a treatment}} for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase [...] "A.D.D. for All" [...] intended to convey that [...] "it was meant to <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an inclusive thing" [...] for marketing purposes. The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal warning letter for the violations), then later issued a second formal warning letter to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of [...] "the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD Act". Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution {{of a large number of}} issues related to the company's numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved drug product. In 1997 Richwood Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in a $186 million transaction.|$|E
500|$|Metroid was {{designed}} to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of Super Mario Bros. with the non-linear exploration of The Legend of Zelda and a distinctly darker aesthetic. The name of the game is a portmanteau of the words [...] "metro" [...] (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist. Halfway through development of the original Metroid, one of the staff said to his fellow developers [...] "Hey, wouldn't that <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?", and the idea was accepted. Ridley Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film Alien was described by Sakamoto as a [...] "huge influence" [...] after the world of the first Metroid had been created. The development staff was affected by the work of the film's creature designer H. R. Giger, and found his creations to be fitting for the Metroid universe. In recognition of this, a character was given the name Ridley, after director Scott.|$|E

500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus, Nicholas J. Scapa, John Read Fasse, Michael McGinnis, Antonina Armato and Tim James. It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So you think that must <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's about breaking free." ...|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Lo compares {{falling in}} love to being under the {{influence}} of drugs. Regarding the track's composition, she stated that [...] "all of the verses are drug references. It is comparing a high to being in love, which I think can <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> the same thing". According to Scandipop, the artist is saying in the lyrics that [...] "no – she's not on drugs, it's all that amazing love she's in which is making her so high". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork wrote that Lo insists [...] "she's back on her feet and reaching for the stars—she's not on drugs, she's just in love" [...] in the verse, [...] "I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue / I live in the sky / You come live here, too". The line, [...] "I'm queen of the clouds, make my wish come true" [...] served as the inspiration for the title of the singer's debut album. Both Tim Jonze of The Guardian and Jamieson Cox of Time noted that the track's message contrasted that of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", in which the artist sings about using drugs in order to forget her former boyfriend.|$|E

According to Steven Gottlieb of VideoStatic the double-exposure body shots are a visible common similarity of the two videos. On November 13, Rihanna unveiled a behind-the-scenes video via her official Vevo account. During it she explained {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's gonna <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> eerie, very creepy because 'What Now' is one of those songs that you can get really boring with the visual. You can get really almost expected. Everybody's probably expecting narrative type of video, a love story of some sorts or something really soft and pretty" [...] and then says, [...] "It is pretty and kind of soft, but it's really a little demented." [...] Prior to the video's release, Rihanna posted a sneak peek of the video on YouTube. The official music video was released to VEVO on November 15, 2013.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Mahone {{was not in}} the original plan of the Prison Break staff writers for the second season. When the writers approached the Fox network with their plans for the second season, Fox Entertainment president Peter Liguori suggested including a fugitive pursuer who was [...] "not corrupt"; a character who is [...] "like the Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive." [...] Along with Paul Kellerman and Brad Bellick, Mahone became a fugitive hunter {{at the start of the}} second season. The writers were aware of the increasing number of antagonists in the show, which led Olmstead to remark, [...] "If there are too many people pursuing them, [...] are rendered inept because they're not all catching our convicts, and you can only have so many close calls." [...] The writers decided that the {{character of}} Mahone was to be a [...] "very formidable" [...] nemesis for the protagonists, and the [...] "flip side of Michael Scofield." [...] Scheuring acknowledges comparisons made between Mahone and Les Miserables character, Inspector Javert, [...] "He certainly is Javert to Michael's Valjean, but you can express it however you want. He's his nemesis." [...] One of the tricks used by the Prison Break writers is to constantly shift the sympathetic characters. Olmstead notes, [...] "A white-hat character can <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> boring." [...] Fichtner does not believe that Mahone is a [...] "bad guy"; rather, he has [...] "a lot of demons driving him." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracer {{has been}} cited as being the [...] "poster girl" [...] for the game; the gaming {{magazine}} Hardcore Gamer concurred, describing her as [...] "Overwatch's single most iconic character". Many publications have referred to her as the game's mascot, or note that she essentially fills the role of one. Even prior to the game's official release, VentureBeat noted, [...] "if you've {{paid any attention to}} the early fan culture for Overwatch, you've likely noticed that Tracer seems especially popular". Kotakus Nathan Grayson described her as [...] "peppy and fun, but also courageous and badass," [...] adding that: [...] "In creating their own works involving Tracer, fans have turned those characteristics up to 11. Some depict her as childlike, naive and carefree. She can even <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a doof, a punchline." [...] Kotakus Kirk Hamilton asserted that she is [...] "easily the most iconic Overwatch hero," [...] in addition to calling her his favorite character. Tracer's popularity compared to the other characters has had unintended effects for Blizzard; Overwatch-related searches boosted by 817% on Pornhub after the game's open beta went live, with [...] "Overwatch Tracer" [...] being the top search term related to the game.
