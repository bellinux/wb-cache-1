25|$|The high {{abundance}} of the cyclopoid copepod Limnoithona tetraspina {{may be due}} to its reliance on ciliates rather than phytoplankton as a primary food source.

25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E

Scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern Britain really presented and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the Wall, rather than conquering and annexing what has become the Scottish Lowlands and defending the territory with a loose arrangement of forts.|$|E

2500|$|The Mialoquo {{site was}} {{probably}} occupied {{as early as}} the Archaic period, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent is unknown. [...] Of the 60 features uncovered at the site, 8 (mostly refuse pits) were classified as Mississippian, the rest were Cherokee. [...] The distribution of the features suggests a short-term occupation. [...] The Qualla pottery type which is associated with the Middle towns in North Carolina comprised 13.5% of the site's 6,000+ sherds, lending support to the theory that refugees from the Middle towns lived at Mialoquo in the 1760s.

2500|$|Often {{a player}} is {{confronted with a}} conundrum: You have good cards to hold but must throw to your {{opponent}} cards {{that are likely to}} score significantly in his (or her) crib. If you are dealt a hand composed of 10-10-8-7-6-2, your best opportunity to score points is to hold the 8-7-6-2: fifteen four and a run of three make seven. More importantly, this hand can be cut to ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen or sixteen. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> extent does throwing a pair of 10s mitigate the usefulness of holding the deuce? By throwing a 10-deuce, the likelihood your opponent will score significantly in the crib is reduced, while your hand's possibilities still range from five (two less than thrown the [...] "better" [...] way, offset by throwing two less points to the crib) to twelve. The opponent's largest possible crib, your having thrown a 10-2, is fourteen, whereas throwing a pair of 10s offers the maximal possibility of twenty-two.(10,10,5,5,5) ...|$|E
2500|$|Morbidity can {{be major}} (myocardial infarction, pneumonia, {{pulmonary}} embolism, renal failure/insufficiency, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and allergy) or minor (minor nausea, vomiting, readmission). [...] There is usually overlap in the contributing factors {{that lead to}} morbidity and mortality between {{the health of the}} patient, the surgery being performed and the anesthetic. [...] To understand the relative risk of each contributing factor, consider that the rate of deaths totally attributed to the patient's health is 1:870. [...] Compare that to the rate of deaths totally attributed to surgical factors (1:2860) or anesthesia alone (1:185,056) illustrating that the single greatest factor in anesthetic mortality is the health of the patient. [...] These statistics can also be compared to the first such study on mortality in anesthesia from 1954, which reported a rate of death from all causes at 1:75 and a rate attributed to anesthesia alone at 1:2680. [...] Direct comparisons between mortality statistics cannot reliably be made over time and across countries because of differences in the stratification of risk factors, however, there is evidence that anesthetics have made a significant improvement in safety <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> degree is uncertain.|$|E
