In total there were 64 UFO candidates, 20 ILP candidates and 10 Farmer-Labour candidates in the 1919 provincial election. The UFO platform called for the abolition of political patronage, better educational opportunities in rural areas, cheap electric power, conservation of forests, proportional representation and [...] "direct legislation". The UFO also favoured prohibition and <b>budgetary</b> <b>restraint,</b> two platform planks that were at odds with the views of urban Labour supporters. To the shock of everyone, including itself, it won 45 seats and formed a coalition government with the support of Labour MLAs in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario despite having no leader.|$|E

40|$|Over the {{economic}} crises of the 1990 s, global economic understandings {{shifted from the}} early classical orthodoxy of the 'Washington Consensus' to a later Keynesian support for demand stimulus and capital controls. However, Russian policy - particularly after the 1998 ruble crisis - partly deviated from these broader trends, combining Keynesian capital controls with classical <b>budgetary</b> <b>restraint.</b> In offering a 'constructivist-institutionalist' explanation for this policy mix, we assume that agents can always interpret or construct events as varying types of crises, reshaping state society relations in the process. We then argue that classical interpretations of the early 1990 s' crises legitimated orthodox policies and more importantly - alienated the Russian state from society. Given this backdrop, while later interpretations of the 1998 ruble crisis legitimated capital controls, the prior alienation of state from society precluded any domestic Keynesian coalition. Global pressures must, from this vantage point, be situated in specific social and institutional contexts. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the long-term effects}} on output of different fiscal policies in Portugal {{in the context of}} unrestricted VAR models that include several public spending and taxation variables. Empirical results suggest that the effects of fiscal policies are within the Keynesian paradigm for public transfers, public consumption, public investment and direct taxation, with public investment showing particularly strong positive effects and direct taxation showing particularly strong negative effects. In turn, non-Keynesian effects dominate in the case of public wages where cuts are expansionary and indirect taxation where raises are neutral. Accordingly, cuts in public wages and raises in indirect taxations are the two most desirable instruments for fiscal consolidation in Portugal. Finally, deficit-neutral policies that offset raises in public transfers, public consumption, and public investment, with raises in indirect taxes have long-term positive effects on output. The same is true for cuts in direct taxation offset with cuts in all forms of public spending except for public investment. policy, <b>budgetary</b> <b>restraint,</b> fiscal consolidation...|$|E
