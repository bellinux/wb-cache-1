40|$|Over {{the past}} fifteen years, the market for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> has evolved {{in an attempt to}} further enhance the {{economic}} value of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> landings. Historically, the US East Coast has been a major supplier of high quality <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> to Japan, the primary market for sashimi grade tuna. To date, many questions regarding the economic feasibility of offshore aquaculture, and in particular offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farming in the United States, remain unanswered. This research assesses the economic feasibility of an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture industry located on the East Coast of the US by developing a dynamic stochastic adaptive bioeconomic model of such an offshore enterprise. The bioeconomic model incorporates the biological constraints of the species, the interaction of relevant economic parameters and constraints, and stochastic sources of risk, to solve for the profit maximizing behavior of a farmed <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> producer. This research identifies the optimal harvest schedule for an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> farming facility that maximizes the net present value of the operation under a variety of economic, biological and regulatory conditions. Economic feasibility is analyzed using profitability indicators including net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). This research is relevant given the continued expansion of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture globally, the increasing demand for high-quality <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> and the uncertainty regarding the economic feasibility of an offshore <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture industry in the United States...|$|R

This study investigated whether some of the variability in larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances was related to environmental conditions, by defining associations between larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catch locations, and a suite of environmental variables. We hypothesized that certain habitat types, as defined by environmental variables, {{would be more likely}} to contain <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae. Favorable habitat for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae was defined using a classification tree approach. Habitat within the Loop Current was generally less favorable, as were warmcore rings, and cooler waters on the continental shelf. The location and size of favorable habitat was highly variable among years, which was reflected in the locations of larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catches. The model successfully placed <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae in favorable habitat with nearly 90 % accuracy, but many negative stations were also located within theoretically favorable habitat. The probability of collecting larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> in favorable habitat was nearly twice the probability of collecting <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae across all habitats (35. 5 versus 21. 0 %).

40|$|Abstract This article {{assesses the}} {{economic}} feasibility of capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture on the US East Coast and examines {{the potential of}} this hybrid form of aquaculture production to increase the net economic value generated in the US East Coast <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. A bioeconomic model of an offshore capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture facility is {{used to evaluate the}} economic feasibility of this form of production on the US East Coast under a variety of economic, biological, and regulatory assumptions. The results suggest that of the three proposed farming sites along the US East Coast, the expected net present value (NPV) of the operation over a 10 -year operating horizon is highest at the Gray’s Reef, GA, site. The second part of this article assesses {{the extent to which the}} opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production could improve the net economic value gener-ated in the US East Coast <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. The results suggest that if the fishery had the opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production, there would be an increase in the net revenue generated in the fishery. Depending on how the seasonal quota was enforced, economic improvement in the fishery ranged from a 52 – 142 % improvement in net revenue. Even when the cost per fish associated with capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production was doubled, the results still indicated that the opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production would lead to a 12 % increase in net revenue in the fishery.

40|$|We {{critically}} {{reviewed the}} contributions of fishery genetics {{to the understanding of}} spatial population structure and dynamics in Mediterranean <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> by comparatively integrating existing data with those recently obtained from on-going surveys. Microsatellite-based population genetic studies provided coherent and informative evidences which consistently indicate a spatial genetic structure of Mediterranean <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> By integrating the existing genetic data with those obtained from other approaches, {{it is likely that the}} Mediterranean is inhabited by reproductively isolated subpopulations, displaying different spatio-temporal population dynamics.

However, the genotyping of 275 <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> individuals collected over five years performed on six neutral and 10 underselection microsatellite loci did not provide evidence of genetic heterogeneity within catches.

50|$|Since {{southern}} <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> {{must constantly}} be swimming to drive {{water over the}} gills and provide their bodies with oxygen, there is a requirement for their metabolic rate to constantly be high. Unlike other organisms, the southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> cannot expend more energy to produce heat in cold temperatures, while slowing down metabolism to cool down in high temperature waters and maintain a homeostatic temperature. Instead, the southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> seems to implement a system that regulates how actively the rete mirable system heats the tissues. Experiments involving the southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> have led researchers {{to believe that this}} species of tuna has developed a shunting system. When the southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> experiences cold temperatures, more blood is directed to the rete vascular system, heating muscle tissue, while in warm temperatures, blood is shunted to the venous and arterial systems, reducing the heat in the muscle tissues.|$|R
50|$|Southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> migrate {{between a}} variety of {{different}} ocean regions, however the osmotic conditions faced by the tuna stay relatively similar. This species of tuna inhabits ocean areas that are relatively high in salinity compared {{to the rest of the}} world’s oceans. Like other marine teleost fish, the southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> maintain a constant ion concentration in both their intracellular and extracellular fluids. This regulation of an internal ion concentration classifies southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> as osmoregulators.|$|R
50|$|This {{commercial}} importance has led {{to severe}} overfishing. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) affirmed in October 2009 that Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> stocks have declined dramatically over the last 40 years, by 72% in the Eastern Atlantic, and by 82% in the Western Atlantic. On 16 October 2009, Monaco formally recommended Endangered Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> for an Appendix I CITES listing and international trade ban. In early 2010, European officials, led by the French ecology minister, increased pressure to ban the commercial fishing of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> internationally.

40|$|The Gulf of Maine, NW Atlantic Ocean, is a productive, {{seasonal}} foraging {{ground for}} Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus), but commercial landings of adult size classes {{were up to}} 40 % below the allocated total allowable catch between 2004 to 2008 for the rod and reel, harpoon, and purse seine categories in the Gulf of Maine. Reduction in Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catches in the Gulf of Maine could represent a decline in spawning stock biomass, but given wide-ranging, complex migration patterns, and high energetic requirements, an alternative hypothesis is that their dispersal patterns shifted to regions with higher prey abundance or profitability, reducing availability to U.
